The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.

But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.

In general, poorer people wear what would be earlier fashions, historically, which are more shapeless and with less ornamentation. The wealthy, especially women, wear fashions much closer to Renaissance Italy.

[This is an example of a couple things.](http://www.icf.edu.in/library/history/4.jpg) The woman on the left in green is something a lady of middling nobility might wear. The guy in yellow is A) what a Bravo might be with all the elaborate detail and colour and B) an example of slashing and puffing. Slashing is mentioned many times in the series, and it is meant to show the rich fabric of your clothing's underlayer. It demonstrates possession of the wealth required for such frivolities. The three on the right demonstrate why I don't think there is much draw from late 16th century for either sexes - the clothing becomes too constricting and/or heavy to fit with anything described in the books.

[Here's another.](http://www.icf.edu.in/library/history/3.jpg) The man in green is wearing what is called a doublet (on his torso) and bases (the skirt thing). You probably recognize the word ""doublet,"" seeing as most men of nobility wear it as their typical attire. Ned has ones of varying quality, from leather up to fancy ones he wears for court occasions. This outfit would be modular - that is to say, the components could be swapped out or parti-coloured (another term that appears in the books). The bases, which would be worn longer by modest men, attach to the doublet by laces (I think Eddard actually describes this at one point). Same goes for the sleeves.

[This might be what female high nobility would wear](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Giovanna_Tornabuoni_full_length.jpg) It's Renaissance Italian, and you can see the level of detail in both the construction and the fabric. The books describe Myrish lace, rich damask (heavy printed material), patterned silk. This is the kind of stuff Europeans got into as technology and trade improved, and this happened especially early in Italy. You can even see slashes with tiny puffs on the sleeve of the woman in front. Dresses like this are described by their skirts and their bodice - the upper part. The woman in grey is supposed to either be a nun of some sort or simply an older, reserved woman. Still, she pulls her skirts up slightly in the front to reveal a high quality inner layer of her outfit. Septas dress like this, and cover their hair out of modesty just like in history.

SIDE NOTE: She's also doing something that you might notice in the other pictures - she's gathering her clothing in front of her belly like a baby bulge. Women did this to either liken themselves to the iconography of the Virgin Mary or to express fertility. The show actually depicts this when Walder Frey parades his daughters in front of Robb - most of the girls are doing this. At first it confused me. ""What? They don't even have a Virgin Mary!"" But it makes sense if they want to invoke the Mother of the Seven.

Dressing for war seems to be a point where GRRM pulled from any source he wanted from like 1000AD til the height of armour-making around 1500 - armour gradually started becoming obsolete after this, but the most elaborate sets were made after this, for show. The fancily adorned and coloured suits of armour in the books are inspired by this later, craftsmen period. 

But the majority of foot soldier battle attire looks a bit like [the two guys in mail here](http://www.icf.edu.in/library/history/2.jpg). The surcoat (mentioned ALL THE TIME in-books) is a topmost layer worn in battle by most knights, if not the foot soldiers, and IRL many were just a long and narrow sheet with a head hole in the centre. Many of the peasant rabble wear mail shirts like the one in the picture. At least the lucky ones, or they wear leather versions with studs or metal rings sewn onto them. Others are described wearing less substantial things made of leather, quilted doublets or jerkins (Doublets with sleeves!). 

Oh, also in that picture, the guy in red over Carolinian Europe is a great example of the type of garment the lower class would wear. Imagine it with less colour, and no trim. That's Smallfolk Chic.

I'm kind of getting tired of typing, even though I could write a Master's Thesis about fashion in Westeros (and don't get me started on beyond).

Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines.

&gt;EFSA finds that the study as reported by Séralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments.

Moreover, during the hearing, the study‟s authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

So while I'm sure we'll lose some top talent, it's not full-on collapse. Plus EU has been able to run a league without LAN finals for years.

Most aspects here, besides the huge amount of grinding to level up and get skill points, are what we in the NA/EU are used to and or desire and it's simple as that. The best outcome would be for a KR CBT3 or similar version for the west, but for arguments sake, let's assume we don't get that and we have the retarded AI mobs and everything else we currently have on the KR version just brought over. There is a ton of stuff to do! Even with 90%+ of the game translated, many foreign players, and heck even loads of Koreans, don't even bother with so many features of this game. You need to come into this game thinking it's basically Archeage in my opinion. This way you will know there's so much to do and needed to do to advance. Now unfortunately, or should I say, on the other hand, this isn't exactly true because if you grind enough you can buy what you need off the AH. This method is perfectly fine for those who want to mindlessly grind. Don't get me wrong, I have done it this way in many games, opposed to earning income other ways or what have you because of my personal nature...However, there's no need for a lot of that if you play the way you are ""supposed to""  ex: literal farming, mining, crafting, housing, taming for a profit/breeding, fishing, and much much more. 

In my opinion once players see this game for all of what it's worth then there will be a much more expansive population as well as market...Though when we come to market we are stuck with a non trading environment which still works but to an extent especially with the AH limitations.

Next shot will be called ""Scene 9, Slate 2, Take 1"". Then the next shot will be called ""Scene 9, Slate 3, Take 1"". And so on.

Then after you finish shooting that scene, say you start shooting Scene 5. You'll continue the Slate Number where you last left off. So, your next slate will be ""Scene 5, Slate 4, Take 1"". And so on. This slate number will never reset or repeat.

Now, people can reference a shot later by just saying the Slate Number and Take Number. The Scene number on the slate is optional in the European system if you have a Script Supervisor.

Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the Khazars), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.[citation needed] Thus, Boyarin has argued that ""Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.""[72]

because proving that someone isn't one of the smartest player in the world is harder than proving he is mediocre.  show me these clips where **consistently** he outplays european players and makes the right decisions on the grand stage.  show me rounds where he's put himself into a scenario where he should wiwn but only loses because he has ""subpar aim"".  show me the demo's where he's outplaying the internationally greatest players.  you cant, because they don't exist.  you're asking me to show you evidence?  i'm the one saying hes a good player, you're the one saying he's one of the smartest.  show me this evidence where he's smarter than everyone else because its not very easy to show that he's not the smartest player in the world.

&gt;I think you're confusing the team iBP and the individual players. Steel is a subpar aimer, and that's even according to himself. DaZed is a good aimer and an incredibly smart player. However, chemistry wise he is probably one of the worst players there are.

you've got to be kidding me.  NA is notorious for being aim heavy.  the stereotype has always been, even dating back to 1.6, is that we're ""dumb"".  that we ride the aim train and then get destroyed when we run into euro's that neutralize our aim. and becuase we're notoriously stupid and ill-prepared, we have nothing to fall back on.

&gt;And iBP played one major together with the lineup you're referring to, and no they didn't do very well. How you draw the instant conclusion that no individual players can thereby not be some of the smartest people in the scene just proves your flawed logic.

no because you clearly don't understand how much distance you get out of being a smart player.  you don't call yourself the ""smartest player"" and not make it out of groups.  what a fucking insult to what smart players and teams even are.  learning to aim, spray patters, practicing reaction time, that's the easy part.  there are players that will exceed others and its a great tool to have but getting smart at the game: and by that that i mean, watching demo's, knowing how to handle situations, knowing what you need to do as a team to give yourself the best possibility of winning a round, that's fucking hard.  if steel and dazed are these cs geniuses, smarter than anyone else, then they'd leverage their greatest tools(swag, azk and skadoodle) much more effectively, and they didn't.  instead they bitched and whined about how skadoodle never talked and how none of them were friends in mumble.  

&gt;Instead of just bashing on someone's knowledge, try to make a fact based argument of why Steel isn't one of the smartest players. And don't point to team results, that has little to do with how much an individual knows about the game.

your logic is just insane.  you've not heard what 99% of the rest of pro players have to say when it comes to smart play or breaking down a round.  you've heard what steel, dazed and whoever else is vocal has to say.  how you could draw any conclusion on who is smart and who isn't by anything besides what they do in-game shows an incredible amount of ignorance.  ive played this game for 15 fucking years.  ive played with people smarter than steel.  you have very little understanding of what the talent pool is like out there.  there are players out there that wont ever play at the level of a player like steel simply because they don't put in the time to DM or they don't just make the right connections and play with the right people.",,0,False,,GlobalOffensive,cqumoy3,,0,1,t5_2sqho,t3_34etr8,t1_cqumoy3,False,,1430448776

Most people go to America for the colleges but it is rare to see American citizens going outside for other colleges. Everything we need as American students to prepare ourselves is already here. You have an advantage over hundreds of thousands of foreigners applying for a visa to study here and have a huge discount compared to what they have to spend.

Unless with exceptional circumstances, there is no good reason to enroll abroad unless you plan on living there for certain benefits and future opportunities. I can't explain why it is a bad decision, but it has to be explained why it is a *good* decision. Countries will want to retain the students that they educate and a strong education from a European country won't make a difference compared to a normal education from America depending on how large the company you will work for is and where you will be working from.

Do a study abroad program but do not enroll abroad unless you know what you're doing, credit transferring will most likely not work out in your favor and may set you back a semester unless it is explicitly stated in university policy. That is a 3-4 year commitment with huge risks if things don't work out and could also potentially lose you your citizenship the longer you stay outside the country (i.e. changing your mind and deciding to stay in the country).

 * Political nature of the alleged crime: most countries refuse to extradite suspects of political crimes. See political offence exception.
 * Possibility of certain forms of punishment: some countries refuse extradition on grounds that the person, if extradited, may receive capital punishment or face torture. A few go as far as to cover all punishments that they themselves would not administer.
 * ***Death penalty: Many countries, such ... Canada ... will not allow extradition if the death penalty may be imposed on the suspect unless they are assured that the death sentence will not be passed or carried out.***
 * Torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: Many countries will not extradite if there is a risk that a requested person will be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In the case of Soering v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that it would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed.

*Emphasis mine*

People aren't any less deserving of civil rights just because they were born elsewhere or because they're *accused* of a crime.

&gt; The difference is unlike the US Europeans have a culture of responsible gun ownership and know weapons are dangerous and treat them accordingly

Did you miss the 80 million responsible gun owners part of my statement? That's more people than many of your nations populations.

You're also overlooking the fact that Europe has a largely homogeneous population, with population centers, political traditions, and social norms that can date back hundreds of years (thousands, in some cases). Your populations are *significantly* smaller (Texas alone is three times the population size of Switzerland, with insanely diverse social demographics), much denser, and closer together, which means a much higher rate of police saturation with fewer resources, meaning that fewer cops can effectively police more people in a smaller area, therefore drastically reducing crime. Many places in the US are just so huge that the average police response time is 20-30 minutes, meaning the only real way to protect yourself is with a firearm (otherwise, you're pretty much at the mercy of your attacker/intruder, and God help you if you're a woman or the elderly). 

It's also a constitutional right, because our very nation was founded in response to an oppressive government that sought to disarm the public (technically two governments, if you're from Texas like I am). Political legitimacy is not enforced by a piece of paper, but by force of arms, and when people don't have the power to protect themselves, they no longer have political legitimacy. If you don't like that, you're free to stay in Europe and bitch about it. 

It's also a pretty common occurrence here that the areas in the US with the highest gun control also have the highest levels of violent crime. Gun control doesn't stop violent crimes, it switches violent crimes from being gun-related to other forms of violent crime, and disarms the public from protecting themselves. 

Look, you're free to believe what you want, but to say that it's ""all in our head"" is just absolutely fucking ridiculous, and I'd recommend a stepladder to help you get down off that high horse of yours. ",,0,False,,AskReddit,cqur64j,,0,6,t5_2qh1i,t3_34f9rh,t1_cqur64j,False,,1430458444

* Health tourism does cost £2.2billion per year.

* We would have to build a house every 7 seconds to cope with net migration of 300k per year.

* Migrants need somewhere to live.

* We can negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU if we leave.

The data I'll be pulling from:

[Population Statistics of the European Union](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+the+European+Union)

[Population of California](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=California&amp;lk=1&amp;a=ClashPrefs_*USState.California-)

[Population of Poland](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Poland&amp;lk=1&amp;a=ClashPrefs_*Country.Poland-)

[Population of Maryland](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Maryland)

[Population of Baltimore, Maryland](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Baltimore+Maryland)

[Population of Denmark](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Denmark&amp;lk=1&amp;a=ClashPrefs_*Country.Denmark-)

[Population Density of Lativa](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Latvia+population+density)

---

The only advice I can possibly give would be to suggest that you don't think of the United States as a single country but instead 50 separate countries. For example, California has the population of Poland and Maryland (Where Baltimore is) has the population of Denmark.

Imagine you have a country in the EU that is small, roughly the size of Lativa, where 65% (please don't PM me about this percent, I know not all of the demographic is this way) of the population may feel disenfranchised with the current state of government and law enforcement. Add in a draconian drug law, corruption, poor social programs, low education levels and you eventually get to the point we are at today.

As to why a law enforcement would be picking up 2 people, population density and likely crime type. I don't know what both of the offenders were being brought in on, I would assume it was non-violent crimes such as skipping bail or drug charges. Either of these would be a ""Pick them up when you have time if they aren't a flight risk"" type.

---

Is any of this okay? Not really, eventually there might be a massive shift on how we as a people deal with social inequalities but it won't be fore a bit longer. One thing that a good portion of silent Americans pride themselves on is personal responsibility. People see the protests and they become aware of the situation. Then people see the riots and disconnect. Each of those riots sets back progression just a little more each time. Eventually it will be a joke, looking on reddit it already is a joke. This is what riots did, they turned a social injustice into a joke. My conservative estimate is that this and Ferguson set us back as a country 20-30 years in social equality.

I hope that roughly answered your question and sorry for the rant at the end.

And you're doing the same thing to them. Who's to say that his opinion is a shitty opinion? You saying that is based on your own opinion, which is naturally biased by being one of the 1%ers of the world (and in case you were wondering, if you're in the poorest 10% of Americans and have regular internet access, you're wealthier than 99% of the planets population.) 

Wholly 1/7 people on this planet are catholic. So let's take a look at things the Catholics believe that you would likely consider a shitty opinion. I'll even try to keep God out of this rationale. 


- abortion is murder (because they define life at conception and you likely don't)
- homosexuality is a sin (because they believe that sexual relations are for procreation and gay sex serves no procreation all purpose.)
- birth control is unnatural (because they believe that by actively preventing pregnancy, sexual relations no longer serve q procreation all purpose, see above) 
- anti-gay marriage (because of you strip the religious beliefs out of it, the purpose of marriage is to form a family unit which is supposed to rear children. And if you're not procreating, there's no need for a family and therefore no need for marriage.) 
- no sex before marriage (because this one is based on medieval times and was really a means of preserving bloodlines but more importantly, preventing the spread of disease. Does it have a place in the modern western world? Probably not. But in a third world country with little to no higher education system, and limited access to modern medical treatment? Maybe it's not the worst policy ever.)

Now let's take a second and look at Muslims. There's 1.6 billion of them. I would make you a list of the things that they believe that you likely wouldn't agree with, but you can basically loom at the catholic list and potentially remove the birth control one depending on the sect of Islam you're talking about. 

So now we've covered the two religions that comprise 99% of the Filipino population.

And just those two religions alone account for 39% of the worlds population. That's not even counting other denominations of Christianity that share the above beliefs with Catholicism to varying degrees. 

So yeah, maybe his political beliefs don't match well with even moderate beliefs here in the United States, but that doesn't make it an inherently shitty opinion. At a bare minimum, 2.7 billion people share those beliefs. So is it really a shitty opinion? 

**for the record, I don't agree with him either**, but I also don't agree with people calling him a piece of shot for thinking that way. People seem to easily forget that even conservative politics in the United States and Western Europe is fairly liberal compared to the rest of the world. 

So let's pretend for a second that he doesn't personally believe any of these things. Let's pretend he had the same liberal views that you and I have (we do, I swear, just because we're arguing doesn't mean our personal views on the matter don't line up). So now he's pro gay marriage pro birth control and pro choice, just to name a few. But his constituents are still the Catholics and Muslims I talked about earlier. **So doesn't he have an ethical obligation to represent their views in congress and not his own? Isn't that the very thing many Americans are infuriated  with our own congress about?

Once Europe divided up Africa  these new countries became formed of many different groups with different languages, customs, and had bitter rivalries in the past. Colonial rule dominated them by largely exporting their resources and in some cases such as the Belgian Congo had a very repressive rule. When WWII was over most European countries were pressured to give up their colonies. They did so but did not prepare the African countries for governing themselves. The British colonies did a bit better than the rest but most of the others just left taking all of the leadership with them. This led to many of the new governments collapse some even within weeks. Power struggles, corruption, and outside influence ravaged the countries for decades to come. Billions of aid was dumped into the nations but it was either misspent or stolen by the corrupt governments. In some ways they have suffered from a ""resource curse"" which led more developed nations to exploit them. Some nations are on the rise these days however. Botswana has the highest GDP largely because of their massive diamond mines and Ghana is second due to the gasoline.

That comes from Western theory and is not the way many places view the world. Some societies, for instance, believe in more of a cyclical process. Related, Africa is huge, so generalizing for all of Africa is impossible. There are tons of places in the continent of Africa that would meet the ideals of linear development. Second, colonialism and slavery. Many African societies were far more ""developed"" than the rest of the world before colonialism and slavery. They had advanced mathematics, agriculture techniques, books, religion, etc. But can enlightened Europe enslave an enlightened people? I have come to understand our view of Africa came about in part as justification for the slave trade. We (Americans) painted Africa as dumb and backwards to justify the subjugation of its peoples. Beyond the view, colonial efforts in Africa underdeveloped the continent. As others have said, many extracted resources from Africa to the West, drawing financial benefits away. (read the dependency theorists Wallerstein and Gunder Frank)  add to the extraction of resources the arbitrary carving up of the continent by Europe into states that had no basis in the people living there and you have a recipe for the current unstable situation in many places. As others mentioned, you can't arbitrarily put dozens of minority groups under the rule of one and expect it to all be hunky dory. Colonial powers try to maintain control long after the heyday, often with disastrous consequences. Take, for instance, Congo's first democratically elected president Patrice Lumumba. He tried to unify Africans under a banner of peace and self-determination, but was deposed and assassinated with CIA backing. Which brings the other point of control of resources. Congo is very rich in natural resources. If they had a strong government, so many other countries and companies would suffer from having to leave or pay fair price for taking the resources. There is little attention to the current atrocities in DRC because a stable government there would be costly to business interests. TL;DR the West wants to think Africa is backwards because it benefits us economically. In truth it is a huge continent with varied ideas of ""development"", and Western (and increasingly Eastern) interventions actively underdevelop many areas.",,0,False,,explainlikeimfive,cquyqxm,,0,4,t5_2sokd,t3_34hrvq,t1_cquyqxm,False,,1430486737

There's actually a book/movie about this; it's called Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. I would definitely reccomend it. 
Anyways, the point of the book is that the higher the nutritional and caloric concentration in the most abundant food source (assuming there is an abundant food source), the more developed the civilization. So if an abundant food source meets this criteria, less manpower will need to be devoted to producing food and more manpower can be devoted to other things like crafting, building, and discovering. An example given in the movie talked about an island in Indonesia, or somewhere in Southeast Asia, which had is one crop that was relatively hard to plant, as it had to be planted one by one in large bulbs, and wasn't as nutrient and calorie dense as wheat or rice. This meant more people had to devote more energy to farming as opposed to other specialties, so they developed relatively slowly as opposed to in Europe where wheat, high in nutrients (for a grain) and calories, was abundant. There's also another idea given that the available domesticated animals were also directly related to the development of the civilization. Going back to the Indonesia example, it was said that the only native domesticated animal there was only a species of pig which was not very useful when it came to agriculture (it couldn't pull plows and such), but in Europe horses and cattle were available and were strong enough to help with agriculture. 

This theory mostly applied to when civilizations were first developing, but can still be seen today. I'm sure there are hundreds of other factors and theories, but this is relatively simple (for trying to explain civilization) and makes a lot of sense.

TLDR; The more nutritious a food source, the faster a civilization may develop as it can devote more manpower to other things necessary for the advancement of the society.",,0,False,,explainlikeimfive,cquzebx,,0,1,t5_2sokd,t3_34hrvq,t1_cquzebx,False,,1430488094

United Kingdom Special Forces (**UK-SF**) might be somewhat of a good match for you. 

We are a fairly decent sized ArmA3 MILSIM Community, with a good structure and gameplay. You will of course go through a recruitment process, however it will never be like what you described. Recruitment process will make sure 1) we are a good match for you, and 2) you are a good match for us.  And although we are a mainly European community, we have members from both United States and Canada.

Our mandatory training are on Saturday, 8PM GMT - which should be 2PM CST your time. We also have non-mandatory (optional) training on Wednesday, same time, 8 GMT. Though you will not be forced to take part in trainings, please do remember that for you to become a fully pledged Pte (Private) - you have to finish three phases of basic. Operations and trainings takes around two hours to three, most of the time - but it might be just a bit longer. We however understand your absence from mandatory operations - as everyone in the unit puts their personal lives above anything else, including the game.

We use variety of mods, around 16Gbs - give or take couple. If you know our mods, or played with them before - great. If you didn't, you will be taught everything from scratch - so you feel no difficulties during the gameplay.

Considering we are UK-SF, 1st Para. - you won't be able to crew a tank. That being said, we use Jackals during some of our patrol operations, and it is possible for you to man the machine-guns, or if you prefer, be the driver - after your basic training. On the other hand if you wish to fly, you may try our Joint Special Forces Aviation Wing (JSFAW) - where our Pilots provide both transport and CAS.

If you are interested, feel free to join our teamspeak over uk-sf.com (yes, just uk-sf.com - with no ts. prefix) - and visit our [website!](http://uk-sf.com).

People can live in high-rises that contain shops and restaurants to accommodate them, eliminating the wasteful sprawl seen in places like the US.  

Of course this will take a lot of money, but I think it can be paid for by improving the environmental and labor laws in these poor African countries - if international corporations had to pay workers a minimum wage comparable to that in the US or EU, imagine the massive increase in taxes the government would receive.  Also, increasing environmental regulations (and fines for violating them) would provide even more funds.  Though another important part of this is to somehow remove a lot of the rampant corruption in African politics.  ",,0,False,,worldnews,cqv0k8t,,0,1,t5_2qh13,t3_34gan3,t1_cqv0k8t,False,,1430490301

Before that, we also struggled in big games to hold onto leads - City, United, and PSG away - although I'm buoyed a little by our recent performances against United and Arsenal.

I doubt, in the conceivable future, that we'll ever surpass the likes of Barca/Bayern/Real man for man, so our ability to win in Europe will depend largely on the ability to grind out results, as Mourinho's Porto and Inter did in the past, and as we did in 2012. 

Obviously, the question now is whether or not this team can develop that mental fortitude, and it's still too early to tell: there won't be a real answer until next year.

A good one is transport.

&gt; TR341 National weight limits for delivery vehicles would be set within which local authorities would choose those most applicable for their roads. The aim will be to considerably reduce the size of delivery vehicles, especially in residential areas. The weight limits which we would seek to enact would be 1.5 tonnes, 3 tonnes (which would be the maximum limit in any purely residential area), 7.5 tonnes (which would be the maximum urban limit) and 20 tonnes. To enable this to happen within the current competitive environment, the Green Party will work to change E.U. law to reflect the need for a reduction in weight limits.

So what they want to do is replace every articulated vehicle not doing  urban work which currently does around 9MPG and carries 27 tonnes with three 20 tonners to do the same work, each doing around 12MPG thus tripling the amount of fuel used and doubling the amount of road space used.

They want to replace one artic delivering to your local Asda or Tesco with nine 7.5 tonners. Given a typical Asda in a city will have 6-7 artics a day delivering, there'll be over 60 7.5 tonners going to each Asda over a 24hr period. Can you imagine just what that would be like? Where the fuck are they going to get the drivers from? There aren't enough unemployed people in the whole of the EU to do it.

* Do you have a mixture of students and employees coming in or what's the general conf attendee like?

I've signed up for an ultimate membership on aigamedev.com and I'm pretty serious about learning more about it. I've been spending the past 6 months working with MCTS (mainly on Go).  I understand that the conference will be about exploring innovations in the field, but some people will obviously be able to grasp a lot more than others. I don't want to be the guy that sits there and goes ""Woah, this is cool"" without actually understanding anything, you know? I'll be graduating with a CS degree in a few months and people over there will have far more experience. That's one of my concerns.

* What kind of work is involved in volunteering? Would you accept volunteers from out of Europe?

* I've noticed that the student-discounted all-access passes do not include access to any networking events. Is there anyway to pay an extra fee to gain access to those or is it strictly for those who pay full price for the passes?

I'm from India. Flight tickets will be my major expense but I have enough saved up and this conference is something I'm quite keen on attending. Both for the talks and the chance to network. It's just that before spending so much I want to know I'm making the right choice.

For example I usually use the website feelunqiue.com for European/drugstore brands. It's free shipping for 16$ Canadian or more (which is crazy reasonable), and it has a lot of the french/european drugstore brands for cheaper than I've been ever able to find in a Canadian Rexall.

If not, I really love putting on an entire face of Eucerin's aquaphor at night. It's pretty much vaseline, but with some added moisturizing ingredients. Your face will look greasy as hell, but I find it does wonders when I wake up.

I balance this with a more low key moisturizer in the day. I use one from sebamed, which you can get at feelunique.com but it's probably more practical for someone with acne. I find I break out from cream moisturizers, so need a gel, but they are hard to find. 

I would look at any cerave and eucerin product for moisturizer/cleansers. They have no fragrances/added fluff and seem to be widely available at most drug stores.

As for foundation, I don't have a great answer because I tend to use one's on the higher price end (Laura Mercier &amp; Nars). I use their tinted moisturizers and love them. They look natural, hydrate, and dont break me out. A little goes a long way, I can get one last 6-8 months. It may be something to consider. Also sephora sends out samples for not too much money.

In England you buy a bike and mail in a slip with the registration address, and they send your ownership papers. No further questions asked. Then I got moto insurance for Europe through this company: http://www.tourinsure.de/

One downside is that if you want to have all your documents in order, you'll have to wait until the insurance card comes in the mail which is about a week or more. Getting the full registration is hopeless - took about six weeks to finally arrive. I didn't have time to wait for either so I was riding with a printout of my insurance card they had emailed me and a temporary registration slip from when I bought the bike. I never got pulled over so I don't know if this would have gotten me into trouble, but I did get hassled at the Bosnia-Croatia border.

Also I was covered for Europe through my insurance but NOT for the UK, so I had to ride from London to the ferry uninsured which was slightly sketchy. I guess I could have bought UK insurance as well but I didn't have time to look into it. (**edit:** I remember why I couldn't get UK insurance - I didn't have a UK license.)

My friend still gets mail in my name at his place with fine notices because if you don't insure your bike after you register it in the UK they will fine you after a certain amount of time.

I'm not sure how registration goes in any other part of Europe. It may just be easier to rent if you have the money, but I was doing everything on the cheap.

* ALL new construction MUST have 4-5 stories minimum; ANY construction on 1 to 3 stories are banned outright for all future construction.
* 20-year plans to convert any 1-2 story buildings on selected prime streets to 4-5+ stories buildings.  Basically by imminent domain.
* ALL new commercial construction MUST have residential apartments and condos.  I'm OK with **universally** coerced affordable housing quotas.
* ALL new or converted or modified residential MUST have 1st floor commercial space - no exceptions or exemptions
* Special preference for local owner/residence for those who start/run businesses at the 1st floor within the same block/street
* Subways MRT/Surface LRT must be radically expanded; car thoroughfares must be sacrificed and deprecated throughout the city **and for walkable plazas and pedestrian malls** should be preferred.

Basically this is how you recapitulate well functioning cities as ALREADY exist in Europe or Asia.  This is how you create thriving, livable, enjoyable neighborhoods.  The key features:

* Density must be increased.  At least 10x of current SF levels.  Key is residential *and supporting commercial* in close proximity.  
* Mass transit must have precedence over ALL individual motor vehicle traffic at all times in all parts.  280/1 and 101 need to become subsumed to this agenda by being re-routed underground, out of sight, out of mind, as much as possible.  Freeway-like thru traffic must not interfere with neighborhoods!
* Commercial and residential must be mixed to minimize trip distances and maximize walkability.  You should be able to get 90% of your daily consumer needs with a 3 block walk or less.  Jobs or consumer goods beyond that should only be a 10% exception of your time.

On the one hand, people want more direct control over legislation, they want their vote to mean more. Look at discussions here about how bitter people are about their representatives acting against what they themselves belief in. On the other hand, a politician that aims to act against the public will, even though he knows that it's in the public interest is going to not get re-elected. So on the one hand a politician has to choose between democracy and good governance. 

Gun legislation in the US is the epitome of this. There's tons of examples for this situation. Even though no one knows nothing about TTIP , international law, economics, regulations or arbitrations, and so on, fuck it, the treaty has not even been finished negotiated, everyone is dead fucking set against it, to the point of religiosity. 

What Cameron did with the ""EU referendum"" reflects the no actual option for a politician.He reflected in his opinions the public opinions of the population, and as they changed, he changed as well. It's what a career politician does, and it's exactly what people want, even though they despise him for it. Cameron knows the EU is necessary for the UK, and there's no way to leave, or the welfare legislation. But people want something else, so there's a waiting game until public opinion gets better informed, or changes, or remains the same, but no politician would dream to act against public opinion or else he'd get burned on a stake in a moment.

The market for politicians is exactly as people want it , according to the demand. People want a political class that will do what they are told, according to public opinion. Those people are going to get elected, and those people are going to be coming into politics. People that are leaders and are willing to act against public opinion in the interest of good governance are not going to get elected. In that aspect Cameron is no more than a CEO / Manager of a country, and has to influence/control/direct/manage, but by no means does he have the freedom to actually govern and be a leader. I would see this as a career position more than anything as well, in fact it really does not even matter who's the prime minister of the country, so of course it's about my career.",,0,False,European Union,europe,cqv7tg4,,0,8,t5_2qh4j,t3_34i7nu,t1_cqv7tg4,False,EURO,1430502182

&gt; For example, from the past decade we know that trickle down economics don't work. From the past decade we know that having strong regulations to keep the big banks in check is better than removing regulations and letting banks do whatever they want.

Not even remotely true. If you actually paid attention in history class, it was the Reaganomics [that brought the country out of the horrible stagflation that happened under Jimmy Carter's watch.](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/Reaganomics.html). In modern history, Estonia is one of the [fastest growing economies after the 08 crash due entirely to low taxes and low spending](http://www.newsmax.com/Rahn/estonia-freemarket-economy/2011/06/21/id/400766/). Even the ""Nordic Socialist"" countries [used deregulation and capitalism to build their economies in the 90s](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21571136-politicians-both-right-and-left-could-learn-nordic-countries-next-supermodel). 

&gt;From the past decade we know that strengthening the middle class by raising the minimum wage results in positive changes for everyone - even employers.

lol wut? Any sources on that? I can understand if the minimum wage keeps up with inflation but raising it? it generally doesn't help. [When looking at european countries with and without minimum wage, countries without minimum wage saw much higher employment rates and better paid workers](http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/24/report-minimum-wage-has-hurt-employment-in-europe/). 

&gt;Like free post secondary education that has proven successful in other countries like Sweden and Norway. A well educated population is good for everyone - especially employers

Look at one of my last posted articles. Sweden and Denmark have private school vouchers (something US republicans want). Swedish Students also graduate with about $19,000 of debt (only 30% less than US Students) and 85% of students graduate with debt. College in Sweden isn't exactly free. http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/

0,t1_cqv3lvy,False,witoldc,6,1432716443,"It's frightening largely because it is taken out of context:

- US has a ton of ongoing and temporary training programs for lots of people abroad, doing lots of things.  Europe, Asia, Africa.  Everywhere.  Some of it is political/financial, some of it information warfare, some of it is logistical and knowledge support to groups and individuals that are deemed important.  Here in DC, I've met foreign military personnel going to US military training and living on US military bases.  Support for C. and S. American governments, leaders, and groups is nothing unusual.  

- No one has a crystal ball to figure out people's true intentions or their future behavior.  You can only skew chances in your favor.  You can't magically eliminate bad or embarrassing outcomes.  Doing nothing is considered a clear loss that is -worse- than occasional embarrassments.  That's what it comes down to.  

- Some of these countries are a basket case and they will remain basket cases for a long time.  It is better to have some sort of relations than no relations at all.  In the Middle East, all these leaders (most not elected) hate USA openly in their statements.  But as Wikileaks cables showed, behind the scenes they are often maneuvering to be in USA's good graces and sharing secret information and bad mouthing their neighbors.  They are 'covert' allies.  USA has a lot of 'covert' allies who publicly bad mouth USA, but behind closed doors support USA and sometimes depend on USA financially/logistically/etc.  Strategically speaking, this is a much better outcome than having zero influence in the region.  

- US has been documented in writing checks and supporting many efforts that people consider ""just"", like Tibet's Dalai Lama.  But over the years, Dalai Lama made it clear that there is no democracy in Tibet's future.  Tibet used to be a theological serf state led by these religious extremists who want to be back in Tibet and back in power.  So who really knows what would've happened had they succeeded in gaining independence for Tibet?  That's just one example.  CIA/etc have provided support for a lot of things over the years, including Polish Solidarity movement... and as you can see no one is complaining about that.  US has been involved in supporting opposition to Yanukovych for many years now, and is actively involved trying to undermine Europe's last dictator Lukashenko as well.  

When shit hits the fan, people will make a big deal out it.  They're justified in doing so and raise important issues.  These programs are continuously evaluated for effectiveness and minimizing embarrassing situations.  

But it is important to look at these programs not as some individual conspiracies, but as overall USA policy.  There are organizations that keep track of casualties of war and armed conflicts.  If we use that a metric of success, the world is doing as good as ever.  Whatever USA is doing is working - or at least not hindering progress as much as individual incidents might make it seem.

There are no official studies of this.  But I have had occasion to be in the presence and gotten to know many atheists, especially in the last 10 years.  It's one of those things you easily observe &gt; 90% behaviors from a group (for example, the near 100% support of gay marriage among atheists, while it is something like 40% for Christians is just too striking, and does not need a survey to observe.)

&gt; and most religious people believe. 

These sorts of things are available from Pew, Aris, or just reading the news headlines.

&gt; There are good and bad people every where and whether they are religious or atheists have nothing to do with it.

But atheists don't subvert the definition of good or bad according to arbitrary authoritarian doctrine.  Religious people think that gay marriage is a bad thing.  So your clever truism does not apply, because religious people are far less likely to have a reasonable sense of what good or bad is.

&gt; Look at Russia for athesits that are homophobic.

First of all, they are culturally homophobic for the same reasons Americans used to be.  The media and culture in general have persecuted them.  However, if you scratch under the surface, you find that actually the real people there don't hate gay people, and the younger generation is much more tolerant; the current outspoken backlash against them has been manufactured entirely by the government.

Second of all, Russia can no longer be considered an atheistic state.  The government does not restrict practice of religion and there has been a major upsurge in Russian Orthodox Church attendance since the fall of the Berlin wall.

&gt; Eastern Europe ranks among highest for nonreligious and child abuse, child sex and slavery trade.

Ok, that you would have cite figure for.  The eastern Europeans that *I* know are extremely protective of their children, and are unaware of a child slave trade.

&gt; Freedom of speech is quite restrictive in the non religious world.

Ok, that's just utter bullshit.  The non-religious world is basically Japan, Europe, and to a lesser extent Canada and Australia.  They have generic freedom of speech in those places.  The one exception to this is China.  China's secularism is a special case.

&gt; Look at Russia and China.

Again, Russia is no longer an atheistic state.  China is a special case in many respects.

&gt; I think you may be over emphasizing the anecdotal evidence from your social network.

No, there is a well known statistic about federal incarceration and religion that was calculated during the Clinton administration.  It showed that Jews were about 40 times less likely to be in prison, and Atheists were 50 times less likely (Muslims were nearly twice as likely) as compared with their population.  The government has since stopped providing this data.

I wrote my own survey (but I got too few responses, and clearly a biased turn-out) to help me understand this.  Atheists in the west are just way ahead of the curve on human values and decency, and I've spent much of the last 10 years trying to figure out why that is.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Drugs_and_alcohol

""Substance abuse and violence
Hendrix would often become angry and violent when he drank too much alcohol, or when he mixed alcohol with illicit drugs.[258] His friend Herbie Worthington explained: ""You wouldn't expect somebody with that kind of love to be that violent ... He just couldn't drink ... he simply turned into a bastard.""[259] According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix ""admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise.""[260]

In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden for a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen, in Gothenburg, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment.[259] The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.[261] After the 1969 burglary of a house Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon, California, and while he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him.[262] A few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.[259]""",,0,False,,AdviceAnimals,cqva0yh,,0,2,t5_2s7tt,t3_34imtj,t1_cqva0yh,False,,1430505765

**The Returnees:**

*Kyle Wiltjer (RsSR, 6'10"")* -- You guys know Wilt, he was the national face of this program due to his transfer from blue-blood Kentucky to our tiny little school of 6k undergrads. Kyle was the standout in an offense with several contributors, scoring 17 points a game on 54% from the field, including 46.6% from beyond the arc. He's definitely a stretch-four type on that end of the floor. The reason he's still here and not in the NBA is his poor footwork. This leads to many awkward moments on offense and really, really hurts him on defense. Speaking of defense, he's poor at it. While he's able to run the floor with most anyone in the college game, he'd be lost trying to defend power forwards in the NBA, especially with his lack of strength. This also is probably the reason we won't see the three-big lineups many think we might, since that'd leave Kyle on some team's three-guard who'd probably have a field day driving around him.

*Przemek Karnowski (SR, 7'1"")* -- The 7-1 Goliath briefly entertained turning pro, many speculating that a European team might've even offered a contract, but will be coming back to dominate the paint in the WCC again. His strength, besides his pure size, is probably his hands. Most effectively shown off with a couple no-look passes around double teams down low in the UCLA game, Przem knows how to use his hands in ways most big men don't. Defensively, he's a problem for most teams simply because he's big. Opposing forwards find him hard to post up against and he's more than capable of stopping drives. One criticism would be his lack of blocks for someone of his size, only getting one or two per game. This might be at least partially due to his other problem, a lot of bench time due to his foul trouble. In addition to the occasional ""You're too big"" foul calls you expect in the WCC, he doesn't always know when to cut his losses and allow the bucket without grabbing another foul.

*Domantas Sabonis (SO, 6'10"")* -- Of Arvydas Sabonis' pedigree, he was huge as a sixth man off the bench and the last of the returning players who saw significant minutes in the 2014-15 campaign. The third big on the roster, Domantas brought onto the roster the polish he gained playing with professionals in Europe. His main problem last year was fouls, though his were of the over-the-back variety on rebounds. He did wind up leading the team in boards, but he did so by being very aggressive. The three of these returning bigs have many Zag fans and some national analysts anointing this frontcourt rotation the best in the nation. More on that a bit later.

*Josh Perkins (RsFR, 6'3"")* -- Currently the assumed point guard until Mark Few tells us otherwise, Perkins was supposed to back up Pangos last year until an errant flying ninja kick caught his jaw and left him out for the season, partially in order to pick up a medical redshirt. He looked like the kind of guard Gonzaga doesn't usually get in the recruiting process. Athletic and entertaining as all hell to watch. Many speculated that if he stayed healthy, the Zags go undefeated in the regular season. Anyway, he's  at least a little bit of an unknown for fans right now, for as highly rated he was out of high school (four-star, ESPN 100) and how good he looked last year, his games were against lower-quality opposition and no one knows what kind of development he did while sitting. He also has the same height problem as Pangos and Bell, leaving some concerned about his defensive ability on taller guards like what we faced in Duke.

*Kyle Dranginis (RsSR, 6'5"")* -- One of your prototypical college hustle guys who picks up a lot of offensive boards and gets on the ground for loose balls. His other strength, one that might lead him to the three-guard position, is his three-point shooting. I don't have a shot chart on hand or anything but if memory serves me right he usually takes his shots from the corners and can drive the baseline if the opportunity is there. Defense is a little suspect (you're probably noticing a theme here) but Mark Few once started Mike Hart for most of a season so who knows.

*Silas Melson (SO, 6'5"")* -- Once thought to be a good tandem partner for Josh Perkins a la Pangos and Bell Jr, he wound up burning his redshirt once Perkins got hurt since McClellan wasn't eligible for another two months and Dranginis was the only other scholarship guard on the bench at the time. He saw limited minutes and didn't shoot nearly as well as one would hope. He held his own on the defensive side of the ball, though, and Gonzaga seems to be much better at developing offense than defense, so he might be a decently rounded guard come next year. He'll be expected to be the two guard.

*Eric McClellan (RsSR, 6'3"")* -- Vanderbilt transfer who sat out the first half of the year and then saw limited minutes. Not much is known about Few's plans for him and since I didn't get to see much during the season I can't do the kind of analysis I did for everyone else. He will probably at least give Perkins competition for the point guard spot and might wind up in the two or three-guard spot if Mark Few decides Dranginis is more effective off the bench.

**The Newbies:**

*Ryan Edwards (RsSO, 7'1"")* -- With our only committed 2015 recruit going off on his Mormon mission before stepping on a court with a Gonzaga jersey, the only ""newcomer"" actually saw minutes his freshman year before sitting down and presumably working with Tommy Lloyd for a season on... something. Zag fans have seen redshirt seasons work wonders on Kelly Olynyk and Kyle Wiltjer so many are pegging Edwards to be a surprise the nation won't see coming but he did not have near the hype that those two had coming out of high school. He is the same weight and height as Karnowski, though, which could be all he needs. With him on the bench, Few might have Karnowski be more aggressive on defense, knowing that there's another equivalent paint presence on the bench. I don't expect him to be near Karno's level on offense, so he'll get only limited minutes at the end of the day.

**Possible Pickups**

I don't follow the recruiting and transfer trail as hotly as some of my fellow Zag fans, but after making Damion Lee's shortlist and getting burned there's only one player left on my radar who could come in and make an impact next season. PG Federico Mussini is an international player in Italy who has Gonzaga on his list of schools he's considering, but he might go pro. St John's is also apparently hot on his trail as well. He would definitely be a backup point guard, probably pushing McClellan out of that race, and might see some minutes elsewhere in the backcourt as well. Gonzaga is still everywhere on the transfer market, but most of the names that I've seen have been of the redshirt year variety, including Nigel Willams-Goss. A lot of Zag fans would definitely appreciate one more guard at least to firm up the backcourt, and with four scholarships open it's a surprise the staff has yet to add anyone. Time will tell.

In conclusion, the frontcourt should be beastly, the backcourt is a big question mark, and the team is not set in stone yet.

But more realistically, apparently feeding a person requires [0.07 hectares](http://ask.metafilter.com/77287/How-much-land-does-a-person-need):

&gt; ""The minimum amount of agricultural land necessary for sustainable food security, with a diversified diet similar to those of North America and Western Europe (hence including meat), is 0.5 of a hectare per person. This does not allow for any land degradation such as soil erosion, and it assumes adequate water supplies. Very few populous countries have more than an average of 0.25 of a hectare. It is realistic to suppose that the absolute minimum of arable land to support one person is a mere 0.07 of a hectare–and this assumes a largely vegetarian diet, no land degradation or water shortages, virtually no post-harvest waste, and farmers who know precisely when and how to plant, fertilize, irrigate, etc. [FAO, 1993]""

Or maybe 0.2 hectares:

&gt; If you're interested in the maximum yield, you might look into the Biointensive method. This book, by John Jeavons, claims that less than half an acre (~ 0.2 hectares) can support a family of four, or about 0.05 hectares/person, which is lower still than the lower of sfenders' figures.

0.2 hectares is like a 14 meter square.

First, [this.](http://np.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/34bhuj/did_feminism_create_the_red_pill_mentality/cqtnmyc#cqtpv9w) You seem to operate under the misconception that it's the greatest prospect for a guy to have a marriage of convenience where he has the license to maritally rape his wife if she isn't compliant on her own (and *you* wonder why I always chime in with a sarcastic ""this is what feminists actually believe""...). As I said, holding that belief certainly makes it easier to avoid cognitive dissonance. 

&gt;Didn't you once look around you and see which males were having the greatest success with women?

Sure, I was aware of them. Well, where to start...

- let's begin with the greatest player among them, who pretty much went through all girls in my class (at least making out, but also hooking up, can't say for sure) and to quite a bunch beyond that - he once said that he had two women a week on average, and even though one might consider that humblebragging, it was most likely accurate. Not hating here, he was a really chill, laid-back guy, not your stereotypical bad boy, and I actually liked him (and, more importantly, so did the girls). Doesn't change the fact that he saw dating as a game and girls as conquests or challenges that had to be had, only to lose interest when he had made it.
- another player type (catchphrase ""woah, fucking bitches"" whenever a woman got on his nerves) even gave me the most sincere and probably best piece of dating advice I ever got until that point in my life (given the poor quality of the rest of the dating guidelines I had): ""sandman, women want you treat them like crap."" While of course he was exaggerating, truth is that he certainly didn't treat them what I would have considered ""decent"" back then. He was fucking around, shamelessly hit on women (also in a blatantly sexual manner), and wasn't a stranger to cheating on them (the last habit I got to know a decade later from a girl whose friend he dated back then). 
- well, we also had our jerks jock; a steroid using bodybuilder who considered generally being an asshole as something honorable. Rumored to have fathered a child at 16. During our school trip to Eastern Europe, he mused about how you could get the prettiest girls there for peanuts. Which must have been his hard standard because those times I saw him with girlfriends, it was never less than an 8.
- a pretty good friend of mine in HS was a serial monogamist who went through breakup without heartache and usually had a rebound girl within a week, sometimes within a day. He could regularly deride a girl only to hit it off with her later or hit on her/get into a relationship with her and regularly deride her afterwards. He's the most harmless case from that list, but even he had the habit of considering the women in his life as disposable.

So yeah, I actually *did* see what the successful guys did. Unfortunately, it wasn't compatible with the feminist-approved set of dating guidelines I internalized (and if you didn't prefer to stay in denial about them and refuse to read the reports I linked above, you might actually get to know how *guys* interpreted the messages a feminist-influenced narrative sent them through all channels). Okay, I mean, I *could* have tried to emulate that behavior, sure (though I already have an idea of how this would have turned out). The mere *possibility* is there. Alas, all that ""objectifying"", ""disrespecting"", ""only thinking about sex"" and generally treating women as disposable didn't sit well with me. But unfortunately, that was the point: while it wasn't the only thing they had going for them, those guys who had the greatest success with women wouldn't have had it had they actually treated them like feminism tells you to, and not like as guy#2 has put it. Neither would they have gotten that far nor would they have been personally willing to do. 

The answer is - apart from the fact that I wouldn't have been very good at it (for several reasons), that I didn't *want* to, not under these conditions. I actually wanted the soulmate romance, and I clung to a set of counterproductive and nonsenical beliefs that were derived from progressive notions on how to treat women and of what women said they wanted. I would lie if I said that I would have been the ultimate player had I not been confused by them, but having an actually accurate idea of what women want and how to deal with that (and them) would have made my dating life *infinitely* easier.

 ""...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.

As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.

""Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source,"" said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. ""Primarily ... dogs don’t get sick at all or they get a minor illness,"" after being infected with the plague.

Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.

""For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat,"" Runfola said. ""The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner.""

""The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.

The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans.",,0,False,,StormComing,cqvdqjz,,0,2,t5_2xnik,t3_34jsym,t1_cqvdqjz,False,,1430511956

Not when someone abandons his team for the good stuff. BIG difference.

Leaving a team due to no raise in salary is fine, IF THEY WON THE FREAKIN' championship.

BUT He left in order to play with other star players, aka greener grass.

Consensual sex with Slavs, Jews, etc. was not permitted. Rape was, either implicitly or explicitly.

The Wehrmacht organized a vast system of military brothels in Eastern Europe using sex slaves recruited from Poland, the Soviet Union, etc. Punishment for raping civilian women in the East was either explicitly waived or never enforced.

Your bullshit nationalist arguments have no place here. Lorraine was inherited by the french king after the duke of Lorraine and Holy roman emperor and husband of Maria Theresa von Habsburg exchanged Lorraine for Milan and a claimant to the polish throne got it for surrendering his claim on Poland and because he was brother in-law (or something like that) with the french king it was decided that he was the heir and Lorraine would fall to France. 

Alsace is more complicated because it were several little lordships, clerical territories and free cities. However France fabricated claims before occupying some of these territories by the same right America belongs to the european nations or their successor states like the US or Prussia, Russia and Austria partitioned Poland. The city of Straßburg for example was conquered when the turks besieged Vienna and the empire and europe needed every man so the assembled imperial army had to defend Vienna instead of Straßburg since the turks were a bigger enemie than France (I mean out of the perspective of 17th century christian europe). Attacking Straßburg was certainly not honourable. 

Now to the German claim to Alsace and Lorraine. In respect to Lorraine there's none except to a little strip. Metz was only taken because the military establishment wanted it because it's a strategically important place. Real Lorraine is way bigger and the german majority area was even smaller. Alsace was arguably German in the most areas. As the self-determination ideology didn't exist in that time Germany had a good claim to most of the taken territory. 

It's also important to look at French actions before Germany took the area. They attacked and ravaged Germany very often before. They needed to weaken France to protect them. Of coudse Bismarck and the German empire weren't saints. 

France didn't stole them, Germany didn't stole them. You don't steal territory in war you gain or lose it. ",,0,False,,MapPorn,cqvf4od,,0,8,t5_2si92,t3_34g0cm,t1_cqvf4od,False,,1430514374

This means you will get -1 revolt risk for all Hellenic provinces (because they have +1 happiness basically) and a +1 revolt risk in all other non Hellenic provinces.

Culture doesn't mean much in the game other than is it your Primary Culture, and Accepted culture or non accepted. Primary gives no penalties or benefits and neither does Accepted. However, Accepted can always become non-accepted if you grow too large (I think if a culture provides 15% - 20% or something around there of your total income it becomes accepted and if it falls below that by expanding your empire it can become unaccepted). Unaccepted provides a -2 unhappiness or in other words +2 revolt risk.

Revolt risk now accrues over time (unlike the old system which was like in CK2 where a 5% revolt chance spawns a 100 stack lol). So if a province has like 1% revolt it will likely take 50+ years to spawn and will most likely go away before it does. 10% chance tho and it will spawn in under 2 years. Understand?

The biggest difference in nations is their Ideas, their Unit Types, Religion, Government Type and their Technology.

Ideas are unique traits about your country which grant bonuses which you will have to look up on the wiki.

Unit Types have what are called PIPS. Offensive and Defensive PIPS and determine their Efficiency in battle. Unit Types are most often tied to the starting tech of the country (Western tech with Western units, Indian with Indian and so on). You can change Tech groups later in the game however you cannot change Unit Types unless it is changed by a special decision (look up the Timurids forming Mughal or Manchu forming Qing). Some units types are strong early game, mid game or late game but they all pretty much have their chance to shine at some point in the game.

Relgion and Government just provide some benefits or penalties and can be found in the wiki.

Finally, Tech groups. Tech is where you will spend most of your monarch points. Every tech group except Western has a penalty that increases the cost of each tech. This is to keep with the history of the world (so a far east country doesn't have the same technology as a European country). You can get rid of this penalty and change to Western once you make contact with a European and they border you (and you have 8 techs behind them). It takes about 10-15 years to change and during this you probably dont want to buy tech because once Westernization is done, you get massive discounts to tech cost until you catch up to your European buddy.

I *have* lived for a few years in a building with a couple of Section 8 tenants, and I have witnessed those people taking advantage of the system by buying crap like wheel rims, drugs, and other ghetto items so I understand that we are paying for lazy bums like them.  

I then realize that it is a small minority in the overall US population anyway, and that means we can increase the taxes to pay for universal healthcare, rather than paying insurance companies for services that we will rarely use on average, and sometimes have to pay from our own pockets because of deductibles or see an increase of insurance payments because we actually dared to use the insurance. The problem is that insurance companies have a good hold on the government, and the states want to take care of it individually to actually see a healthcare system like in Europe.",,0,False,,AskReddit,cqvhduj,,0,9,t5_2qh1i,t3_34k8rf,t1_cqvhduj,False,,1430518645

0,t1_cqvgam9,False,Mosinista,3,1432721033,"I read through the discussion you linked to, there was a surprising amount of bad guessing regarding something that's actually quite simple and well documented. 

The short of it; Imperial Russia bought a lot of Remington and NEW made Mosins until 1917. They were issued to troops all over Tsarist Russia, including Russian troops stationed in the Grand Duchy of Finland. When Finland declared Independence in December 1917 and Civil War broke out between White and Red Finns several Russian garrisons were disarmed by the Whites, some gave arms to the Reds and some sold arms to both sides. A lot of US made Mosins ended up in newly independent Finland this way.

After the Civil war Finland bought surplussed and scrap Mosins from all over Europe. Some of these must also have been of US origin. 

When the Suojeluskunta (the Civil Guard) began repairing and building Mosins to arm the volunteers they actively preferred and picked US made Mosin parts. They had a reputation for better workmanship and they lacked the Russian stigma.

Regular army depots also built rifles from the best parts available in the huge piles of surplus rifles.

At the beginning of WWII all Suojeluskunta rifles were turned over to the army and in 1942 the army started stamping [SA] on their equipment.

That's why, unlike what the guys at surplusrifleforum claimed, there's nothing unusual with a [SA] marked NEW or Remington.

As for OPs question, no I've never seen a double stamped NEW like that. Neat find!

I ordered adrafinil caps on powdercity a few weeks ago, got them without any problem!
French customs are not like German customs, they're pretty lax towards supplements of all kind, even my tianeptine or piracetam were accepted, yet they're scheduled.

As for travelling I don't know, I always travel with a weekly pill box and it always went fine.
I suggest you label it, if they find a white powder unlabeled pouch they will retain you for hours until the lab gives the results, you don't want to miss your flight.

I suggest you buy containers, put a nice realistic label on it and you'll be fine, or you can do like me : buy now foods or whatever brand supplements, empty the container and fill with the powder of your choice!

If you buy adrafinil then buy for less than $100 of it because this amount won't be taxed, the risk when it is taxed is that they will determine which rate applies so if they see this is adrafinil they might destroy it for some reason (normally they shouldn't but better dafe than sorry).

Also never use private transporters such as UPS, fedex, TNT, DHL, etc...
Why? Because if you buy outside the EU they will always submit your parcel to the taxes whatever the amount is, which means that the parcel will have to be identified.

Thanks for stating your concerns, I will answer as much as I can. 
 
Q: Concern 1: Heavy metals.
In the bodybuilding scene it is fairly well known that some supplements contain a dangerous amount of heavy metals. I am looking at the whey protein and vitamin powder. In the US supplements are taken out of the market for this but I don't know how it is in Europe. I think Europe is less strict than the US.

A: We use european RDA. All nutrients are a 100% or close to it. If they go over it they are well below safety limit. You can check them specifically on our website.

In Europe local governments check if their food companies apply to european standards. In Holland it is called the NVWA which translates to Dutch Food Authority. They check factories, like they checked ours, and have the ability to shut down, fine and/or demand upgrades/changes to everything that beholds the product. It ranges from hygienic protocols, labeling to the ingredients and their storage. 

they work top down. Large importers and production companies of whole foods have top priority. Making sure that the consumer production companies , companies like us, can only get their hands on ingredients that are considered save. They demand us to keep an administration of what whole foods and intermediate product goes in to which consumer package. So if something goes wrong with for example an importer that delivers a bad batch of soy, all packages that went to consumers can be recalled. 

Q: Estrogen.
The site lists soyflour as an ingredient. Soybeans increase estrogen levels.

A: Like skyrmion said there is a lot of conflicting information about that. I and my food technologist believe it is not a problem but we are obviously open for new information about that issue. You can reach him at pablo@joylent.eu if you have such info. 

Q: The shaker.
The site doesn't list the exact material but it looks plastic-ish to me. Like plastic water bottles it will probably release (toxic) chemicals. I suggest just getting an aluminium shaker.

A: Our shaker is BPA free and designed to safely consume food out of.

Q: How justified are these concerns?

A: It is healthy to be sceptical and have concerns.

Q: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxB_MRr-bM
They no longer use these but the fact that they once did makes it very questionable how much they care about health.

A: The truth is I never produced food on a large scale before Joylent. When I started I was just a visual artist mixing up my own recipe in my atelier and vlogging about it for the sake of experimentation. When it got in demand I did what I could to deliver and tried to be transparant about what goes in your bag, how it is mixed and what level of expertise I had. That is why I shot the video and mentioned my level of experience in the welcoming letter of all orders. When it grew one of the first people I hired was a food technologist to compensate for my lack of experience. I dit that to improve the product and the production because I care about both your and my health (I use Joylent myself for atleast one meal a day). We since then made progress and are now NVWA approved. You can see here how we are producing now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOf_5lkzptY&amp;feature=share

They checked our facility and had few demands about labeling and having a production room with a double locking system. We recently got a new warehouse (2000m2) in which we will build a top of the line production room. We are working on it as we speak and I will make a video to further explain. 

For now thanks for reading, I hope have taken away some of your concerns.

It does seem like we've had SOME successes... perhaps there have been fewer terror attacks than there would have been otherwise?  But that's extremely speculative... and it's hard to know what actions have reduced the number of terror attacks.

It seems almost indefensible to argue that the invasion of Iraq has reduced the amount of Islamic terror at all.  Look at some of the consequences:

1) it removed a brutal, but SECULAR dictator.  His only interests in ""terrorism"" were gassing the kurds and being brutal to any other political enemies he had.  He hated Islamist terrorists as much as anyone, since they represented a threat to his Baathist rule!

2) It killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, either by our own bombs and guns or by those of insurgents.  Obviously that is going to result in a ton of blowback.  

3) Estimates have it costing at LEAST $1.5 trillion.  For that amount of money... think of the kinds of public spending it could have gone to?  Obviously that has huge costs in human lives and standard of living.

You can get the 7 kWh battery for $3,500, and it comes with a 10 year warranty. 15 cents/kWh you store works out to 23,333 kWh usage over 10 years. That's an average load on the batteries of 266 watts or 6.38 kWh/day. Seems like a fair assessment.

However, if the difference between peak and off peak prices is 16 cents/kWh, you've saved yourself $233.33 over that 10 year lifespan. Every cent adds another $233.33.

However, the interesting thing isn't buying off peak and using the battery at peak hours. The interesting thing is using the battery to store the electricity your home solar cells are generating when you're at work and you have no need for it. At that point you **might** be selling it back to the utilities at 1 to 2 cents/kWh, but now you can store it and use it to power your house at night, when the sun isn't shining instead of buying the electricity from the utility.

And 15 cents/kWh is cheap once you start talking about European markets. I live in Denmark - private households pay something like $0.33/kWh when taxes etc. are paid. Now, obviously the price will be higher in Denmark than in the US. Assume it's 50% higher plus VAT (another 25%) and the price jumps from $0.15/kWh to $0.28/kWh.

________________

**Thoughts** | First of all, people can try and analyse this game based on both team's first matches, but you simply can't, or at least not accurately as you simply never dind NA teams playing AU teams; however, I will do my best.  

All right, here's a a game i'm really excited for. Immunity played some great cs today and Liquid well, didn't. Although I didnt get to watch the immunity game live, I watched bits of the VOD and was really impressed. To me, they clearly showed that they have prepared for this tourney, their teamwork was great (pop flashing eachother, crossfires, etc.) and they even out aimed NiP at times. Needless to say, I was impressed and am really looking forward to see how they do against Liquid. 

Liquid, Liquid, Liquid; I do like their lineup, and I think they could make a bid for top 2 NA this year, but after their performance vs Fnatic, they're not going anywhere internationally. It really looked like they put no effort in to preparing for playing EU teams at all. Granted, Cobblestone is a map rarely played in NA games so you can't expect too much from them, but they couldn't even do the basics. Map control, it was all Fnatic's all day long. Even on mirage, a map Liquid are used to, they gave Fnatic every bit of map control they wanted and Liquid only won rounds by out-aiming Fnatic once or twice (Nitro). They never once tried a fake, tried to split the defence, they just chose a site, pushed half way and got slaughtered by Fnatic. It is worth noting that Elige had an off day with just 10 frags across 2 maps, so if he turns on tomorrow, who knows how it'll go. 

Conclusion: 

1. It is really hard to accurately analyse this game as NA and AU teams never face each other 

2. Immunity look prepared and motivated to perform well here while Liquid look like a newly formed pug, no strats or ambition. 

3. Elige had an off day and mas as well have been non existent today, but he has the potential to have massive games.

4.  While liquid did bring some rounds quite close, their post-plant play was silver like, peeking when they didn't need to etc.  If they keep that up, they're gonna struggle.

In Germany, that's quite a statement to make, since virtually every newspaper and TV channel raves about Agenda 2010 and how fantastic everything is:

http://cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/CDP_06_14.pdf

Apart from that, the Agenda 2010 was formally announced by Schröder in 2003. Some stats:

2003: 47.0 million hours worked, 2009: 46.9 million hours worked, 2014: 49.8 million hours worked

2003: 24 million full-time jobs, 11.1 part-time jobs
2009: 22.9 million full-time jobs, 13.5 million part-time jobs
2014: 23.5 million full-time jobs, 14.8 million part-time jobs

Germany went from 35.1 million ""in employment"" to 38.3 million ""in employment"", while actually reducing the number of full-time jobs!

This of course also means:

Overall:
2003: 1339 hours per employee, 2009: 1289 hours per employee, 2014: 1302 hours per employee

Part-time:
2003: 613 hours per employee, 2009: 655 hours per employee, 2014: 693 hours per employee
...which means that the average part-time job is below 50% of the average FTJ.

Source: http://doku.iab.de/kurzber/2015/kb0415_Anhang.pdf

While there has been a slight increase in total hours of labour, increasing part-time jobs is not rocket science, but hey, it gets people out of these ugly unemployment figures. There has of course not been a wage increase that could make up for this effect (that would have been cool ;) ). 
By the way, the criteria to include somebody in the unemployment stats has also been changed: jobless people over the age of 58 years just don't count anymore, unemployed that are assigned to a private employment agency don't count anymore, and people that are put into a super-useful qualification and training program (in which guys with an IT degree are being taught how to switch on a computer ;) ) don't count, either. The ""real"" unemployment figures that don't include such trickery are still reported by the national employment agency, but don't make it to the headlines. They are about 600,000 higher than the doctored stats.

An often overlooked fact is the positive development of the worldwide economy as a whole that kicked in shortly after implementing the Agenda 2010, and that definitely must have had an impact on an export-driven economy like Germany. But a lot of people prefer to praise the ""reform effort"" instead. As a German citizen in Spain, I know that Germany is still better off than Southern Europe. But you know, all that glitters...

This is of course a collection of criticism against the Agenda 2010, not a completely neutral statement on it. But since I feel that the complete German media have gone jingoist about it, I figured that I might give you some facts and figures that are a bit harder to find than the usual ""Hoooray, reforms, reforms, bloody Greeks, look at how great we are"" stuff.

The US's job, both self appointed and because we're the only one nation strong enough, is to maintain the political Status Quo. To make sure each nation stays reasonably within its political power level. 

For example, right now Saudi Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen. Iran is trying to blockade a straight, every important to trade.

As well, the US maintains military alliances with dozens and dozens of countries. If you start a war with any of these nations, that means you are fighting America. The Military has to be ready to fight multiple wars at once. 

So if the US removes itself from its geopolitical position, there will be a power vacuum that no one country could fill. So expect a rise in regional tensions and possibly wars as the regional Powers push their boundaries of influence. Expect a more aggressive Russia and China. 

Europe would be forced to try to keep the balance, possibly federalizing the EU or at least creating a EU military to project power. This will not be popular with Europeans because of the cost but also because they will think it's neo-imperialism.

Ugh.

Jews are an ethnoreligious nation; someone who is born a Jew receives citizenship in that nation, just like how everyone whose first language is or historically was Arabic is part of the ethnolinguistic Arab nation. 

What is illogical about that? It doesn't fit into your post-Christian Western perspective, but you don't have a monopoly on meanings.

&gt;According to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism.[71] Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the Khazars), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.[citation needed] Thus, Boyarin has argued that ""Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.""[72]",,0,False,monotheist looking for a book or two,DebateReligion,cqvrcoq,,0,1,t5_2snuc,t3_34j1a7,t1_cqvrcoq,False,,1430539426

*If it's telecommutable, why only USA?*
If you're drivable to the Philly area, you can meet with staff in person regularly, a good thing. If you're outside that area, like I am (I'm in Idaho), then every once in a while you can come to the main office for a week or so for planning, on the company dime. If you're out of the country, everything goes too complex - telephone calls are more expensive, time-zones too different, getting you to the office is much more complicated, bank transfers, etc.

*How many hours are we talking here?*
If it works out right, it's mostly full time, though since you're a freelancer, you'll probably have other projects going on. The schedule is pretty flexible. Assume 30 hours per week at a very minimum.

It will be something like a three month agreement at first, because there are tons of things to learn, and it gives us a chance to see if we can all work together. If all is well, we'll extend it for longer. It's not a temporary/short job, it is ongoing....kinda ""no end in sight"".

*How much does it pay?*
Not a lot. Probably $20-$30 an hour, depending on what we have to outsource. For a real wizard, slightly more. (Nearness to Philly yields slightly more, as well.)

*Can you pay via PayPal?*
Probably not, no.

*Why is the job description so lame?* (More politely worded, but that was the general consensus.)
I'm a computer geek, not an HR manager. I'm searching for my own replacement. Our GM normally does this stuff, but if he did it, even with my description, we wouldn't end up with someone who could do what we need done. You can PM me to get the complete, very wordy job description. (However, I wrote that as well, so...lol.)

*Why did you post this on **Reddit?***
For other positions, including IT positions, I've watched our GM post to various other places - Craigslist, etc. A zillion people read those, and you end up with people who took a PHP class once, can do some HTML, and really need a job. Reddit has a lot of weird people, like me.

*The question nobody asked: What are you looking for?*
I need...a generalist. I need someone who just does what needs to be done to get the job done, even if it is non-standard - the appropriate technology is the one that works - while paying close enough attention to what they're doing that it can be edited by someone else later, and someone organized enough, to document that. I need someone who wants lots and lots of variety. (Remember how office work add=s used to say that? ""Lots of variety."" They should see our IT requirements. They know NOTHING about variety.) I need someone who can switch focus on a dime and think on their feet, as there are lots of simultaneous projects and tasks going on, both big and small. I want someone who lives to learn. (I meant to type ""loves"", typo'd, and decided ""lives"" works better.) And you'd get paid while you were learning.

I don't care about education. (To a certain extent, I don't even care that much about experience, provided you can code/think/plan at the drop of a hat.) I care about what you know, and how fast you can think. It's an *attitude* toward webdev/IT that I'm looking for. (At this point, you can probably see why I didn't try to post this on Monster or something.)

And, another important question nobody asked: What is the company like? We're a travel company, specializing in European Travel. We've been in business for 40 years. We were the very first certified B-corp. The roof of the office is covered with solar panels. A worm composter lives in the closet and the worms' birthday is on the company calendar. Profits go to support our foundation that supports economic independence among disadvantage populations and green projects. You get the idea. Great group. :)

Enlightenment failed because the people who thought it up where rational. The people they hung around where rational. So they made the assumption that everyone else is rational. Usually academics have never been in the real world or they look at things through rose tinted glasses. When one actually gets out in the real world they find out that maybe 3% of people are rational. 

As Taleb said, when big money is on the table mysteriously religion is never a problem. The best example of this is the canary wharf bailout in Britain. Back in the 1990s, Reichmans where doing a huge realestate project on Canary Wharf. He got screwed by the British government since they never built the roads/rail networks to the area like they promised. At the same time there was a realestate slump so he ran short of capital. All the banks refused to lend him money, everyone said the Reichman empire will got bust. 

Here is the interesting part. The Reichman family are devout Jews and have personally donated a lot of money to Isreal. Guess who bailed him out, Saudi Prince Al-Walid bin Talal bin Abdulaziz who happens to he a devout muslim, and possibly might have funded the 911 attacks. That is when you realize it is all a big shell game designed to keep people distracted from real issues.

Multiculturalism doesn't work because people do not make rational desicions. Racism is genetically programmed into people just like a fear of heights, fear of snakes and a fear of spiders. 

If you follow the white/black divide in USA originally it was used to ensure that white and black slaves would never unite. Follow it along to the 1960s. Again black/white differences where used to weaken and then break unions. 

For those that claim unions are leftist, well they must hate guilds that existed in Europe before the word union even existed. There where all sorts of guilds in London, some of them hundreds of years old. 

Studies have shown that trust is decreased when the person you are dealing with does not have the same looks or beliefs. This is regardless of one's political beliefs.

Part of the success of Chinese,Indians of the merchant class, Jews and Arabs of the merchant class is that under the surface they are exceptionally racist. So where ever they go, they look after each other's interests. The goal of the powers to be is to break these groups appart.

It is...  if you follow these article submissions and board topics over the years, this is a very clear trope.  Probably leads into gold or some other equally mediocre kind of investment.

The reality is that the IMF already has a separate reserve currency (Americans like to think *they're* the reserve currency for the world, but the reality is that they're only the ""reserve"" currency for certain types of oil trades) and that reserve currency is called a Special Drawing Right, of which the US dollar is a component, but it constitutes less than half of the basket of currencies.

The IMF is due to reevaluate the basket very soon (happens every 5 years) and the Chinese are desperately trying to be included.  Given Japan's fucked up finances, it's really only a matter of time before that happens (if not in this reevaluation within the next two).

[The Human-Powered, Giant Theme Park Playground: Ai Pioppi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQEc736GO4)^(Tom Scott | YouTube) ^\( ^(Apr 6, 2015) ^\)
&gt;In the foothills of the Dolomites, an hour or so north of Venice, lies Ai Pioppi, a restaurant that's home to an astonishing, giant, human-powered, kinetic-art theme park playground. It was designed and made by a man called Bruno over forty years, and it's free for folks who eat at the restaurant.

&gt;I'll be honest: I sort of thought it was a myth. The idea of unattended, huge kinetic ride-on sculptures was surely false? There was some evidence: a very artfully-shot documentary, and some shaky tourist footage, but I couldn't quite believe that something this potentially dangerous could still exist.

&gt;So on Easter weekend, when it was quiet, Paul (@cr3) and I took a road trip to try it. And it's real. It's very, very real. Watch as we try and take a somersault on the Bicycle of Death.

&gt;And if you don't take the right amount of caution, it can hurt you -- although my eventual injury didn't come through any rides, but just by tripping over by running!

&gt;AI PIOPPI: http://www.aipioppi.com/  
&gt;Opening hours vary, closed most weekdays and all winter, check before travelling  
&gt;Via VIII Armata, 76, Nervesa della Battaglia TV, Italy

&gt;Thank you so much to everyone at Ai Pioppi: I'm sorry for bleeding on your ride, and for pronouncing your restaurant's name terribly. Thanks to Paul, who drove me to the hospital; thanks to the doctors and nurses at Treviso Hospital, too. And Europeans: remember to take an EHIC card on holiday around Europe, so your healthcare travels with you. I didn't have to pay a penny or deal with travel insurance!

&gt;And more than that: if you do go, and I recommend you do if you're ever anywhere near it: TAKE CARE. Even when you're on an adrenaline high and you think you're invincible. I wasn't. You won't be either. Hospital visits in a foreign language aren't fun!

That goes for me too.  This place is great, but it's crazy.  No place I've ever been is perfect. 

&gt;shitty public transportation

That depends where you are.  If you are in one of the major US cities (Boston, New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, etc.), you have decent public transit options.  If you live were I do (central Florida), not so much.  In most places, especially like where I live, everything is just so spread out that public transit isn't very feasible.  Trains or buses would be too infrequent and your trip would likely take more time than if you were to just drive yourself.

Europe, in general, really wants people using public transit and off the roads, so they tax the hell out of licenses, cars, and fuel.  I really wish they didn't do that.  I hear this complaint from my German friends and colleagues all the time - they want to afford a better car, they want to go on road trips across Europe.  They want the freedom of going to the hardware store, and loading up a car or truck and taking those things home on their own.  Here in the US, the amount of money that I spend on transportation annually commuting to work and around town in my two, completely payed for vehicles (05 Chevy Colorado, 91 BMW 318iS) is probably less than or equal to what I would spend if I were living in Munich and had to get year round passes for the S-bahn. 

Personally, my biggest gripe about Europe's trains...they always quit running at night and leave me stranded on the wrong end of town after I've been out drinking with my friends and then I either have to walk 15km to get home across a city I'm only barely familiar with, in the dark no less, or take an expensive cab ride...seriously Europe, automate that shit so my drunk ass can get home!!

The truth is that your ancestors that came to America did not receive the same treatment that freed black slaves received.

I recommend reading Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon to learn a bit about the treatment of blacks in the south after slavery was ""officially ended""  

Also, Romanian slaves were not subject to the same treatment that black slaves (or even ""free blacks"") received from their slave masters and from American society as a whole.  The life of a Romanian slave is hardly comparable to the level of systematic oppression and violence that blacks in America had to endure.

Looking at the history of America, black people have only maybe a few decades of a fair degree of freedom and opportunity compared with white people.  Just because your ancestors were also slaves doesn't mean their history in this country is anything like that of African Americans.

Yes, TSM did well that tourney, but TSM performing once wont make NA a superior region.  
Yes NA did catch up, but I dont see NA being a stronger region than EU in any way.  
The only teams doing good are C9 and TSM, and both of them had their moments, but also tourneys were they got heavily outperformed.  
Remember season 3, when everyone said china sucks, they only fight all the time and have no good macro strats? The same is said about EU now.  
The analysts you are talking about are the ones that think every game that has 10 kills is a good game, and every game with more kills must be a bad game. They never think about the possibility that a game with less than 10 kills mustnt be a macro game, but might just be a game, where the teams didnt know how to take avantages or force objectives and just stood around a lot.  
TSM vs Fnatic will most likely be a lot closer than a lot of people expect, there might even be a stomp in Fnatics favor, since its a Bo1. Oh boy, will I enjoy if that happens.",,0,False,,leagueoflegends,cqvu6j4,,0,1,t5_2rfxx,t3_34jm8u,t1_cqvu6j4,False,gnar,1430547897

That system creates (enables/facilitates) the ability for women\* to be able to use government (and men collectively) as a herd of ""sugar-daddies"".  Ergo they can be ""bitches"" with virtually no negative consequences.

Cf: http://masculineprinciple.blogspot.ca/2015/03/the-fraud-of-modern-marriage.html

If you protest that places like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc are even more ""liberal-socialist"" than Canada, but that the women there are ""not as bad"", well I think *you need to do a bit more digging* as to what is ACTUALLY happening (the reality underneath the ""official"" glossy propaganda/mainstream media narrative\*\*) in those countries and to their social environment/demographics.

---

\* Nor does it ONLY affect women; there is an inverse effect on men as well; they essentially become ""slaves of the state"" -- and that has a psychological affect (emasculating and infantilizing) as well as a financial-impact effect -- it turns the majority of men into mangina/beta males, subservient &amp; obeisant to what essentially becomes a matriarchal ""nanny state"".

---

\*\* And puhlease, do not be so naive as to claim that just because there isn't some *overt* heavy-handed ""censorship"", that the press and the stories told in the media are therefore *unbiased* or anywhere near the ""full story"" -- people and societies are quite capable of collectively engaging in *passive* forms of ""censorship"", and there is a long history of such behavior that can be described by the commonly heard phrases like ""Well, we just *don't* talk about *THAT(!)* not in polite society."" or the sentiment of ""You don't/shouldn't air your dirty laundry in public."" and etc. ALL of those are forms of ""self-censorship"", and the populations of the western European nations are highly skilled at engaging in various types of this kind of three-monkey behaviors (i.e. """"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" -- aka pretend that it doesn't exist; don't look, don't listen, and most important *don't talk about it!*) -- and if you need proof, just consider the current ""pedophile scandal"" in Britain, or moreover the ""open secret"" about the buggery that used to (and may still) take place in British boarding schools (with exactly what prevalence *no one knows* for certain, but that it occurred fairly often there is plenty of evidence, mostly first hand {albeit often understated &amp; euphemistic} testimony).",,0,False,,MGTOW,cqvu9dl,,0,9,t5_2sjgc,t3_34l8fs,t1_cqvu9dl,False,,1430548179

I do not have any sexual issues to my knowledge, I just don't feel sensitive down there. Even if I don't masteurbate for weeks. Receiving head is pointless, I barely feel anything unless the girl knows what she is doing, and most don't. 

Talking to my unmutilated European friends there is a different opinion. They say that finishing quickly is not an issue and that they can go multiple times. I'm lucky to continue after two orgasms as my sensitivity is completely diminished. I have been reading that MGM is not always accurate, that some may lose sensitivity more than others and that it can come down to the doctors method at removing the foreskin. 

Anytime I bring this up to supporters they justify the barbaric practice for ""hygenic"" reasons. My European friends are horrified that it is a normal practice in America and they had stated that none of them ever had any issues in terms of infections or complications with their foreskin.

The decision-making consists of setting a strategic goal for yourself and doing stuff to achieve it. 

The examples of the goals are: get more land for yourself and build a solid personal demesne and a good army, become independent, take the place of your liege, change a succession law when you don't meet the requirements to do it, win a crusade, conquer the 3 neighboring kingdoms to create an empire, pacify your vassals so they won't revolt etc. The game doesn't hold your hand at all, you'll have to think of your own ""victory conditions"" and then other ones, once you've achieved those. 

And you take actions to achieve your goals: building wine cellars, starving out castles, burning churches, fabricating claims, committing suicide, seducing your sister, kicking the Jews out of your realm, cutting that blind Muslim dude’s balls off, assassinating your arbitrary dwarf 9 year old son who has the Down syndrome etc. You’ll have to find out what tools are at your disposal and how to use them. That will take time, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. 

I can’t really recommend any videos, just find a guy whose voice you like and who played a lot of CK2. And definitely start playing yourself. You could jump in and start playing as a leader of a huge empire, but the odds are that everything won’t be making a lot of sense to you and will just be too confusing to handle. Also, don’t play the suggested historical campaigns, they are also very confusing and that’s not where the fun is. I’d suggest starting as a duke or count, probably independent, with little or no vassals, close to people of a different religion to kill them later, and start building your empire from scratch, the complexity of your game will raise as your realm gets bigger. For me Aragon was a lot of fun as I fought the Muslims to take back Spain. I think it’s what the tutorial suggests you should play first. North-eastern Europe is always aa lot of fun as well.

If you fail terribly and your realm is taken from you, but it’s still not game over, never restart, it’s a huge part of fun. Stand up from your knees, retaliate, take your revenge.

Dick imagined it in The Man in the High Castle anyway. It isn't really clear how far Hitler was willing to take his expansion and if they managed to defeat the western allies it's possible they would only turn them into allied states and not annex them permanently. Russia would likely be divided between Germany and Japan though and most of asia would likely become part of Japan or a client state. Most of Africa would probably turn into a German/Italian playground and Jews, black people and homosexuals pretty much everywhere would be fucked. 

I'm pretty sure English would still be a widespread language but German would probably be enforced throughout Europe and western Asia.

Another interesting thing is that Speer and Hitler had pretty detailed plans on what to do with Berlin [after the victory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welthauptstadt_Germania).

As for the long term stability of that ""empire"" nobody really knows how long it would have lasted.

&gt;The __gross world product__ (__GWP__) is the combined [gross national product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product) of all the [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries) in the world. Because imports and exports balance exactly when considering the whole world, this also equals the total global [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product) (GDP).  In 2013, according to the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA)'s *[World Factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook)*, the GWP totalled approximately US$87.25 trillion in terms of [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP), and around US$74.31 trillion in nominal terms.  According to a separate estimate by the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank), the 2013 nominal GWP was approximately US$75.59 trillion.  The [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita) PPP GWP in 2013 was approximately US$13,100, according to the *World Factbook*.

0,t3_34kzuv,1430566515,idjet,109,1432728594,"There is a chance that your 'peasant' during the Carolingian period in southern France could have been a slave and not a free peasant, the odds depending on which historian's calculations you trust. By 1300 slavery had been extinguished in southern France, if not quite yet in the lands of their Spanish neighbours to the south. 

By 1300 the wide gulf between Carolingian slavedom and free peasantry had narrowed and became, in custom and in law, a rather single entity: the peasant in servitude. But opportunity had also become more diverse with the development of technology and commerce. Southern France's position on the Mediterranean, with several important ports extant from antiquity (Marseille, Narbonne), had meant that import/export businesses never died off. But the south enjoyed a growth of towns perhaps faster than most other places in Europe in the 11-13th centuries. These towns were either brand new creations founded by either secular or ecclesiastical lords (*bastide* or *salvetat*, respectively) or based on Roman *oppidium* that had endured as villages. The rapid rise of towns was due to the huge growth of agricultural output and of commercial development it spurred.

These changes which spurred the growth of towns were founded on the lives of peasants, lives which changed in the 500 years between Charlemagne and the assertion of Capetian dominance over the French south. New lands were put to cultivation by more productive technology like 3 field rotation which made the earth more productive, horse collars which could pull faster and stronger, mouldboard plows which could turn heavier soil deeper, animal husbandry which resulted in greater animal variation to suit greater productivity. 

Where the Carolingian peasant lived in earth and wood huts, 500 years later they could be living in stone houses; stone pulled from the fields by peasants' deeper, stronger plowing...or the cast offs of limestone mines for the castles and churches that sprang up across the south and which the peasants also built. It was a multitude of towns and castles and churches: some 200 new stone towns in the south sprang to life between 1100-1300. These towns drew in peasantry to work there in trades and industry, or to live behind the protection of walls and farm the fields beyond during the day. 

So commerce and industry developed on the innovations of peasantry during this period such that the physical, agricultural world would have looked different over half a millennia.

But what of the spiritual world of the peasant?

The peasant of the Carolingian period, whether slave or free person, would have been Christian in name and identity. But in practice? They would have rarely been in a church or rarely seen a priest as we would know them, or as their descendants 500 years later would know them. By 1200 the Church was on a steady march into the souls of all the population, and perhaps no more so than the souls (and pockets) of the southern French peasantry.

The question of discipline of the average Christian in thought and action became paramount for the Church after 1000. Attendance to mass, sacraments like baptism and confession became obligatory and enforced by the 13th century. Marriage became subject to the Church. The entire life of the agricultural peasant in 1300 would have been enveloped by the Church (how effectively is another question).

And to add to the greatly expanded influence of the cathedral and monastery, by 1300 thousands upon thousands of potential heretic peasants of southern France would have been disciplined - interviewed, approved and/or corrected - by the inquisition: from Toulouse to Narbonne, Montpellier to the deepest Pyrenees.

0,t3_34ktwh,1430564395,DotRoamer,13,1432728618,"I think the low numbers come from a couple of factors:

Not everyone uses Steam (I know, it's like not having an iTunes account, which incidentally, I don't)

The main point of a group would be to arrange MP games. Being a 'Patientgamer' (TM?) means that a lot of us don't play modern multiplayer games when they come out.

Patientgamers are (in some, not all cases) very economically aware of what they spend on games, and as such might seek other outlets to spend their money on, so there will be a schism in the user-base. With the new mod initiative from Valve, I imagine for older games and gamers, that divide will only increase.

I know I personally will consider buying games off Steam that are heavily mod-based if P2P mods becomes the norm - Kneejerk reaction from me, but they really got to put in a better effort to support the modders before they get me over on their side on this subject.

-------------------------------------------------------

    THAT SAID
There's some steps that can be taken to make it more attractive to be in the steam group, such as:

&gt;**A)** If there's an old game on sale with MP, but the MP scene is dead, it could deter some people. 
[Arrange game nights for older titles when on sale that are MP dependent (Natural Selection 2 f.ex.)](http://i.imgur.com/mJ55urs.jpg)

&gt;**B)** Integrated curator list/Forum!
[Game nights can be structured around re-releases (because we're patient) of particular games, with a forum thread going up a week or two in advance, listing discounts from other sites, patientgamer reddit thread links and much more.](http://i.imgur.com/raCpIYy.jpg)

&gt;**C)** Allowing users (with moderation and within reason) to schedule and arrange own game nights, following a standard template procedure, you'd be a community that can self-generate the content they want. This gives time for the admin of the group (should they wish to) to dedicate time for bigger events or even setting up month-long campaigns / whatever tickles your fancy.

C is very important in my experience, as it allows whoever has the ownership, to breathe once in a while and not have to worry about the day-to-day content.

&gt;**D)** Cross-group promotion/content.
Many subreddits also have Steam Communities, and it would not be impossible to arrange coop nights with them.

Imagine Arma III having gone on sale, which I'm sure is a game many PatientGamers would go for if given the chance, you'd have who knows how many people running around clueless due to the demanding nature of the game.

Contacting the Arma III subreddit to plan a game night for fun and introduction, with the help of people who have been in the game and game community, surely would be much more attractive to the audience than running around solo with an AI going off in your ear every 30 seconds 'ENEMY COMBATANT SPOTTED SOUTH EAST 3 CLICKS'. Thank you Microsoft Sam for that one.

&gt;**E)** We are all pretty spread out in the world. Not everyone is in the same timezone and for multiplayer, that really counts for a lot of the attractiveness. I know Reddit has a large American following, but you got to take into account that the US is 6-8 hours behind Europe, and OCE is 6-12 hours ahead, so there's a big disparity in terms of who's on when and what peak time is. That and latency. in RTS/Turn-based, latency does not count for much, but try playing Counter Strike with a 250ms lag.

-------------------------------------------------------

I have been a community manager for an online game for many years, and I've spent most of my teen/adult years in either some form of community/association management and group building.

Through that I've learned a couple of things about ventures like the steam group:

&gt;**1)** You'll get as much out of it, as you put into it. It's not a direct 1:1 ratio, but it's pretty damn close.

&gt;**2)** The community has to be self-sustainable. Real life always takes presidence over the virtual life (or should anyway) and you really don't know what will happen tomorrow.

If you look at the steam group and the internal activity, you can see that it grew stale and died because whoever took care of it no longer does so (not an accusation, just a fact)

Without the proper tools for the community to sustain itself or for someone to provide the tools to the community, these things have a habit of fading and dying real fast.

-------------------------------------------------------

In any event, I think you could get a lot out of it, if you took ownership (you being people in general and by ownership I mean initiative)

I've given this some thought as well, as to my own involvement and initiative, but I just don't have the time or desire to be honest. All of that energy goes into my work, but I'm open to give out advice if help is wanted.

- Despite this and before Pearl Harbor, the Lend-Lease set up gave Britain specifically $31.4 billion worth of supplies over the war that did not have to be paid back. This is after a Destroyers for Base Rights deal that sent about 40 Destroyers to Britain.
- Post war the US gave Britain a really good interest rate loan

Yes, they are registered in some manners under banking regulation and might be subjected to banking law; however this would appear to be a more strategic move than anything else. While the article at wiki would seem to indicate that it's flat out quacking like a bank/duck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal#regulation - reading some of the act would have you find that they are subject to specific conditions that would seem to be very specific to their practice - http://www.apra.gov.au/adi/Documents/cfdocs/PayPal-auth-and-conditions-2006.pdf . I would suggest that this is because they do not fall under any kind of specific ""digital"" law.

From the wiki - ""In 2007, PayPal Europe was granted a Luxembourg banking license, which, under European Union law, allows it to conduct banking business throughout the EU.[77] It is therefore regulated as a bank by Luxembourg's banking supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF).[78][79][80] All of the company's European accounts were transferred to PayPal's bank in Luxembourg in July 2007.[81] Prior to this move, PayPal had been registered in the United Kingdom as PayPal (Europe) Ltd, an entity which was licensed as an Electronic Money Issuer with the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA) from 2004. This ceased in 2007, when the company moved to Luxembourg.[82]""

This was a strategic move against google (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2808982/PayPal-becomes-a-bank-to-fight-off-Google.html); there will be a corporate/commercial reason for this - and I would hedge bets (without reviewing the acts/documentation fully) that they would be subjected to similar conditions of operations to that found in Australia. Might be wrong though, was at a Digital Security/Privacy Seminar recently with proponents from AU/EU government and it was very obvious that the EU operates very differently to the commonwealth... which might be why they moved from the UK to Luxembourg ;)

also suggest you watch this - http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=1036 (The founders of Paypal are often asked if they are a bank.  They are not a bank because they are not involved in fractional lending, nor are they backed by the Federal Reserve. Peter likens Paypal to a money market fund. )

I've shipped several items to Europe (but not the Netherlands yet), and am yet to have any issues.   
    
Packages are shipped with insurance, but thankfully I've not had to deal with anything damaged so far.  
  
Usually you will not be hit with any import fees, but I can't 100% promise you won't be.  
  
As for a quote for your items, here is my quote for without the CPU cooler. if you are paying with Google Wallet, the cost is $530 USD,  if Paypal then it is $543, both are plus an optional tip. It includes the cost of the items, the local sales tax, shipping, and paypal fee if paying paypal. Once I get the items in hand and get their actual weights, I can give a more accurate quote, I am estimating on the high side, so it likely will be a few dollars less.  
   
I don't believe shipping this combo with the cooler will be practical. If the weights listed on Amazon.com is to be believed for this combo, the package will be over 4 pounds, and will not be eligible for the fairly inexpensive First Class shipping, making you have to pay for the more expensive Priority International shipping.

""It is not broader by any definition. Rape is rape: you cannot just say it is broadened when it is the same of mostly men forcing themselves on a woman. Sweden is the biggest rape capital in Europe and NUMBER 3 IN THE WORLD. So please with that bullshit. ""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden
""Historically, rape has been defined as forced sexual intercourse initiated against a woman by one or several men, without her consent.[2] In recent years, several revisions to the definition of rape have been made in Swedish law,[3] to now not only include intercourse, but comparable sexual acts initiated against someone passive — incapable of giving consent — because they are in a vulnerable situation, such as a state of fear or unconsciousness.[4]""
There you go...

""In Germany they were shouting lewd remarks to german children. They have no social skills and regard us as vermin and whores for their taking. They don't even take care of the women and men beat up by immigrants. Not trying to find the perpetrators and if they do. ""Rehabilitate"" them and let them continue leeching off the government. 

Sources? Or you did you just make that up on the spot?

""If you are ignorant in ignoring these facts: then you are insulting every single victim in Sweden""

Uh, I'm pretty sure it's you ignoring the fact that Sweden has a much more broad definition of Rape, so you can try to blame it all on the immigrants.

""You have no respect for the victims and all I can say is you are an enabler here in our society""

You're ridiculous, when did I say I don't care about the victims? Of course immigrants are going to do crime, so did German, Irish, and the Italians when the flooded America. It should be up to the country to properly assimilate them.

If you go to Istanbul, see the Sultanahmet Mosque, see Kapalı Bazaar etc. I'm sure you can google places to visit in Turkey, I think that would be more useful since there are numerous sights in Turkey and which ones you'll go to depends on your personal preference and the time you'll spend at each city. However, definitely go to Epheusus in İzmir in my opinion. Going to İzmir is a must, I must say.

- The best beach in Turkey, in my opinion, is in Ilıca, Çeşme which is a district of İzmir. Çeşme is a great vacation place, it has lots of sun, beautiful beaches, lovely people and amazing environment. It is also a lot less crowded than Antalya. But Çeşme is somewhat expensive, so keep that in mind. 

- Gaziantep is fine, but I wouldn't personally spend my valuable time on Gaziantep. It is very pretty, don't get me wrong, and not dangerous, but other cities have a lot more to offer. I would call Şırnak a dangerous city as it has a huge Kurdish population that interacts with PKK as well as Syria and conflicts occur. Don't go to Hakkari either. Go to Eskişehir. See Van, for example, or Erzurum. Go to Trabzon. Definitely do go to Çanakkale. Go to Konya. But Gaziantep? Depending on what you're looking for, the typical tourist in my vision wouldn't prefer to go there over other cities. But of course, if you made your decision, I can tell you that Gaziantep is a safe city.

- That is a hard question. I don't think this should be a concern, but to be polite, I would say ""Lütfen"" after asking for something, it means ""please"" and locals would absolutely love it. It shows that you respect them and are a kind person. Also say ""Teşekkürler"", which is thanks. Oh, and also, this may sound irrelevant, but never put your thumb between your index and middle finger and close your fist. Google ""nah işareti"" and go to images to see what I mean. Some people just happen to do that without thinking, but it's a pretty bad insult in Turkish. People won't get mad at you or anything unless you shove it into their face, they'll get that you are a tourist, so you really, really shouldn't worry about this but I guess it is important to know.

- English is prevalently spoken in areas that take in a lot of tourism. Otherwise, I must admit that my fellow citizens are not very good at speaking English. Especially towards the extremity Eastern Turkey, don't expect the locals to know a word of English. However, in most cities you will be able to survive with English. Especially in cities like İzmir and İstanbul pretty much everyone has a basic understanding of English. But for example in Gaziantep, a very little number of people would be able to communicate with you in English.

- Westerns are of course welcome! Istanbul itself is more secular than Berlin, so don't worry. Most Western Turkish people take pride in calling themselves Westerners, you'll see that Western Turkey, especially İzmir, Eskişehir and İstanbul, is not much different than your typical European city in the sense that it has a very liberal society. You might not even be distinguished as a foreigner in these cities, unless you dress overly obviously like tourists with huge hiking bags and everything :P But don't get me wrong, Turkish people are very hospitable and love foreigners, do not expect any form of bad treatment. In that sense, I kid you not, I've never seen any other country that welcomes tourists this whole-heartedly, and I've traveled almost all of Europe and the Americas and a good portion of the Middle East.

I would like to wish you a great vacation, and please PM me if you have any other concerns!

* The Muslim should feel in his heart that he **hates** the kuffaar and the way they look and behave. **This hatred** will motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe, or people from a certain country, will hate to dress like them, especially if they are poor.

Do we get more inequality and suppression? It's the casino variant. We will gamble with our most precious values to find out if we can have a different flavor of Islam here.

It's nothing to do with how the officer feels, they may or may not feel terribly, but the question is are they permitted to continue their duties? Usually yes.

And it's not because the wood is coming from countries where forests aren't regrowing:

&gt; Developed temperate countries produce ~70% of industrial round wood, with Brazil, China, and India accounting for another 15%. North America is both the world’s major producer and exporter of industrial wood, producing 38% of the world’s production.

So about 70% of lumber comes from countries where forests are recovering.  It's not being exported from the undeveloped countries:

&gt; Tropical timbers are mainly produced and consumed within the tropical world. Temperate developed countries import modest amounts of African and South American timber. The Southeast Asia–Pacific region is the only large producer and exporter of tropical wood, with much flowing from Malaysia and Indonesia to the other Asian countries, including Japan and China, and also to the U.S. and Europe.

However, it makes sense to shift more world lumber production from temperate developed countries to tropical countries:

&gt; Logically, and other things being equal, trade from warmer, moister climates, where trees grow fast, to cooler or drier ones, where they grow slowly, decreases the global forest area harvested. For example, trade between U.S. regions encourages shifting round wood production to the South, where trees grow faster than in the North. From 1976 to 2001, harvest in the South rose 1.6% per year, much faster than the slow 0.3% per year rise in the North (3). The shift toward harvest in a region where density increases about twice as fast slowed the expansion of area to replace the growing stock by 17% or 3,100 kha.

So shifting more timber growth from places like the US to places like Malaysia and Indonesia will result in a net gain in forests worldwide.

If you read further on, the growth of tree farms is reducing the amount of lumber harvested from forest as a result of improved tree seed stock by plant breeders and increased density of farmed trees.  Current 2/3 of lumber comes from forests and, by 2050, only 1/4 of lumber is expected to come from forests.",,0,False,,todayilearned,cqw486y,,0,2,t5_2qqjc,t3_34kwdj,t1_cqw486y,False,,1430583364

You'll never get competent in time to start this time next year at a French university without working your ass off, full time, from now until you start. If you're dead set on studying in France, then take a year off (you're a year ahead anyway!) and take an intensive immersion course in France.

Some options for programs taught in english would be England, Scotland and Australia. Might be some other places in Europe that offer BAs taught in English, but France would NOT be one of them! Try googling some universities in Scandinavia, or possible the Netherlands or Germany if you want to go somewhere non-English speaking. If your life goal is to study in France, another option is to choose a school with a study abroad program where you can spend a year of your studies in France. Universities in the UK at least also have these programs, not just American schools, so you could possibly study in, say, England, study French there, and during your time there do one year or 6 months studying in France.

As for the application process to a foreign university, I applied to a university in Scotland, so I know that your first step is to apply (and yes you can apply before you graduate high school, same as in the US), then your acceptance is used as a basis for your student visa. Don't worry about visas until you get in, they probably have people there to help you with the technicalities once you get in. I think I would have had to pay some tuition fees. I didn't end up going there so I can't give specifics, this is based off memory, but as I recall it wasn't too pricey compared to the US system, and you can still take out American student loans. Wait until you get in to worry about housing, most schools will have housing for their students as they do in the US, if you hate it you can rent a flat in your 2nd year.",,0,False,,IWantOut,cqw4qsd,,0,1,t5_2r5hw,t3_34h54z,t1_cqw4qsd,False,,1430584415

By the summer of 1939, German factories were turning out only 30 heavy field howitzers per month.115 The manufacture of all kinds of ammunition was so limited that when war broke out in September, the army only had enough stockpiled for six weeks of combat. The air force had a three-month supply of light and medium bombs and no reserves of heavier calibers. Considering that most weapons are a means of delivering projectiles to a target, an insufficient store of ammunition decisively influences their effectiveness.
Hitler used the armed forces first as an instrument of diplomacy. He told General Erhard Milch in 1938, “No one asks about whether I have bombs or how much ammunition I have. All that matters is the number of airplanes and cannons.""116 During 1938, Germany produced less than one-sixth the munitions its plants would manufacture throughout the war year 1944.”


Doesn't sound like They were rearming at all. All of the European powers were aiming up at a much higher rate than Germany was during those years, which shows you who really was planning for war.

 
“Military commanders met with Hitler in November 1938 to discuss coordinating rearmament among the three principle service branches. One German military historian summarized, “The vague instructions as to how these as yet unspecified armaments objectives were to be realized over the next several years, do not suggest that Hitler at this time expected to be at war just three quarters of a year later.""121 Between September 1937 and February 1939, German firms holding arms contracts filled only 58.6 percent of the orders.122 During 1938, barely nine percent of German industry produced military wares.123 The amount increased as the war approached, reaching around 15 percent by the end of 1939, though some estimates are slightly higher. England by contrast, spent 15 percent of her budget on rearmament in 1935 and 38 percent during 1938.124 The economist Dr. Anja Bagel-Bohlen concluded that the Reich’s “arms production in reality never received unrestricted priority in the economy as it appeared.... The German industry was in no way prepared for an extended confrontation with the enemy’s industrial potential.""125”

It's like if Jean-Paul Sartre wrote the Divine Comedy. If you're like me and can't stay in one place doing one thing for more than a few months without feeling vaguely itchy, this book is a love letter to existentialistic wanderlust. My all-time favourite.

*Moravagine* by Blaise Cendrars. Take the above and have it written by The Joker. A chaotic evil serial killer/rapist whose name literally translates to ""death to vagina"" kidnaps his psychiatrist and travels the world funding revolutions, committing acts of terrorism, scamming everyone he meets, and killing those he has no use for. It's sort of like *American Psycho* in that the character is so comically evil that you can't help but like him. 

*Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson. I had always written off cyberpunk as the fetish porn of sci-fi, but then I found this in a Goodwill and gave it a try. On one hand it's an incredibly relevant look at the relationship between man and machine with a heavy focus on virtual reality, distributed networks, and biomechanical augmentation. If you like the world of 2015 and want to see endgames of our current horizon techs, it's fascinating. On the other hand, it's really a novel about linguistics and information dissemination and will completely change your relationship with information. 

*The Sea of Fertility*. A tetrology by Yukio Mishima. It's this massive epic spanning much of the 20th century in which a retired judge imagines the reincarnations of a childhood friend and tries to prevent their karmic fates. That spine-tingly frisson feeling that the internet goes apeshit for, you'll have that throughout the entire last book. One of the most nauseatingly beautiful things I've ever had the pleasure of reading. 

*Kyoko's House* by Yukio Mishima. There are a few unofficial translations of this floating around, but nothing that professionally takes it from Japanese to English. Mishima was a really introspective author and all his novels were more or less dissecting either his political views, sexuality, athletic fetishism, or view of the artist's role in society. This book takes four different elements of him and places them into four stories. The one about an actor named Osamu involved in a sado-masochistic murder-suicide is probably the most beautiful thing I've ever read and it's film adaptation in *Mishima* was just as amazing.

*Hunger* by Knut Hamsun. This is sort of like *Masochism: The Novel*. A modern day Diogenes travels around Oslo trying to survive as a writer. Really great insight into poverty and the survival instinct. 

*A Canticle for Leibowitz* by Walter Miller Jr. My favourite post-apocalyptic novel. After a cataclysmic nuclear war, the survivors turned on the scientists and intellectuals that they blamed for starting it. All the world's remaining literature is preserved by a monastic order of the Catholic Church which transcribes it through the centuries and tries to rebuild society from the scattered fragments of ancient knowledge. 

*The Shock of the New* by Robert Hughes. Non-fiction. It traces the history of art from 1870 expressionism to 1980 postmodernism and shows how major events have impacted the artistic consciousness of Europe and the USA. If you've ever wondered why people pay millions of dollars for paintings of squares and crude bulls, this book is like taking a lightning bolt to the head.
