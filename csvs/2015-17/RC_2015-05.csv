The retraction was over the fact that do to the small sample size of 10 rats per sex per group and 2 year duration of the study it was physically unable to draw meaning conclusion on either general toxicology or carcinogenicity. 
  
[The common protocol for sub chronic toxicity dictates 10 rats per sex per group for 13 weeks.](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-408-repeated-dose-90-day-oral-toxicity-study-in-rodents_9789264070707-en)

[Here is a study that modeled the effect on decreasing sample size of a carcinogenicity study](http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/~hahn/psfile/papyang.pdf)
  
[Relevant section showing the decrease in power from 50 rats per group down to 30.](http://i.imgur.com/MEhC8C8.png) This is in contrast to the 10 rats per group that Seralini decided to use for his study.


Seralini ran a bastardization between a sub chronic toxicity study and a carcinogenicity study, with using only 10 rats per sex per group and running it for 2 years.  
  
Also Seralini did not run any statistical analysis on mortality or tumor prevalence. His data, due to sample size and short duration was inadequate to determine if any of his observed effects were statitically significant.

The retraction was in line with COPE guidelines.  
  
  
&gt;[The COPE guidelines were consulted when making this decision. According to the COPE guidelines, “Journal editors should consider retracting a publication if… they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, either as a result of misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error).”(COPE, 2009). The retraction statement could have been clearer, and should have referred to the relevant COPE guidelines. The data are inconclusive, therefore the claim (ie, conclusion) that Roundup Ready maize NK603 and/or the Roundup herbicide have a link to cancer is unreliable. Dr. Séralini deserves the benefit of the doubt that this unreliable conclusion was reached in honest error.)](http://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/food-and-chemical-toxicology-editor-in-chief,-a.-wallace-hayes,-publishes-response-to-letters-to-the-editors#sthash.2el1IrEj.dpuf)

[Here is the original EFSA report that highlighted short comings and error in the 2012 Seralini study.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2986.htm)   
  
  
&gt;EFSA finds that the study as reported by Séralini et al. is of insufficient scientific quality for safety assessments. EFSA concludes that the currently available evidence does not impact on the ongoing re-evaluation of glyphosate and does not call for the reopening of the safety evaluations of maize NK603 and its related stacks.
 
  
[Here is Health Canada's response.](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/seralini-eng.php)  
  
  
&gt;Based on Health Canada and CFIA’s review of this information [the Seralini study], the authors’ conclusions concerning the long term safety of NK603 corn and glyphosate are not supported
  
[Food Standards Australia/New Zealand](http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/seralini/pages/default.aspx)  
  

  
&gt;On the basis of the many scientific deficiencies identified in the study, FSANZ does not accept the conclusions made by the authors [Seralini et al] and has therefore found no justification to reconsider the safety of NK603 corn

[High Council of Biotechnolgies conclusion.](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)
  

  &gt;Consequently, the HCB Scientific Committee considers that the paper offers no information supporting the existence of a health risk associated with consumption of maize NK603, whether or not treated with a Roundup® herbicide formulation. 

[ANSES Opinion](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2986ax1.pdf)

&gt;**Conclusion on study Results**
  
&gt;[The significant results obtained before correction are not biologically coherent overall. However, biological data on the results would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion. At this point in time, in light of the information provided in the publication, the ECEAG‟s experts consider that the authors‟ interpretations are not sufficiently corroborated by the study data. 
Moreover, during the hearing, the study‟s authors admitted that this study was not conclusive by itself and that, though subject to improvement, it had the merit of opening up an interesting line of research.

I like the idea of liberalism far over socialism, and want to retain that power. It's not to say that capitalism must have one flavour, but instead respond to the critiques given and improve upon itself. I largely find capitalism and business to more adaptive and responsive to new ideas. Where I have a problem with capitalism is when too much power gets concentrated into a few hands, as we're seeing in America now. Capitalism can and has cannibalized itself. 

For all the time that leftists spend looking to Europe for socialist inspiration, us moderates and conservatives should do the same. Rhine capitalism has been incredibly successful for Germany and stands as a beacon amongst the bankrupt welfare states.

ice caps melting, satelite data on temperatures, *el ninos* getting stronger, and stronger hurricanes because the oceans are hotter so there is more vapor in the air, and most importantly, basic chemical properties of carbon dioxide

scientific papers supporting the consensus are being made right now, faster than anyone can read, and its not spammy either, a paper could take whole day to be made, a whole week, and it costs money for these to be created

You cannot walk down Oxford st in London without gypsies harassing you or begging you for money every 100m.  

Begging on the tube has become way more common - one tactic I've seen them do is leave a pack of tissues on seats, with a note saying 'please help' etc, and guilt people into handing them money. 

There is a big DIY store near me that has Romas who speak hardly a word of English, stopping cars for work. They probably live 10 to a shared house and lowered the tone of the area. This happens all over London. It is accelerating the exodus of respectable people who do not wish to be around such unclean people. 

There are neighbourhoods in Ireland that have been very quickly harmed by an influx of just a few Roma families. A few Irish families got together and sent them packing, to the disdain of our frowning, head shaking liberal press who live far removed from the problem. 

This gypsy problem is hardly affecting places like Scotland or Wales, only big urban areas in England, but also other parts of Europe going by what I've read on /r/Europe, so remember that when people dismiss your claims. They haven't actually lived near anywhere near these gypsies and see preaching moral righteousness from a position of safety and relative comfort.

Now when I say we laugh at American religiosity, I was not joking. I have never gone out of my way to laugh at a religious person in person. That's disrespectful obviously. In discussions about America or religion do people bring up their religion? Yes. Do we laugh at the absurdity of it? Yes. It has been this was since I was very young and continues today even though I'm in my late 20s. The idea of someone being religious to the extent that they believe the bible is absurd to me and yes I do find that funny. I'm quite sure in many of the secular European countries you would find people agreeing with me. 

You say you've never encountered this? Probably because like I said, I wouldn't laugh at you in person for having a different belief. However if you came up to me and said,

"" I genuinely believe the Noah story"" 

Then I'm quite sure I would laugh. Not in an offensive way but it's just so absurd to me. 
Also perhaps you are Religious in a more spiritual way. Perhaps you don't take the bible literally and just follow the general morality principle of the texts. If this is the case generally it would be hard to tell you were religious. Unsurprisingly people who are religious in this regard are far less dogmatic and therefor it does not come up as much. 

In all honesty I would still find your faith unusual as I still have no friends or friends of friends who are religious. Nor family neither. And without being a nasty person, I would wonder how someone educated could see all the evidence and still come to the conclusion of a divine creator. So perhaps even deep down I might still chuckle.

Most aspects here, besides the huge amount of grinding to level up and get skill points, are what we in the NA/EU are used to and or desire and it's simple as that. The best outcome would be for a KR CBT3 or similar version for the west, but for arguments sake, let's assume we don't get that and we have the retarded AI mobs and everything else we currently have on the KR version just brought over.

This method is perfectly fine for those who want to mindlessly grind.

Sort of let my thoughts run a bit early in the morning - don't take this as an argumentative post or anything, I'm just opining on my general observations on what you were saying and my feelings about Putin, politics and the Morning Star.

That's fair enough on the EU stuff, I mean I don't agree with it but its just opinion about it and stuff etc.

&gt;  As for foreign policy I'm highly critical of the west and not a fan of the dictators either, but I am not a typical lets hate on Putin for breathing redditor, I like him for one reason and that's because he stifles some of the wests attempts to go being imperialists.

Putin *is* authoritarian and he *is* an imperialist, more so than the majority of the various Western leaders his foreign policy has become shifted against. There's been mistakes in EU/Western foreign policy with regards to Russia, particularly an over-enthusiastic expansion of NATO - but Putin's government has intentionally sabotaged its relationship with the West when it has deemed it in the strategic interest of his oligarchical state to do so, when on certain issues before it had been more than happy to accept Western actions that the far left would criticise.

There's a tendency among the far left in the West to look at Russia Today or something and take the Russian governments propaganda and their view of their role in the world at face value because it justifies their own view of their own side of the world (the West), and its been the same since the days of the USSR really. Russia has shown more obvious support for Palestine for longer and when people see that they're impressed - but then it sort of brushes over the fact that Putin supports brutal regimes that are otherwise isolated, as well as ones that the West has also been guilty of being too kind on, but he is not subject to the same pressure to withdraw from such ventures.  It rings kind of hollow that he's supposedly countering Western imperialism in Palestine (or what he calls Western imperialism when there is a growing divide between Israel and the West) when just a few miles away in Syria he helped Assad crush moderate resistance against his government from day one.

Sadly, the Morning Star is guilty of exactly the same thing and that is why it has backed up people who should be abhorred by most leftists. Unless I've misread something and Milosevic was a straight up guy and the Big Bad West was protecting...jihadists?

So while I understand *why* you might like Putin, I'd suggest you think carefully about what he really represents. He isn't an antidote to Western imperialism. He's an imperialist himself - and whatever mistakes the West have made, he doesn't check Western interests to stop them being imperialist, he does it because he has no respect for anybody who lacks any strength.

&gt; Honestly, the typical Brit voter doesn't even know what left wing means anymore and are being pushed towards UKIP's vileness because it's the only alternative to the mainstream they know.

I agree to an extent, but I think that the problem is there that it is a misunderstanding to believe that the reason people are going to UKIP is because there is no left wing alternative or none of them are left wing anymore. UKIP have attracted people who used to vote Labour, many of them - socially conservative, economically left wing traditional Labour voters who have switched to UKIP out of disillusionment, predominantly from the white working class in the coastal south east and east of England, and even in the north. However they're being pushed to UKIP because they are in poor economic conditions or perceive themselves to lack opportunity, and in a lot of the areas where UKIP have real support, UKIP offer them an alternative and a solution to what they think causes their problems, the EU and immigration being the two prime things. They're wrong of course, but what counts in the end is what the electorate thinks.

And this is the other problem - there IS other further left alternatives including the Greens who you support. However the simple truth is the Green Party do not broadly appeal to the working class as a whole. The Green party or other further left parties don't appeal to the small c conservative segment of the working class and they never will. The Green Party might have shifted left recently but they'll only become electorally relevant if they return to the centre-left and try to replace the Lib Dems. 

&gt; Ideologically I like anarcho-communism the best, it's a difficult thing to reach so I throw in pragmatism hence why im voting green this year, but the mainstream papers are way way further from my views than the morning star.

Then it makes sense that you read it - though of course ideally we should all aspire to try and read a lot of material on politics that doesn't always just conform to our viewpoint. The problem with the Morning Star that it is *so* biased on certain issues and less professional than any broadsheet that a lot of the time its just going to be feeding you confirmation bias and not always the truth. I mean christ, I popped on to it just now on the search term ""Russia"" out of curiosity to see what its come up with recently, and there was a headline suggesting NATO advisors had been deployed to Ukraine to help crush ""anti-fascists"".

Its the far left equivalent of the Daily Express calling the recent Russian bomber activity in the North Sea an act of war or something.

&gt; Oh and an extra point, there was some news about Castro a while back and the morning star told the news then gave background, whilst the metro gave the news and asked why he wasnt dead yet...

The Metro is a rag, what do you expect? You can probably find more sophisticated and accurate coverage of Casto in a more mainstream broadsheet or other news source than either the Metro or the MS. This is an assumption on my part I admit as I've not seen any MS material on Casto recently, but given their track record, I fear their portrayal of him won't be too nuanced. I'm sure their coverage of the positive aspects of his rule in Cuba are well covered as are his contributions to environmentalism and resistance to American interference, and that's great. However, are they as critical as one would hope about the numerous human rights abuses of his totalitarian rule, the exile of hordes of Cubans, his participation in aggressive Soviet imperialist battles with the US or even by itself in Africa and elimination of any sign of political opposition? I don't know, but I'm not confident on that. If you could link the article in question I'd love to see for myself.

Fun side story, former MS contributor George Galloway wrote a book on Castro which I had to handle in a charity shop once while volunteering there. Just an unrelated fact that popped into my head. As a student of history it was fairly easy to see early on what tosh it was. It had to be binned (or ""ragged"" as they call it) anyway as the spine was buggered, but I'm not sure it was a huge loss to the world. 

I also destroyed a book by David Irving. Sue me!

Of course fewer Europeans migrate to the US than in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or compared to Latin American countries today, but they still come and the net flows are still considerably in the US's favor.

There are 1.2 million German-born people living in the US, for example, versus only 150,000 American-born people living in Germany,^1 although the US has four times Germany's population, implying that the average German is 32 times more likely to move to the US than an American is to go in the other direction. 204,000 French migrants in the US compared to 42,000 Americans in France; the US's population is five times larger, implying that the average Frenchman is 25 times more likely to migrate to the other country.

Sweden and Norway? 15,000 Americans in each, compared to 54,000 Swedes and 36,000 Norwegians in the US. Sweden has 10 million people—the size of Los Angeles County—so there would have to be more than 450,000 Americans living there to match those going the other way on a per-capita basis. Etc., etc.

Although it does provide standards, make trade and movement of livestock easier and champions sustainability issues only a very small amount of the UK economy these days is based on agriculture, not even 1%. Compare that to net gainers like Romania which has something daft like 8% or France which is the agricultural powerhouse of the EU.

it's probably the area of the EU which is undergoing and still needs big reforms. It's slow progress.

The CFP *has* undergone reform recently which led to the scrapping of the well-intentioned but ultimately stupid 'quotas' system (where excess fish had to be dumped over board). Fishermen like to complain but I think they recognise that tough laws on sustainability is a better long-term solution for their job security. The main issue is more tied in with something called the Factortame case in the 90s where a British sovreign law which basically meant Spanish boats couldn't fish in waters surrounding the UK was directly repealed by the EU for the first time.

Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the Khazars), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.[citation needed] Thus, Boyarin has argued that ""Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.""[72]

because proving that someone isn't one of the smartest player in the world is harder than proving he is mediocre.  show me these clips where **consistently** he outplays european players and makes the right decisions on the grand stage.  show me rounds where he's put himself into a scenario where he should wiwn but only loses because he has ""subpar aim"".  show me the demo's where he's outplaying the internationally greatest players.  you cant, because they don't exist.  you're asking me to show you evidence?  i'm the one saying hes a good player, you're the one saying he's one of the smartest.  show me this evidence where he's smarter than everyone else because its not very easy to show that he's not the smartest player in the world.

&gt;I think you're confusing the team iBP and the individual players. Steel is a subpar aimer, and that's even according to himself. DaZed is a good aimer and an incredibly smart player. However, chemistry wise he is probably one of the worst players there are.

you've got to be kidding me.  NA is notorious for being aim heavy.  the stereotype has always been, even dating back to 1.6, is that we're ""dumb"".  that we ride the aim train and then get destroyed when we run into euro's that neutralize our aim. and becuase we're notoriously stupid and ill-prepared, we have nothing to fall back on.

&gt;And iBP played one major together with the lineup you're referring to, and no they didn't do very well. How you draw the instant conclusion that no individual players can thereby not be some of the smartest people in the scene just proves your flawed logic.

no because you clearly don't understand how much distance you get out of being a smart player.  you don't call yourself the ""smartest player"" and not make it out of groups.  what a fucking insult to what smart players and teams even are.  learning to aim, spray patters, practicing reaction time, that's the easy part.  there are players that will exceed others and its a great tool to have but getting smart at the game: and by that that i mean, watching demo's, knowing how to handle situations, knowing what you need to do as a team to give yourself the best possibility of winning a round, that's fucking hard.  if steel and dazed are these cs geniuses, smarter than anyone else, then they'd leverage their greatest tools(swag, azk and skadoodle) much more effectively, and they didn't.  instead they bitched and whined about how skadoodle never talked and how none of them were friends in mumble.  

&gt;Instead of just bashing on someone's knowledge, try to make a fact based argument of why Steel isn't one of the smartest players. And don't point to team results, that has little to do with how much an individual knows about the game.

your logic is just insane.  you've not heard what 99% of the rest of pro players have to say when it comes to smart play or breaking down a round.  you've heard what steel, dazed and whoever else is vocal has to say.  how you could draw any conclusion on who is smart and who isn't by anything besides what they do in-game shows an incredible amount of ignorance.  ive played this game for 15 fucking years.  ive played with people smarter than steel.  you have very little understanding of what the talent pool is like out there.  there are players out there that wont ever play at the level of a player like steel simply because they don't put in the time to DM or they don't just make the right connections and play with the right people.",,0,False,,GlobalOffensive,cqumoy3,,0,1,t5_2sqho,t3_34etr8,t1_cqumoy3,False,,1430448776

No one expected anything from Fnatic. Players, coaches, casters and fans all believed they would be a mid to lower tier team and would need a split to work on their teamwork. They came in and destroyed everyone and no one expected it. Rekkles was groomed by Fnatic from like 15 years old to be the best in the world and when all of the people you played with want to retire or reform a new team that may not make it into LCS at all this year it's completely understandable that Rekkles went for a different team instead.

If Fnatic had done poorly this split Rekkles would have been seen as dodging a bullet and making the right decision. But this split turned out much differently. Rekkles went to a team that is basically a ""we're all gonna try not to feed and do nothing and hope Froggen gets so fed he can carry us"" type of team where on Fnatic everyone contributed and he had a very aggressive support and jungler so he could afford his passive playstyle.

Fnatic won because they had a style that complimented every player. EL lost because it did not. 

Above all else, this is a job. He wants to win, he wants to go to worlds, he wants to play with and against the best. That is what matters to him and it is what should matter to every competative player.

He is running for President in the US and therefore how he would be perceived by the European electorate doesn't really matter here. It'd be the same as saying that all French politicians are radically Left when compared to the US. Is it true? Sure, but the US doesn't elect French politicians so the discussion itself is limiting in necessity.

It's be just like comparing Sanders to the leanings of Bismarck in the 1880s. Interesting? Sure. But ultimately a discussion not really relevant to the context of Sanders running.",,0,False,,politics,cqunyvi,,0,0,t5_2cneq,t3_34ebeb,t1_cqunyvi,False,,1430451032

Indirectly? Yes. Unlike the surface, the atmosphere is free to move north and south. As the equator heats up from all the direct sunlight there, air moves towards the poles to redistribute that heat. Air that was once moving with same angular momentum as the surface at the equator has now shifted closer to the poles, and thus closer to the axis of rotation. In order to conserve angular momentum, then, it must start rotating faster, like an ice skater pulling in his arms.

The ancient Huns in Attila's time would sometimes mix a bit of blood from their horses with milk as sort of last min/emergency rations if they had nothing else to eat... But that's it. And the Huns were most likely descending tribes from Mongolian Steppes, not Siberia. 

The Huns at the time, like the Mongols, were  a fairly large mix of various tribes that united under one banner, and had many different religions amongst their ranks. *Some* people claim to be able trace the lineage of the Szekelys back to one of those tribes, but the research here is fairly dodgy and come primarily from folk tales and legends as opposed to verifiable historical accounts. Frankly any number of people living in Central Europe today can probably have just as good a chance of tracing their lineage back to the Huns in some shape or form. 

The Szekelys *are*however a very old tribe that have lived in Transylvania and the Karpathians for a long time. Hungary was founded when 7 of the main tribal leaders/chieftains in the region decided to unite in 895. The Szekelys were one of these tribes. But even by this point, Christianity was starting to spread in the region, and Hungary (Szekelys and all other tribes included) officially became a Christian Nation around 995 under St.Stephen The First. Hungary's first king and one of it's biggest historial figures. 

In other words, your claim that ""many tribes still practice this today"" is bullshit. Pagan religions throughout Hungary and really most of Central Europe were wiped out by the 10th century, and Hungarians, Szekelys and other ethnic groups that identify as Hungarian have been self proclaimed Christians for over a millenia.

Source: I was born and grew up in Transylvania, and I am a Hungarian expat... oh and I also happen to be Szekely and I've studied Hungarian and Transylvanian history. 

I've never even *heard* of this blood drinking and ""Szekely Shaman"" nonsense. Not in historical accounts, not in folklore or legends or as part of an ancient culture we've left behind. Nevermind word of people practicing it *today*. Szekelys as a whole tend to be pretty devout Christians. Believe me, if there were Szekely Shaman's today (if they ever existed in the first place) drinking blood and practicing Shamanism 1) I'd definitely know about it. 2) They'd be locked in an institution. 

So you've either read some serious misinformation (at which point I'd like you to point me where you've heard/read/found this info) or just plain made shit up, for what reason I don't know.

Just because there are laws against Lèse-majesté in the Netherlands doesn't mean we should extradite Dutch citizens who mock the Dutch monarch.  The Charter guarantees civil rights to everybody in Canada, citizen or otherwise.  This means that we need to have some assurances that the jurisdiction they are going to operates under the rule of law and that the prosecution isn't unduly political, amongst other things.

Wikipedia sums up the problem pretty succinctly.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition

Common bars to extradition include:

 * Failure to fulfill dual criminality: generally the act for which extradition is sought must constitute a crime punishable by some minimum penalty in both the requesting and the requested states.
 * Political nature of the alleged crime: most countries refuse to extradite suspects of political crimes. See political offence exception.
 * Possibility of certain forms of punishment: some countries refuse extradition on grounds that the person, if extradited, may receive capital punishment or face torture. A few go as far as to cover all punishments that they themselves would not administer.
 * ***Death penalty: Many countries, such ... Canada ... will not allow extradition if the death penalty may be imposed on the suspect unless they are assured that the death sentence will not be passed or carried out.***
 * Torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: Many countries will not extradite if there is a risk that a requested person will be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In the case of Soering v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that it would violate Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights to extradite a person to the United States from the United Kingdom in a capital case. This was due to the harsh conditions on death row and the uncertain timescale within which the sentence would be executed.

*Emphasis mine*

People aren't any less deserving of civil rights just because they were born elsewhere or because they're *accused* of a crime.

So basically if we want to respect our own laws we need to protect everybody who is on Canadian soil or otherwise under our control as equally as is practical.  It shouldn't even be up for debate unless you want to amend the Constitution, but of course political factors always come in to play, so you may yet get your wish.",,0,False,Canada,canada,cquqlrb,,0,1,t5_2qh68,t3_34booi,t1_cquqlrb,False,CAN,1430456816

In the most recent episode of Hello Internet, you complained about the declining specificity of words, so I have no qualms with this short rant.

The words 'state', 'country', and 'nation' have certainly had long and troubled histories, but they really do have meanings that people tend to not pay attention to and this causes real misunderstandings which affect how people see the world.

'State' refers to primary political divisions. The United Kingdom is a state. China is a state. The Maldives is a state. There is a reason that the US Federal government has a Department of State which is primarily involved with interacting with states. The United States of America is a federation of states.

A 'country' is a nebulous term which refers to the European feudal system of lords gaining their titles from the lands they ruled. In this system, the divisions of the land were informed by geographic, ethnic, and historical boundaries. In a more modern context, a country is a geographic area with traditional socio-political identity. Scotland is a country, but it is not a state.

'Nation', which your video uses to describe the level of governance above 'states' is a term best used to describe a social identity which people assume. It is a word which has become confused with 'state' with the rise of the 'nation-state' where the state tries to forge a common identity among its population instead of as a collection of regional identities which had been the norm since soon after civilization. There are plenty of nations without states (e.g. US American Indian tribes, the Scots, Tamil nationalists in India).

The level of governance you described in your video is best described as 'federal' or 'the federation' or 'the union'. The USA is a federation of **states**.

0,t3_34gsh4,1430458251,BeABetterHumanBeing,3,1432708184,"I think about this sort of stuff a lot, and here are a few thoughts I've had:

* First off, *national* boundaries will likely always exist. A nation is a group of people with unifying culture. The modern version of a nation-state is a relatively recent invention, and works only by establishing states (which are fickle, impermanent things) around already existing nations. A single world-spanning state would have to encompass all the nations there are out there, so it could not reasonably be expected to resemble a nation-state. A loose (con)federation like the UN or EU would be more likely than the more closely held centralized government of any given well-established state. In general, a flexible governing structure would likely have greater popular support.

* Second, for the sake of stability it should probably have an opt-out. I'm reasoning that having such a place would be good since objectors to the way of things could always leave. Some landmass, a continent say, which would be explicitly outside of the global government. Em- and Immigration between the two would have to be pretty easy, otherwise it'd be defeating its purpose. The sensitive point would have to be being very sensitive to the formation of a us-vs-them political dynamic between the two.

* Third, some serious cosmopolitanism would be in order. Cosmopolitan = citizen of the world. As in, there'd need to be a very strong culture of belonging to humanity, in addition to whatever other group inclusions people may have (and mind you, identifying as e.g. French would still be a thing, but more in a cultural sense). So children would be taught world history in addition to the more conventional national history.

* Fourth, I think it'd mostly come about from a growing global class. The global class already exists; it's composed of people who don't identify strongly with a particular country, of people who may change countries for their convenience. That class has more in common with each other than they do with fellow compatriots in their nation. They have friends spread across the world, and travel regularly, and have non-localized careers. Arguably, they already live in a single world government, but one with very little authority. It's not what most people think of when they think of one world government, but I think it's the most accurate way of thinking of the rise. As the global class grows in size, influence, and geographic indifference, their worldview will start to approximate that of a single global state closer and closer. It may not even be necessary for an actual government to follow suit to get an equivalent world.

* Fifth, I imagine that eventually there'll be identity cards that take care of citizenship, credit cards, rewards programs, certifications, authorizations etc... A lot of people aren't going to like that idea, but it's so much more practical than the alternative. It'd probably be necessary for such a service to be managed by a paragovernment to make it (a) acceptable to the general public, and (b) to allow for strong protections against the government. What do I mean by strong protections? I mean that the government couldn't access private information without the citizen's consent, and withholding consent would have to protected by something similar to the fifth amendment.

* Six, a military will likely always exist, even if there weren't really any human 'enemies' per se. Their work would mostly involve things like disaster response. Actual peace would be enforced by economic interdependence, like it already is today.

* Seven, separatist / independence movements will always be a thing. Young, idealistic wannabe revolutionaries will always be a thing. 'Domestic' (Cosmic) terrorism will always be a thing. A liberal global government can handle the first pretty well, by allowing sections to nationalize without their necessarily moving outside of it. The latter two will fall under police-type matters, but will primarily be kept at bay only by good economic conditions; similarly to how it is today.

* Eight, the welfare structures we typically associate with goverment, like a basic income, education, and welfare are probably not going to be administered at the global level, at least not for a long time. I can only really see them unifying in response to arbitrage.

* Nine, I'd personally like to see something more of a task-oriented government, unlike the representative governments we have today. So rather than a person in theory having a representative in some global governing body, the body would assemble taskforces to address problems as they appear. Each taskforce may have representative structures within them, but in this form there wouldn't be a single legislative entity.

* Ten, it'd be easiest if it had a legal grammar, which would have to 'recognize' all laws. With a legal grammar, the laws of various sub-governments would interface cleanly (or at least deterministically) with each other. It'd specify things like the source of authority for a law, as well as the implementation details. With a legal grammar, you could actually relax restrictions on e.g. who gets to propose new legislation. It would also be more easily machine readable, which would allow for proper analysis and things like having a computer lawyer or legal aide.

That's off the top of my head, but there may be more later on. Sorry if it's vague and confusing; I'll clarify if you are confused by something.

* Eleven, I think it's worth noting that a good global government would be structured across several levels of granularity. E.g. similarly to how the US is organized across federal, state, and municipal levels. Different 'governences' would be handled at different levels, according to their need. The distinction is that rather than forcing everything onto only a set variety of levels, it'd make more sense for it to be organized across as many levels as would be needed. For example, watersheds would be organized into different water districts, and aquifer districts would administer different acquifers. The appropriate size for such districts is most obvious for natural resources than human resources.",,0,False,,InsightfulQuestions,cquqxu5,,0,3,t5_2smsq,t3_34gsh4,t1_cquqxu5,False,,1430457763

To clarify my earlier remark: I wasn't referring to the early stages of labor, but rather active labor. The issue is that on labor and delivery, you have a captive patient in extremis which can create power dynamic problems (appears to not be an issue in this case). Attempting to do a 'teach back' or synthesis by receiver (which would demonstrate that they a.) heard you and b.) understand what you said) is typically complicated by some combination of pain, medications, and other stimuli.

I do think I over-generalized in the prior post, as you pointed out.

FA is an European based A3 community (but we have a fair amount of North American players), that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 19.20 UK time (That's 13.20 for CST). And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

What's genuinely hilarious is that we've been living with them for centuries and i've been living with them for 28 years but somehow you still know better.

Do you have any idea about that concrete wall other than that it was erected? Do you know the blocks are city property, first of all? As they have many children, there were problems with them getting on the road and throwing rocks at cars or being in danger of getting hit by a car. (edit: some of) The very people (romas) living there said it's a good thing the wall is there. The wall is also not *encircling* the living area, it's mostly facing the road to which a part of the community is exposed.... you know like any any residential area. [edit2: To frame it however as if it's only protecting the roma comunity would be disingenuous, it's obviously there to keep it in check also and protect and provide some comfort for the rest of the population.]  

The president of the Ardeal (Ardeal=Transylvania) Roma Association said the following:

„Astăzi am fost la Baia Mare, la aşa zisul zid. Vă rog să mă credeţi cei care n-aţi fost la acest zid jur că aşa ceva n-am văzut în viaţa mea. O mizerie de nedescris atât în jurul blocurilor cât şi pe scări. Referitor la zid, este vorba de un gard din beton care era strict necesar pentru protecţia copiilor care trăiesc la aceste blocurii“,

""Today I've been to Baia Mare at the so-called wall. To the ones that haven't been to this wall, please believe me i haven't seen anything like this my whole life. There is undescribable garbage around the blocks and on the stair cases. About the wall, it's a concrete fence that was strictly necessary for the protection of the children living in these blocks""

The story is deeper than that but i'm not going to waste my time anymore.

There were problems with that community and it was addressed in a certain way. Is there some underlying racial bias, sure, but you first need to understand the situation.

Israel would go nuclear almost immediately. Without US/Europeans propping up their security, they'd be a sitting duck in any conventional warfare scenario. This is assuming that most surrounding countries would be attacking. They'd have to use nukes. I don't see how they'd survive any other way.

I think China would be the obvious new world power, though. Then the world would get a taste of life without white people. I don't think the Chinese would have the same ethical reservations about enslaving Africa again, or using their military might to control what remains of the middle East.

**On to the USA/Canada:**

North America would become an absolute shambles very quickly. There would be a huge battle to take the nice neighborhoods, beachfront properties, fancy stuff, and anything infrastructural.

Of course the infrastructure would fail within days. Food production would cease. Even the cheapest Mexican labor would be abandoning their farm jobs in an effort to take over the upper/middle class leavings. The economic chain would have been severed anyway, so there's no one to *buy* the food.

There would be a massive run on the grocery stores, and the chaos would lead anyone with access to food reserves/warehouses to hoard the assets they've inherited.

The Southwest would be overrun with an unstoppable wave of Mexicans fleeing their own government. The sheer number of guns/military equipment in this country would lead to massive fighting once the lines had been drawn between factions (likely racially drawn). Obviously blacks and Mexicans would be waging Civil War II within a few months. Blacks would probably be winning small skirmishes at first, but would be completely overrun by the sheer mass of Hispanics. The Mexicans would likely organize much faster, too.

In all truth, our cities and skyscrapers would probably be reduced to slums and run down megastructures within the first year. After a while, some kind of North Mexican government would form, and attempt to salvage what remains. It'd be rife with corruption, opportunism, and would likely lead to ongoing wars between warlords and their armies.

I'm guessing China would take advantage of this and move to take control of oil/mineral rich areas, as well as farmland. They'd likely subdue North America with a show of force, then push the Immigrants further south again. Blacks would be nothing but a smattering of stragglers at this point, and would offer no resistance at all.

**Europe:**

I think Europe would just fall immediately to China. I don't think the non-white population there would resist it. China would take over the cities, install small military outposts, and use the threat of force to quell any rebellion.

**The rest of the world**

I think India/Pakistan, would set aside their differences to present a unified *defensive* stance against China. Though I doubt they'd actively engage them in armed conflict. They'd probably try to negotiate a peace deal, but would be bullied into accepting China's broader world conquest as a given. I think that truce would remain volatile  for a very, very long time. But with so much up in the air, they'd hold on to it for self-preservation.

The acquisition of Russian, European, and American Nukes would be priority #1 for most countries - for use as bargaining chips. More likely than not, they wouldn't be easily reverse engineered, so most countries would just use them for posturing. China, India, Pakistan, and maybe some Middle Eastern countries could figure them out, though, but would more likely just be seeking the fissile materials.

South America would probably suffer major destabilization, but wouldn't engage other countries at all. I think they'd generally just try to continue as usual. None of them has the military power to win a war with a major country, but would provide enough of a threat to make invasion unlikely.

GMOs are not brand new. They are relatively new, but they depend on methods and functions that have been understood from prior research.

GMOs, especially modified plants, are not a complex system that gets thrown into disarray and then we have to figure out what the fuck is going on. Based on previous research, very specific parts of a plant are modified to create an expected change. Then they check if other changes have occurred, and once they understand the changes in the plant they have to show that these changes do not cause the plant to break the limits set by regulatory agencies on the contents of produce. Only then can they be certified for public consumption.

It's people who shoot down scientists based on fundamentally wrong concepts- like the founder of The Institute for Responsible Technology coming on the Daily Show and spewing bullshit like the claim that modifying the DNA of a potato can cause the human body to pick up that modification and then cause mutations in the human's DNA- that cause undeserved public backlash against scientific research.

As was proven with the decline of GMO research in Europe, this kind of treatment of scientists and organizations (that aren't as large and monolithic as Monsanto is) causes people to avoid this field and can make it more difficult for them to get funding.

If people think there are dangers to GMOs, they should learn the science and then propose and conduct research that would examine their hypotheses. Even if only for personal gain, a scientist actually proving dangers to GMOs would be hailed as an international hero and savior, so there is plenty of incentive in finding dangers, but as of yet, that has not fucking happened.

**One month ago**

Tomoko was well into her fifty's at this point, and it showed... Somewhat. She had streaks of grey running all throughout her hair, and a slightly wrinkled face. But her style of dress really hadn't changed since Hope knew her as a child. Still a plain suit, and bunned up hair. ""Uh, hey there, Doctor Sano..."" ""Hope, you're late as usual. Sit, I'd like to be out of here by five."" Tomoko replied, in her oddly toned accent. Her English was flawless, but you could still just about tell that the Japanese was still there, despite how much she tried to emulate well educated Americans in her speech. 

""So, what is it this time? You didn't mention in your call. Do you need more ginto capsules again? I'm sure I told you to just send an email for that sort of thing."" Stiffening up, Hope shuffled in her hard seat and looked about the office before continuing. ""Ah, well you see, it's not really that this time..."" ""Well, I highly doubt you're here for an interview. What was it Ianthe mentioned you were studying? Fine arts? I'm sure that's... Interesting"". Even Tomoko's version of small talk rubbed Hope the wrong way. Gritting her teeth and bearing it seemed to surface for now though. ""No... It's about the Quincy. I would talk to Neomi, but I know you know more than pretty much anyone alive about how we work. It all started with this man Aldbert I met, you see. He told me about all these cults in Europe, and Quincies with powers beyond reishi manipulation. I met one of them too. He said there were two Quincy gods. I've forgotten the names... but there's one that lives within all Quincy. He was good. And another who the cults are trying to revive..."" By the look on Tomoko's face, Hope could see she wasn't quite impressed by the whole 'gods' and 'cults' explanation. ""And so that's why I came to you. I remember Dad mentioning something like it in the past, and I was just wondering if you knew all about these extra 'powers' and you know, things like that"". Unsure of how Tomoko would take it, Hope shirked back into her seat, bracing herself for the reply. 

""Oh, that."" The doctor simply replied. ""That's quite simple really. What these mad men call 'gods' are really just advanced progressions of your ability to manipulate reishi. Without getting too technical, reishi is in everything, and it even forms the entirety of various universes. Most Quincy can harness the raw form, and use it as weapons. However, very few, such as your adoptive father, and indeed myself, are able to master it to a degree where we can manipulate specific elements, laws of physics, biological functions, or the form of reishi. I recall some fools giving it a letter of some kind, as was tradition in the years gone by. That's all. But I could have told you that over the phone, I do wonder why you felt the need to come see me in person. Having trouble controlling reishi as of late, Hope?"" When Tomoko made the correct assumption, it was like a sword through Hope's armor. But at least she'd gotten some answers out of it all. Now for the real favor.

""Yeah... I suppose. Well, not my normal powers, but- Well, it's easier to show you."" Holding her hand up to a pot plant she'd noticed earlier, a light green energy seemed to flow from Hope's fingertips, in rythm with the induced growth of the plant. The bamboo grew right up to the roof, only stopping once it reached the concrete and Hope lowered her hand. ""Plants just do *that* whenever I use tiny bits of reishi around them. I was sort of wondering, if, you know, you could help..."" Despite Hopes pleading look, her only answer was a resounding, ""Can't"". 

""These things are unique to each individual. It took me a decade and a PhD to understand mine. The only way you can get the hang of it would be experimentation. I'm afraid for a while it won't make sense, but as a starting point, it seems you can manipulate the growth of Eukaryotes in the plantae kingdom. Just think about how they grow, and what they can do. Maybe take a paper in Plant Biology"". Tomoko couldn't help but smirk at her own joke, but all Hope could do was sigh in dismay. She didn't know what she'd been expecting Tomoko to do. Maybe magically make it all easier. Suddenly give her the power to defend everyone? Who was she kidding. 

""Well, thank you, Doctor Sano. I appreciate it. Tell Ian I say hi."" She was just about at the door when Tomoko piped up from behind, in a slightly kinder tone than she'd welcomed Hope in with. ""I wish you the best with your work, Hope. This city needs more people like you in times like these. Sometimes I do feel for you kids having to take on our old problems, but I think you're doing a better job that most."" Without saying anything, Hope just smiled at Tomoko, the first time in her memory, then left to head back to her apartment. *""Come on Hope, if even the old 'meanest of meanies' can trust in you, then you have to as well""*.

**Three Weeks Ago**

""No, really, I'm fine Ian. Don't worry, Neomi, Sherner and Sam know, I'm done with my exams, I've got extra leave. This is just sometime I've got to do... Alright, talk again soon. Love ya!"" And with that, Hope ended the call and turned off her phone. She was pretty sure she was nearly out of charge too. A fact probably for the best really. With what Hope was doing, one less distraction was a god send.

After throwing the phone into her bag, Hope stood up from the dilapidated bench to look about her [new training grounds.](http://urbanomnibus.net/redux/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/NBI_TB-Winter.jpg). [North Brother Island](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1202/1579/4m/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/01/article-2094823-118CDD45000005DC-34_964x558.jpg) was a practical breeding ground for Hollows, deserted, and not too far from every where else. The perfect place to let loose and see what she could really do with this new control. It was a tricky place to get to, not so much because of the distance or the water, but really just because of how much Hope had to carry. With a tent, supplies and extra clothes, she’d decided it was easier to catch a quick ride to the island with a ferry service, then slip away from the small tourist group and wait till night. 

There was no doubt that the place was creepy, but really it just gave Hope an extra boost of adrenaline as she walked about the deserted buildings, looking for a place to start. “And I’ll make a man, out of you…” She mumbled away to the tune of Mulan’s soundtrack, not letting the setting diminish her mood at all. “Alright, time to get started.” After setting down all of her things, Hope got changed into her black combat trousers, boots and torso armor, then whipped out a katana in a spinning motion at her right side. In her left hand, she broke up ⅛ of a piece of Hollow bait and a roar instantly echoed across the place. 

---

**Present Day**

Dawn broke on Hope’s 21st day on the island, now an incredibly different place. Most of the buildings had been overgrown further, if not destroyed by expanding roots and vines in the structure. Fresh flowers and young trees dotted the whole camp site, a serine view, just blemished a bit by the new coat of Hollow blood washed across the ground. The beast was still twitching a bit from it’s impaled position in the air, a thick branch piecing it’s chest. Hope didn’t really seem to care in the slightest though, and finished off her last target of the night with one quick slash to the neck, finally letting it dissolve into nothing. 

“Whew… That was a busy one.” Exhausted from her training, Hope slumped back down into a tree stump and opened up her flask of tea. When she finally got to have the cup, it felt like all the night’s blood and grim was washed away. If only. Fighting giant monsters each night wasn’t the most forgiving of occupations. None of them were at the level of the ones she’d fought in the library, but with so many of them, anyone would be worn to the bone. 

Today was Hope’s last day on the Island. Her leave at the Little Light ran out soon, and she wanted to keep a couple of days spare in case she got sick. That being said, it probably wouldn’t be much longer before she got unlucky and met another strong Hollow. There had already been a few close calls in the nights. Her healing powers had really helped there. Would’ve been tricky to get to a hospital all the way out on the island. Tricker still to explain how she’d managed to get giant gashes in her arms and torso. 

After the tea, Hope went about packing up her things, switching her phone on when she finally found it at the bottom of her bag. 210 Messages. 17 Missed calls. “Ohhh, that’s probably not good…” She mumbled having inhaling through her teeth and sighing. “I hope they’re all okay. Might put off the ‘Bloom’ practice today.” Talking to herself had become a habit whilst alone. To amuse herself, she’d even made up small stories and scenarios to explain to few people she saw, building’s histories and what Hollows did in their spare time. So far her favorite was a tourist couple who were kitted out like old British biologists on a safari. Just thinking about that made her chuckle. “Ah, silly Mr and Mrs Jones. Right, packing.” Nearly done with putting everything away, Hope heard a rustle in one of the many large bushes she’d created and looked up to see what it might be.

#### Open to interaction from end point onwards. Any powered OC would be able to sense something out there, and get there easily if they wanted to investigate. Would be hard to tell it was Hope at first though. There would have been a lot of Hollow activity and reiatsu in that area.

If however you're playing a Defensive Hero, with a red shield on the card, your job is to hold off the enemies Minions, and Heroes.

The two roles comes with very different play styles, if you're on the Offensive you earn Leadership, and use that to upgrade Warcamps and place stronger Minion Cards in those Warcamps.
On Defense you earn Coin, and use it to build traps to better hold off enemy Minions.

There's a few Official Guides to help you get started, published both on the [European](http://board.omd.gameforge.com/board45-omd-unchained/board25-guide-and-tutorial/), and [North American](https://forums.orcsmustdie.com/categories/official-guides) Forum.


Then there's a few community created guides for different subjects. Since the game recently went through a major overhaul, only two guides have been written for the new version so far.
[One about the essential Trap called Barricade](http://board.omd.gameforge.com/board45-omd-unchained/board24-questions-answers/2896-in-depth-look-at-barricades/), in this guide you can learn a bit about creating so called Kill Boxes:


And one guide specifically written on [how to win against Bots](http://board.omd.gameforge.com/board45-omd-unchained/board24-questions-answers/2901-how-to-win-a-hard-co-op-match-quickly/), this was written for 2.0, and some changes were made to Bot games in 2.1, but the majority of the guide is still relevant: 



If you want to browse all the cards available in the game I've created a site where we collect all that sort of info, and I'm trying to make it as easy as possible to navigate. It's still in development however, so there's a few bugs here and there. 

http://atypicalneurons.com/

The best way to learn the game will however always be to join the Team Speak server(s), there's one for the North American community, and one for the European.

[On a per adult basis, taking account of spending on dependants, the cost of providing healthcare to Tier 1 and 2 migrant families is around a third lower than the cost of providing similar services to other families](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257236/impact-of-migration.pdf)

&gt;Eastern European migration is mainly to the three wealthiest EU nations, Germany, Britain and France.

[Probably. Arbitrage of wages and all that.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_labor_arbitrage)

&gt;Health tourism does cost £2.2billion per year.

In 2011-12, the NHS officially spent £33m on treating foreign nationals, £21m of which was recovered

&gt;We would have to build a house every 7 seconds to cope with net migration of 300k per year.

It'd need a house every 34 seconds by my mark. And that'd be if we assumed they each occupied a single house on their own.

&gt;Migrants need somewhere to live.

Well, yes

&gt;We can negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU if we leave.

Maybe, unless the large EU countries decide to punish us. Which politically would probably be a winner to paint us as the bad guy.

&gt;Having a referendum is democratic.

having a vote in parliament is also 'democratic'.

&gt;Their manifesto is the only one to have been independently audited.

&gt;They have sacked every UKIP member to have made a discriminatory slur.

Ha, no way that's true - every UKIP member reported in the press, maybe

&gt;Discriminatory slurs have happened in every political party, Green's included.

Probably

&gt; We could fun the NHS if we scrapped foreign aid.

Maybe. We could also fund the NHS if we cut pension spending by means testing, or military spending cuts, or changes to taxation.

&gt;There, is no disputing any of those.

**Clearly there is** 

&gt;Those Kurds that went to go fight in Kobane against ISIS to protect their kin would probably disagree with you.

Nonetheless, they aren't in a position to dictate our national policy regarding our citizens fighting in foreign wars. As I commented, there's a serious aftermath issue which we already struggle with for the trained regular army.

Our foreign policies will continue to allow factions like ISIS to be able to recruit. I cannot see how immigration can be blamed for it? Surely these people would join wherever they resided?

These people would not be in the UK if we'd have only let in people that had moderate religious views and shared our values. You don't get the children of secular liberals going off to join them. And we're making the same mistakes again: many of the Syrian and Iraqi immigrants we let in today will have kids going off to fight in the latest Middle Eastern War in 2035. 

&gt; I don't see how UKIP are more in a position to deal with the sexual abuse scandal more than anyone else? I certainly don't believe that nonsense regarding the Rochdale abuse that the police etc ""Didn't want to seem racist."" No, they fucked up and looked for a poor, poor excuse.

If you read the independent report into Rotherham, it's very clear that concern about appearing racist was a major issue. In one case, someone that raised the issue was sent on diversity training. Others were warned off looking into it further for reasons of ""community relations"". Go and read the Jay report yourself if you don't believe me. 

&gt; My main gripe with UKIP is not actually their immigration policy. I don't actually have strong opinions about it but what really, really annoys me is the absurd rhetoric that they are a ""party for the average bloke"" etc. that Farage seems to constantly push. They're not. Not even close. So he's trying to attract votes from working class/lower working class groups when in reality they would be shooting themselves in the foot by doing so.

That is your particular view because you presumably think left of centre economic views are what most helps working class groups. People like me disagree: we think what would most help people from these backgrounds are removing the pressures of immigration, making low skilled labour more scarce, reducing food bills by leaving the EU CAP, and bringing back more grammar schools.

It may or may not work well in other areas but again, ur standard of ""well"" may be different from others. Don't throw in more arguments like human rights. Legalizing any substance is and still currently viewed as not acceptable for most countries (you said so as well).

Okay, lets get into pointing out how your mix and match refuting my argument is bullshit shall we.  China is a military dictatorship in the guise of socialist capitalism, not a communist state regardless of what the claim.  Considering we are arguing the validity and morality of the death penalty, China's lack of respect for human rights is most certainly valid.  

Speaking of China, they have been regularly reducing the number of crimes punishable by death and they have also been consistently dropping the number of executions they conduct.  

My use of communism was to point out that *although* a system may look good in theory, the practical application is shit.  It was not to discuss whether communism has been successful anywhere or not.  SPOILER:  Communism has never worked in practice.  Not once.  Even Soviet Russia was never at any point in its existence a communism.  It was again a dictatorship that utilised socialist principles to govern the masses.

&gt;But whatever, u are again throwing new subjects in the discussion. 

Your difficulty at keeping up with the arguments presented and how they are all related is not really my problem.  I have offered to assist in you comprehending what I am saying and you chose to laugh that off.  If you cannot be polite and see that I was being genuine, itu salah kamu bukan salah aku.

&gt;You are confusing at most times

Again, not my problem.  I am speaking very concise and well structured English.  You wanted to get into this debate.  I agreed that Australia's policy towards drugs is not progressive and provided much evidence that prohibition does not work.

This was highlighted to show you that the Indonesian system instituting the death penalty for possession and trafficking of drugs is ridiculous, because there is a lot of evidence to show that prohibition of substances *in itself* is a stupid policy.

Now if you are talking my argument regarded *more progressive nations*, then yes, most of Europe and Australia are far more progressive than Indonesia both politically and legally.  The reasons for this are many and varied, as Indonesia is a complex nation.

&gt;That is in one fucking response dude. Be consistent, even when u lie, be consistent. Hehehhee

I provided you with extensive links and evidence resulting from thorough research that this is the case.  I am tired of being polite, so if you are too fucking stupid or too fucking blind to understand the facts placed in front of you, then you are one of the problems with this world.  Your ridiculous one eyed bullshit exacerbates conflict and social issues, and worst of all *you aren't even willing to learn!*. Grow up man.

&gt;What u are agreeing to is ""an eye for an eye"" principle.

See now you're being disingenuous again.  It is hypocritical of a government that is willing to execute foreign nationals to request clemency for it's own citizens.  I am not agreeing with an eye for an eye principle at all. 

I am *talking* about the hypocrisy of this act and the rightful calls of the nations that do not participate in this unjust practice for clemency of their own nationals.  No country has requested a pardon, they agree with the arrest and detention of their nationals, but they in principle do not agree with the death penalty. 

If 140+ nations do not practice the death penalty, it is the majority of the planet that disagrees with the death penalty.  So yes, nations that still implement capital punishment should be judged harshly and condemned for their actions. 

&gt;Is it unjust during the trial or the former issues?

This makes no sense.

&gt;U think i don't understand English? Lol...wow...as a so-called person who deals with legal matters regularly, I am truly disappointed at ur level of arguments and assumptions. What actually do u do if i may ask?

You may definitely not ask.  I assume as such because if you can understand English well enough to comprehend what I am telling you, you would not say half of the rubbish that you have been spouting.  Taking one out of context and willfully misrepresenting what they are trying to say is an indication of one clutching at straws.

If your language comprehension is *good* then you wouldn't be so ridiculous and hyperbolic with the rubbish that you're saying and trying to obfuscate the argument.

And ffs learn some basic Reddit formatting, such as quoting, so your the mess that you spew forth onto your keyboard is somewhat readable.

---

&gt;Steel loses strength when heated sufficiently. The *critical temperature* of a steel member is the temperature at which it cannot safely support its load. Building codes and structural engineering standard practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its [yield stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_stress) has been reduced to 60% of the room temperature yield stress.  In order to determine the fire resistance rating of a steel member, accepted calculations practice can be used,  or a [fire test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_test) can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), this is below 400 °C [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]. In [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000–1300 °F  (530-810 °C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the [fire-resistance rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-resistance_rating). Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of [fireproofing materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireproofing_materials), thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include [intumescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intumescent), endothermic and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral or high temperature insulation mineral wool blanket.

The rich Americans who have never actually had to work a day in their lives are pretty much disliked by Americans as well, especially those of us who have to work retail or customer service. Please don't let them represent us. 

Hostels and Americans really don't mix well. I've worked at a hostel in the US and we rarely allowed Americans to stay because of how much trouble they were. They were typically less than 10% of the hostel population (because hostels aren't really popular in the US outside of hippy areas on the West coast) yet somehow they would be 95% of the problem guests. We enforced a rule requiring Americans to show proof of international travel. The Americans who travel tend to be open-minded and culturally understanding. The Americans who have only lived in America are used to lots of personal space and tend to get into political arguments with international guests. Most of them only wanted to stay in hostels because they were too poor to stay in a hotel, and of course they would borrow money from other guests and steal their stuff. Working in a hostel definitely made me embarrassed to be American at times. 

However, overall Americans are genuinely nice in a way that not many other cultures are. The people who are really talkative and friendly are likely to actually care at least a little bit how your day actually was. Most Americans just don't have the money to travel in Europe and Asia and travel with in the US, so we don't have the international perspective someone living elsewhere might. Generally travel opens up people's eyes to the world, so the Americans who do get out and see the world, or at least those who take an interest in the rest of the world are good travelers and good people to talk to.

Probably. But not anytime soon. 

&gt;We shouldn't forget that Ukraine has excellent land for efficient agriculture, considerable natural resources and industry (including nuclear power, for example), access to sea, and a generally educated workforce. Its potential is heavily underused.

I agree, there is big potential for Ukraine in the future. But it won't happen soon, especially when Russia are determined to keep Ukraine out of the EU and NATO. This is going to be bad in the medium-long term. It will be long before Ukraine can grow steadily and stabily again. Uncertainty is very damaging for Ukraine's economy.

For starters, you can look at the [Metal Archives](http://www.metal-archives.com/lists/MT) page for Maltese bands. That being said, here are a couple of active names:

[Forsaken](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Forsaken/964) is probably the most famous of the bunch. They play an old school style of doom, and were pretty influential. You'll see the singer, Leo, at pretty much every metal gig ever.

[Nomad Son](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Nomad_Son/3540258067) was formed by Forsaken's bass player and fellow local figure Albert. They also play doom, with a more modern take, and they kick ass. Feel the [anvil of doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfeZRRy7IeU)

[Beheaded](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Beheaded/328) is an old school death metal band who enjoyed some degree of success abroad too. Its frontman, Frank, has numerous side projects that are more or less active in Malta too (Slit, It Came From the Desert...)

---

Those bands tour regularly in Europe, as you can see [here](http://www.last.fm/music/Forsaken/+events).

Another old, but still active band is [X-Vandals](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/X-Vandals/90192), playing mostly thrash/death with a bit of hardcore in it. Still gigging up and down the island.

Among the more recent bands, you'll find another herald of Maltese doom in the shape of [Oblique Visions](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Oblique_Visions/62800) (who started in the 90s but broke up, then got together again). 

You also have a couple of very local black metal bands of moderate talent, such as [Martyrium](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Martyrium/12396) or [Thy Legion](http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Thy_Legion/111995). 

--- 

In terms of events and venues, the highlight of the year is without a doubt the [Malta Doom Metal](http://maltadoom.com/mdm/), which hosts international bands and has brought legends like Manilla Road or Dark Quarterer to the island. 

The [Xtreme Metal Assault](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Xtreme-Metal-Assault/215440148496160) is another festival, a bit smaller and less stable than the MDM, run by Beheaded's frontman (I believe). Mostly concerns itself with death, thrash and black metal.

The best place for gigs used to be [V-Gen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Voice-of-a-Generation/122264074515636) when I was living there, but I don't see any recent activities on their pages.

In the States further strain is added as a culture that had been dominant starts to level off with the minority groups. Cultural clashes are bound to be much more likely here because the different groups are far more likely to interact.

Now, this isn't to say that segregation is the path to peace. Instead there needs to be a common cultural identity to develop among the groups that outweighs the old ones.

The US has been warned by countless world leaders, journalists, analysts and experts that our policies are benefiting and creating the very same terrorists we have sworn to destroy. 

That is an undeniable irrefutable fact.

The US is not supporting secular/moderate rebels according to the testimony of the FSA's southern commander:

[""The bits of the FSA that continue to oppose Nusra and the Islamic State blame the West for their loss of power. ‘The Syrian people will welcome any support if the West continues to abandon us,’ the FSA’s commander for southern Syria, Abu Fadi, told me in Jordan. Abu Fadi said that, contrary to reports in the US newspapers, he had received almost no American help. None of his men had been trained in the camps that supposedly exist in Jordan. No weapons had been handed over. ‘We have had some new boots and jackets,’ he said with a snort. ‘That’s all.’""](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/)

[The US had supposedly been training 'moderate' rebels in Jordan, why is it that the main opposition leader in the FSA is claiming otherwise? And let's not ask the Northern commander of the FSA because we already know he wants a government based on Islamic Law]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODxF4jOjCs) 

Additionally, a western diplomat makes the startling revelation that the vast majority of Syrian rebels are Islamist thugs:

""The official was his government’s main conduit to the Syrian rebels. I asked him what percentage of the rebels western countries could support: what percentage were not jihadis, not committing human rights abuses, looting or kidnapping — and were militarily effective?""

[""There was a silence. Finally, he said: ‘Thirty per cent.’ It was a devastating admission. Then he paused and said he had been considering only the first three criteria. Adding in military effectiveness, you would have to say the West could support only 10 per cent.""](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041901/assad-now-has-the-enemy-he-wants/)

Hassan Aboud of Soquor al-Sham and Abu Ayman of Ahrar al-Sham, another Islamist group, said that whoever was vetting which groups receive the weapons was doing an inadequate job.

[“There are fake Free Syrian Army brigades claiming to be revolutionaries, and when they get the weapons they sell them in trade,” Mr. Aboud said](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)

These numbers however may be a good guide to the number of loanwords that have gained significant standing in the language (as opposed to bring used as a fad).

Africa has an abundant land mass with quite favorable conditions in many countries this led to a more spread out tribal living situation. Once Europe divided up Africa  these new countries became formed of many different groups with different languages, customs, and had bitter rivalries in the past. Colonial rule dominated them by largely exporting their resources and in some cases such as the Belgian Congo had a very repressive rule. When WWII was over most European countries were pressured to give up their colonies. They did so but did not prepare the African countries for governing themselves. The British colonies did a bit better than the rest but most of the others just left taking all of the leadership with them. This led to many of the new governments collapse some even within weeks. Power struggles, corruption, and outside influence ravaged the countries for decades to come. Billions of aid was dumped into the nations but it was either misspent or stolen by the corrupt governments. In some ways they have suffered from a ""resource curse"" which led more developed nations to exploit them. Some nations are on the rise these days however. Botswana has the highest GDP largely because of their massive diamond mines and Ghana is second due to the gasoline. However, it is hard to develop or produce exports there because there is very little infrastructure.

Because of the water quality in the wells, most of the children that lived in it had a parasite of some type.  Allergies were nearly unheard of. The WHO came in and administered anti-parasite pills to the children, their parasites died, and many of them started presenting with allergies.

Scientists started doing research on this and found out that intestinal parasites suppress allergies in most people.  Also, a ridiculous number, like 70% or something, of people in rural areas drinking out of wells have a parasite and don't know it. Doctors in the US are trying parasite therapy on some people in the US who have terrible, deathly allergies.

There are some utter, utter pricks on that sub. But freedom of speech is so very precious (to me anyway, if not you). The ludicrously heavy-handed moderation of /r/europe (which something tells me you don't condemn) was always going to lead to a sub like /r/european, which has a wide range of views, some perfectly moderate, hence I have no problem with it being ""promoted"" in the sidebar. This does not in any way ""prove"" anything about UKIP (much as you might want it to), or even the mods who are common to this sub and /r/european (perhaps you should judge them by their actual posts instead? You people can stalk /u/erowidtrance and downvote him because he disagrees with you, but can you point out any post of his which is actually extreme?)

You can't expect reasonable or thinking people to be happy with a Muslim mod going round banning anyone from /r/europe who dares to criticise ""The Religion of Peace"" (even if they've only done so on other subs). For goodness' sake, even *whole threads* are removed from /r/europe if they get enough ""racist"" comments, meaning that any intolerant leftist (no such thing of course) can get any thread removed by signing up with a new account and posting ""racism"" (anything the mods disagree with).

/r/european makes it quite clear that it's a free speech sub. Anyone can go there and challenge what people have written. IMO it does one good to read rebuttals to what ""everyone knows"" and make sure that one's position is on firm ground.

And if you really hate /r/european that much, simply because loonies who want to kill the Jews/blacks/gays are allowed to post there (along with others who are not loonies), then I have the perfect solution for you: *don't read it*.

I figure that non-muslims probably have a problem with the idea of justified killing (fatwahs) in the first place.   Killing based on religion is a big trigger here in the United States.  I don't really think anyone paid atheists any attention until the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  That's when ""atheist hero"" Christopher Hitchens got involved in debating theology and religion.  That attack did far more harm than most realize actually.

But I am sure that Muslims feel their position makes total sense.  Yes, fatwah is sometimes necessary, but just because ISIS is misusing it doesn't mean it is bad.

I suppose the old addage is ""a few bad apples spoiling the bunch"" but in this case the bunch is people that thing sometimes fatwahs are ok.  It's kinda like how the Jews were, but no longer are.

&gt;
Also, the second Gulf war ended (according to the U.S., but ISIS would argue that the war is ongoing because the government implemented after the war is just a front for the U.S.), so anybody declaring war based upon the U.S. involvement would be going against the Quran. Where do you stand on this issue? do you consider the war to have ended or not?

There is no ending to the war.  As long as the United States has active military personnel engaging in combatants in a foriegn land, we are at war.  But as I said, there is no ending it.  America is now the world police, largely because we are physically seperated by an ocean.  The rest of Europe knows proper behavior because these countries are their neighbors.  The US, my people, don't.

It's like whenever you get in a back forth arm punching competition with your buddy.  Any hit on them will hurt you back?  Well, America is a one way punching machine.  We are a boxing glove on an extending arm.

Absolutely.

&gt; But that's not going to happen

It really could, Africa's situation can (should, I would argue) be viewed as an opportunity - most of their cities are a blank slate that can use the best technology the world has to offer to become truly modern and efficient places.  They can be designed so that public transportation is widely used, perhaps to the point where most citizens won't even need cars.  People can live in high-rises that contain shops and restaurants to accommodate them, eliminating the wasteful sprawl seen in places like the US.  

Of course this will take a lot of money, but I think it can be paid for by improving the environmental and labor laws in these poor African countries - if international corporations had to pay workers a minimum wage comparable to that in the US or EU, imagine the massive increase in taxes the government would receive.  Also, increasing environmental regulations (and fines for violating them) would provide even more funds.  Though another important part of this is to somehow remove a lot of the rampant corruption in African politics.  ",,0,False,,worldnews,cqv0k8t,,0,1,t5_2qh13,t3_34gan3,t1_cqv0k8t,False,,1430490301

It's kind of circular in this case, they already knew she was a muslim, so that's their ""proof"".  


&gt;IMO, it's exactly the same as policing what women wear in the U.S. They're just conveniently using an existing law.

But they're not policing what *women* wear, it just happens to be a muslim girl in this case.  There's a reason you can't find other cases of non muslim girls being sent home for wearing long skirts, but can find this incident recurring for muslim girls. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32510606 

&gt;Eight Muslim students were told to change by their school in Montpellier when they arrived in long skirts last month, local media say.

By 1982, Chelsea had played five seasons in Europe, starting with the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1958. They would actually have been the first English team to enter Europe, had Football League secretary Alan Hardaker not pressurised the club into withdrawing from the European Cup in 1955. City, meanwhile, had played seven European seasons by the time Villa won the European Cup, their first in 1968. So far from Chelsea and City being newcomers to Europe, they were among this country’s first entrants and champions. Still, presumptuous errors like that can happen if all you know is modern football and all you listen to are stupid chants about clubs having no history. Mr Gofar probably doesn’t even realise that City and Chelsea both won European competitions before Liverpool lifted the UEFA Cup in 1973. Maybe he should ask his dad. Until next time.

http://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/34cq1b/the_facts_as_we_currently_know_them_about_the/

Every so often an article gets posted here about the state of these devices. These often end up being quite heated arguments between groups of people (on all sides) that are working with partial information, are conflating speculation with what we know, and that misunderstand what scientists are actually looking at.

So, because this will continue to be a hot topic, and because Eagleworks will be conducting more experiments in full vacuums soon, I wanted to collect what information has actually been revealed, not what has been speculated in sensationalist articles, echo chambers, and comment sections.

Let me be clear, although I described the news articles as sensationalist, the facts as we currently know them are ALSO quite sensational.

**EmDrive vs. Cannae Drive**

The EmDrive and the Cannae Drive are two different things. They were independently invented by two people. The EmDrive was invented by Roger J. Shawyer, a British aerospace engineer who has a background in defense work as well as experience as a consultant on the Galileo project (a European version of the GPS system).

The Cannae Drive was invented by Guido P. Fetta and was formerly known as the Q-Drive.

They both are claimed to use a specially shaped cavity, with constricted openings, and operate by using some form of electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum to generate a directional force. The EmDrive is claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity and the shape of the opening, while the Cannae drive was claimed to receive its force from the shape of the cavity, opening, and from specially shaped ""slots"" on the inside of the cavity.

The EmDrive has been tested in a laboratory twice independently (once by a team at the China Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in Xi'an, and once by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center), under different conditions and setups, while the Cannae Drive has only been independently tested once by Eagleworks.

Although they are independently invented, and different in shape, and the inventors claim different effects are the cause of the resulting force, because of their similarities in concept and mode of operation, as well as the particular method of interacting with the microwaves, it is likely that if they work they operate on the same principle regardless of what the inventors claim.

**The Inventors Claims**

Both inventors claim that their devices do not actually violate any physics, and instead take advantage of very particular but speculative aspects of existing physics. It is important to note that while both theories are being tested, Eagleworks is testing whether or not the devices work as a SEPARATE thing from why they work.

Shawyer claims that the EmDrive works only on radiation pressure. Light is both wave-like and particle-like. Though it has no mass, it does have momentum, and the fact that light exerts a very small force on the objects it interacts with is well documented.

Shawyer claims that the pressure exerted by light is a result of the group velocity of the wave, not the singular velocity of the the photon that interacts. He then uses this to contend that radiation pressure is actually a Lorentz force. As scientists understand it now, the momentum of a photon is related to phase velocity, while group velocity measures the propagation of information.

Fetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias in the quantum vacuum and pushes against it. Basically, physicists think that at very, very small scales, much smaller than atoms or even protons, space bubbles with quantum fluctuations. This bubbling is represented in the math as sort of imaginary particles that are spawned in pairs, and then very, very quickly the pairs come back together and destroy each other. Fetta contends that the Cannae Drive creates a bias where some of these particles never come back together, and then ""pushes"" against them.

**Cannae Tests So Far**

The only independent (not conducted by the inventor, the inventor's company, or by labs hired by the inventor) tests of the Cannae Drive that I can verify have been done by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center.

They performed three tests:

The device as the inventor designed it.

The device as the inventor designed it without the slotting that the inventor claimed was critical. (Called the ""null test"".)

A control test that used the same energy, but without the cavity present in the design.
The results of these tests were as follows:

Approximately 25 micronewtons of thrust at 50 Watts.

The same results as test #1, showing that at the very least, the slotting provided no benefit or detriment to the effect happening.
No measurable thrust.

For each of these tests they use a torsion pendulum which could measure thrust down to about 10 micronewtons or so. They also ran the test multiple times. In addition, they ran the test in two directions, making sure that the directional thrust changed with the direction of the device (to attempt to eliminate the possibility of noise or instrumentation error). The Cannae Drive passed these test, and the control test showed it was unlikely (although not impossible) to be a heating or air current effect.

The confusion over the naming of the ""null test"" however led many people to think that NASA reported the same thrust in the control test. This was not the case. The fact that the null test showed only that the inventor's ideas for why thrust was being measured were incomplete or wrong, but it is certain that thrust was measured. That still does not eliminate other factors in measurement or the test setup that might have accounted for the measured thrust, although the control test does make the list smaller.

The ""null test"" also was only performed on the Cannae Drive, and has no bearing on the EmDrive tests, as the EmDrive has no such features which might have be tested in this way, which has been another point of confusion among many people.

**EmDrive Tests**

The following independent tests have been performed for the EmDrive.
A test at 2500 W of power during which a thrust of 750 millinewtons was measured by a 

Chinese team at the Chinese Northwestern Polytechnical University.
A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~760 Torr of pressure. (Summer 2014)
A test at 50 W of power during which a thrust of 50 micronewtons was measured by Eagleworks at the Johnson Space Center at ~5.0×10−6 torr or pressure. (Early 2015)
A test at 50 W of power during which an interferometer (a modified Michelson device) was used to measure the stretching and compressing of spacetime within the device, which produced initial results that were consistent with an Alcubierre drive fluctuation.
All these tests were conducted with a control device that did not produce thrust.

**UPDATED**

NOTE: a better source was found for the Chinese results, and I have changed this section to reflect that.

Test #1 was conducted at the direction of lead researcher Juan Yang. She tested the device at several power levels and frequencies using the same equipment used to test Ion Drives. The given result above was the largest result produced. Her team estimated that the total measurement error was less than 12%. Source 1[1] | Source 2[2]
Tests number 2 and 3 were performed multiple times, changing direction of the device and observing a corresponding change in the direction of force.

Test #4 was performed, essentially, on a whim by the research team as they were bouncing ideas off each other, and was entirely unexpected. They are extremely hesitant to draw any conclusions based on test #4, although they certainly found it interesting.

The lack of funding is related to how outlandish the claims are to those who understand physics very well, and the lack of adequate explanation on the math behind the devices from the inventors.
Criticism

There has also been much criticism over not testing in a vacuum, (although they have since tested the device at approximately 5.0x10-6 torr pressure and achieved identical results), while others have claimed the team did not account for the Earth's magnetic field.

I can't find any definitive accounts that the team accounted for Earth's magnetic field, but many find it hard to believe that they would be putting so much effort into these tests without accounting for something that is so easy to account for.

Others have criticized the measurement devices, specifically that so little force was measured. While the measured thrust was over 5 times the sensitivity limits of the torsion pendulum, with such small forces it is much easier for some sort of noise or other factor to appear to be thrust.

Relatedly, some have claimed that tests at such small power are useless. The main reason the tests were conducted at such low wattage have to do with the hardware that was available to test with, and Eagleworks is planning on conducting a higher power test sometime this year.

Some have questioned why no companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, or SpaceX have attempted to investigate the device, but regardless of how likely these companies find the results so far, the largest reason is almost surely that the devices are both patented by their inventors.

Most however have criticized the tests based on the fact that there is no explanation for such results, and that they apparently contradict known laws of physics. 

**What's Next**

Following the positive results last year and early this year, Eagleworks have been able to dedicate more and better hardware to the experiment. They plan to conduct the experiment with more controls at higher power this year

Towards the end of my period, large-scale and inter-regional dynastic warfare became more common as regional powers fought to assert their political hegemony, but on a local level, the low-scale conflict that I describe below continued to be fought.

Medieval Irish society was in fact less like the stereotypical picture of a 'feudal' society but was rather structurally similar to earlier Iron-Age societies found elsewhere in temperate Europe. At its most basic and localized elements, this society's fundamental purpose was to support a small population of warrior-aristocrats.The most basic political-economic unit in Ireland was the *tuath*, which which contained enough diversified land for agriculture and livestock, held in common by its inhabitants, to make it economically self-sufficient. The most basic social unit was the *clann* (lit. 'offspring') whose labour provided enough food from their *tuath* to support a small population of warrior-aristocrats who were often bound to the community by means of fictive kinship. These warriors would engage in frequent but low-scale conflict with neighbouring communities over cattle or to address wrongdoings that legal recourse had failed to solve. These kinds of local communities were  what Nerys Thomas Patterson has called a ""low-energy war-machine"".

The cattle-raid was perhaps the most common form of conflict because cattle were the most basic unit of economic exchange, a form of wealth and an aristocrat's source for gaining new clients. These conflicts were not particularly destructive as their goal was to quickly steal as many cattle as possible, though a community deprived of a herd might face hardship afterwards (dairy products formed a considerable proportion of the medieval Irish diet). In that case, their own warrior-aristocrats might undertake a raid to steal back their cattle or take some from a different neighbouring community. Conflict was thus endemic and self-sustaining; the *clann* and *tuath* provided enough food and labour to support local warrior-aristocrats who were mostly engaged in back-and-forth warfare with neighbouring communities over herds of cattle. At their most fundamental level, Irish social structures had evolved precisely to sustain constant conflict.",,0,False,Moderator | Pre-Norman Ireland |  European Fascism until 1945,AskHistorians,cqv41ap,,0,4,t5_2ssp3,t3_34fzii,t1_cqv41ap,False,moderator,1430496148

- Western Europe didn't share Eastern Europe's fate post WWII and the conflict in Ukraine is far away enough that they don't care;

There are many countries in this region and it's not simple to identify who would join a Union with deeper integration. How do we solve this fragmentation?

The Eastern countries are too poor or small and they know they can't accomplish the same with 2% of their GDP, their only real option would be a common army gathering resources from multiple countries, with a stated goal of protecting them from Russia and even, dar i say it, project power in the region.

J'ai déménagé au Canada il y a 8 mois pour faire mon undergrad à Waterloo. :)

&gt; People here don't clean up after themselves though.

It's a self-service and there is no waiting staff expect one guy who has a booth and were people go to when they need to pay when they are done. He also does some pretty amazing café, cappuccino etc... and refill the biscuit [boxes](http://cdn2.eminza.com/images/rep_articles/gra/cl/cloche-en-verre_11195_1.jpg) (they look pretty cool!).

They have put a box just near the clean plates/cups where people put their dirty ones when they leave. It is not the case in any other place though. Classic restaurants/cafés have a waiting staff that is paid to do that. 

&gt; I like this idea, I would hangout somewhere if philosophers were talking to everyone.

That's the main purpose of workshops and talks. Since they are events specifically focused on a particular topic, it let laypeople (like me!) the time to read about the subject and develop some familiarity with the topic so I can ask questions and bring something to the discussion when the actual event happens.

Minimum ilevel for raid for highmaul its recommended that you have the equivalent ilvl of full heroic dungions (630 but most groups ask for 640 for a buffer).  At this point in the expansion that is an easy target to hit (A couple highmaul LFR's should get you there and if you get to brf lfr queuing even more gear).  Minimum DPS is less of a factor these days then it used to be.  There are so many variables and so few butcher fights that being able to bring cleave or burst is a bigger factor (and that is a function of class) that being said if you are below 15k sustained single target with raid buffs dps you will probably have a rough time.

If you are looking for a pug group the best place to find one is the looking for group queue.  There is always one available for any level of puggable content.  With how the lock out system works you can do the tectus and brakenspore in one run then go back and get Kargath and butcher in a different run.  You are only elegible for loot from a boss once a lockout (happens tuesdays for NA Wedensday for EU).

Every guild worth it's salt is recruiting and with flex raiding the bench is less of a thing (you might have to wait a week to gear up a bit but if you have an intrest normally a couple people will help you gear (que quicker for LFR or do old raids using their exess ability to carry the slack of the damage you are not quite doing).  Roster turnover is really high especially in the weeks before new content comes out (also known as right now) as players get all the gear they want they take a step back and the guild continues to raid until they get the gear for the next patch.  This leads to openings.

Heads up before joining a Raiding guild.  Be prepared to make a time commitment and be on for their raids.  Tips can be given, gear can be farmed but attendance is the break point.  If you are late or a no show you might not be invited to raid and people are less likely to help you out.  Be prepared to make an effort to be available the first couple weeks.  Many players only log on to raid and little else but there tends to be a few in every guild who log on most evenings just to do stuff like farm or gear alts.  Those people tend to be bored enough to help you do stuff they were going to do anyway (which at times is exactly what you wanted to do).",,0,False,,wow,cqv4vjj,,0,5,t5_2qio8,t3_34is0x,t1_cqv4vjj,False,priest,1430497498

The city tried to prevent it from happening. A Jewish lawyer for the ACLU took it to court and secured their right to march. 

Their are out right racist rallies all the time. At a local public library racists have shown holocaust denial film. The protestors stood outside. That is how freedom of speech works. Right now, on Stormfront, they are actively recruiting racists to move to my area to set up a Pioneer Little Europe.

Edit: He's looked absolute quality for us so far this season, but so was Barry last year. Like Barry was last year, he's fighting for a contract right now, so I worry he'll quieten down when he's got one. There'll be a reason that he can't nail down a permanent place in the Spurs squad right now, and I can't imagine they'd want to sell him to us too cheaply as we were (until recently) fighting for Europe against them.

I'm also hoping it doesn't become a president that we buy the unwanted players of other premier league clubs. Martinez hasn't been too narrow sighted with his choice of transfers so far but we'll never find the next Coleman by buying off Spurs.

He seems like a safe bet right now but I worry that signing him would be nearly as much of a gamble as signing someone who's new to us. If he played with the same intensity and positive attitude next season I'd be very happy but only time will tell.

Natürlich sind Nachrichtendienste wichtig und man kann nicht völlig auf sie verzichten, aber man kann sie stärker an das parlamentarische System binden. Die Regierung hat sich als nicht fähig erwiesen, den BND zu kontrollieren, dies geschah entweder aus Unwillen oder aus Unfähigkeit. Deswegen sollte das Parlament mehr Möglichkeiten haben die Geheimdienste zu kontrollieren. Dadurch wird auch die Einflussnahme von fremden Geheimdiensten, wie jetzt geschehen, erschwert.

Zur dritten Frage kann ich nur sagen, dass zwischenstaatliche Beziehungen gar nicht tief genug sein können. 
Das gegenwärtige Problem ist, dass die Beziehung ziemlich unausgewogen ist. 
Deutschland sollte sich seiner Macht bewusst werden und endlich sagen, dass der gegenwärtige Zustand nicht hinnehmbar ist. 
Die EU wurde gegründet, damit die europäischen Staaten sich nicht alleine in der Welt behaupten müssen. Also sollte die EU jetzt endlich zusammenstehen und den USA sagen, dass das Ausspionieren aufhören muss, weil sonst Konsequenzen gezogen werden.

Meaningless when the *black president* himself cannot address the issue of institutionalised racism, over the course of 2 terms. 

&gt;None of the Western European countries have had non-Euro minority in their highest office. 

The US hasn't had a female president, does this mean the US is misogynistic? No.

&gt;Some (like Switzerland) have such restrictive immigration that the idea of a minority as a PM or President is laughable.

Restrictive immigration isn't a problem. The problem is institutionalised racism, which is far more present in the US than in Western Europe.


I'm not sure what your point is. You have a black president? So what. We (the UK) have had a female prime minister. It didn't create some radical change in society, we have much less than 50/50 split between men and women in the House of Commons (like the Senate) and the gender pay gap is still existent. 


&gt;Our big issue is actually a poverty mitigation problem. The police do kill minorities at a higher rate than whites, but when you control for poverty, they're killing poor whites at about the same rate, but the idea that they're killing people AT ALL is really bad.

I agree in a sense. The police in the US need serious reform, and not just with institutional racism, but using excessive force with all citizens. It's really sad that the riots and issues Ferguson and Baltimore have exploded, but I feel it's the anger of it not being addressed for so long (still no justification for destroying property or being violent).

&gt;The __Hawaiian Islands__ ([Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language): *Mokupuni o Hawai‘i*) are an [archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago) of eight major [islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island), several [atolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll), numerous smaller [islets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islet), and undersea [seamounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamount) in the North [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), extending some 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) from the [island of Hawaiʻi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island\)) in the south to northernmost [Kure Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kure_Atoll). Formerly the group was known to Europeans and Americans as the ""__[Sandwich Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_Islands)__"", a name chosen by [James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook) in honor of the then First Lord of the Admiralty [John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Montagu,_4th_Earl_of_Sandwich). The contemporary name is derived from the name of the main island, Hawaii Island.

In England you buy a bike and mail in a slip with the registration address, and they send your ownership papers. No further questions asked. Then I got moto insurance for Europe through this company: http://www.tourinsure.de/

One downside is that if you want to have all your documents in order, you'll have to wait until the insurance card comes in the mail which is about a week or more. Getting the full registration is hopeless - took about six weeks to finally arrive. I didn't have time to wait for either so I was riding with a printout of my insurance card they had emailed me and a temporary registration slip from when I bought the bike. I never got pulled over so I don't know if this would have gotten me into trouble, but I did get hassled at the Bosnia-Croatia border.

Also I was covered for Europe through my insurance but NOT for the UK, so I had to ride from London to the ferry uninsured which was slightly sketchy. I guess I could have bought UK insurance as well but I didn't have time to look into it. (**edit:** I remember why I couldn't get UK insurance - I didn't have a UK license.)

My friend still gets mail in my name at his place with fine notices because if you don't insure your bike after you register it in the UK they will fine you after a certain amount of time.

I'm not sure how registration goes in any other part of Europe. It may just be easier to rent if you have the money, but I was doing everything on the cheap.

In my research I also found these guys who can apparently also arrange insurance for cheap, and apparently good in all countries: http://motosapiens.org/motocamp/Info",,0,False,,motocamping,cqv76pv,,0,1,t5_2tko6,t3_34ivh3,t1_cqv76pv,False,,1430501172

Most of the ""Muslims"" came from former colonies, to get a job (the kind of job that nobody wants) in France. But with the current unemployed rate, it's not as easy as it was to find an unqualified job in France (Though it is still easier and better paid than in Algeria/Morocco/Tunisia etc..). 

Until the late 70's everybody (including themselves) thought that these worker will spend a few years to France and come back to their country, then they were allowed to bring their family with them, and finally they raised their children and grand-children in France, but they still have an attachment to their region (not the country the Region were their ancestor came from). 

A big part of the french ""muslims"" are poor, living in poor towns/districts/suburbs (where you get bad school, and thus are more likely to fail and stay poor). and were there is sometimes nothing to do, nor state presence.

A last point, there are very few reliable statistics on religion and race in France, the last time the state collected information about race and religion was during WWII, when the Nazi asked for the Jew.

- US has a ton of ongoing and temporary training programs for lots of people abroad, doing lots of things.  Europe, Asia, Africa.  Everywhere.  Some of it is political/financial, some of it information warfare, some of it is logistical and knowledge support to groups and individuals that are deemed important.  Here in DC, I've met foreign military personnel going to US military training and living on US military bases.  Support for C. and S. American governments, leaders, and groups is nothing unusual.  

- No one has a crystal ball to figure out people's true intentions or their future behavior.  You can only skew chances in your favor.  You can't magically eliminate bad or embarrassing outcomes.  Doing nothing is considered a clear loss that is -worse- than occasional embarrassments.  That's what it comes down to.  

- Some of these countries are a basket case and they will remain basket cases for a long time.  It is better to have some sort of relations than no relations at all.  In the Middle East, all these leaders (most not elected) hate USA openly in their statements.  But as Wikileaks cables showed, behind the scenes they are often maneuvering to be in USA's good graces and sharing secret information and bad mouthing their neighbors.  They are 'covert' allies.  USA has a lot of 'covert' allies who publicly bad mouth USA, but behind closed doors support USA and sometimes depend on USA financially/logistically/etc.  Strategically speaking, this is a much better outcome than having zero influence in the region.  

- US has been documented in writing checks and supporting many efforts that people consider ""just"", like Tibet's Dalai Lama.  But over the years, Dalai Lama made it clear that there is no democracy in Tibet's future.  Tibet used to be a theological serf state led by these religious extremists who want to be back in Tibet and back in power.  So who really knows what would've happened had they succeeded in gaining independence for Tibet?  That's just one example.  CIA/etc have provided support for a lot of things over the years, including Polish Solidarity movement... and as you can see no one is complaining about that.  US has been involved in supporting opposition to Yanukovych for many years now, and is actively involved trying to undermine Europe's last dictator Lukashenko as well.  

When shit hits the fan, people will make a big deal out it.  They're justified in doing so and raise important issues.  These programs are continuously evaluated for effectiveness and minimizing embarrassing situations.  

But it is important to look at these programs not as some individual conspiracies, but as overall USA policy.  There are organizations that keep track of casualties of war and armed conflicts.  If we use that a metric of success, the world is doing as good as ever.  Whatever USA is doing is working - or at least not hindering progress as much as individual incidents might make it seem.

There are no official studies of this.  But I have had occasion to be in the presence and gotten to know many atheists, especially in the last 10 years.  It's one of those things you easily observe &gt; 90% behaviors from a group (for example, the near 100% support of gay marriage among atheists, while it is something like 40% for Christians is just too striking, and does not need a survey to observe.)

&gt; and most religious people believe. 

These sorts of things are available from Pew, Aris, or just reading the news headlines.

&gt; There are good and bad people every where and whether they are religious or atheists have nothing to do with it.

But atheists don't subvert the definition of good or bad according to arbitrary authoritarian doctrine.  Religious people think that gay marriage is a bad thing.  So your clever truism does not apply, because religious people are far less likely to have a reasonable sense of what good or bad is.

&gt; Look at Russia for athesits that are homophobic.

First of all, they are culturally homophobic for the same reasons Americans used to be.  The media and culture in general have persecuted them.  However, if you scratch under the surface, you find that actually the real people there don't hate gay people, and the younger generation is much more tolerant; the current outspoken backlash against them has been manufactured entirely by the government.

Second of all, Russia can no longer be considered an atheistic state.  The government does not restrict practice of religion and there has been a major upsurge in Russian Orthodox Church attendance since the fall of the Berlin wall.

&gt; Eastern Europe ranks among highest for nonreligious and child abuse, child sex and slavery trade.

Ok, that you would have cite figure for.  The eastern Europeans that *I* know are extremely protective of their children, and are unaware of a child slave trade.

&gt; Freedom of speech is quite restrictive in the non religious world.

Ok, that's just utter bullshit.  The non-religious world is basically Japan, Europe, and to a lesser extent Canada and Australia.  They have generic freedom of speech in those places.  The one exception to this is China.  China's secularism is a special case.

&gt; Look at Russia and China.

Again, Russia is no longer an atheistic state.  China is a special case in many respects.

&gt; I think you may be over emphasizing the anecdotal evidence from your social network.

No, there is a well known statistic about federal incarceration and religion that was calculated during the Clinton administration.  It showed that Jews were about 40 times less likely to be in prison, and Atheists were 50 times less likely (Muslims were nearly twice as likely) as compared with their population.  The government has since stopped providing this data.

I wrote my own survey (but I got too few responses, and clearly a biased turn-out) to help me understand this.  Atheists in the west are just way ahead of the curve on human values and decency, and I've spent much of the last 10 years trying to figure out why that is.

 [**Battle of Stalingrad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Stalingrad): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Battle of Stalingrad__ (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943)     was a major battle of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in which [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) and its allies fought the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) for control of the city of [Stalingrad (now Volgograd)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volgograd) in [Southern Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Russia), on the eastern boundary of Europe.

&gt;Marked by constant [close quarters combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_combat) and direct assaults on civilians by [air raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe), it is often regarded as the single largest and [bloodiest battle in the history of warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_by_casualties).  The heavy losses inflicted on the *[Wehrmacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht)* make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war.  It was a turning point in the [European theatre of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II)–the German forces never regained the initiative in the [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II\)) and withdrew a vast military force from the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_II\)) to replace their losses. 

&gt;The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in late summer 1942 using the [6th Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_Army_(Wehrmacht\)) and elements of the [4th Panzer Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Panzer_Army). The attack was supported by intensive *[Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe)* bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [building-to-building fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_warfare), and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones generally along the west bank of the [Volga River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_River).

&gt;On 19 November 1942, the [Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army) launched [Operation Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Uranus), a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Romania) and [Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1920-1946\)) forces protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.  The [Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers) forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [cut off and surrounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encirclement) in the Stalingrad area. [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining elements of the 6th Army surrendered.  :p.932 The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.

The story is still absolutely fantastic, but the gameplay has been bettered, in comparison to FFVI which is still one of the best gameplay orientated JRPGs ever made in my opinion.

I think a decent amount of it may be nostalgia, sure, but I wasn't actually born when it came out, and it wasn't available in Europe for another 8 years, so I never game round to playing it up until a few years ago. It's hard to put into words why I think it's the best, but here are the general points.

- Ensamble cast, with no really annoying arse as the MC. The fact that there isn't really a main character has allways added to the game in my opinion. It also makes battles more strategic, and different players will likely find different casts of characters, especially after the midway point.

- Music is the best in the series, full stop.

- Reasonably dark story which gets the Magic Vs Technology theme of FF pretty much spot on, which none of the successive games have done as well since. I also love how it twists on the established formula of FF by this point, and the second half of the game really kicks things up a gear.

- It's aged brilliantly. The sprites in the era are some of the best in the 16-Bit era, especially boss sprites, and in my opinion, it's aged a million times better than FFVII at the very least. It's art style is brilliant, to boot.

- The best villian in the whole series.

&gt;have more faith. If you have no faith, why are you guys even here?

I've been with CLG since literally the beginning. The good old days of the initial roster consisting of you, Kobe, Bigfatgg, Chauster and Elementz. I was with you when you won WCG 2010 over SK. There was a disappointing showing in 2011 at worlds (season 1), but after that things were significantly better. When you picked up saint the following year and WON back to back events (IEM and MLG). What a time to be a CLG fan, the days when bigfat was considered one of the best mid lanes in the world, the days when CLG was one of THE TEAMS to beat. Then... well then that was 2011 hotshot. We're 2015 now, do we really have to go down the road that's been the last 4 years?

End of 2011 - Picking up Doublelift and CLG.EU

I loved the pickup of double at the time, the team looked good, they had just come off of back to back wins with iem and mlg in august. There was some fluctuation, other teams were starting to catch up to CLG, but it was all good. The end of 2011 was a slightly shaky but it ended on a good note, so much, ugh, potential.

2012:

We had Korea at this point, oh Korea. So begins the hope train right? CLG at this point is still the #1 team NA, TSM is very rapidly catching up but CLG is arguably still on top. Unfortunately this marks the shift (we're only in 2012, there's still 3 years to go, how depressing is that). CLG goes to Korea to compete in azubu, fans are ecstatic - Korea at this point is already considered one of the strongest regions in the game, CLG is definitely going to get stronger here right? I mean, they were already on top of NA, imagine when they come back! Imagine... An early knock out sends CLG back to NA, but it's ok - they lost to the Koreans but they'll definitely still be strong in NA right?

After that, the role swaps, I questioned the role swaps (Voyboy --&gt; Saint, moving you to jungle), but I continued to defend it. ""The team didn't get along, too many hotheads but that's ok. Hotshot may struggle initially in the jungle but he'll do ok, CLG will get through"". During this time, CLG.EU looked like a brilliant pickup. This was when the tides were turning in NA, but CLG.EU looked to be very dominant alongside M5. CLG was still strong, they were even considered favorites. (At this point, the EU vs NA was swinging in full force, I mean - it always has, and it started before then) but that's what made MLG 2012 so special. CLG Prime + CLG.EU + TSM + DIG + Fnatic. This was THE TOURNAMENT to be at. This was a period of time where EU looked extremely strong, and... NA came out stronger. NA was basically considered underdogs at this point when it came to those matchups I was so proud when you won 2-1 against CLG.EU, so proud. We lost in the finals vs TSM (taking it to the 2nd set against TSM, and going to 6 games), but honestly - you rose back up to the level we expected from CLG. Not quite the high as mid 2011, but it was pretty great. Was...

Worlds happened, a very disappointing knockout in group stages, devastating. We're nearing the start of the LCS. At this point, CLG has had its rocky moments (every team does right?). They've had their extreme highs, and towards the end, lower then they've probably ever been (both the team, and the fans). Link comes in to replace bigfat, and Aphro also joins (first time).


2013-2015:

Honestly... I'm not sure how much more I care to write. Above is part history of the team and part fan experiences. Writing this has brought up a flood of memories that I'm glad to have been part of. Up until this point, even in all the low times (both worlds, and then the latter stages) it's always been good. When CLG made a promise to come back, it meant something.

I don't think we really need to go through the feelings of the LCS - it has literally ALWAYS been the same. 

LCS Spring Split 2013: Middle to low part of the pack first season

Playoffs: lose to Vulcun in playoffs 1:2.

LCS Summer split 2013: even or losing records vs every other team except for 4-0ing TSM. 

Playoffs: Lose to TSM 2-0 , beat Curse 2-0 to survive

LCS Spring Split 2014: Huge improvement, holy cow! 3-1 or 4-0 every other team except 1-3ing vs both C9 and TSM. 

Playoffs: Holy cow we won a set, 2-0 vs coast. Lose 2-1 vs TSM, then beat curse to secure 3rd place. (Improvement!)

LCS Summer Split 2014: End middle of the pack again, 13-15 overall record. 2-2 with TSM, lots of 1-3's and 3-1's 

Playoffs: 0-3 vs Curse, 1-3 vs Dig. 3-2 &gt; Curse Academy (and that may have honestly been the lowest point as a CLG fan). 1 game from getting relegated after such a successful spring split and an amazing start to the summer split, but a colossal meltdown in the second half.

That brings us to the last split: Spring 2015: 0-2 TSM/TL 1-1 C9 (then 0-1 in tiebreaker) 1-1 vs TIP and 2-0 vs every other team. The BEST split CLG has ever had... until the last 4 weeks. (very reminiscent to the summer split 2014 where CLG rose to team to beat in the first half before they had that major breakdown).

Playoffs: 0-3 to TL

So here we are. For the record. Both of 2013: CLG went 13-15, 18-10 and then 13-15 in 2014, then 12-7 in 2015

It might be good to note that in these last 4-5 years, I've made it a point to watch literally every CLG game I possibly could. It became an unhealthy obsession. The extension of my day had a huge factor into how CLG did in their games. Part of that is being a fan, but this went a step beyond even that. After being knocked out 0-3, for the first time in LoL history, I lost the will to watch competitive LoL featuring CLG, why? I could see it looming - the approaching ""We're definitely going to do something"" only to have no change occur. I'd LOVE for you to prove me wrong, please - absolutely - do it. But it's been 4 years of the same ""things will change"" spheel, and as fans - we just want to see you follow through one of these times.

At the end of the day, you run the team how you want. You can be as transparent as you want, but when legit fans are being fed the same responses split after split, it's extremely disappointing to see everyone else climbing the rungs of the ladder, while CLG (showing points of brilliance) continue to be content with being mediocre.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Drugs_and_alcohol

""Substance abuse and violence
Hendrix would often become angry and violent when he drank too much alcohol, or when he mixed alcohol with illicit drugs.[258] His friend Herbie Worthington explained: ""You wouldn't expect somebody with that kind of love to be that violent ... He just couldn't drink ... he simply turned into a bastard.""[259] According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix ""admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise.""[260]

In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden for a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen, in Gothenburg, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment.[259] The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.[261] After the 1969 burglary of a house Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon, California, and while he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him.[262] A few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.[259]""",,0,False,,AdviceAnimals,cqva0yh,,0,2,t5_2s7tt,t3_34imtj,t1_cqva0yh,False,,1430505765

**The Returnees:**

*Kyle Wiltjer (RsSR, 6'10"")* -- You guys know Wilt, he was the national face of this program due to his transfer from blue-blood Kentucky to our tiny little school of 6k undergrads. Kyle was the standout in an offense with several contributors, scoring 17 points a game on 54% from the field, including 46.6% from beyond the arc. He's definitely a stretch-four type on that end of the floor. The reason he's still here and not in the NBA is his poor footwork. This leads to many awkward moments on offense and really, really hurts him on defense. Speaking of defense, he's poor at it. While he's able to run the floor with most anyone in the college game, he'd be lost trying to defend power forwards in the NBA, especially with his lack of strength. This also is probably the reason we won't see the three-big lineups many think we might, since that'd leave Kyle on some team's three-guard who'd probably have a field day driving around him.

*Przemek Karnowski (SR, 7'1"")* -- The 7-1 Goliath briefly entertained turning pro, many speculating that a European team might've even offered a contract, but will be coming back to dominate the paint in the WCC again. His strength, besides his pure size, is probably his hands. Most effectively shown off with a couple no-look passes around double teams down low in the UCLA game, Przem knows how to use his hands in ways most big men don't. Defensively, he's a problem for most teams simply because he's big. Opposing forwards find him hard to post up against and he's more than capable of stopping drives. One criticism would be his lack of blocks for someone of his size, only getting one or two per game. This might be at least partially due to his other problem, a lot of bench time due to his foul trouble. In addition to the occasional ""You're too big"" foul calls you expect in the WCC, he doesn't always know when to cut his losses and allow the bucket without grabbing another foul.

*Domantas Sabonis (SO, 6'10"")* -- Of Arvydas Sabonis' pedigree, he was huge as a sixth man off the bench and the last of the returning players who saw significant minutes in the 2014-15 campaign. The third big on the roster, Domantas brought onto the roster the polish he gained playing with professionals in Europe. His main problem last year was fouls, though his were of the over-the-back variety on rebounds. He did wind up leading the team in boards, but he did so by being very aggressive. The three of these returning bigs have many Zag fans and some national analysts anointing this frontcourt rotation the best in the nation. More on that a bit later.

*Josh Perkins (RsFR, 6'3"")* -- Currently the assumed point guard until Mark Few tells us otherwise, Perkins was supposed to back up Pangos last year until an errant flying ninja kick caught his jaw and left him out for the season, partially in order to pick up a medical redshirt. He looked like the kind of guard Gonzaga doesn't usually get in the recruiting process. Athletic and entertaining as all hell to watch. Many speculated that if he stayed healthy, the Zags go undefeated in the regular season. Anyway, he's  at least a little bit of an unknown for fans right now, for as highly rated he was out of high school (four-star, ESPN 100) and how good he looked last year, his games were against lower-quality opposition and no one knows what kind of development he did while sitting. He also has the same height problem as Pangos and Bell, leaving some concerned about his defensive ability on taller guards like what we faced in Duke.

*Kyle Dranginis (RsSR, 6'5"")* -- One of your prototypical college hustle guys who picks up a lot of offensive boards and gets on the ground for loose balls. His other strength, one that might lead him to the three-guard position, is his three-point shooting. I don't have a shot chart on hand or anything but if memory serves me right he usually takes his shots from the corners and can drive the baseline if the opportunity is there. Defense is a little suspect (you're probably noticing a theme here) but Mark Few once started Mike Hart for most of a season so who knows.

*Silas Melson (SO, 6'5"")* -- Once thought to be a good tandem partner for Josh Perkins a la Pangos and Bell Jr, he wound up burning his redshirt once Perkins got hurt since McClellan wasn't eligible for another two months and Dranginis was the only other scholarship guard on the bench at the time. He saw limited minutes and didn't shoot nearly as well as one would hope. He held his own on the defensive side of the ball, though, and Gonzaga seems to be much better at developing offense than defense, so he might be a decently rounded guard come next year. He'll be expected to be the two guard.

*Eric McClellan (RsSR, 6'3"")* -- Vanderbilt transfer who sat out the first half of the year and then saw limited minutes. Not much is known about Few's plans for him and since I didn't get to see much during the season I can't do the kind of analysis I did for everyone else. He will probably at least give Perkins competition for the point guard spot and might wind up in the two or three-guard spot if Mark Few decides Dranginis is more effective off the bench.

**The Newbies:**

*Ryan Edwards (RsSO, 7'1"")* -- With our only committed 2015 recruit going off on his Mormon mission before stepping on a court with a Gonzaga jersey, the only ""newcomer"" actually saw minutes his freshman year before sitting down and presumably working with Tommy Lloyd for a season on... something. Zag fans have seen redshirt seasons work wonders on Kelly Olynyk and Kyle Wiltjer so many are pegging Edwards to be a surprise the nation won't see coming but he did not have near the hype that those two had coming out of high school. He is the same weight and height as Karnowski, though, which could be all he needs. With him on the bench, Few might have Karnowski be more aggressive on defense, knowing that there's another equivalent paint presence on the bench. I don't expect him to be near Karno's level on offense, so he'll get only limited minutes at the end of the day.

**Possible Pickups**

I don't follow the recruiting and transfer trail as hotly as some of my fellow Zag fans, but after making Damion Lee's shortlist and getting burned there's only one player left on my radar who could come in and make an impact next season. PG Federico Mussini is an international player in Italy who has Gonzaga on his list of schools he's considering, but he might go pro. St John's is also apparently hot on his trail as well. He would definitely be a backup point guard, probably pushing McClellan out of that race, and might see some minutes elsewhere in the backcourt as well. Gonzaga is still everywhere on the transfer market, but most of the names that I've seen have been of the redshirt year variety, including Nigel Willams-Goss. A lot of Zag fans would definitely appreciate one more guard at least to firm up the backcourt, and with four scholarships open it's a surprise the staff has yet to add anyone. Time will tell.

In conclusion, the frontcourt should be beastly, the backcourt is a big question mark, and the team is not set in stone yet.

First, [this.](http://np.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/34bhuj/did_feminism_create_the_red_pill_mentality/cqtnmyc#cqtpv9w) You seem to operate under the misconception that it's the greatest prospect for a guy to have a marriage of convenience where he has the license to maritally rape his wife if she isn't compliant on her own (and *you* wonder why I always chime in with a sarcastic ""this is what feminists actually believe""...). As I said, holding that belief certainly makes it easier to avoid cognitive dissonance. 

&gt;Didn't you once look around you and see which males were having the greatest success with women?

Sure, I was aware of them. Well, where to start...

- let's begin with the greatest player among them, who pretty much went through all girls in my class (at least making out, but also hooking up, can't say for sure) and to quite a bunch beyond that - he once said that he had two women a week on average, and even though one might consider that humblebragging, it was most likely accurate. Not hating here, he was a really chill, laid-back guy, not your stereotypical bad boy, and I actually liked him (and, more importantly, so did the girls). Doesn't change the fact that he saw dating as a game and girls as conquests or challenges that had to be had, only to lose interest when he had made it.
- another player type (catchphrase ""woah, fucking bitches"" whenever a woman got on his nerves) even gave me the most sincere and probably best piece of dating advice I ever got until that point in my life (given the poor quality of the rest of the dating guidelines I had): ""sandman, women want you treat them like crap."" While of course he was exaggerating, truth is that he certainly didn't treat them what I would have considered ""decent"" back then. He was fucking around, shamelessly hit on women (also in a blatantly sexual manner), and wasn't a stranger to cheating on them (the last habit I got to know a decade later from a girl whose friend he dated back then). 
- well, we also had our jerks jock; a steroid using bodybuilder who considered generally being an asshole as something honorable. Rumored to have fathered a child at 16. During our school trip to Eastern Europe, he mused about how you could get the prettiest girls there for peanuts. Which must have been his hard standard because those times I saw him with girlfriends, it was never less than an 8.
- a pretty good friend of mine in HS was a serial monogamist who went through breakup without heartache and usually had a rebound girl within a week, sometimes within a day. He could regularly deride a girl only to hit it off with her later or hit on her/get into a relationship with her and regularly deride her afterwards. He's the most harmless case from that list, but even he had the habit of considering the women in his life as disposable.

So yeah, I actually *did* see what the successful guys did. Unfortunately, it wasn't compatible with the feminist-approved set of dating guidelines I internalized (and if you didn't prefer to stay in denial about them and refuse to read the reports I linked above, you might actually get to know how *guys* interpreted the messages a feminist-influenced narrative sent them through all channels). Okay, I mean, I *could* have tried to emulate that behavior, sure (though I already have an idea of how this would have turned out). The mere *possibility* is there. Alas, all that ""objectifying"", ""disrespecting"", ""only thinking about sex"" and generally treating women as disposable didn't sit well with me. But unfortunately, that was the point: while it wasn't the only thing they had going for them, those guys who had the greatest success with women wouldn't have had it had they actually treated them like feminism tells you to, and not like as guy#2 has put it. Neither would they have gotten that far nor would they have been personally willing to do. 

The answer is - apart from the fact that I wouldn't have been very good at it (for several reasons), that I didn't *want* to, not under these conditions. I actually wanted the soulmate romance, and I clung to a set of counterproductive and nonsenical beliefs that were derived from progressive notions on how to treat women and of what women said they wanted. I would lie if I said that I would have been the ultimate player had I not been confused by them, but having an actually accurate idea of what women want and how to deal with that (and them) would have made my dating life *infinitely* easier.

By stealing it from the pockets of others. Government cannot create wealth it can only redistribute it through the theft of wealth from the private sector 

&gt;He wants to pay people better by raising the min wage

No we wants to force businesses at gunpint to pay people a wage that is more than what the job is worth 

So those jobs taht can be located elsewhere .. will go elsewhere leading to unemployment

Those that canlt will just go unfilled  which will lead to more unemployment

And those that do raise there wage will pass on the costs to the customers making that section of the Americans populace more poor ....

These are not good outcomes from this plan of Bernie's

&gt;He wants to create jobs by rebuilding our roads and bridges

Again, he will have to take money from those businesses that create jobs first ... to increase the ranks of the dependency class

Besides we have too much infrastructure to begin with, which is why it is such sad shape and with the government being $18 trillion in debt, there is no money for him to do this ( not that it is even legal for him to do so since there is no authority for infrastructure repair in the Constitution )

&gt;He wants to make college affordable

No he doesn't .. he wants to make more expensive by dumping more and more of the cost on to the taxpayer. The only way to make things leas expensive is to ensure there are no costs imposed by government through subsidies, regulations and other impediments to competition

&gt;He wants to reform the tax system to prevent companies like Boeing from paying nothing in taxes. 

As we see in Europe theft ( taxation ) is not a sustainable way to keep a country going, eventually you run out of people to steal from

&gt;He wants to overturn Citizens United.

0,t3_327dp3,False,SpicyMagnum23,1,1432718591,"I agree with a lot of people here that in the most likely of circumstances the war would be quick and dirty, which is to say that far more likely than an expanded conflict any possible war would be about limited gains even between potential great powers. For example, if the US and China find themselves in a war over some small islands in the western Pacific there is hardly room for and kind of land offensive and the scope of the war would stick to higher tech and more precise equipment in the naval and aerial spheres. In a sense, this war would be politically guided: the Chinese would simply need to inflict enough damage to make the American people uninterested in further war, but sinking a Nimitz could go in the totally opposite direction and just piss the Americans off. Ultimately, the Chinese would give in if their advanced materiel were destroyed and they decide that its useless to let the Americans destroy the rest of their older vessels and aircraft. This is a war were production capability hardly matters until afterwards when they rearm.

Your question is a lot more focused on long term, large scale war between great powers which would in all likelihood have to be centered on ground combat. The difference is that any war of this kind would be a systemic war akin to the World Wars when the outcome will completely upset and rearrange the international system, and so every bit of skin is in the game for the Americans. In the end, the Americans would be highly dedicated to the cause so as to not lose their empire while the Chinese may think it just slightly more acceptable to lose the war and maintain a relative status quo. 

American doctrine always recognizes that on the Eurasian landmass, the US will always be heavily outnumbered by local populations (and therefore potential forces). This is a large reason for the American lust for high technology which is ultimately necessary to military success to act as  a force multiplier to make a numerically inferior American force capable of victory. Few countries that the US would potentially be at odds with have such a similar need since they already lay in Eurasia. Therefore, while many posses the kind of high tech materiel that the US employs their stockpiles are hardly as necessary and so they receive less investment (while China has MBTs ""comparable"" to the Abrams, they still own and operate swarms of older, dumpier tanks like T62s and T-54s) As a side note, the kind of war you are imagining where each country employs the same high tech force composition is not a real scenario today and is one that wont likely come to term for years at the least.

I can tell I'm going to ramble so I'll just jump to your question... China today has the largest manufacturing/industrial base in the world, but it is just slightly larger than that of the United States. More importantly, the Chinese industrial base operates at 100% to churn out all the garbage that people in America and Europe buy. On the other hand, US firms hardly operate above 90% of their capacity (and usually much lower). The reason for this is simple, the Chinese economy is garbage. They have the most ludicrous financial system which is set up exactly like Japan's in the 1980's but with more corruption, but this fuels massive growth. However, Chinese firms make almost no money (one company made about 5 million Yuan in sales last year and profited about 120 yuan), so they absolutely must sell AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE and still drown themselves in debt to grow their businesses. By this account, the Chinese production capacity is an anomaly that is unlikely to last much longer, which if you realize that leaves the US (post-China) as an unbeatably superior productive economic force in the world. Even before a Chinese economic collapse, during war time the US could maximize its industrial capacity and still surpass that of China without doing anything like converting other factories for military production.

What is equally important to realize is the specialization of American and Chinese manufacturing. China builds Christmas tree lights, the US builds 747s. Even though the Chinese can boast massive output, their capacity is built on uneducated and unskilled labor along with a uniquely incapable technological sector. The United States on the other hand, while it does not export a lot, exports highly profitable high tech commodities such as aircraft or medical equipment or weapons. In a battle of military production the US is extremely well situated not only with the largest existing high-tech military productive base, but also a far vaster wealth of factories and workers who could easily be re-tasked to build high tech military equipment. While it may seem that a high tech and expensive hardware would be prohibitive to build en mass, you cannot think of it in a vacuum. The US economy and workforce is already highly oriented to produce today's military equipment at a level which would still match the output in WWII in relative terms.

Additionally, the first thing that would happen in such a war would be the nullification of debt to a nation. For China, that means that not only would the US be entirely capable of affording new debt to finance its leviathan war machine, but the Chinese would be financially ruined (both in terms of their planned debt repayments and inability to sell exports because the Renminbi would skyrocket without US T-bills).

There is also the final bit which is that during wartime, everything is streamlined in a near-magical way. On a national level, there is no excess nor distraction (think like when you exercise and your head becomes so clear because all you can focus on in the workout). People will be motivated, useless production will be cut out, and miraculous technological advancements will surprisingly pic up speed as they become necessities instead of interesting side projects. The US has always churned out incredible new technological developments in war time and the factors that made that so have and will not change. New capabilities in terms of military operations, intelligence, industry, and whatever else will be unpredictable but indispensable.

I have used China as the example because everyone loves talking about shooting China, but the same assessment goes for any other country if not more so. War does not change, the small conflicts may because instead of having to land your Red Coats to meet the rebels in a field you can fly sorties to bomb them at a far lesser cost and risk. However, in systemic wars... real wars, the trends are the same and ultimately high tech naval and aerial combat will give way to divisional maneuver warfare which will eventually give way to old fashioned hand-to-hand. The same goes for the production of war, the US may choose to produce less expensive and simpler units, but ultimately that is not necessarily a given and I think it will surprise us all tremendously how quickly the Americans are capable of producing hundreds of advanced aircraft, numerous simultaneous ship constructions, and thousands of vehicles from HMMWVs to Strykers to M1A2s if not something brand new.",,0,False,,CredibleDefense,cqvcpai,,0,1,t5_2y5ib,t3_327dp3,t1_cqvcpai,False,,1430510182

Just as in any country. People sometimes immigrate to certain countries, Palestine is not exempt from this. That's a very odd argument. 

&gt;I would describe the Arab presence in Palestine as colonization and the Jewish presence as the return of an indigenous people to their homeland seeking to exercise their rights.

Most people would disagree since the Palestinians have been recognized as the indigenous population. Your opinion is unfounded and is in fact seems extreme. 

&gt; find it deplorable you deny Jews as being ""actual inhabitants of the land."" 

So should everybody return to where their ancestors lived 2,000 years ago? Cause that's what you're saying.

&gt;So you think Palestinians and BDS CAN revoke Jewish rights and demand Palestine all for themselves?!

Again they are not revoking anybody rights. They are just saying that settlers colonizing a land do not have a right to self-determination to this land based off the fact they are colonizing it. 

Self-determination definition was meant to aid in decolonization in the world, and end the practice in general. 

&gt;If the Palestinian Arabs have a right to statehood in Palestine, so do Jews. Do you agree with that? 

That literally makes no sense. That's like saying ""if the Palestinian Arabs have a right to statehood in Palestine, so do Australians."" 

The logic is inconsistent and completely changes the definition of self-determination. Settlers don't have a right to self-determination. 

It's like saying that the British had a right to self-determination in India simply because they were colonizing it before independence was achieved.

&gt;Jews in the ME and Jews in Europe have a shared culture, just like Arabs in Egypt and the US. 

Why are you trying to lie to me? Mizrahi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews have completely different culture. Their culture was no different than that of the societies they lived in. Jews in the Middle East spoke Arabic, ate Arabic food etc.   

They shared the same faith. Even in Israeli society today many Mizrahi Jews are much more similar to their Palestinian neighbors. As this article even explains [Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews are very different] (http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/mizrahi-jews-remind-israel-hidden-other-513815657) 

&gt;You're just wrong. Jews in the Middle East have a shared culture with Jews in Europe. 

Then explain the disparity of Middle Eastern Jews and European Jews in Israeli society. They are very different people and anybody who has been to Israel knows this. 

&gt;Then prove me wrong. Show me where ""Canaan"" is seated at the United Nations.

Please tell me how the Canaanites just disappeared. The fact is they didn't, rather they intermarried with the Arabs.

 “But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin. - Illene Beatty, “Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.”

To refute each of your arguments separately:

&gt;It proves that, if it takes WT 44 games with duo to get masters (better solo queue player than Pob by every indication we have) then it seems reasonable to believe it would have taken Pob more than that to get masters, let alone challenger.

Does not prove this at all, you're just flat out wrong here.

&gt;Not just NA LCS pros, NA/EU/Chinese pros were all there. It's a lot of players in a pretty small pool - since everyone has high diamond MMR - so it seems pretty damn likely that those people would step on each others toes and climb more slowly as a result.

Once again, Chinese players always play in soloq. The only new players were Wildcard regions, NA and EU. Pobelter was already rank 2 in NA, and once again this is incredibly rare until the highest parts of the ladder (and not a single LCS player was above rank 100, so they wouldn't been in his rank 30 games). He was playing against Faker for pete's sake, no one else got to that level.

&gt;""In solo queue at least, he's one of the best players in the world"" - that's funny, because he's never been rank 1 IN HIS REGION except when the pro players are elsewhere.

So what? Once again, Incarnation hasn't been rank 1 for an incredibly long time as well. You can't use ""Rank 1 a year ago vs rank 2 a few months ago"" as a metric, that's the point I'm making from the very beginning. There's no real indicator on who's a better player, and if people's argument is based off of **soloq performance**, then **Pobelter is at least equal to Incarnation in ranking**. I'm not saying that's a smart thing to do (soloq =/= LCS), but that's all we have to go off of in terms of incarnation.

&gt;Hardly one of the best in the world lol.

Once again, he was rank 30 in Korea. I don't get why you're focusing on ""oh he fell from rank 2 to rank 4"", that in no way proves your point. Yet the moment you bring up rank 30 in Korea your counter argument is ""well Wildturtle was Masters""? I don't even know how to respond to that.

This means you will get -1 revolt risk for all Hellenic provinces (because they have +1 happiness basically) and a +1 revolt risk in all other non Hellenic provinces.

Culture doesn't mean much in the game other than is it your Primary Culture, and Accepted culture or non accepted. Primary gives no penalties or benefits and neither does Accepted. However, Accepted can always become non-accepted if you grow too large (I think if a culture provides 15% - 20% or something around there of your total income it becomes accepted and if it falls below that by expanding your empire it can become unaccepted). Unaccepted provides a -2 unhappiness or in other words +2 revolt risk.

Revolt risk now accrues over time (unlike the old system which was like in CK2 where a 5% revolt chance spawns a 100 stack lol). So if a province has like 1% revolt it will likely take 50+ years to spawn and will most likely go away before it does. 10% chance tho and it will spawn in under 2 years. Understand?

The biggest difference in nations is their Ideas, their Unit Types, Religion, Government Type and their Technology.

Ideas are unique traits about your country which grant bonuses which you will have to look up on the wiki.

Unit Types have what are called PIPS. Offensive and Defensive PIPS and determine their Efficiency in battle. Unit Types are most often tied to the starting tech of the country (Western tech with Western units, Indian with Indian and so on). You can change Tech groups later in the game however you cannot change Unit Types unless it is changed by a special decision (look up the Timurids forming Mughal or Manchu forming Qing). Some units types are strong early game, mid game or late game but they all pretty much have their chance to shine at some point in the game.

Relgion and Government just provide some benefits or penalties and can be found in the wiki.

Finally, Tech groups. Tech is where you will spend most of your monarch points. Every tech group except Western has a penalty that increases the cost of each tech. This is to keep with the history of the world (so a far east country doesn't have the same technology as a European country). You can get rid of this penalty and change to Western once you make contact with a European and they border you (and you have 8 techs behind them). It takes about 10-15 years to change and during this you probably dont want to buy tech because once Westernization is done, you get massive discounts to tech cost until you catch up to your European buddy.

Hope this helps :D Have fun!

If you were lucky, you had a private bathroom/shower (generally all combined into the space of a single shower stall), or less lucky, a shared bathroom. One of my favorite business hotels had 1 bathroom per 2 rooms. You got an exterior key, which opened a small vestibule with three doors - bathroom, room 1, room 2.

These rooms were always clean and quiet. Salary men use them, so nobody was inviting their bros to hang out like American hotels. In fact, most of these places have strict ""no guests"" rules. No school trips. Just tired folks who want to sleep because they have to get up early the next day.

To take an example, in Darwin's voyage of the beagle, although dismissive of the cultural achievements of the natives of Tierra del fuego, at no point does he suggest that they are inherently inferior than Europeans, simply that they have not reached the same level of development. This thread of thinking is consistent in many of his observations about the native tribes in south America.  Similarly, if you look at 'the golden bough' by Frazer (nicknamed the father of anthropology) you'll see that he views tribal beliefs as primitive precursors of the religions of more developed societies. So in summary, although these people had little regard for the value of these cultures, they didn't think that these people were inherently inferior, just that circumstances had prevented to them from achieving what they believed to be the cultural zenith of European civilisation.

Why the mandatory use by governments? Well, in states with nationalised healthcare the case is significantly simpler. It is cheaper to assist dental health through fluoride in the water, than it is to deal with the long term health affects and damages that can arise without the assistance of fluoride.

With other countries, and all countries, the argument rests on the duty of the state to it's citizens. America has a lot of 'leave me alone' attitudes towards the governments (which exists in European nations, but is framed entirely differently), so there are avenues of anti-support for anything the government does to it's people. On the otherside is the idea that the government should do actions to assist and protect it's citizens, with these actions being balanced against the rights they infringe on.

Fluoride allows a pretty cheap way to improve dental health across the board, and the only right it infringes is the right to drink water without fluoride in. Seeing as this right doesn't have any benefits, and it is merely being reduced rather than removed (you can find water without fluoride if you really want), it is considered a fair compromise.

I have a number of cuttings, leaves and plants that I am happy to give away. :)

* Senecio articulatus plant
* Sedum spurium both the regular one and dragon blood (cuttings, some rooted)
* Sedum blue carpet
* Adromischus cristatus var Zeheri leaves. Roots easily
* ~~Gasteria possible little warty plant~~
* Kalanchoe blossfeldiana cuttings
* Kalanchoe daigremontiana plantets (tiny)
* Unknown Echeveria pups.  ~~I have something that looks like an Echeveria Metallica which is a couple of inches across~~ and many smaller pups of various things. 
* Hawothia retusa small pups.
* Crassula perforata both the regular one and the variegated kind. Cuttings.
* ~~Leaf from a pachyphytum bracteosum~~
* Crassula setulosa (clump)
* Anything else from my post history that you fancy. I might have cuttings though for the rarer plants though I would like something interesting to swap for.

I'll post some photos soon.

Postage costs:

UK 

£1 if I can fit the plant into a large envelope.

£3 for Royal Mail second class

£4 for Royal Mail first class

EU:
(depends on country but as a rough guide)

£4 for an estimated delivery time of 3-5 days but then the last parcel I send to Portugal took about two weeks to get there. This was the first time I sent something outside the UK and I would be happy to do again. :) (Parcel has to be under 200g else the postage costs are higher.)

Suggested donation to the /u/thecakeisnotalie succulent addiction fund* if you want more than a few plants: £1. :) All by Paypal.

 \* This is not a charitable cause. 

Edit:

Jol deserved more time to fix things after he did so well until then. He turned us into a team that consistently qualified from Europe. He bought players like Dawson, Huddlestone, Lennon and Defoe, who would remain the core of our squad for many years, including our CL qualifying year.

Redknapp led us to the Champion's League for the first time. He shaped the squad into a side that could demolish smaller teams (9-1 against Wigan, anyone?) and grind our results against bigger teams (AC Milan springs to mind). He didn't receive financial backing in 2011-12, and that stopped him leading us even higher.

Sherwood gave us our highest win ratio in premier league history. He brought through players, such as Bentaleb and Kane. He got Adebayor firing. He's now proving at Aston Villa that it wasn't a fluke. This sacking annoys me the most - he deserved a full season with the squad.

Both Japan and Korea are just beautiful places. I hope to spend a good deal of time in both countries in my life. If I had to choose one, I'd say Japan. Its culture is surprisingly well preserved: You'll still see girls wearing kimonos, the temples and shrines are actually used, there's sumo, origami, kabuki, the list goes on and on. I've been there twice and got culture shock both times. Korea on the other hand, just felt western from the moment I got off the plane.

In the UK, our minimum wage for all jobs is going up to just over $10/hr in October, and that's entirely out of the employer's pocket- there's no expectation for customers to make up the wages, not in restaurants, bars, nothing. Customary tipping here's about 10%, and that certainly doesn't happen everywhere- virtually never in bars/pubs (you might get the odd ""keep the change"").

You can get the 7 kWh battery for $3,500, and it comes with a 10 year warranty. 15 cents/kWh you store works out to 23,333 kWh usage over 10 years. That's an average load on the batteries of 266 watts or 6.38 kWh/day. Seems like a fair assessment.

However, if the difference between peak and off peak prices is 16 cents/kWh, you've saved yourself $233.33 over that 10 year lifespan. Every cent adds another $233.33.

However, the interesting thing isn't buying off peak and using the battery at peak hours. The interesting thing is using the battery to store the electricity your home solar cells are generating when you're at work and you have no need for it. At that point you **might** be selling it back to the utilities at 1 to 2 cents/kWh, but now you can store it and use it to power your house at night, when the sun isn't shining instead of buying the electricity from the utility.

And 15 cents/kWh is cheap once you start talking about European markets. I live in Denmark - private households pay something like $0.33/kWh when taxes etc. are paid. Now, obviously the price will be higher in Denmark than in the US. Assume it's 50% higher plus VAT (another 25%) and the price jumps from $0.15/kWh to $0.28/kWh.

You drink a lot of beer - definitely in top3 of the world (probably top1?). Pilsner Urquell is a nice beer if you like generic beer (well, most of the ""big concern"" beers are pilsners, so the ""father"" of the beer is the best. I think Pilsner was the first clear beer in the world).

You have a decent railway system since the country is generally small.

Czech movies are very hard to understand, the running joke is that a movie without any plot and with pseudo philosophical dialogue  is a ""Czech movie"".

Your favorite other country in the world is Slovakia. Slovakia is like a poorer version of Czech republic, but with tons of German owned car factories. I am not sure if Skoda cars are made in Czech or Slovakia (please note here I called you Czech, not Czech Republic. Czech Republic in general is a retarded name for a country and I think even you realize that and was considering changing the name to something else (at least in English)).

You are considered cowards that throughout history always become someone else's bitch (it is quite debatable if this strategy isnt that bad - you are generally alive and your towns were never ruined that much).

The ""Jozin z Bazin"" guy was a (crappy) internet phenomenon few years ago ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9MTGNaEXGM ). I think the guy is dead now..

Soviets invaded you in 1968 when you tried to have ""socialism with a human face"". You had a ""velvet"" revolution, what means that you did not really punish the communists for their crimes. That first president after fall of communism seemed to be a decent guy (he was smart, or at least that's how the press presented him), the later ones not so much.

Czechs are our neighbors and are generally liked, but most of people here seem to completely miss that Czechs completely despise us. We know that most of you are atheists, probably one of the most atheist countries in the world (after Estonia?), you think most people here are catholics (what is actually complete bullshit, most people are just baptized and dont give a flying fuck about the church, only like 40% people actually attend more than 1 mass per year).

You seem to do a lot of porn. Caprice is Czech I think. Same for Dessa Devil xD

I think you had some popular writers, I only have some book of Hrabal, that IMHO sucked and I never finished it, since it felt pretentious and boring.

I think you have a strong hockey team, or at least one that could compete with USSR.

Weed is legal in Czech Republic and people living near the border just cross it to safely smoke it there. You can have up to 5 plants or something like that.

I dont know much about your economy. I think you are like 80% of EU average when it comes to GDP. You got rid of the Korona and now use Euro. I dont know any of your big companies, I think one of your biggest rafineries was recently sold. Otherwise apart from Skoda and Pilsner I am not sure if I can name any other big company. Maybe Tatra, that makes those trucks with interesting chassises.

I think you are dependand on russian gas and Russians are pressuring you using their pipelines (are you a part of the ""Friendship"" pipeline? btw. what an ironic name..).

________________

**Thoughts** | First of all, people can try and analyse this game based on both team's first matches, but you simply can't, or at least not accurately as you simply never dind NA teams playing AU teams; however, I will do my best.  

All right, here's a a game i'm really excited for. Immunity played some great cs today and Liquid well, didn't. Although I didnt get to watch the immunity game live, I watched bits of the VOD and was really impressed. To me, they clearly showed that they have prepared for this tourney, their teamwork was great (pop flashing eachother, crossfires, etc.) and they even out aimed NiP at times. Needless to say, I was impressed and am really looking forward to see how they do against Liquid. 

Liquid, Liquid, Liquid; I do like their lineup, and I think they could make a bid for top 2 NA this year, but after their performance vs Fnatic, they're not going anywhere internationally. It really looked like they put no effort in to preparing for playing EU teams at all. Granted, Cobblestone is a map rarely played in NA games so you can't expect too much from them, but they couldn't even do the basics. Map control, it was all Fnatic's all day long. Even on mirage, a map Liquid are used to, they gave Fnatic every bit of map control they wanted and Liquid only won rounds by out-aiming Fnatic once or twice (Nitro). They never once tried a fake, tried to split the defence, they just chose a site, pushed half way and got slaughtered by Fnatic. It is worth noting that Elige had an off day with just 10 frags across 2 maps, so if he turns on tomorrow, who knows how it'll go. 

Conclusion: 

1. It is really hard to accurately analyse this game as NA and AU teams never face each other 

2. Immunity look prepared and motivated to perform well here while Liquid look like a newly formed pug, no strats or ambition. 

3. Elige had an off day and mas as well have been non existent today, but he has the potential to have massive games.

4.  While liquid did bring some rounds quite close, their post-plant play was silver like, peeking when they didn't need to etc.  If they keep that up, they're gonna struggle.

0,t3_34kd9c,False,brandysnifter,24,1432723692,"In addition to what others have posted, it is important to recognize that Hindustani both ultimately descends from [an early spoken form of] Sanskrit AND borrows from Sanskrit (especially in the case of Standard Hindi). In Indo-Aryan linguistics, the Sanskrit terms ""tadbhava"" (born from that), i.e. words that have evolved from Sanskrit through various stages over time, and ""tatsama"" (same as that), direct borrowing from Sanskrit, are useful in describing this. This results in many doublets where you have a Hindustani word coexisting with the Sanskrit term for the same thing, and often also a Persian or Arabic (or English/European) word. Each may have a unique connotation, where the Sanskrit is typically viewed as more formal, high-brow, ""pure"" or even ""Hindu"", and the Persian/Arabic more courtly or poetic or ""Muslim"".

For example, the tadbhava Hindustani word for ""farmer"" is किसान کسان /kɪsan/, versus the tatsama Sanskrit borrowing is कृषक کرشک /krɪʃək/, the root of which was the source of the tadbhava word.. In addition, you have the Persian loan, دہقان /dɪhqan/.

For ages, speakers of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages have incorporated Sanskrit loans in their vocabulary, but with the advent of standard prestige registers/dialects with fixed spellings in printed literature by the educated elite since the 18th century, Sanskrit loans seem to be more prevalent, and viewed as ""purer"".

Yelling ""fire"" in the crowded not-on-fire theater is also not illegal, as was made clear in Brandedburg v Ohio 1969.

The only speech illegal in the US is speech that is INTENDED to and LIKELY to incite imminent lawless action.

This means a homeless dude yelling ""fuck the police! let's kill them pigs!"" in all seriousness is not illegal. If that action does result in property damage, injury, or death, you will likely face your day in court, but the chances of it being criminal and not civil would be very small. (ie. You'll get the shit sued out of you)

Nor is a person people actually listening to saying ""fuck the police! let's kill them all!"" in a situation where a reasonable individual would recognize as not actually intending violence.

Now, if you have a bunch of people hanging on your word, and you tell them to kill a bunch of cops in seriousness, the powers that be would have reasonable cause to detain you.

Pretty much, by the time that that last scenario is at that point, you basically have a riot already, as the police coming in to detain the speaker will be spark, if the fire isn't already raging.

So, no, you can't say absolutely anything anywhere, but you can VERY WELL get close to it. The banned speech in the US is already bordering on illegal for reasons other than the speech itself.

Kind of like how brandishing a weapon at someone is enough to warrant a response before you action hit/stab/shoot them.

But I do know when. Both of them.

For most people it would be a fantasy, a dream come true. *Falling back 10 years into the past?* They'd say. *I could finally get Serena from corporate! Build the best football bracket ever! Hell, I could talk to Dad again!*

I don't build football brackets. Don't have a Serena. My father... well.

No, for me there was only a duty-- duty to my neighbors, to humanity. To myself.

People saw me as a success in the former timeline, but looking into the mirror-glass I saw only failure. I'd accumulated millions for myself with cute little companies that got bought up by bigger ones, and then gotten so *fucking* busy patting myself on the back that I'd lazed around while the world crumbled around me.

So when Time chose me as the fuckup who got a second chance to save the people who needed saving... how could I say no?

Sure, I missed a few. I was still only human, with a human memory; I couldn't have memorized the timing and location of every terrorist attack or natural disaster even if I had known I would be cutting through the web of time into the past.

But the collapse of the Chrysler Tower? Averted. The 2008 bombing of the Beijing consulate? Averted. The rise and literally nuclear fall of Albanian warlord Adnan Ovlev? Averted with prejudice. I had millions at my disposal, and Time on my side, and even I do not know how many hundreds of thousands of lives I saved.

To the public I showed only my inventive side, my economical side, bolstered by the knowledge of technologies and stock victories to come. I funded space exploration, publicized renewable energy technologies, and released as many patents as I could to fuel the scientific ingenuity that I knew lay in the rest of the world.

It's been ten years since I tripped into the past, and even though my foresight has at last run out, I finally feel as though humanity has broken through some kind of desperate bottleneck. There are no vast swaths of nuclear wasteland in this timeline, no despotic conglomerate ruling Western Europe, and we are closer than ever to leaving our cradle of rich, black earth for the serenity and purity of the stars above.

Not only are there a number of sources for the 10 million number, but there are also a number of sources in the sentences prior to that for mass rapes (the name of that section) and an explanation for why they were allowed:

&gt;In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline.[75] The German military command viewed them as another method of crushing Soviet resistance.[71] ... Rapes were allowed in practice by the German military in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared.[67][68] In Occupied Denmark, which initially agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany, rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them.[67] By contrast thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.[33] German soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women – and other women as well – with the words ""Whore for Hitler's troops"" and rape them.[69] Following their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide.[70] ",,0,False,,todayilearned,cqvokdh,,0,1,t5_2qqjc,t3_34ilcp,t1_cqvokdh,False,,1430533205

The US's job, both self appointed and because we're the only one nation strong enough, is to maintain the political Status Quo. To make sure each nation stays reasonably within its political power level. 

For example, right now Saudi Arabia and Iran are fighting a proxy war in Yemen. Iran is trying to blockade a straight, every important to trade. So the US has sent a carrier group to the area to show who the real Big Dick Swingin of the area is. [basically we're this dog](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-26911-dog-stops-catfight-gif-Imgur-OAkg.gif)

As well, the US maintains military alliances with dozens and dozens of countries. If you start a war with any of these nations, that means you are fighting America. The Military has to be ready to fight multiple wars at once. 

So if the US removes itself from its geopolitical position, there will be a power vacuum that no one country could fill. So expect a rise in regional tensions and possibly wars as the regional Powers push their boundaries of influence. Expect a more aggressive Russia and China. 

Europe would be forced to try to keep the balance, possibly federalizing the EU or at least creating a EU military to project power. This will not be popular with Europeans because of the cost but also because they will think it's neo-imperialism.

Ecuador uses Napoleonic Law. Everything has to be written out centrally, by the 'federal government' in Ecuador. Well, at least things like these. Also, Ecuador is not a federal republic, so it's not really called that, but I understand that Americans make a distinction between 'fed' vs other gov'ts. 

Your whole point is simply pointless here because that's the fundamental nature of most of the worlds' law systems. Only former British colonies use the common law, and most only use it partially. Only US, Ireland, UK, Australia and New Zealand use it exclusively, along with some minor Central American nations, Caribbean island and one continental one). Common law is an oddball in this world, as much as it may shock some Americans.

suarez scored 31 goals in 33 games for a liverpool team 2 or 3 tiers below messi's barcelona. neymar literally scores for fun with brazil, being well positioned to destroy pele's record at just 23 years of age. i'd say they can score just fine without messi.

&gt; Messi wants to score, but if a team mate has a better chance of scoring he is perfectly fine making the assist or allowing his team mate to score. His ability to create his own chances or finish chances given to him is better than Neymar and Suarez and that's why he scores more than them.

my point has nothing to do with messi's ability or selfishness, there is one stat that truly embodies the reason he scores more and it's called shots per game. messi takes, by far, the most shots in barcelona and is only second to cristiano ronaldo throughout the entirety of europe, possibly the world. clearly possessing messi's talent helps, but simply put it's his desire and will, his lust for goals what results in 50+ goals every season. he'd still be every bit as talented if he didn't want to score as much, but he'd certainly score less.

Did they all just fall on their faces from too much ""blaming the system"" ?  

The truth is that your ancestors that came to America did not receive the same treatment that freed black slaves received.  It's quite obvious to me that you don't even know the history of blacks in the U.S. after the formal abolishment of slavery.  I recommend reading Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon to learn a bit about the treatment of blacks in the south after slavery was ""officially ended""  

Also, Romanian slaves were not subject to the same treatment that black slaves (or even ""free blacks"") received from their slave masters and from American society as a whole.  The life of a Romanian slave is hardly comparable to the level of systematic oppression and violence that blacks in America had to endure.

Looking at the history of America, black people have only maybe a few decades of a fair degree of freedom and opportunity compared with white people.  Just because your ancestors were also slaves doesn't mean their history in this country is anything like that of African Americans.  

Try learning about the history of the people you talk about.

I expect part of the reason is that a lot more young people still live with their relatives in Brazil, and Japan is, on the surface, a very conservative place, so it needs to be kept hidden. (Hence the boards to hide licence plates.)

In Europe, young people move out of their family home at a young age, often to go to university, so they have their own places to do what they want in, so there's just less need for love hotels.

So, make some friends and go explore the city together or just play it cool and do it by yourself.

As for getting to Spain or France I would definitely take the train. When I travelled I had a Eurorail pass so I commonly used [their site](http://www.raileurope.com/european-trains/) to figure out train schedules. The website is good to see all the train schedules as all you have to do is scroll to the bottom and put in where you are, where you want to go and when you want to leave. It will show you the schedules and all you need to do is book it!(go to the train station or book online. 

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: have fun. You are in Amsterdam! So much good stuff. Enjoy!

In a kingdom, usurpation is easy because the people don't matter. Those who live outside the capital don't usually care about who is King or Queen, they care about their local feudal lord. They might not even hear about the regime change until months later. Capital dwellers, in the case of a kingdom, are fairly similar: local authority (like the mayor and bailiff) have a much higher impact. Sure, the monarch is living in a palace in the city, but this has usually more of an economic impact (employment, market luxury goods) because the monarch is ruling an entire country, possibly spending months outside the palace. Even the threat of a foreign King is not really an issue : it has happened quite often in European history (French kings of England and Norway, Spanish kings of the Netherlands, and so on). 

The usurper needs the support (or at least the wary acceptance) of the nobility (who have the power to throw him out or undermine his finances) and the administration (who are those that actually make the kingdom work). 

All of this goes out the window in a city-state, because the King is usually a much closer figure to the people, and foreigners are much less welcome. The good news is, most city-states have several powerful families that would love to have the throne for themselves, and would gladly cooperate with ""foreign aid"" in retaking the city from its ""decadent, cruel descendants of a good king of old"". Sure, this usurpation would give the power to a local house rather than the invading lord, but one would expect[*] the local house to be fairly co-operative with the lord afterwards.

[*]: an asshole move, which has occured fairly often, is that the invading lord would instead pretend to be a _mercenary_, allowing the usurping house to use his army on a long-term payment plan. Then, in the name of friendship, they would allow delays in payment for as long as the new monarch was co-operative. If the new monarch betrayed the foreign lord, this would be grounds for international action (debt is an acceptable reason to invade and ransack or ransom).

(currently me this week, poor college student, can't imagine trying to support a family on minimum wage). 

You bash several times on ""Socialist States in Europe"", Sanders ideology lines up with that of the Nordic Countries which have some of the wealthiest and most socially evolved countries in the world. They have free healthcare, education and have 3.9% unemployment[[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway )]. So if implemented correctly democratic Socialist ideas have been proven to work. 

Now I know USA is massively bigger then all of Scandinavian combined but we also have a proportionally large economy to fund such endeavors. 

Why is free college bad? It would lead to more opportunities for better jobs, or retaining in jobs where their is a need reducing unemployment, and it won't cripple fresh graduates under massive student loans giving them more spending money which would directly help the economy. I looked around and it would cost the government around 70B [[2](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/ )] to make tuition free for undergraduates. That is only 1.7% of our annual federal budget, which is less if you have states contribute.  

You say that free tuition would would cause class sizes to rise but thy are already extremely full already, 65.9% [[3](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/business/fewer-us-high-school-graduates-opt-for-college.html?_r=0)] of students already enroll in college directly after HS, free college won't change this by much. 

You know the major reason why terrorist want to bomb us? Because we keep sticking our nose where it doesn't belong in the middle east. I am all for being the top dog in the park, it ensures we have influence on a global scale providing security, a large top of the line military is necessary, but getting involved in every conflict around the world isn't providing security it is making enemies and providing situation where people hate us enough that they want to kill themselves by flying planes into buildings. 

You know why ISIS formed? because we left a wake of chaos behind us from Iraq that left a power vacuum. If we had not destabilized the region ISIS would never had gained the traction it did. But you know sure lets bomb the oblivion out of the region destroying vital infrastructure and destabilize the region. Like I said I am all for remain the top dog in the world but we have to stop involving ourselves in every conflict. 

If we took a percentage money going to the military complex and shifted to repairing our crumbling infrastructure then we would add thousands of jobs without having to bomb a region to oblivion. What is the point of the military if the entire country crumbles to the ground while its out playing war? Our roads and bridges are falling apart only held together by patch jobs and our telecom network is falling way behind the rest of the world. The world is at peace, MAD basically ensures this yet we still act like WW3 is right around the corner, it is time to shift our focus to rebuilding the home front. A strong infrastructure and industry will ensure our safety, what made us a powerhouse in WW2 and the cold war was our ability to mass produce. If that ability crumbles we will be less secure.

If think UKIP victory conditions are looking at coming clear seconds in 50+ seats.  The closer to a hundred improving the cheer.  De facto opposition in significant parts of the country.

Obviously the more MPs this time the better, but a virtually tied second place in 2009 allowed them to win in the 2014 European elections under PR.

I'm just gonna copy-paste an old post on this subject as it is quite relevant to this.
-----------------

There hasn't been ""pure"" socialism anywhere any more than there has been ""pure"" communism anywhere, so it's a little difficult to set up an example if you're after any kind of pure system.

We have historically tried somewhat pure capitalism (it was dystopic for many people, at first), but it begun working better, socially, when we started taking care of [market failures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act) and caring for the underprivileged with safety nets. Today, the US is lagging behind and fucking up things again by ignoring the problems with pure capitalism.

The closest thing we have to ""pure"" socialism, I would say, is [Norway's democratic socialism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) It still has many capitalistic features, of course, but it also has many socialistic features.

[Scandinavia in general](http://www.vexen.co.uk/countries/best.html) is pretty similar, as well.

In the 1920s, the economy was pretty bad in Europe, and the situation in Norway was no exception. In addition to dealing with the fallout of other nations' economic problems in various ways, Norway had mass-produced wares for World War I, and suddenly there was no demand (among other problems like increased inequality and lack of industrial materials). 

The deflation that followed was absolutely devastating, and no amount of individualism would solve the problem: the individual farmer or fisher had no other choice but to try to increase production to sell more, but that only drove the prices down and forced people to increase production even further. For the industrial worker, refusal to accept the much lower wages due to deflation resulted in strikes met by lockouts and strike breakers.

There was no other choice but to cooperate, and so people came together and formed the dairy product cooperatives, for example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tine_(company)

This forced cooperation throughout the workers due to the deflation crisis set the stage for what was going to be the Norwegian way of doing things even to this day.

[The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Confederation_of_Trade_Unions) became a prevalent force, and it has been closely connected to the Norwegian Labour Party ever since its inception (and they have extremely close ties even today in 2014).

Meanwhile in the 1920s, the extremely left-wing Labour Party in Norway went through a bit of a change and split up into various factions: the Communist Party, the Social Democrats, and the Labour Party.

In 1927, the party merged with the Social Democrats again, and they actually formed the government for 18 whole days in 1928. The king asked them to form government as they were the biggest party, but because Norway has negative parliamentarism, they were taken down by a no confidence vote by the Norwegian parliament: Stortinget. 

After this, they realized that complete reform was off the table, and so they calmed down their radical, revolutionary sentiment.

In 1933, they put out an [extremely well-done propaganda poster](http://i.imgur.com/PaiT7oy.jpg) all over Norway. 
(""City and land, hand in hand. The entirety of the people at work."")

They handily won the election as democratic socialists under the name ""The Norwegian Labour Party"", which is what they were called until very recently when they changed their name back to just ""Labour Party"". (DNA: Det Norske Arbeiderparti).

It wasn't until 1935 that they had a ""pure"" government, however, and since 1935 they have been in charge of Norway almost the entire time. The Labour Party took Keynes' new theories to heart, just as Roosevelt did with his New Deal, and things improved dramatically for Norway up until the German invasion.

The years after World War II are considered the ""golden age"" of the Labour Party with a supermajority control of the government. The prime minster from this period, Einar Gerhardsen, goes by the nickname ""Landsfaderen"" (the father of the nation) for his fantastic work in rebuilding Norway after World War II with the help of Keynes' economic theories.

After finding oil (the Ekofisk discovery in 1969 was a pivotal find), the profits were socialized through the state owned company Statoil in 1972, and the economy was boosted as a result.

This find helped Norway secure an emergency fund for lasting through crises, which is one of the major reasons why Norway has survived so well through the 2008 depression.

In total, there were only 16 years since 1935 that the Norwegian Labour Party was not in charge, and they have been socialistic the entire time.

---------

Now, a couple of points on Scandinavia. First of all, if you link me to historical revisionism from mises.org, I might punch you over the internet.

Furthermore:

1) Size is a poor excuse. A higher population makes things more difficult but by no means impossible. Besides, you could easily make the comparison of the EU as a whole compared to the US in arguments such as universal healthcare, etc.

2) Homogeneity is certainly helpful, but not anywhere near as important as racists claim. What's more important are factors that interact with and reinforce homogeneity across cultural borders: [equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI) and [overall peace.](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/global-peace-index) These factors play off of each other along with homogeneity, but to claim that homogeneity is the sole cause or something is ignorant.

3) The oil argument is libertarian / conservative propaganda.

The social safety net in Norway has historically been paid for by **high taxes**, not the Government Pension Fund (oil fund). If it were paid for by oil money, it wouldn't be sustainable in the least (the fund, even though it is huge, would be gone in a few short years).

It is against the rules to spend more than 4% of the fund per year. Since it is an emergency fund, it is taken care of well. Some years (like 2007), it's not touched at all and just grows.

It is a myth that it is simply oil money that lead to the success in Norway: sound fiscal policy, spread wealth, technology building, nationalization of the energy sector, high education, stable global region, close situation to the market, predictable and stable government, balanced mix between taxes and benefits...the list goes on.

Furthermore, Norway, ever since around 1850s, has never been poor in relation to other countries. Even before Norway found oil,  it had a better standard of living and GDP per capita than for example Sweden.

That Norway has historically been extremely poor is bad history that you'll hear all over the place, but **it is wrong.** If you want to argue this point, take it up with [this professor of economic history.](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Honningdal_Grytten)

Here's [one link to his book](http://www.nb.no/nbsok/nb/71b541ce552753e1f72b328437e87bad.nbdigital;jsessionid=06CDCD2F18069EDBDAC7027175119C53.nbdigital3?lang=en#0), but I'm not sure if you can access it.

Finally: **Sweden is also a very similar country to Norway, and Sweden is doing just fine without the oil.**

By 1300 slavery had been extinguished in southern France, if not quite yet in the lands of their Spanish neighbours to the south. 

By 1300 the wide gulf between Carolingian slavedom and free peasantry had narrowed and became, in custom and in law, a rather single entity: the peasant in servitude. But opportunity had also become more diverse with the development of technology and commerce. Southern France's position on the Mediterranean, with several important ports extant from antiquity (Marseille, Narbonne), had meant that import/export businesses never died off. But the south enjoyed a growth of towns perhaps faster than most other places in Europe in the 11-13th centuries. These towns were either brand new creations founded by either secular or ecclesiastical lords (*bastide* or *salvetat*, respectively) or based on Roman *oppidium* that had endured as villages. The rapid rise of towns was due to the huge growth of agricultural output and of commercial development it spurred.

These changes which spurred the growth of towns were founded on the lives of peasants, lives which changed in the 500 years between Charlemagne and the assertion of Capetian dominance over the French south. New lands were put to cultivation by more productive technology like 3 field rotation which made the earth more productive, horse collars which could pull faster and stronger, mouldboard plows which could turn heavier soil deeper, animal husbandry which resulted in greater animal variation to suit greater productivity. 

Where the Carolingian peasant lived in earth and wood huts, 500 years later they could be living in stone houses; stone pulled from the fields by peasants' deeper, stronger plowing...or the cast offs of limestone mines for the castles and churches that sprang up across the south and which the peasants also built. It was a multitude of towns and castles and churches: some 200 new stone towns in the south sprang to life between 1100-1300. These towns drew in peasantry to work there in trades and industry, or to live behind the protection of walls and farm the fields beyond during the day. 

So commerce and industry developed on the innovations of peasantry during this period such that the physical, agricultural world would have looked different over half a millennia.

But what of the spiritual world of the peasant?

The peasant of the Carolingian period, whether slave or free person, would have been Christian in name and identity. But in practice? They would have rarely been in a church or rarely seen a priest as we would know them, or as their descendants 500 years later would know them. By 1200 the Church was on a steady march into the souls of all the population, and perhaps no more so than the souls (and pockets) of the southern French peasantry.

The question of discipline of the average Christian in thought and action became paramount for the Church after 1000. Attendance to mass, sacraments like baptism and confession became obligatory and enforced by the 13th century. Marriage became subject to the Church. The entire life of the agricultural peasant in 1300 would have been enveloped by the Church (how effectively is another question).

And to add to the greatly expanded influence of the cathedral and monastery, by 1300 thousands upon thousands of potential heretic peasants of southern France would have been disciplined - interviewed, approved and/or corrected - by the inquisition: from Toulouse to Narbonne, Montpellier to the deepest Pyrenees.

The most recent data for HSV-2 was published in March 2010, based on a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey study performed between 2005 and 2008 by CDC. About 1 in 6 Americans (16.2%) aged 14 to 49 is infected with HSV-2. HSV-2 prevalence was nearly twice as high among women (20.9%) than men (11.5%), and was more than three times higher among blacks (39.2%) than non-Hispanic whites (12.3%).[8]

The most affected group was black women, with a prevalence rate of 48%. Prevalence increased with age and number of partners. Only 18.9% of those infected had previously been aware of their infection.[8]

African Americans and immigrants from developing countries typically have an HSV-1 seroprevalance in their adolescent population that is two or three times higher than that of Caucasian Americans.[9] Many white Americans become sexually active while seronegative for HSV-1. The absence of antibodies from a prior oral HSV-1 infection leaves these individuals susceptible to herpes whitlow, herpes gladiatorium, and HSV-1 genital infection. Primary genital infection brings with it the risk of vertical transmission to the neonate, and is highest if the mother contracts a primary infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. In the U.S. the number of genital infections caused by HSV-1 is now thought to be about 50% of first episodes of genital infection.[10][11]

In healthy adults, HSV-2 infection occurs more frequently in the USA than in Europe.

Seroprevalence rates in the USA appeared to be increasing, rising from 16.4% in 1976 to 21.8% in 1994.[12] However, this trend seems to have reversed itself in recent years, dropping to 17.2% in 2004.[13]",,0,False,,Advice,cqvxubo,,0,1,t5_2qjdm,t3_34k0gz,t1_cqvxubo,False,,1430565107

There will also “soon” be an agreement between Misrata and eastern tribes to the same end, he says

&gt;Destroying IS, he told the Libya Herald, is now the “top priority”, not just for Misrata but for the whole country.

&gt;“We need everyone to help in the fight against Daesh [IS]”, he said in Tunis before flying back to his home city today. “This is a war that has to be shared by all Libyans.”

&gt;Misrata’s 116 Brigade is currently battling IS in Sirte but facing stiff resistance. In Benghazi and Derna, it is the LNA that is fighting it.

&gt;The Warshefana agreed to join the fight against IS as part of the deal last month under which Misrata’s Halboos and Zawiat Al-Mahjoub brigades pulled their forces out of the fighting west of Tripoli, said Bushaga, himself one of the leaders of the Halboos Brigade. “We have promises from the Warshefana to help in the war,” he divulged.

&gt;He did not say if this meant that the Warshefana would send forces to fight in Sirte alongside the Misratans or help elsewhere. The Warshefana commander Omar Tantous has said that his sole objective is to liberate the Washefana area.

&gt;The west-of-Tripoli deal is being seen as part of Misrata’s moves to reposition itself in the current political crisis.

&gt;Bushagha himself points out that it is part of a bigger development.

&gt;There had been an agreement in Brak Al-Shatti between the Misratan forces and the Magraha, he noted, which likewise had ended fighting there. There would also soon be a similar agreement between Misrata and a number of tribes in eastern Libya. He did not say when or with whom, but again the fight against IS was the immediate prime aim.

&gt;Bashagha counters accusations of betrayal in Zawia following the Warshefana pullout. “It’s not true,” says Bashagha, insisting that the deal had been approved by Zawia beforehand. ‘It was a good deal,” and it had, he claimed, enabled the situation in the area west of Tripoli to stabilise.

&gt;In the same way, the Brak Al-Shatti deal had brought peace to that area. Misrata was actively working for unity between Libyans so that they could focus on the fight against IS.

&gt;Bushagha, along with other delegates in the Dialogue, had been in the Tunisian capital to meet EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.

Some background info:

The Warshefana are an anti-MB, anti-Islamist tribe from the area southwest of Tripoli. Like the Zintanis, they have chosen to side with the government in Tobruk. Dawn supporters accuse them of being Gaddafi loyalists (the classic) and of harboring criminals who rob travelers on the Libyan Coastal Highway. From another article: 

&gt; The resentment was tangible in Warshefana territory. Many said they had lost all faith in the media, which they believed were being used to stigmatise their tribe. “All this talk about azlam (Gaddafi loyalism) is wrong”, shouted Sheikh Nureddin, a tribal elder. “We are innocent civilians! This is the land of our ancestors and we are part of the nation. We are all brothers and stand with the revolution. Libya will not stabilise until Warshefana does!” Some politically involved members of the tribe were particularly outspoken. Faraj Sayeh, who was minister in the initial NTC government and now lobbies for a political reconfiguration, emphasized that Warshefanis were among the first to fight – and fall – on the rebel side in 2011. “Many in this area led the revolution, either here or in Tripoli, and I was one of them”, he claims. “The first revolutionary who died in Zawiya was Warshefani!”

&gt;[His brother] said Warshefana was wrongly perceived as passive during the revolution because the strong military presence made open rebellion impossible, but that many tribe members instead joined rebel forces elsewhere or fought secretly. “Fearing our influence, some began spreading lies about our tribe after the revolution”. Juma Sayeh firmly believes that the Warshefani resistance against [Tripoli] is legitimate: “The confrontation was imposed upon us. Our honour, our land and our families are at stake. We have no choice but to fight. We either win or die.”

&gt;“GNC members are transferring their problem out to the Libyan people, using the policy of divide and rule.” Juma Sayeh also portrayed it as the result of infighting between congressional factions crystallised around the political roadmap. Warshefana recently hosted a tribal meeting for the formation of a national council of elders, which some in Libya interpreted as an attempt to undermine the acting institutions. “We do not want to stage a coup”, protested Sayeh. “We only want to make sure there is no power vacuum in case the GNC falls.” According to Sayeh, the state is powerless while unlawful militias are dictating policy. He accuses them of being backed by the Muslim Brotherhood “and their radical Islamist allies”.",,0,False,Neutral,LibyanCrisis,cqvy75l,,0,3,t5_37mau,t3_34m31z,t1_cqvy75l,False,NEUT,1430566740

El Tribunal de Cuentas dice que las operaciones de crowdfunding de Podemos son 'alegales'



El presidente del Tribunal, Ramón Álvarez de Miranda, llama a regularlo y recuerda que en política no se puede hacer una colecta para recaudar fondos con una finalidad concreta.

El presidente del Tribunal de Cuentas, Ramón Álvarez de Miranda, ha señalado que la colecta ciudadana organizada por Podemos en Internet (crowfunding) para conseguir fondos para la campaña electoral de las elecciones europeas de 2014, en las que irrumpieron en la política española, no está recogida en la ley, pero cree que por ese vacío legal tampoco se puede sancionar a dicha formación política, como reclamaba el PP.

Álvarez de Miranda ha presentado ante la Comisión Mixta (Congreso-Senado) del Tribunal de Cuentas el informe de fiscalización de los gastos electorales de los partidos políticos en las europeas de 2014, que fue el primer examen realizado por la institución a la contabilidad de Podemos.
""Deficiencias"" e ""incoherencias""

En ese informe, el Tribunal de Cuentas detectó ""deficiencias"" e ""incoherencias"" en la contabilidad electoral de Podemos y apreció un ""descuadre"" entre los recursos declarados y los gastos electorales contraídos.

Podemos declaró haber recibido aportaciones por valor de 114.365,75 euros, que se corresponden con múltiples pequeños ingresos procedentes de personas físicas y jurídicas que el partido gestionó en su mayor parte a través de una plataforma de financiación colectiva o 'crowdfunding'.

Eso sí, el Tribunal de Cuentas detectó que casi la mitad de ese dinero no contó con la completa identificación de los donantes que requiere la ley: hubo 57 ingresos por un importe de 886,12 euros que incumplieron completamente la Ley Electoral por no contemplar ninguno de los requisitos de identificación que la norma requiere (nombre, DNI y domicilio), y otros 48.261,47 euros donde faltó alguno de esos requisitos legales.

La formación de Pablo Iglesias alegó problemas en el diseño del software de la plataforma de 'crowdfunding' y se mostró dispuesta a destinar dichas donaciones a la finalidad que el Tribunal establezca. El órgano fiscalizador dio por buenas las explicaciones y no vio motivo alguno para sancionar, pero aconsejó mejorar la aplicación informática para ajustarse a los requisitos fijados en la ley.

&gt; The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner.

There are wikipedia articles on this by country, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_from_Czechoslovakia

&gt; In the months following the end of the war ""wild"" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš on October 28, 1945 called for the ""final solution of the German question"" (Czech: konečné řešení německé otázky) which would have to be ""solved"" by deportation of the ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia.[3] The expulsions were executed by order of local authorities, mostly by groups of armed volunteers. However, in some cases it was initiated or pursued with the assistance of the regular army.[4] Several thousand died violently during the expulsion and more died from hunger and illness as a consequence.

Less documented are 1) the deportation of Germans *to Soviet Russia* as slave labor, mentioned in books like Against Their Will, and 2) miscellaneous ethnic cleansing of some non-Germans in central and eastern Europe, such as sending ethnic Poles to Poland, in order to create ethnically homogeneous states in Europe and ensure that national boundaries matched population boundaries so that there wouldn't be any more of this ""liberate our brethren in foreign countries"" excuse for war.",,0,False,Restore the Patriarchy,TumblrInAction,cqvyyw4,,1,125,t5_2vizz,t3_34lf4j,t1_cqvyyw4,False,,1430569685

Yes, but that's largely because the neo-liberal right wing has had a major uptick in the Eurozone. In the US you have a politically independent Federal Reserve which has followed a largely Keynesian policy, whereas in Europe the European Central Bank is ideologically controlled.

I don't mean to imply that current Western European fiscal or monetary policy is anything to emulate, far from it. Austerity is fundamentalist ideology of Eurozone apparatchiks. Europe would be so much worse off if the United States hadn't reacted appropriately and largely propped them up with their export demands.

For a good example of how a Sanders-style democratic socialist response to the financial crisis might look, see Norway - it is not an EU member, and had a left-wing government when the crisis hit. We went straight for ""shovel-ready"" public works to stop the construction industry which is always the first domino piece in a credit crunch, and became one of the only countries in the world to maintain a positive purchasing power growth throughout the financial crisis, with unemployment around 2%. And we got public works projects done in the best buyer's market possible.

Sweden, a very similar economy in many ways, had a neo-liberal government which saw unemployment rise to 10% and an exodus of youth to Norway greater than the exodus to the US during the late-19th, early-20th century.

&gt; and one could make the argument that European welfare state spending is only possible due to the US footing 70% of the bill for NATO.

There's an argument to be made for that but there are two aspects of that I'd clarify: First and most importantly, it's very important to note that democratic socialist systems understand how welfare spending makes a nation more competitive. 

This is why I'm so glad that the Sanders campaign is at least exposing American voters to some of the rationale behind Nordic welfare states. It's so fundamental to understand that social democrats don't consider a welfare state to be a luxury expense, but rather a vital, and extremely profitable investment.

There are a great many benefits - for example, people become more entrepeneurial when they are socially secure - not just because of the basics like health care being connected to citizenship rather their current job. If you start your own company and fail, you never have to worry about hunger or homelessness.

Our public day care, kindergarten and parental leave systems allow women the freedom to combine both career and family - the increased workforce participation of women alone are shown by credible statistical models to be a greater asset for the Norwegian economy than oil(!).

Now, as for NATO spending - sure! Europe does save money on that. Even though this doesn't apply nearly as much as it once did in the immediate postwar years, NATO does takes a load off Europe's back. But it's not a load anywhere near the magnitude that it might make or break a welfare state. Keep in mind that Sweden, one of the best examples of a Nordic welfare state, never joined NATO.",,0,False,,circlebroke,cqw0b3k,,0,10,t5_2tnz9,t3_34jbis,t1_cqw0b3k,False,,1430574082

In essence, he says that he never noticed that the death penalty ever frightened any of the people he was about to kill. So, I think we can scratch the ""it will scare the others"" argument.

However, I feel that there are people who are too dangerous to keep alive. OP mentions child-rapists and such, I'm thinking more of repeat offenders and the most dangerous psychos.
What's the point of keeping people in prison all their life, where they contribute nothing, cost a lot, might escape and kill again. Might as well kill them.

The US death penalty system (well, the justice system) is pretty fucked up, so you have plenty of innocent people. The dealth penalty in Europe, as I understand, was rare and there were no big ""actually he was innocent cases"". So the US ""he might innocent!"" argument doesn't apply.
I believe we did away with the death penalty as a populist gesture, a reflection of the fact that people have abandoned their responsibilities and that no one was really willing to take on the responsibility of killing someone, how ever much it was in the public interest (repeat child rapist).

If you want some options on what you can do once you're more familiar with the game, go with Druid. They can take on any of the four roles in the game (Tank, Healer, Ranged DPS, Melee DPS) and do each of them well. For example, if you level a Druid in the Balance spec (which is a ranged, spell casting, damage dealer) and you start to feel the itch to do more with your class, it's not too big a leap to switch over to Restoration and give healing a try.  
  
Basically though, just look at the races and classes and pick which one you think is cool.  That's what I did. I love nature etc, so I picked Druid and learned as I levelled. You - as many have said - learn the class gradually as you level up so you'll be able to easily get to grips with any of them.

They wouldn't really care, they worked as mercs before and there are billions of them on the planet, it wouldn't be strange for a few to go off planet and worked as a merc.

&gt;And then, of course, we learned that he wasn't a particularly trustworthy individual in general.

He was corrupt but he had no reason to lie to Kenobi about Jango Fett. If anything it would have helped him get rid of Death Watch if he was connected with them which would have made him look even better to the public so he could hold unto power. 

&gt;Yes, it's Lucas's intention that the Fetts not be Mandalorians. But it was also Lucas's intention that the emperor be a benevolent figurehead controlled by corrupt advisors and that Vader and Anakin Skywalker be two separate people.

Yes but one of them he actually stayed with for canon material and the other he didn't think it would fit in the long run. That is how you make a story and characters, hell the first star wars script was 
nothing like the movie. It goes through changes. From the very start Boba Fett and Jango Fett were never ever considered Mandalorians, that is a EU thing only. It's Lucas's creation and from the very start they were never meant to be mandos. 

&gt;Until we have an actual, definite statement (such as an alternative Canonical account of Jango's origins, or a statement by the Fetts) we can't say for sure one way or the other.

We can, already stated by Dave and Lucas who stated that any clone wars extras or unfinished stuff are canon and the fact that the prime minister himself said it as well. What you're doing it trying to find a loophole for Jango to stay a mandalorian and everything from the show to the creators themselves said they aren't. Even in the clone wars Boba Fett has never been seen together with a Mandalorian nor ever set foot on Mando. He got his helmet when he was with Cad Bane.

Also it goes with the canon Mandalorians in how uniformed their looks are and how they didn't want them to look different with different colors or armor and be treated like vagabonds (which Jango and Boba are). Jango and Boba tricked out their armor with a certain look that is different from the mandalorian armor. 

For your **headcanon** he can be a mandalorian all you want but **actual canon** he isn't.

&gt;When the film was first released, several Australian animal rights organizations raised allegations of animal cruelty during filming and called for a boycott. The Sunday Mail reported at the time that Animal Liberation Queensland founder Jacqui Kent alleged the killing of more than 20 kittens during production and added that she was disturbed by reports from Europe which alleged other animals had been injured, as in one case where a producer allegedly had broken a cat's paw to make it appear unsteady on its feet. Other scenes that were the source of controversy were the scene of a kitten flying off a cliff and a scene of a pug fighting a bear. Kent said her organization had a number of complaints from people who had seen the film and were concerned that it could not have been made without cruelty. The Tasmanian and Victorian branches of the RSPCA also alleged abuses.

&gt;The film was reported to have the approval of the American Humane Society, despite not having their officers present during filming.

&gt;The American Humane Association attempted to investigate cruelty rumors through ""contacts in Europe who normally have information on movies throughout the world."" While noting that the contacts had also heard the allegations, they were unable to verify them. The organization also reported, ""we have tried through humane people in Japan, and through another Japanese producer to determine if these rumors are true, but everything has led to a dead end.""

This is the most pressing issue.. The energy industry is pushing fast tra ck because of the TTIP energy chapter which would be a disaster for Americans, potentially forcing the elimination of any local state and national laws in dozens of countries which stand in the way of corporations goals on innumerable environmental issues, including known to be dangerous agricultural and industrial chemicals, endocrine disruptors, methane, and fracking.. 

It could also make a lot of housing really expensive to live in because of energy price increases for heating (natural gas) and electricity. Winter months do not have solar energy in large enough quantity to use it for heating homes. Wood burning causes lung deseases and lowered IQ. Coal has mercury and other issues.. Sure, prices in Asia are six times those in the US, but export of natural gas has been barred since the 1970s and Americans homes are not ""passivehaus"" designed- they need energy to be warm enough to live in. Suddenly selling off that energy to the highest bidder and subjecting it to WTO jurisdiction would be among the dumbest possible things this country plans to do in these three really horrible free trade agreements they are planning to sneak through. 

[Putting drilling and fracking in irreversible trade](http://www.iatp.org/blog/201405/no-green-jobs-for-you-secret-eu-us-trade-agreement-threatens-minnesota%E2%80%99s-solar-rebate-an) deals- [like they want to do with TTIP](
http://www.tni.org/sites/www.tni.org/files/download/nofrackingway.pdf) - is insanity-   It will kill jobs. 

Its an example of the deceptive tactics of PR pros - how they are trying to mislead Americans on these three trade deals, and the FIVE YEAR fast track bill.

Selling off something simply to increase the price you can get - when it is needed by the country, Selling off a vast natural resource, if it has the cost of suddenly, hugely increasing the costs for Americans of heat and electricity, (which is inevitably what it would do because the price elsewhere s so much higher) is wrong, because it also will increase greenhouse gases and the large cost increases due to deregulation of export may result in potential dislocations of lots of people.. In other words, it will amplify the global warming problem because it would release all that energy which otherwise would stay in the ground and likely within ten or fifteen years it would no longer be needed.. But it is needed now.. Also, where would millions of Americans move to if their apartment buildings suddenly were deemed too expensive to heat or renovate?

Methane is one of the worst greenhouse gases. Its been responsible for huge climate changes in the past.

We have tons of research showing innumerable things about methane's effect on global warming (&gt;80 times more than CO2) also innumerable problems related to fracking and drilling operations - for example the many waste products released, as well as natural radiation hazards which are brought to the ground, and their dangers.

I have never had problems being visible, on the contrary, I feel cars give me a lot more space than they do normal bikes.

Do remember that you have to impose yourself on the road, but that's just like with any other bike.

For locking it, it's no more difficult than a normal bike. I always Park in a busy place, people are curious, so they're always watching it. It would be very hard to steal a trike unnoticed. (and unlike normal bikes, they're not as easy to sell, so they're not as attractive for thieves). At home it's locked up.

My trike is my only form of transport, I don't own a car anymore. I commute to work and do my shopping with it.

On another note, the expedition is a tough piece of kit, I did a lot of off road with it, and it still looks new after 8000 miles and 18 months of ownership. Only things I've replaced is a chain and a derailleur. (and tires of course!)

Nordic countries in general are politically most definitely (still) an amalgam of both Western capitalism and Social Democratic Welfare State which has its ideological and historical basis on Communism.

In FInland the division between The West and The East could have not been clearer when the Iron Curtain was still being held up. And now that the Russian Nationalism is rearing its head once again with the backing of the Russian Orthodox Church, the division between the West and the East is once again more apparent than it might have been in minds of most of the West in the mid- and late 90's. Despite the efforts, Russia was never Westernized, nor did it develop a western Democracy, nor did it become a Western capitalist society, unless that concept is extended to include Cleptocratic Oligopolies after the fashion of Robber Barons.

The Nordic countries can't be said to be that well and far away from the cultural influence of the United States so much so that they're in completely different cultural spheres and worlds apart. During the era of Communist Russia the division between the West and the East could be said to have followed religious division lines, at least here in Finland WW2 had quite a bit to do with good Christians opposing The Atheistic East.

Consequently religon and religious conflicts still define much of the divisions between East and West, but now it is increasingly secular and atheistic Europe that finds itself between fundamentalist religious cultures with imperialistic tendencies on both sides. This however does still not separate United States into its own hermetic cultural sphere, influences still bleed through both ways across the Atlantic, as much as they did after WW2.",,0,False,,changemyview,cqw37ce,,0,7,t5_2w2s8,t3_34midx,t1_cqw37ce,False,,1430581229

McDonalds not a culture? The idea of fast food originated in America, and has since spread. The most popular of this is McDonalds. People from Asia to Europe know what a happy meal is. Just because something is advertised in another country and picked up, doesn't make it not spreading culture. If something originates in America, become part of our very culture, then spreads to another country, the way it spreads doesn't make a single fucking difference.

Superheroes in my setting are mix between crime-fighters and celebrities. They are sponsored by big companies and since it's completely controlled by government, superheroes have to possess sufficient rank in alchemy (phlebotinum of my world).

&gt;Are there actual real-life superpowers? 

Around 85% of European Federation's population has access to alchemy, which can be used even with mobile phone. It's capabilities vary from reheating soup to vaporizing city.

&gt;Are there aliens/mystics/beings from alternate dimensions?

Nope, only humans.

&gt;Are superheroes a new phenomenon? Are they as old as time?

Superheroes (along with alchemy) are relatively new phenomenon, cause they are present from few generations.

&gt;How has the culture adapted to superheroes? Are they still trying to adapt?

Superheroes are widely recognized celebrities and they are worshipped by masses (and used by big corporations to control said masses).

&gt;How are superheroes chosen or created?

&gt;Is it genetic? Environmental? Both? Neither?

Most of society can use alchemy and people as children are accustomed and trained in it with addition of drug therapies to expand their consciousness.

It's both genetic and environmental. Genes determine brain's computing capacity, which is indispensable, since alchemy bases on caster's calculations. Environmental part is for escaping price of alchemy, the loss of willpower. The more you are cut from reality, the higher is your Expression Strength parameter and in consequence casting is less draining for your will and motivation. That's why everything what is starnge is welcome in Europe. Also some families and institutes practice tortures (both physical and mental) on children.

&gt;Are there supervillains? What makes them supervillains?

Yes, supervillains are all superpowered people, who live outside system, so henchmen, psychopaths and heroes-freelancers.

&gt;Is it legal to have abilities? Is it legal to be a superhero?

Yes, I would say it's less legal to not have abilities, since powerless people are heavily discriminated against. And to be superhero, you have to register yourself in appropriate department and find sponsor. Freelancers are treated like villains.

&gt;Are there logical limits on powers? What are the types of powers?

Yes, my power system is rather hard, though metaphysical. Main limit is Law of Equivalent Exchange. You cannot create from nothing and you cannot unmake anything. Alchemy is still bounded by data/energy conservation. Also there is cost of it's usage in form of willpower loss. The more you use it, the less you care.

&gt;Is there a really great power that everyone would want?

Joker class powers, known also as ""absolute"" powers. They're considered immeasurable and don't have upper limit. There is currently five people on that level in the world.

&gt;Are there drawbacks to having some dope abilities?

Nope, powers are not random and can be selected, though most of people have some field, in which they specialize.

&gt;How are superheroes treated? Are they freaks or are they rockstars?

As I said before, they are celebrities.

&gt;Are there mediocre versions of superheroes in the same way that there are mediocre versions of people?

No, mediocre people cannot become superheroes, since that job has high alchemical rank requirement.

&gt;Tell me a little about a protag. What do you know of this person?

I have three protagonists. First is student of alchemical highschool and member of Sidekicks - youth organization of aspiring superheroes. He tries his best to become fully-fledged hero, but his power rank is not enough for any corporation to even consider him.

Second one is female cape in mid 40s, who is rather celebrity than hero. From the childhood she was pampered, only child and that made her quite egocentric.

The last one is incompetent, street-smart dork, who get high position due to family's conections. Though his job, despite looking completely safe, turned out to be spectacular failure. Now he tries to keep his position by any means necessary (maybe aside from killing).

&gt;Introvert or extrovert?

Due to cutting from reality stuff, people in my setting tend to be more introvert.

&gt;What are some features and limits of their power?

&gt;What can they do? What can't they do?

First protag is Jack rank alchemist and his abilities focus on electromagnetism and he can use it to generate lighting, climb the walls, boost hacking, move ferromagnetics or cause pain in people, though his abilities are not exceeding firearms in terms of raw power. Also he is an esper and he can see EM fields.

Second one is King rank alchemist and tends to use mostly pyrokinesis, in which she excels. She can wreck buildings with explosions, put things on fire or raise heat in wide area. Aside from that she uses basic stuff like telekinesis or flying.

Last one is Spot rank (the lowest one) alchemist and can e.g. reheat soup, dry his hair or pull soda can from table to himself.

&gt;Are there things that they could possibly do with their power, but probably won't or can't because it's simply too difficult?

Well, in my setting everyone knows own capabilities, so rather no.

&gt;Imagine a being or group of beings, which once were normal persons, who now have abilities/powers/curses/blessings that have evolved far beyond the entire world's control - they are the limit of what is known to be possible. What are they like?

So normal guy gets Joker rank power, so he/she would raise own status and material situation. I would imagine said character to be rather arrogant and act like nouveau riche.

&gt;Does this character exist in your world? If not, why not?

Not a chance. If you were born weak, you will die weak. Power is determined by genes. People hit their limits as teenagers and then cannot raise it anymore. Theoretically it is possible to ""level up"" by mental desing surgery, but it's precarious and rarely effective.

&gt;What is or was the farthest-from-control that a person or group with abilities could be?

Manhattan Massacre - when some freelancer heroes caused many causalities and massive property damage during their battle with villains.

&gt;How does society react to this?

&gt;What was or could be the fallout of such a world-shaking point in history?

Freelancers are no more legal and heroes are strictly controlled by government and corporations.

For the second point, its just a matter of knowing American history. I'm no expert but here is what I can tell you. For example, many don't know that the Spanish came to America long before the English. I am from a city that was founded the 16th century. The capital of the state I am from, NM, is older than Phildelphia or the Constitution. The Spanish brought us our language, food, and metal. Over the hundreds of years that passed they intermarried with the natives and as a result the state has its own culture. The family names are incredibly old. You can trace the original areas of Spain a family came from by many of the surnames. In fact, my mothers family is of mixed Basque/native blood. :)  This is just the state I come from, that I have knowledge on. I'm sure someone from Louisiana can give you some history on the French communities and culture that is very very strong there to this day.  
America (quite horrifically) imported slaves from all over Africa. Later, we had the Chinese come over in great numbers to build our railroads. As a result, we have communities that are shaped by these cultures, while not being inclusive to them. Our black community gave us much of our defining culture, style and music which has since been exported world-wide. Our large cities have pockets of every corner of the globe within them. I now live in Los Angeles and as I mentioned before in a post, one neighborhood here (just *one* neighborhood, mind you) is home to the most ethnic Koreans outside of Seoul, S. Korea.  I can name areas of town that are nicknamed after the historical migrant communities that live there... Little Armenia, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Bangladesh, Little Ethiopia, the list goes on and on. Don't forget the millions of Mexicans and South Americans here also. And these are just the areas I know about, in a city of 14 million people, an area of 400 or so square miles. This is only the second biggest city. New York is arguably far more diverse.
The Northern part of our country is full of ethnic Scandinavians. My grandparents on my fathers side were German and Swedish, from North Dakota. The East Coast is chock full of European heritage, they brought that here. Not only the English who settled, but the waves of Italian, Irish, Jewish and German and Dutch people who came as well. Then, we have our indigenous people from all over the continent. My mothers mom is part Navajo. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Europe has no ""native"" people other than the Basque and the Samii. In America we had thousands of tribes with incredibly diverse language and culture. They looked different, had different societies, etc. Today, we have far fewer in number, but the culture left still exists in a lot of areas where they were eradicated. 

America is a huge melting pot. We, as part of our mission statement, open our arms to other cultures. Europe is a lot more inclusive. ",,0,False,,worldnews,cqw566e,,0,-35,t5_2qh13,t3_34lnbr,t1_cqw566e,False,,1430585256

&gt; best academic research

Subjective opinion. I could say Germany has the best academic research, or France, or Greece, or Russia etc. - I could even go for the Nordic Countries. Doesn't mean that I have an ounce of evidence to back any of that up.

&gt; Bill Gates/Zuckerburg/etc,

I'm not sure what criterion you're using here - is it ""We have famous people"" or ""Our famous people are businessmen""? - but, taking the second criteria, only [19 out of the top 63](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue) companies are U.S. based/owned, and if you are to argue the entrepreneurship of these men that meritocratic myth of a perfect correlation between wealth of a person and how great their country of birth is fails as soon as you realise that the Mexican Carlos Slim is constantly vying for top spot in the World's Billionaires list. I would hardly say that Mexico's infrastructure is at all noteworthy, would you?

&gt; Ah clinging to the past... Too bad they don't produce influential theories or figures like they used to... Sure, there was a time when only ancient greek theories and figures were studied as well... But you are right, french and german academies used to have great reputations. Hell french was once the lingua franca of the world. But that's all in the past. :(

Pick me a field, I'll find you an influential German or French person. You say this is ""in the past"", but I see it as very much in the present day as well - in my own field, the dismissal of modern intellectuals such as Habermas, Bourdieu, Beck, Fischer, Skocpol, Castells, Elias,  Bauman, Latour, Sassen or Wallerstein (I could go on) would be seen as utterly ridiculous and absurd. 

In fact, when American Charles Murray was paid by Rupert Murdoch to go to Britain and tell Britain how to improve American-style (basically, condemning working-class people, mothers and the unemployed), he was correctly debunked and vilified.

&gt; Kinda unfair since britain is a tiny island and america is young as a nation.

Britain has the third largest population in Europe and owned the largest empire to ever exist in the whole of mankind; America has the world's highest nominal GDP which is almost double that of second-place China. In regards to both of their relative strengths, they've been mediocre at best.

&gt; I'm sorry britain only produced the likes of newton and darwin and introduced physics and biology along with the industrial revolution to the world.

Compare to Germans Einstein, Planck, Heisenberg and (Austrian) Schrödinger for modern physics; the German Kepler, Polish Copernicus or Italian Galileo for classical physics. 

As for biology, Darwin (who built on the theory of the French Lamarck) - as I'm sure you know - was known primarily as a man who inspired Spencerian Social Darwinism which ultimately manifested itself in a number of euthanasia and sterilization programs across the world and culminated in the Holocaust. Aside from him, we have the Austrian Mendel, the French Pasteur (although I know how touchy you Americans get about vaccinations) and the Swedish Linnaeus.

&gt; And I'm sorry the US has only managed to land a man on the moon

-cough- Soviets -cough-

&gt; and invented the internet, modern computers, etc. I'm sorry the last great anglo-american cooperation ( Church-Turing thesis ) introduce computer science to the world.

[Need I remind you what happened to Turing?](http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/part8.html) 

I digress, though. Jaquet-Droz, a Swissman, invented the first automata which provided the very precursor that made the idea of a computer seem possible, and Turing drew heavily on the works of the still-esteemed Austrian mathematician Gödel in creating the computer. I'll concede that the internet was solely an American invention, but only insofar as it began as a security network for DARPA that later evolved into a commodity for public use.",,0,False,,education,cqw5qk8,,0,-1,t5_2qhlm,t3_34if2f,t1_cqw5qk8,False,,1430586353

By the summer of 1939, German factories were turning out only 30 heavy field howitzers per month.115 The manufacture of all kinds of ammunition was so limited that when war broke out in September, the army only had enough stockpiled for six weeks of combat. The air force had a three-month supply of light and medium bombs and no reserves of heavier calibers. Considering that most weapons are a means of delivering projectiles to a target, an insufficient store of ammunition decisively influences their effectiveness.
Hitler used the armed forces first as an instrument of diplomacy. He told General Erhard Milch in 1938, “No one asks about whether I have bombs or how much ammunition I have. All that matters is the number of airplanes and cannons.""116 During 1938, Germany produced less than one-sixth the munitions its plants would manufacture throughout the war year 1944.”


Doesn't sound like They were rearming at all. All of the European powers were aiming up at a much higher rate than Germany was during those years, which shows you who really was planning for war.

 
“Military commanders met with Hitler in November 1938 to discuss coordinating rearmament among the three principle service branches. One German military historian summarized, “The vague instructions as to how these as yet unspecified armaments objectives were to be realized over the next several years, do not suggest that Hitler at this time expected to be at war just three quarters of a year later.""121 Between September 1937 and February 1939, German firms holding arms contracts filled only 58.6 percent of the orders.122 During 1938, barely nine percent of German industry produced military wares.123 The amount increased as the war approached, reaching around 15 percent by the end of 1939, though some estimates are slightly higher. England by contrast, spent 15 percent of her budget on rearmament in 1935 and 38 percent during 1938.124 The economist Dr. Anja Bagel-Bohlen concluded that the Reich’s “arms production in reality never received unrestricted priority in the economy as it appeared.... The German industry was in no way prepared for an extended confrontation with the enemy’s industrial potential.""125”

---

&gt;Hornets, like many social wasps, can mobilize the entire nest to sting in defense, which is highly dangerous to animals, including humans. The attack [pheromone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone) is released in case of threat to the nest. In the case of the [Asian giant hornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet) (*[Vespa mandarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa_mandarina_japonica)*) this is also used to mobilize many workers at once when attacking colonies of their prey, [honey bees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bees).  Three biologically active chemicals, 2-[pentanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentanol), [3-methyl-1-butanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-methyl-1-butanol), and 1-methylbutyl 3-methylbutanoate, have been identified for this species. In field tests, 2-pentanol alone triggered mild alarm and defensive behavior, but adding the other two compounds increased aggressiveness in a [synergistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy) effect.  In the [European hornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_hornet) (*[Vespa crabro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa_crabro)*) the major compound of the alarm pheromone is 2-methyl-3-butene-2-ol.

It quoted the American military attaché, Commander Gade, as promising Poland 1,000 airplanes “as soon as the war begins.” The Polish staff officer described Gade as “a man who enjoys the confidence of Roosevelt and is a personal friend of his. . . . He is very unfriendly towards Germany. Personally he is very wealthy.""239”

“Another document the Germans brought to light was a report by Count Jerzy Potocki, the former Polish ambassador in Washington, about a conversation he had had with Bullitt in November 1938: “About Germany and Chancellor Hitler, he (Bullitt) spoke vehemently and with great hatred. . . . The United States, France, and England must rearm tremendously in order to be in a position to cope with German power. Only then, when the moment is ripe, declared Bullitt further, will one be ready for the final decision. . . . In reply to my question whether the United States would take part in such a war, he said, 'Undoubtedly yes, but only after Great Britain and France had made the first move!'""240 Ribbentrop presented the original Polish foreign policy letters to the international press for inspection. The editor of the American edition of the German White Book, which published 16 of the letters in English, concluded, “It is likely that they are authentic documents. This is the opinion of many Washington correspondents, including Sir Willmott Lewis of the London Times, who might be expected to be skeptical of them.""241 Roosevelt and Hull publicly claimed that the Polish documents were forgeries.”

“During this time, the White House focused on persuading Congress to amend the 1937 neutrality law. The law imposed an embargo on the sale of war materiel to belligerents in Europe. Already in September, the president had managed to have the restrictions partially relaxed. As a result, U.S. arms manufacturers sold $4,429,323 worth of ordnance to France that month, and $1,422,800 to England.242 Germany’s share in armaments purchases from America, according to the State Department Bulletin of October 28, 1939, was $49.243 By the close of 1940, Britain had purchased $2.7 billion in arms from the United States. Roosevelt told a cabinet member, “We have been milking the British financial cow, which had plenty of milk at one time but which has now about become dry.""244The president speculated on how to keep the British at war “until their supply of dollars runs out.""245”

“GiselherWirsing, editor of Germany’s popular Signal magazine, made this observation about the arsenal of democracy: “The armaments business has grown to one of the worst rackets in American history and has amassed billions in profits through this 'trading in death.' During 1940, there was an enormous increase in dividends. According to an exhibit of the National City Bank in New York, the clear profit of around 2,600 shareholding companies in 1940 amounted to $4,253 million, compared to $3,565 million in 1939.""246 Congressman Fish recalled, “Roosevelt’s war cabinet had a great deal of cooperation from the powerful Eastern press, largely for war. . . . Pro-war propaganda was heavily financed by the international bankers, armament makers, and big business, numerically few in numbers but exceedingly powerful in financial resources and control over vast publicity and propaganda.""247 Reverend John McNicholas, the Archbishop of Cincinnati, remarked in January 1941, “Ten percent of our people are cunningly forcing the United States into a world conflict, while the majority of 90 percent, which is for peace, stands aside silently and helplessly.""248”

There is another one, but it's usually footed by the city/county (E) injured while in custody or during the course of a crime, where officers request you be brought to the hospital.

We cannot legally take you to the hospital when you do not want to go. For us that's purely a ""sign an fly"" incident, where you sign a waiver saying we told you a hospital is the best place to be and you declined. We like these, because there's little to no paperwork involved. All you've got to do is open your mouth and say ""I'm refusing treatment"" and we've got to stop unless someone with legal documentation can prove you're not capable of making that decision on your own. 

Most combination fire/rescue departments do not bill the individual either. Private services will bill the insurer and the individual, but municipal agencies usually eat the cost or bill insurers.

&gt;

&gt;__Carnival__ (see other spellings and names) is a festive season that occurs immediately before the [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian) season of [Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent). The main events typically occur during February. Carnival typically involves a public [celebration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebration_(party\)) and/or [parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade) combining some elements of a [circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_(performing_art\)), masks and public [street party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_party). People wear masks during many such celebrations, an overturning of life's normal things. The celebrations have long been associated with heavy alcohol consumption. 

&gt;The term *Carnival* is traditionally used in areas with a large [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) presence. However, the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines), a predominantly [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic) country, does not celebrate Carnival.  In historically [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran) countries, the celebration is known as [Fastelavn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastelavn),   and in areas with a high concentration of [Anglicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicans) and [Methodists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodists), pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on [Shrove Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrove_Tuesday).  In [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox) nations, [Maslenitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslenitsa) is celebrated during the last week before [Great Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lent). In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the [Advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent) season or with harvest celebrations of [St. Martin's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Day).

&gt;[Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro)'s carnival is considered the world's largest, hosting approximately two million participants per day. In 2004, Rio's carnival attracted a record 400,000 foreign visitors.

has to be encrypted, with a strong crypto-algorithm. My trust

abused by several national and international secret services from the governments in Europe and in the USA.

This is why I strongly believe, that we have to encrypt.




&gt;And that guarantee is not possible when the encryption software you're using is not open source.

And that guarantee is **not possible** 
~~when the encryption software you're using is not open source.~~

Here, I fixed that. Even if the code is open source, nobody can guarantee that my communication is safe. As I said earlier, quantum encryption is the closest to *guarantee*
we will ever get. But it still isn't 100,00% safe.

You are completely right that for software like ToR the review by the community works relatively good, because some very good developers and security experts are reviewing the code in a regular base.

*BUT:* 
I am sure that the code quality of ToR would be *much* 
better, if a few (~5-10) people would do the coding for this project as their full-time job and not as volunteers and errors would *often*
be prevented before they even happen. That it still would be a good idea to let some specialists review the code is correct.

*BUT No2:*
As I said, for ToR the open source thing works fine, because there are enough skilled people behind it. Of course, I would love to see the source code of Threema to be published, but I understand their point: If they would publish the source code, they would have to choose a license which is not compatible with the open source standard (because they would obviously like the people to buy Threema), the compiling is only allowed if you paid the normal price for the app, they would have to look out for license violations etc...

And: I still trust Threema, I don't trust the secret services and I don't trust certain companies (eg Facebook), but I trust Threema *that they really encrypt my messages and implemented NaCl as intended*
. Otherwise I would never have bought it.



Ah yeah, one more thing, the cryptography itself is open source and was reviewed by some experts, so the only risk is, that threema could send messages without using the NaCl they claim to use, but this can easily be checked without seeing the source code.",,0,False,Mod,Threema,cqw8doq,,0,-1,t5_30if2,t3_34kezx,t1_cqw8doq,False,mod,1430591364

Adjusting to European society meant that they were forced to abolish their entire life-ways.  If China invaded right now, forced you into slavery, made you learn Chinese, beat you and your children for speaking English, forced you from your land onto a reservation.  Reservations that are in the middle of nowhere by the way.  If you were lucky enough to have a resource, such as oil, your group was forced off in the middle of the 20th century to another area so that someone of European descent could take that resource.  Think of where reservations are, the middle of the desert, northern Minnesota/North Dakota/Michigan, the middle of the Everglades.  These were not exactly resource abundant in the modern economy.  The Irish and Italians came to major economic areas like Boston and New York, and built wealth by working for already wealthy Irish and Italians who came to exploit a growing economy.  This certainly took more than three generations to build a base.  Historically, where do I begin.  Here is an example from Canada.  The Potlatch festival was banned, and at least 22 people arrested up into the 1960's for participating in their own cultural event.  It was viewed as un-Protestant and un-Capitalist to Potlatch.  This was in an area where people had so much wealth from natural abundance, that the Potlatch was developed to give it all away.  You may be familiar with the Trail of Tears in the United States, that was a big one, but this was just a consequence of overall policy against American Indians.  Again, keep in mind that this was a population that was already decimated from zoonotic disease when the Europeans began establishing their colonies North America.  Protection Acts don't really begin until the 1970's and 80's, which is one generation.  Those that have autonomy from the government were able to develop casino gambling, which is great if you are in a major population area, like the Seminole.  Doesn't help you much if you are in the middle of North Dakota.  I've gone on too long already, since I'm sure you won't care.

When the natives saw people coming from the sea, they expected more friendly foreigners bringing them exotic fruits and materials to trade. That is why Columbus found golden spear tips amongst the natives who said they had gotten them from previous visitors and when the gold from these spears was later tested, it was found to have originated in western Africa. 

Columbus, or at least some of the people involved in sending him on this trip, knew these facts all too well. They had the world maps showing the American continent with great detail that was left behind by the Moors (Africans) who had occupied Spain for 500 years prior.

The constable in the UK doesn't count because he's just one constable and Jan Slota doesn't count because he's a ""known racist"", never mind that he's a politician who has served multiple offices in a European country.

Wow, you've ruled out quite a lot of examples with this ""Doesn't count"" strategy. It almost seems like whenever you are presented with any example of racism of Europe your response will always be, ""Doesn't count."" Tell me again about ""being disingenuous and blindly defending your country.""

I never said America did not have serious problems with racism. There are there and they need to be pointed out and put on display. But don't come in here bragging that Europe has less racism than America. There's plenty of places around the world to point out serious problems with racism, including Europe. I can only hope that you do not represent the typical European by the way you downplay and try to sweep under the rug the racism problems in Europe as insignificant. By ignoring and minimizing the racism in your backyard, you are helping it remain.

Here's a few more examples for you to discount :

&gt; Into 2010 and problems of racism in Italy continue. For example, a wave of violence against African farm workers in southern Italy left some 70 people injured. This resulted in police having to evacuate over 300 workers from the region. The workers were easy targets being exploited as fruit pickers living in difficult conditions. They earn “starvation wages” according to a BBC reporter, doing “backbreaking work which Italians do not want” in a labor market controlled by the local mafia.

&gt; Spain has seen increased racial violence. The growing economy invites immigrants from North African countries such as Morocco. However, the poor conditions that immigrants have had to endure and the already racially charged region has led to friction and confrontations.

&gt; In 1997, Human Rights Watch noted that, “The U.K. has one of the highest levels of racially-motivated violence and harassment in Western Europe, and the problem is getting worse.” In April 1999, London saw two bombs explode in predominantly ethnic minority areas, in the space of one week, where a Nazi group has claimed responsibility. The summer of 2001 saw many race-related riots in various parts of northern England.

http://www.globalissues.org/article/165/racism#RacisminEurope

And here's a nice little graphic illustrating :

http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/05/16/article-2325502-19D0189E000005DC-313_634x274.jpg

&gt; The situation in Germany is not very different. In April 2006, a 37-year-old Ethiopian engineer was beaten into a coma in Potsdam. News reports described his injuries from the beating as “unusual in their severity.”

&gt; Such attacks are increasingly common in Germany. In recent weeks police have made arrests in connection with such brutal attacks on Africans and other dark-skinned people in Berlin, Wisner and other cities. Africans know certain areas in the eastern part of Berlin, such as Marzahn and Hellersdorf, as “no-go” areas where they are certain to be attacked or killed.

&gt; Police statistics show a 19 percent increase in racist violence by people described as members of the far right. Last year, there were 958 such acts recorded, up from 776 in 2004.

&gt; **The bad situation is compounded by the fact that Germans, in general, seem unwilling to accept the depth of racism in their society. As a result, those who should are not very eager to speak very frankly about it.** The situation is so bad that many Africans who spoke to the press about racism in Germany refused to give their full names for fear of reprisals.

Three poems I love: ""Hunger Camp at Jaslo"" (another translation is ""Starvation Camp near Jaslo"") about the difficulties of writing social history (History counts its skeletons in round numbers./A thousand and one remains a thousand,/as though the one had never existed). Then two by Turkish Marxist poet Nazim Hikmet. One is ""[Last Will and Testament""](https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/literature/nazim/testament.html) which fascinatingly includes the line ""Comrades, if I don't live to see the day/- I mean,if I die before freedom comes -/take me away/and bury me in a village cemetery in Anatolia."" This line is super interesting because he never went to Anatolia until he was an adult (like Ataturk and many others, he spent most of his childhood in what's today Northern Greece), but nationalism made him cognitively accept it as his true homeland. Also his ""[Autobiography](https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/literature/nazim/autobiography.html)"", which is a fascinating look at one of these agitating Marxist intellectuals who spent his time in and out of Turkish prisons and Warsaw Pact countries. 

Oh and if you want a short novel, *Cemile*/*Jemile* by Orhan Kemal, which is about Balkan Muslim refugees working in a cotton factory in Turkey in the 1930's gets into class and gender and modernity and urbanization and industrialization and is delightfully short (I only read the edition widely available in Turkey, not the one [more widely available in the States](http://www.amazon.com/Cemile-Orhan-Kemal/dp/6051415939/)). 

The Heptameron might have a good 16th century story for one of your ""smaller pieces"". I haven't read it since high school, though, so I can't make a specific recommendation as for which story. You wouldn't need to read the whole thing. Reading country's national anthems are also sweet (Turkey's, Poland's, and Germany's are pretty sweet--Poland's includes the line ""Bonaparte has given us the example/Of how we should prevail."")

&gt;For example, many don't know that the Spanish came to America long before the English. I am from a city that was founded the 16th century. The capital of the state I am from, NM, is older than Phildelphia or the Constitution. The Spanish brought us our language, food, and metal. Over the hundreds of years that passed they intermarried with the natives and as a result the state has its own culture. The family names are incredibly old. You can trace the original areas of Spain a family came from by many of the surnames. In fact, my mothers family is of mixed Basque/native blood. :) This is just the state I come from, that I have knowledge on. I'm sure someone from Louisiana can give you some history on the French communities and culture that is very very strong there to this day.

I.e it is crime simply not being reported and police simply fiddle the figures:

http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/12/police-officers-fiddling-crime-statistics-england-wales-figures

The old GOLD standard of the British Crime survey understates crime by 50% by not recording more than X numbers of crime per person. I remember when the crime maps came out. I was mugged had my motorbike stolen (dragged off it) and my sister was nearly car jacked (they grabbed her purse) these crimes did not show up on the crime map. That is why I have little faith in the government figures.


&gt;Literacy rates were in the low 70's it's now 99%. 

Sure by falsifying the stats, go look at the Wolf Report for how individuals came out of college illiterate yet still got A-levels. Note how the government changed it from absolute illiteracy to functionally illiterate. Even 2011 figures suggest 5.2 million adults are illiterate. So by that measure it is 92% literacy rate not 99%. The very fact my job exists proves there is a considerable literacy problem as I sometimes work with charities to promote reading and writing.

&gt;Child poverty was 30% it's now 20%. 

Not read the IFS report? Child poverty is expected to increase by 39% in 2020.

&gt;in 1990 there was no gay marriage, gays in the armed forces, 

&gt;no equality act

Both of which are circumvented and therefore might as well not exist.

&gt;in 1980 it was still illegal to have gay sex in a hotel. 

&gt;Disabled rights, 

As above circumvented at any opportunity.

&gt;child vaccinations, 

&gt;race relations, 

Which changed nothing all that happens is stealth racism non white name? You get discriminated against.

http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/woman-hits-out-at-car-insurance-1165843 We're not racist we don't charge people more based on race! Except we can provide no explanation for this! 

http://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover

&gt;access to education, 

Which has been reduced with barriers such as graduate taxes being introduced. The quality has also declined see the Wolf report.

&gt;oversees flights, 

&gt;decent clothing, 

None of which has anything to do with the government.

&gt;infant mortality, 

&gt;reduction in global war, 

&gt;road deaths

&gt;violent crime. 

Which has gone up so much that the UK in 2009 was the one of the most violent places on the planet:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445042/Britain-the-most-violent-country-in-western-Europe.html

&gt;1930: Satyagraha - India 1954: Hawai Peace Change 1968: The Prague Spring 1974: The Carnation Revolution in Portugal 1979: The Iranian Revolution 1986: People Power Revolution 1987: The Singing Revolution - Estonia 1989: Eastern Bloc regime changes 1989: the Gentle Revolution - Czechoslovakia 1989: Germany regime change 1990: The Golaniad Romania 1990: The Mongolian Revolution 2000: The Bulldozer Revolution 2004: The Orange Revolution in Ukraine 2005: Cedar Revolution in Lebanon


Funny that because most of those were sparked by an act of violence. The Cedar revolution was a result of an assassination a few months before. The Ukraine revolution? Funny because a war erupted several years later.

&gt;You don't vote in a new government and all of a sudden things change. You're not THAT naive.

Maybe not overnight but has anything really changed in 10 years or even 30 years? Everything you list above is merely a result of fiddling figures or peripheral. We are still ruled over by a corrupt government the participants of which seek to line their own pockets. Provide contracts to their mates who give them jobs afterwards while rights of workers is being demolished (I've cited many times CHINESE workers have more rights than UK workers). With a few more trinkets.

&gt;Nothing when a generation of naive keyboard warriors sit behind their computers all day long and whine like pussies about how powerless they are with barely more than a GCSE understanding of history.

What you mean the government version of history? About how the British empire was all love and kisses and how every war we've fought in the past 10 years was not about profit but about democracy. I've mentioned it many times and I guess I'll reiterate it. 

Back in 2000 I was idealistic as you, I campaigned and wanted to change the world. By 2005 I was very much fuck this nothing changes. In economics and business there is a chart of stake holder theory. Voters are in category 1 i.e. have no power and no interest. You like to think you are in category 3 or 4 where you have significant power and significant interest. You seriously want to say I have power and influence when my vote is worth 0.066 of a vote? Who do you think an MP will listen to? A wealthy person who 'donates' millions of pounds or a voter. 

Go on say it with a straight face a voter.

Why do we need to include an ISDS mechanism when investors can go to national courts?

Relying on the national courts of the host country to enforce obligations in an investment agreement is not always easy.Firstly, the investor may not want to bring an action against the host country in that country's courts because it might think they are biased or lack independence.

That FAQ goes on to talk about circumstances where national courts have no jurisdiction etc. but clearly there are cases where it's a ""choice"" open to foreign companies.

I'd agree there's some need somehow to provide for mechanisms to resolve disputes that are outside of the competence of local courts but this should be through international courts in public rather than in private through commercial tribunals.

My history classes are a little odd on this. I guess Russia supported the UN in its goals, which were to collectivize space rights for all of humankind, much like people of your time proposed with the [Moon Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Treaty). The US was a part of the countries which left the UN in opposition to this. They wanted companies and countries be able to claim property and resources in space. Countries like Russia, which had all of the knowledge to get into space but lacked the full financial resources of countries like the US fell behind in the race. They said that space should be open to all mankind, but the revolution felt like they just wanted a free share of the spoils.

The revolution did away with the UN when it won the wars, but a lot of people feel like the Earth Union is more or less the same thing as the UN. The resources we get from spaces make their way all over the world and I guess some people feel like the UN forces were the real winner, anyways.

Some older people in revolution states like the US who still remember the early days of the war don't like former UN nations, like Russia very much. But most people today don't have any hard feelings. I don't even think some kids my age know who was a revolutionary and who wasn't.

&gt;What happened to the Middle east?

Secularism eventually prevailed. The Arab League was gaining greater traction and becoming a more serious political body when the wars first broke out. It was actually the rise of the Arab League that kept the wars going after the second war. A lot of people think if they hadn't gotten involved, the war would have been over for the UN forces at that point, instead of lasting another quarter of a century.

&gt;Did Canada invade someone?

Canada was involved with the revolution. In the first war there was some ""invasion"" but the later wars were mainly fought over space-based infrastructure. Nobody wanted to risk a greater land war. It kind of became an unwritten rule.
I guess it was a big fear early on, though. We saw old public service announcement and propaganda footage from the first two wars in school once. Lots of money, funding and brainpower went into tracking small objects in deep space for ballistic tracks towards Earth. Everyone was afraid the UN forces would accelerate a small object at great speeds towards revolution space. Early on they planned to intercept these before they reached Earth. Interestingly that fear was one of the biggest motivations behind the eventual invention of [stress-energy tensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor) shield generators near the end of the war.

The latest stages of the war didn't even involve humans very much (we started to use drones instead - the last stages of the wars were mostly the revolutionary forces clearing up the UN drone fleets). Politicians today are trying to completely replace human soldiers with an automated drone defense system - and I agree with this, human lives shouldn't be wasted over petty feuds and drones perform better anyhow!

&gt;How's the food?

Food is marvelous! We take our food *seriously*. Our chemists can make anything we want. Synthetic food is really popular. You can buy reverse isomer food that tastes exactly like real food with none of the weight gain! In health class we talked about abuse of reverse isomers. A lot of people end up malnourished because it becomes so hard to convince yourself to eat real food. Most of the actual materials needed to make food are really, really cheap, too. Apparently people in your day cook at home a lot, but most people eat out today. I guess people in some countries can't afford things like reverse isomer food, genetically engineered foods, or for their food to be as big of a spectacle, but it's a really big thing here in Europe and most of the revolution states. I guess a meal like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qofsdSMuGbg) would seem like a pretty big deal ($200+ for a ""ticket"" to a restaurant? Yikes!) in the 21st century, but it's pretty normal for me! ([More about the food/experience on their website in images](http://website.alinearestaurant.com/site/cuisine/), apparently you guys called that philosophy in a restaurant as being a type of [molecular gastronomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_gastronomy) and/or performance art.)

&gt;Did Leonardo DiCaprio finally win an Oscar?

Hmm, I didn't know quite what you mean. Hold on a second, let me look it up (my neural implant makes this pretty quick and easy). Oh yeah, people say things like ""Snubbed like Leonardo"" in songs, but I didn't actually know what they were talking about till now! I guess he didn't.

Robert Schwartz, the engineer who created the preliminary designs, essentially scaled up the 240mm shell (then the maximum in the arsenal) and used the German K5 railroad gun as a point of departure for the carriage. (The name ""Atomic Annie"" likely derives from the nickname ""Anzio Annie"" given to a German K5 gun which was employed against the American landings in Italy.) The design was approved by the Pentagon, largely through the intervention of Samuel Feltman, Chief of the Ballistics Section of the Ordnance Department's Research and Development Division. A three-year developmental effort was begun. The project proceeded quickly enough to produce a demonstration model to participate in Dwight Eisenhower's inaugural parade in January 1953.

The cannon was transported by two specially designed tractors, both capable of independent steering in the manner of some extra-long fire engines. Each of the tractors was rated at 375 hp, and the somewhat awkward combination could achieve speeds of 35 miles an hour and negotiate right angle turns on 28 ft wide, paved or packed roads. The artillery piece could be unlimbered in 15 minutes, then returned to traveling configuration in another 15 minutes.

On May 25, 1953 at 8:30am, the Atomic Cannon was tested at Nevada Test Site (specifically Frenchman Flat) as part of the Upshot-Knothole series of nuclear tests. The test — codenamed Grable — was attended by then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Arthur W. Radford and Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson; it resulted in the successful detonation of a 15 kt shell (W9 warhead) at a range of 7 miles. This was the first and only nuclear shell to be fired from a cannon (the Little Feller 1 test shot of an M388 used a Davy Crockett Weapon System which was a recoilless smooth bore gun firing the warhead mounted on the end of a spigot inserted in the barrel of the weapon.)

After the successful test, there were at least 20 of the cannons manufactured at Watervliet and Watertown Arsenals, at a cost of $800,000 each. They were deployed overseas to Europe and Korea, often continuously shifted around to avoid being detected and targeted by opposing forces. Due to the size of the apparatus, their limited range, the development of nuclear shells compatible with existing artillery pieces (the W48 for the 155mm and the W33 for the 203mm), and the development of rocket and missile based nuclear artillery, the M65 was effectively obsolete soon after it was deployed. However, it remained a prestige weapon and was not retired until 1963.",,0,False,,videos,cqwd544,,0,1,t5_2qh1e,t3_34nq59,t1_cqwd544,False,,1430601012

It sucked...

We kept being ""friends""... whatever... and some nights we would even had sex. At this point i convinced myself that what he told me the first time was nothing but crap.

Anyway, i wouldn't push it. I got to the conclusion that he would have to make his way alone and that at the time he was ready i would have the chance to decide if i wanted to get back together or not.

Eventually we did. I was on a trip to Europe and he told me that he had realised a long time ago that i ment everything for him. OK, great, we are back together, aren't we?

Some days after i came back, i realised something was wrong. I pushed it and got the answer i knew... he was having trouble with us being both men. That night the only thing i said was: ""try not to hurt me so much this time"" and we went to sleep.

A little but more than a month passed and he was back to what we were at the beginning... kind, loving, blah blah blah. So things seem to be working so far...

I'm saying that you will ever find someone like him, but I'm not saying that you cannot find something even better. I know it hurt a like hell knowing that both of you are so deeply in love but you camt be together, I've been there! 

Cry, talk to a friend who will throw a mountain of shit at him, keep on crying, and when you are finished, put yourself together and decide if waiting for him is a good choice. So that when he comes back, and he WILL, you know what you want... set some groundrules in your mind.

Be happy... it's the only thing it should matter to you. Unfortunately, people come and go because that's what they are trying to find... happiness. Yours shouldn't depend on him. ",,0,False,,askgaybros,cqwevo7,,0,1,t5_2vgfw,t3_34mxvi,t1_cqwevo7,False,,1430604700

He had a couple of good games, but his overall performance was not great. 70% of what he did was camp top to get Cabochard fed, hoping he would carry him and bot lane (Betsy did well on his own). Diamond had very little synergy with bot lane, and his teamfighting was not good at all. Compare that to his S2/S3 days where he would singlehandedly carry so many games. Overall the jungler standards in EU went down this split. Diamond is not the only one who needs to step it up. IMO, ReignOver is the only EU LCS jungler at the moment who would stand a chance vs the world's best from other regions. Diamond, Svenskeren and Jankos can do it too, but not in their current form.",,0,False,,leagueoflegends,cqwewe1,,0,4,t5_2rfxx,t3_34nl7z,t1_cqwewe1,False,12 team,1430604746

Indeed, the Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1948) states unequivocally that “[i]n Eastern Europe there were very recently countries in which 90 percent or more of the trades was in Jewish hands; in some branches of trade and export they controlled the entire 100 percent.” It goes on to say: “Here [Central Europe during the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries] they were pioneers in the primary stages of capitalist development and therefore held a dominant position in these cultural economic functions which may be called the nervous system of capitalist economy. Banking, the stock market, export and import fall within this classification.”

But at this year's Europeans I thought she was fine. She seemed to balance her critiques with quite a reasonable amount of praise of the lifters. Surely people in this thread are exaggerating when they say that she's constantly berating lifters. 

It's also worth noting that her being so hard to impress might be helpful for uninitiated viewers. Part of their goal as commentators is to make the competition accessible to people who know nothing about the sport. To that audience, hearing her frequent remarks about the rules might be super helpful in getting a better grip on what's going on, the subtleties of the sport, why things might have been red lighted even if the lifter did manage to get it above their head, etc.

Maybe in your head it is. 

From what you just wrote I'm getting the impression that your logic runs something like this:

If the original research was done in another country as with breast cancer treatment or statins or lung cancer or whatever but newer better technology was invented in the US then the US should be 100% of the credit. 

If, as with many vaccines, the initial research was done in the US but the drugs are developed and marketed by European pharma companies...the US should still get all the credit. 

Take the meningitis vaccines for instance. You say Maurice Hilleman discovered them as well he probably did, I'm not a medical historian. However I can see quite easily that of the meningitis vaccines taken by US people 100% are European manufactured. The [CDC gives 4 vaccines that are sold in the US](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/mening/default.htm), Menomune, Menactra, Menveo and MenHibrix. Sanofi Pasteur patented and produces [Menomune](http://sanofipasteur.com/en/articles/menomune-is-the-first-quadrivalent-meningococcal-vaccine-prequalified-by-the-who.aspx) as it does with [Menactra](http://www.menactra.com/what-is-menactra-vaccine.html). Novartis patented and produces [Menveo](https://www.novartisvaccinesdirect.com/Menveo/About) and the newest drug is [MenHibrix](http://us.gsk.com/en-us/media/press-releases/2012/gsk-receives-fda-approval-for-menhibrix/) patented and produced by GlaxoSmithKline. Does that mean Europe gets the credit for the R&amp;D money that went into making those drugs safe, more effective and mass producing them for children? No, of course not the entire US nation will instead take credit for the research work of one man. That makes sense. But when it comes to breast cancer suddenly this won't do. The initial research was done in the UK but the US gets the credit for developing mammograms. 

If you want to twist the figures to make the US look better than everyone else and pretend they don't exist then you may as well start making stuff up. No-one is denying the US medical community (which you are likely not personally contributing to) has made many discoveries and done lots of valuable research more than any other nation in the world. But pretending that the world would be in exactly the same place if European universities and companies didn't exist is a bizarre statement. 

Then again you could just stop allowing your technologies to be sold outside of the US. It would be quite simple to do, congress would pass a law and boom, if you're right Europe would collapse and everyone would die of hideous diseases. I'd invite you to go to the head of any major pharmaceutical company in America and suggest than the company cut European buyers off. I'll give you 20 seconds before your laughed out of the room. European health services shell out billions to US corporations using European tax payers money to line the pockets of big pharma companies. They'd kill to get a European health service as a client because it means instant access to an entire population. That's why [UK drug companies are all happy to agree to discounts and spending caps](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-agrees-breakthrough-drug-pricing-deal-with-pharmaceutical-firms) just the get access to provision of medicines through the NHS. The volume of sales they will get will be enormous. Hence people in the UK pay less for drugs than most parts of Europe and much less than the US. It's also why, by the way, Medicare is cheaper than ordinary healthcare costs in the US. The government negotiates lower prices with the promise of a huge volume of purchases. 

In other words no-one needs to be appreciative to anyone let alone Europeans be appreciative to American companies. They charge their price and we pay it. It's a contract not a gift. The only difference is the provision of the end product.

Twycross was kinda disappointing when i went a few years ago, lots of very similar monkeys in very similar box cages, and the rest pretty old enclosures, I wasn't a fan of it really. It may have improved in the past few years, I cant say.


Yorkshire Wildlife Park is excellent - its in my hometown in fact. It's very new (5 years i think), constantly expanding and there are walkthrough exhibits for lemurs and wallabies. Their meerkat enclosure is built with windows in the walls so that smaller kids can see in to them and what they are doing. There are some goat/sheep things that the kids can get close to as well. There's also a south american walkthrough where you can get close to squirrel monkeys and a few other animals too!

It also has baby tigers (these may not be on display yet as they've only just been born, but they had triplets recently). I know they have some kids shows with birds, ferrets etc, but I've never been to one of those so i cant say much more. I tend to go every 3-6 months, and its always fantastic. It's not the biggest wildlife place as it's still growing [their map is here](http://www.yorkshirewildlifepark.com/#!ywp-site-map/cqh1), but it does have very large and very new enclosures for all the animals (it has the largest non-drive-through lion enclosure in europe iirc), and it's definately at least a half day if not more.

in terms of number of animals, by far Chester Zoo has the most, its a pretty cool zoo , and they are opening a new massive part of the zoo any time now , but its gotten so large you cant see everything in one day now ,and some of their enclosures are old and not very interactive. It does have monorail, boat ride and a cool walk through bat cave thing though.

Austria has only considered itself not a part of 'Germany' (I suppose it would be better to call that 'Germania' in English) since 1945. Heck, even in the past, Austria was the *leader* of any German political unit until the 1860s

&gt; Only Nazis think every expansion Germany ever had is now Deutschland for all eternity. That's like saying India is still part of Britain.

That's very insulting and very ignorant. India has never been a part of the British cultural sphere (though it was a part of the Empire). Calling India part of Britain would be more like calling Lombardia a part of Austria.

Austria was not an *expansion* of Germany. It was a core part of Germany until the 1860s, and even then it was considered a part of Germany under a different government. Hell, Austria led both the Holy Roman Empire for most of its existence *and* the German Confederation.

&gt; If you refer to countrys that use the german language then that still does not make them Germans

Historically, it does. This was *how it was* until 1945 - this was *not* a creation of the Nazis (though it was taken advantage of by them). One should point out as well that the only reason Austria today is *not* a part of a German state is that the Germany they were a part of, the same Germany *led* by an Austrian German, decided to try to conquer Europe.

&gt;You guys get to sit back and relax and let us do **all** the research

Look lets get to the point here. Either your companies/government do all the research or you do a proportion of the research. Which is it?

You seem to sway between admitting that some countries contribute some things and then claiming that America does all the work. You started this by saying Europeans don't 'contribute shit' to medical research then later admit ""I gave credit when earlier research was done in other places"". The fact is you didn't because all that seems to matter to you is that you can somehow credit some breakthrough to the US. You mentioned when other countries or companies were involved but always try to find a way to minimise this and explain why the US deserves the praise. It's really self-centred. 

Besides, [in 2012 Europe spent $81.8 billion on medical research next the US spending $119.3 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research#Funding). Now the US is certainly spending more but only about 50% more. You claimed the US was spending ""many times"" what Europe was spending. Where do you suppose the $80 billion from Europe is going? Who has it now? How is it possible that Europe can spend so much on medical research and get so little reward, as you seem so keen to point out?

That $80 billion is money already spent; it not money that you can try and argue was probably spent on inefficient welfare programs - No, this was definitely money spent in 2012 on medical research in Europe. How can this be justified if all that money has not led to any advances since the 1950s as you said previously? Whose making these funding decisions and why are they doing so if it's apparently so obvious that $80 billion is being pissed away? I certainly can't think of anything. Of course the real answer is that that research has led to a number of scientific and pharmaceutical breakthroughs which I have listed previously but none of which you wanted to properly acknowledge - that's where the $80 billion is going. 

If you don't want to believe that then that's fine; it will remain true if you believe it or not and I'm clearly not going to change your mind. However the reality is that arguing over this is irrelevant. If US companies want to keep selling drugs to European countries they will keep doing so and if European voters continue to prefer a universal healthcare system with publicly funded elements making up all or part then they will continue to vote for that. If the US government and US companies want to continue to research pharmaceuticals and allow these to be sold worldwide then they will do that. And if US voters want to keep their system and want to continue to allow the state of affairs you are getting so worked up about whatever the reality of it may be, then they will continue to vote for it. 

If you don't like it then change it. No-one does anything out of the kindness of their own heart in this world least of all governments with tight budgets and companies with bottom lines. If you want to believe that there aren't people (Americans specifically) benefiting all the way along the chain when it comes of research then fine but the system exists because creditors get a return on their investment. That's the only reason any money is ever spent because someone with some connection to the person/organisation spending the money or the person/organisation themselves is benefiting. That category does not include the US government or US companies donating their hard earned research to European tax payers; that not how economics works. If there's a cost to the research then that's factored into the price of the product. 

EDIT: Oh an by the way can we end this stupid meme of ""you pay a shitload more in taxes"". European taxes are slightly higher on average but you're exaggerating massively. Personally, I pay an effective tax rate of 8.2% which is less than most Americans do. And if you're an American ex-pat you still have to pay taxes.

In reality, a country always has inequalities. Socialism as it was applied did NOT try to fight inequalities. Members of the party became the new nomenclature. Even workers sharing ownage of the factories they worked in, it is not ideal. It is not fair that you have a share in a pharmaceutical company because you happened to somehow be hired there, while I have a share in a landfill site. Socialism without true democracy is not even remotedly like socialism.

Capitalism and its effect on prices and price-driven investment seems to me analogous to a decentralised supercomputer: all the brains in the economy are involved in bargaining and prices tend to reach the most reasonable values, something that a limited pool of brains in a central government could never achieve (Pisoo already mentioned the terrible famines, which are partially due to this). This gives it a giant advandage against all competitive systems... but costs and benefits are not always properly evaluated. Pigouvian taxes is a nice tool that is used very sparsely today. The small payback times of ordinary investments make long-term investments like raising children appear inefficient. Fortunately, governments are aware of such limitations, but unfortunately they usually seem to fail to address proper measures.

Now, Americans tend to think that certain countries in Europe are socialistic, mainly judging from welfare and healthcare policies. In fact, any government in history had three major resources to exploit in order to improve the economy: land, people, and infrastructure. Land includes minerals, waters, trade routes, whatever. Infrastructure includes existing cities, industries, farms, even traditions and scientific knowledge. Finally, the human capital. If anything, capitalism has failed in exploiting human capital: raising children is inefficient from a capitalistic point of view, the elderly are a burden, even young and healthy workers are often of better use when unemployed. When a country initiates policies that take care of the human capital like welfare, healthcare, public education, they sometimes are called socialistic. Also, people tend to think like ""This is my money, I worked every penny"". This is not true, since we are *allowed* to work in peace and develop in a lawful community and save our money in banks without the fear of jealous neighbors and outlaws governing trade routes. We should be grateful to all those mothers who raised the children that now work for our companies and we ought to pay them enough for them to support a new family for the next generation.

True capitalism was never applied. Senators being paid by aerospace industries is not capitalism. Excessive corn and cotton subsidies is not capitalism. Welfare and healthcare can be compatible with capitalism, as are modest farming subsidies, because a government has to keep all human capital thriving, and all land resources have to be worked on as well, so taking some measures towards these directions is necessary in all reasonable political systems, but the system that tends to prevail at least in USA and Germany should better be called Corporatism.",,0,False,,NoStupidQuestions,cqwk3mu,,0,2,t5_2w844,t3_34lfyj,t1_cqwk3mu,False,,1430616528

It therefore doesn't seem to be totally government driven interests - there are more players involved who clearly favor restricting the market intentionally. 

If I had to guess, I would say it has to do with the international raisin market, in which we provide the higher tier product for a higher cost (Californian raisins are considered slightly higher quality than European/Greek and are priced to reflect that at nearly 300%). Maybe we don't want to oversaturate the Euro market with American raisins because perception can and does change with lower prices.

Shortly after unlocking the second Tiger II. I find myself in eastern Europe - I and two panthers advance in the open, drawing fire for the city team to move in and flank. the city team failed to advance and were overtaken. I and my panthers moved in to support the city team. after a short engagement, I and one panther were the only tanks (From initial spawn) left. a quick check of the scorbord shows three enemies left, to our 5.

moving back out of the city, a lone T44 pops out and kills the panther  (smart, removing the weaker gun to try and flank me.) Right, he pops again, expecting I was sitting still waiting - I was really charging full on too him, he pops again, he fires at the turret KOing my gun. I'm still charging him and in a panic he backs into a closed courtyard. my 4 teammates at this point are a long way out. I have no way to repair, nor would I be able to with an active T44 only feet away. so, I rammed the little shit into a corner between two buildings. and there I sat, I told him in chat, do what you can - I have already won. he shoots at my upper hull fruitlessly (Why he didn't aim at the turret I will never know) for about 4 minuets he tried to desperately maneuver out of the hole he was in now.

 Because as a European I'm honestly just puzzled sometimes about what the fuck went wrong in your country. 

Europe had  managed to fund things like public healthcare and public academic education, right after two biggest wars in the history have devastated the entire continent. In the meantime US has biggest economy in the world, and some people are still acting like having equal access to publically funded healthcare would somehow ruin the whole country and would basically equal to Joseph Stalin taking over. Seriously, what the fuck.

Similarily, I was absolutely shocked a while ago after finding out not everyone in US has a state-guaranteed sick-leave. Seriously, there are countries with 1% of your economical power that manage that. And there'd be literally riots and bombs in the street if anyone tried to take that away.

0,t3_34j8m6,1430633024,phdme,1,1432742382,"I started a PhD program last fall at 33 years old. I actually put off applying a year due to a momentary crisis of certainty of this same kind at the time applications were due the year before. (As a side note, my apps wound up significantly stronger as a result of some experiences I had during that year, but ymmv). 

The decision is really very personal, but I recommend you talk to *everyone* you can about their experiences. Find out what the best programs are in your field (and whether you have any chance of getting hired out of other programs - in the humanities the payoff in hireability is quite low from all but the very top). I'd also confirm the timeline - in my field it's quite typical to take 5-7 years to completion, even if you come in with an MA. It helps to come in with a strong sense of what you might want to do for your dissertation - if you have no idea, it's likely to take longer to get to the point where you can write strong grant applications and hit all the other milestones you need to reach along the way, and that uncertainty can add years.

The personal questions you really need to assess once you have the lay of the land are your life goals, and the financial and social aspects. You need to be *really* honest with yourself about what your own personal needs are and whether you're going to be able to fulfill them during a PhD program. 

*Life goals: Think about all of them, not just your career goals. What do you want to have in your life at age 40? Where do you want to be living, what people do you want to have in your life? What kind of lifestyle? Do you want time freedom, or money and a big house? Do you want to travel a lot? Europe, resort vacations, or hostels off the beaten track? When do you want to retire? Consider your answers in relation to the next two bullet points.

*Financial: Do you have to have your own place? Do you like to eat out a lot or cook/eat elaborate organic meals? Can you handle re-wearing the same clothes that you have in your closet right now for the next several years? In most cases, a grad stipend is going to cover a roommate and dried beans lifestyle with occasional nights out. It's enough, but you're not going to be saving for retirement or  even an emergency fund.

*Social: You probably won't find your age such a big thing within the program - the average age in the cohorts nearest mine is probably 27-28. That said, you're likely to be surrounded by people who are younger than you that know a lot more than you do, and that can be a little (or a lot) destabilizing. This one depends a lot on the type of program you're in, but PhD students in general are a driven bunch and coming in as a casual is probably more of a painful adjustment than being a little older. The hard part (and the one I suggest you think hardest about) is socializing outside of your program. Interacting with other adults as a ""broke college student"" in your 30s is a real challenge. Your intellectual peers are likely to be out doing things that require real money because they have real jobs; your financial peers are in the service industry. Navigating this social divide is a challenge that extroversion and/or a deep passion for your intellectual life and urge to share can somewhat overcome; if that isn't you, you're probably going to have a lot of challenges unless you already have a very strong social network that you'll be able to remain close to (and distance and hours put in can make even this difficult). Or, you know, have a trust fund and this issue goes away.

For me personally, this was the right decision, but it's still been hard. I sometimes have to remind myself that I want this, that I literally have no clue what else I would spend these years doing that would turn me into the person I want to be in the future. But that's pretty much the only reason to do it if your career path doesn't require it. If I wanted kids (I don't) or had a single other major responsibility or goal in my life, I think the calculus would probably have been different.",,0,False,,GradSchool,cqwq9qv,,0,1,t5_2r4r8,t3_34j8m6,t1_cqwq9qv,False,,1430632827

I said western governments have abandoned the idea of nation states based on ethnicity, which is different. *Jus Sanguinis* (right of blood) is the name of the nationality law where citizenship is offered to ethnic non-nationals and only a few Western countries offer this, the major one being Italy.

&gt;Dividing of ethnicity isnt even a result of violence; look at the national efforts of the scots, basque, and catalans, and the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. It is clearly the most stable form of statehood.

These examples aren't making the country unstable. There are people calling for independence, but the country is going fine and the governments are very stable. Europe has scores of micro-nations within nations and things are on the whole, going fine. Some countries, like Italy, are made up of many distinguishable groups where one end of the country can't really communicate with the other end. Even France used to have a continuum of dialects where you could communicate with nearby villages but not with the other end of the country, and people better identified with their locality. Only more recently all these countries have developed a singular ethnicity/identity.

&gt;In the middle east and other areas whose states were drawn up by european imperialism, that is not that case. And in turkey the vast majority of kurds want independence.

The borders in the middle east weren't drawn up at random, they're roughly a long the borders of the principalities under the Ottomans. Except for the situation with the Kurds, the borders make sense in terms of ethnicity and cultural unity and most middle easterners would agree. The Kurds weren't carved out a nation at the time because there wasn't much of a pan-Kurdish identity a hundred years ago, they were more like a dozen nomadic tribes that didn't really identify with each other and ""Kurdish"" was just a social term to label all the nomadic Iranic tribes living in that region - only more recently Kurdish has it been seen as an ethnicity when in fact the tribes had little to do with each other. Sorani and Kurmanji are the two largest language groups and they're as dissimilar as Spanish and Italian, and Zazaki is as far as Portugese. As to the Kurds in Turkey wanting independence, that's not true and it's probably because you're learning about them reading Reddit. They're generally very well integrated in Turkey, with almost half of them speaking Turkish as a first language. And Erdogan's largest demographic of voters was from the Kurdish regions! but you wouldn't know that from reading Reddit where the Kurds are all the rave. The pan-Kurdish movement rose from policies of ethnic nationalism (Arabization under Baathism and Turkification). If it wasn't from governments trying to force people how to live their lives decades ago then this movement likely never would have started and the Middle Eastern borders would make more sense to you today. Though I'll say it again, other than the situation with the Kurds, the borders generally make sense as they are. The amount of sectarianism is quite overstated by Western media, though it's still bad. A lot of the conflict we see today is the result of a proxy war taking place between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with a few other major nations (eg. USA) trying to influence what's going on too. If the borders broke down in a huge war they'd likely recreate into something similar. National identity is far stronger there than you think.

I tried to find the source on my claim on Ancient Greece, but I can't find it. I've read it claimed a few times, including in /r/askhistorians here.

In order to understand and interpret what was written you want to know about everyone involved in creating it. Which is why the founding fathers are talked about a lot. The constitution is a huge talking point, it's talked about endlessly when dealing in US politics.

But, when you ask are there other people after the founding fathers, that would be of equal or greater importance?

Toate partidele au o singura doctrina: fura cat se poate, nu mai lasa nimic in urma!  
  
  
Dar in principiu ar trebuie sa fie cam asa:
In mare, PNL, PDL sunt partide (surpriseee!) liberale: Ele vor o implicare cat mai mica a statului in economie, vor sa lase initiativa cetatenilor si companiilor pentru proiecte de dezvoltare si bineinteles vor o competitie justa in toate sectoarele economiei. Deasemenea, liberalii ar trebui in principiu sa fie mai reticenti la proiecte sociale (ajutoare sociale, free stuff de la stat, subsidizari etc). Ca populatie target pentru partidele liberale este clasa de mijloc.

PSD: Fiind un partid social, accentul se pune pe populatie, ajutorare tuturor celor saraci pentru a le asigura un trai decent (aka welfare). Statul sa se implice in economie prin reglamentari stricte atat pentru protectia muncitorului celui de mai jos, dar si prin banii sau companiile detinute. Cum 90% din doctrina socialistilor se bazeaza pe ajutorarea celor mai saraci, asta inseamna taxarea celor mai bogati (gen taxare in procente). Populatia tinta pentru socialisti sunt cei saraci, foarte saraci.

I don't think boxing will be dead to any noticeable degree. As an American, I understand that we often think we represent the global sporting culture(considering we treat success in national sports as World Champions) but that's most definitely not the case for boxing. It's positively MASSIVE in Latin America and Europe(particularly Eastern Europe), and is growing in Asia. It may fade as an American sport, but that's been the case for years considering it's very rare that we generate great heavyweight prospects anymore.

Only one wild sheep species, the oriental mouflon, inhabits the Fertile Crescent. Genetic studies show that it has the same number of chromosomes (54) as all of the modern domestic sheep breeds, and is therefore their most likely ancestor. Domestic sheep spread northwest into Europe, by boat and other means, so that as early as 8,000 years ago there were domesticated sheep in Greece and on the islands off Italy (**Sicily**, Sardinia, Corsica).

&gt;Mouflon were introduced to the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Rhodes, and Cyprus during the neolithic period, perhaps as feral domesticated animals, where they have naturalized in the mountainous interiors of these islands over the past few thousand years, giving rise to the subspecies known as European mouflon (O. aries musimon).

This seems like it should be a relatively simple to do with all the stuff currently there. Maybe they who run this site would only need to add a few changes.
Could someone not work with them to make this happen rather easily?

I proposed it to the owners a while ago by looking up the company information and writing to the board of directors of the company but never got a response.

My guess is that it comes down to being impossible to explain how good VR is. Even people I show the GVR to say that they always though this talk about VR would end up just looking stupid and is nothing like what they just experienced. 

Check out these photos, which are different views it currently uses. The first person view lets you look around, do chip tricks, stand up, pull the finger at someone, abuse people, whatever. it is already very cool. it even lets you upload a photo which is applied into animation of the avatar making it look just like you. 

Wouldn't all it take to make this real 3D VR be simply streaming it to a side by side on your phone? It just seems so bloody easy.

Then they change their marketing to VR poker and people play poker without having to wait for a table to open up at the casino.

As someone new to investing, I agree it might be a good idea to sign up for a managed depot to give yourself more time to learn about investing. I will clarify some misconceptions here and point out some differences between the 2 methods to help you decide later.

With a Sparplan, the monthly allocation is automated. For example, if you choose to invest 50 Eu monthly into the MSCI World Index, the broker does the buying for you automatically for a transaction fee (normally 1.5% with cap). There will be in addition a management fee (shown under TER, total expense ratio) imposed by the ETF. ISHARES CORE MSCI WORLD UCITS ETF (Identifikationsnummer (ISIN) IE00B4L5Y983) for example charges a TER of 0.2% yearly.

With this arrangement, the fees incurred on the first year will be high because of the transaction fee (if you buy ETFs from certain companies, this could be waived). The example above is roughly 1.6%. But the yearly fee will drop to 0.2% after that on the money invested within the 1st year.

With a managed depot, the advantage is that financescout absorbs all transaction fee and TER and charges you a flat fee of 1.25% yearly on all your investment money. This is a steal for the 1st year but will be a drag for subsequent years as you lose 1+% for nothing. It might be a good deal if you have more than 250,000 invested where the yearly fee is 0.75%.

With this in mind, I encourage you to look at the constituents in their portfolios and learn about the ETFs involved. The ""chance"" portfolio for example consists of 3 main ETfs, 75% MSCI World, 15% MSCI Emerging Markets and 10% commodities. I might skip the commodity part and put them into Emerging markets. 

You can replicate this by putting 50 Euro into ISHARES CORE MSCI WORLD UCITS ETF and 25 Euro into LYXOR UCITS ETF MSCI EMERGING MARKETS C-EUR.

You can go to comdirect's website

http://www.comdirect.de/inf/etfs/selector/selector.html?CLEAR=1

to practice looking for these ETFs and getting familiar with the financial terms. I did a small translation exercise on my website too. Simply search for the index's name using the selector.

I also notice that the managed depot offers multiple risk portfolios. A good choice depends on your age, financial situation and risk appetite. The all stocks approach as shown above will be their high risk profile, though this would be ok in my opinion for young adults.

If you have more questions, feel free to ask again, i will try my best to help.

An even cheaper idea is to simply allow street vendors and food stalls, and maybe rent them space in the parking places next to the sidewalk -- one vendor per parking space.

But as you say, zoning disallows it. People look down their noses at flea markets. But how else can you get a start with no capital? I think zoning laws are one of the main causes of urban poverty in America.

One of my favorite examples of this is Taco Bell. Nothing against them, I have eaten there from time to time. But how in the world did a taco stand get to be a capital intensive business in a country where millions of Mexicans live? Taco Bell can only survive because it is basically illegal to open your own hole-in-the-wall taco stand.

EDIT: You don't even need need to use parking lots in many cases. Look at the intersection of Fremont Avenue and Riggs Avenue in Baltimore. It is an absurd waste of space. Shutting down Fremont between Riggs and Pritcher and simple routing the traffic around the new square would open up a huge piece of open land. Then the city could have a barbeque contest or some other events on the square. The body shops near there probably have welders that could build a barbeque push cart. Planters with wide rims allowing seating could be used to block the roads. The city could provide folding furniture and beach umbrellas in the summer, paid for by rent charged to whatever vendors pop up.

Would it work? Maybe. It did on the Sunset Triangle Plaza in Los Angeles. It works in a lot of places in Brooklyn and Queens, like Corona Plaza. Would it spread? Impossible to say. But it would be very cheap to try.

&gt;

&gt;__Victory in Europe Day__, generally known as __V-E Day__, __VE Day__, or simply __V Day__ was the [public holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday) celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in [Commonwealth realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations)) to mark the formal acceptance by the [Allies of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany)'s [unconditional surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_surrender) of [its armed forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht).  It thus marked the [end of World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe).

&gt;On 30 April, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler), the [Nazi leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrer), [committed suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler) during the [Battle of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin). Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorized by his successor, *[Reichspräsident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichspr%C3%A4sident)* [Karl Dönitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_D%C3%B6nitz). The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the [Flensburg Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flensburg_Government). The [act of military surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender) was signed on 7 May in [Reims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reims), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) and on 8 May in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), Germany.

If you would want to unite **all** turkic peoples there would be at least Tatarstan, Gagauzia, Crimea and several nations in Southern Russia / North Caucasus. If you would want a great Turan there would also be the Hungarians (and perhaps Finland??? Because I don't know what really constitutes as Turanic and what not.) What I think is that a union between the states of Turkestan would be the most likely, but not a Union based on nationalistic principles, but on economic like the EU. But at the moment the initiative is with Russia as it is building a Eurasian Economic Union. So having a resurgence of nationalism among turkic peoples in a scale that they want to create a pan-Turkic state would definitely sore the relations with Russia and China, since it would mean that they would have to give their turkic minorities independence, which IIRC none of them really wants. At the moment I think it is more likely that Russia reestablishes its sphere of influence (This time based on Economics, not Communism or Imperialism) than that a Pan-Turkic or Turanistic state to happen. So its that I generally don't think it is impossible, but under the current circumstances it is very unlikely, but you know a hundred years ago something like the EU to happen was also impossible.

First of all, why Aquafarms? Because even on Arazneb, a relatively high-pop server that always gets the character creation restrictions when they come up, you can jump into an aquafarm zone and find space for 2, 3, 4, or even 20+ adjacent aquafarms. Adjacency is a huge convenience factor - having to warp to three different farms scattered around the continent for your farming is expensive in both hereafters and in time (loading screens lol).

The traps are ridiculously inflated on my AH, but if you can commission a handicrafter directly he can make it for a relative song and dance - a 600 vocation badge chum, 10 bamboo, and like 6 labor. 

Like Chicken Coops, you need to maintain them with Ground Grain and the occasional bamboo (and maybe once a week per farm, assuming two cycles a day, a new trap). They're also the same size, and thus 8 fit per aquafarm with just a little room in between to plant some oysters if you're so inclined. (If you're looking for 420blazeit speed and convenience, you're not, so I won't touch that - aquafarming coral/pearls has its own income, which is certainly higher at the cost of sanity when replanting.)

Cycling every 6 hours, they take 50 labor to harvest and give 50 vocation badges, and use/boost Fishing proficiency. (People looking to grind up Fishing quickly for higher yields when sport fishing, take note here! This is usually far better returns than afk bait worm fishing. Of course now you have to take your main proper out to the aquafarm, but such is the cost of centralizing high proficiency.)

What comes out of the traps normally, the Crayfish and Starfish, are literally 100% vendor trash. There are exactly zero other uses other than being vendored at 30c each. 1632 labor of traps (32 traps) later, I had all of 2.56g in trash.

What I DID have were 80 blue-grade Octopi, which are used in the new fourth Farmer's Workstation meal daily. I don't do it myself, but there's a niche market of people who will shell out a ton of gold for those octopi to farm up an extra gilda star a day.

On Shatigon EU (where I tested these) these Octopi went for 95s each; after expenses on ground grain I was looking at about 4.5s/labor all burned in a single stop, although I didn't have to make any repairs or replace any traps on this test run. On Aranzeb, those octopi are currently up for 1.2g each and are in fact moving, albeit slowly - recomputing with Arazneb's values gives 5.6s/labor.

As far as inconvenience and annoyance, I cede that you'll need to burn a hereafter stone and make a short clipper trek every time you want to visit your farms if you're doing it with your main to grind up fishing. However, if you plant a dedicated farmer alt there who just logs in and out at the surface of the water above them (and only makes the occasional trip to shore every few days to visit the mailbox, since now you can do sell things on the AH anywhere!, and if you get them a clipper, they can simply run an anypost owl to run mails from the clipper's deck in addition to having the scuba gear), the inconvenience is negligible.

Now that the bottom has dropped out of the milk and poo market, my EU alts have collectively constructed a veritable Atlantis in the Two Crowns aquafarming area.

&gt;Poland is one of the least multicultural countries in Europe; do you feel this is a positive or negative thing?

I only know that I'd rather deal with other problems (we're not a rich country) before we become a multicultural country. (I hear it's not really working out in Sweden)

&gt; What stereotypes and misconceptions of Poland and Polish people do you feel foreigners have?

That we're lazy drunkards. 

&gt;Really long question about farms

No idea. I'm not a farmer.

&gt; What's your favorite Polish food?

BIGOS! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigos

&gt;How do you regard the various government or social services when it comes to taxes, legal stuff, etc. Is dealing with authorities efficient?

It's not efficient, at all. I'd like to not deal with the govt or social services at all.

&gt;How are gifted children dealt with in Polish schools? Is the course of education altered do allow such children to progress faster?

Nah, this doesn't really happen here, unless the parents know what they're doing, and the educational system is mostly a failure.

&gt;The US

Seems like a cool country. Too bad they (US Govt) don't give a fuck about us, as we still need visas to enter the States.

&gt;What is your opinion of Russia? 

A country full of great people, led by a manchild with nukes. I don't mind Russians. Why would I? Most of them don't really want to drive tanks through my backyard, right?

&gt;The EU

A utopian idea that's somehow working out (at the moment). It gave us many great things, and sped up the process of the transformation in Poland, but we won't reach Western Europe anytime soon.

&gt; Why is it that one cannot speak negatively about even a single aspect of something someone else believes in 100% without the other interpreting it as ""being totally against"" the thing?

I'm sorry if I came across that way, I didn't mean to put words or ideologies in your mouth. It's just that much too often in these kinds of discussions we deal with very, very polarised opinions; I just entered this one trying to explore the middle ground between your statements up to that point and /u/smayonak's views.

&gt; I believe the government OVER regulates.

I appreciate the clarification and wouldn't hesitate to agree. We might disagree on some of the areas in which it (any government, really) does so. So while I do think that most western governments cut big banks and big businesses way too much slack or even artificially create loopholes for them, I also think that certain aspects need and (would) function best with a level ground imposed on them by government regulations. These areas are public education, public health and public safety, so schools/universities, clinics/doctors and prescription medication, and the entire law and justice department. The military is probably another sector, but I'm not knowledgable enough in that field to make any sort of judgement on it.

&gt; My experiences conversing with people who have not grown up with the understanding that THEY own the government, are its ""boss"", and that its power is meant to be limited, cannot seem to comprehend conversations with Americans about American politics. They usually can't even understand that the Bill of Rights (and other parts of the constitution) is NOT ""the government's rules for the people"", but is ""the people's rules for the government"".

Here is my main sticking point of where I think your perception is skewed. Full disclosure, I grew up in rural Austria, right at the border to Germany, born in the year when the Berlin wall came down. I know you're only describing your experiences and not making generalisations, but still I'd argue that the vast majority of central Europeans and beyond have a very good idea of the dangers of following any government blindly or being lead by any kind of ideological ""leader"". In school alone we spend between two and six whole semesters talking about the second world war and it's atrocities, and quite some time on the first one as well. We get to hear the horror stories from our (great-)grandparents who were in the thick of it all, telling us how they had been deceived on such a large scale that many of their generation still can't and won't even talk about it, as the shame of having fallen victim to such radical ideologies is too big. So I'd argue the memory of false kings and their rule is still very alive here in Europe.

Furthermore, it is very common in Austria, Germany and France to have unions fighting for fairer treatment of workers, both fighting for and against government regulation, depending on the specific cause, or talking straight to the employer, if the company employing these workers is big enough. We also routinely have protests independent from unions. So don't take the fact that we (very generally, across the board) like our free health-care, our free education and our often unarmed police force to mean that we accept big government and government overreach (If I'm putting words in your mouth again, I must have misread your statements). But this just comes back to my earlier point, that it seems to me that certain aspects of running a society should be firmly in the hands of a government, as long as that government is really accountable to its people (which in the US seems to be a long gone phantasy). Which brings me to my next point.

I do understand the US Constitution was written by the people, for the people as restrictions imposed on the government itself, just like any other country's constitution (Austria has the Bundesverfassungsgesetz), although I'd agree that most people won't see it this way, as they never cared enough to think about it or haven't been sufficiently educated themselves. The people who do care however are probably very aware.

Regardless though, I do agree with you, that the means by which a population can hold its government accountable are eroding in many ways, as any dissent is too easily discredited and crushed or ignored. The American people's awareness that they have a constitution at all might be their strongest defense, but its simultaneous worship as sort of ""perfect document of absolute truth"" (my words, obviously) obscures its real meaning a bit, at least that's the impression I got. After all, it too was written by fallible humans, and especially things like the 2nd amendment seems a bit medieval from my perspective; meaning its intentions were good, but in todays reality appears to both make the country weaker (by the shear amount of ""accidental"" killings and domestic terror through privately armed people without sufficient training as well as over-equipped and under- or inappropriately trained police forces) while simultaneously not being enough to give the supposed good populace that would defend the nation against a military overreach by Washington any real power in such a scenario, as gun owners wiling to stand up would be a fraction of the gun owners in general, and those could be easily identified beforehand and then simply be picked up one by one in covert, nightly ""snatch and grab"" operations. But this is probably expanding this discussion way beyond its scope. (Just to be clear, I don't think gun-owners and 2nd amend defenders are wrong, just often misguided)

But overall we seem to be on a similar page and I'd expect if we had this discussion in person over a beer or two we'd find a lot of common ground. I certainly failed in the ""keep-it-short department"", but I enjoy this kind of discourse so I hope you don't mind.

&gt; I suspect that the now-century-long record of corrupt government (kowtowing to the mega-corps who bought them their offices) is about to blow up in their faces.

Looking back at past empires and their demise, I tend to strongly agree on that point. When you build your mansion on pillars to keep the plebs from reaching it, don't be surprised that your house came down after half your pillars gave out at once. Especially when you pay those same plebs minimum wage to upkeep it all.

All Destiny connections are first determined based on user-chosen party (did I join with my Australian mate? did I join with my European mate?), then my locale. That's why you see ""ASUgunner420"" when you live in Arizona, and that's why you see ""LoneStar KDR"" in Texas. Its locale based. Just go to the tower and see how many college and uni based usernames populate in the first thirty seconds. If you go in solo, with no other fireteam members, you'll see only your locale. This is exactly why you **do not** see ""Brisbane ROCKS"" in crucible when you are running solo, unless the playlist is running dry of players when you are playing (which you'll rarely see). The filtering based on locale and fireteam are pretty good overall, with some notable exceptions. I regularly play from Arizona with a fireteam from New York, Utah, Texas, and California. Who do we get paired with? In most cases, west coast players. The outlier in our fireteam is New York, and his connection is the weakpoint, and while its not a bad connection, he is not given locale priori. 

As far as ""Bungie should have been using MS Azure"" (I learned it as Windows Azure a few years ago) Bungie's existing platform does use Windows servers specifically [See here](https://www.bungie.net/en/AboutUs#page=careers&amp;job=12067), but Bungie has made it very clear they do not wish to reveal too much about how lobbies and matchmaking is done. Using a packet tracer, you can tell that matchmaking feeds through a form of speed dating service that tracks (mainly) KDR, kill type, connection jitter, player traffic, and OOB deaths (fall to pit, escape from bounds). This last item being noted specifically for player location outside of map geometry. Ping, connection stability, and packet loss are all tracked pretty much in one connection service, paired to your username in game. That means there's a collated list of players who use radial switches for induced lag, list of players who just plain have a poor connection, and a list of players who should be culled from the next locale based connection. Hence why you leave to orbit every time, even with a full lobby. Backend reasons why there's no dedicated host servers is up for Derek Carroll or others to explain.

As of right now, Connection is based upon your Crucible Medal Score, which is all those little medals that populate like ""post mortem"", and in a solo fireteam, the main factors are locale and CMS. Starting with 1.0.3, most players noticed a weighting towards fireteams grouping with fireteams. So my raid/banner group would get paired with other 3/4/5/6 member fireteams more often. So now the connection criteria is: aggregate of closest members of fireteam determine locale, fireteams, locale of other fireteams aggregate, CMS.

Thanks for following the stupid format of paragraphs separating distinct subjects.

In wake of negative sentiments to the bulk of economic migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asians, Ukrainians are thus often more trusted by the Russian population.

Due to their dispersal and cultural similarity to Russians, Ukrainians often end up marrying Russians and their children are counted as Russian on the census.

Pour info je vais juste reprendre certains points de l'article qui sont en contradiction avec ce que tu as écrit (je ne veux pas perdre plus de temps pour démontrer que soit l'analyse n'a pas été comprise ou soit il s'agit de propagande trompeuse) :

&gt; ""je ne prend pas non plus mes sources dans la propagande russe""

relit l'article : la Russie n'agresse pas, c'est même l'inverse, elle essaie de se défendre (pour plus de détails cf. l'analyse)

&gt; On peut dire que l'Europe a été imprudente et qu'elle aurait du encourager l'Ukraine a rester sous la botte Russe parce que sans cela ils s'exposaient a se faire envahir

Si ton analyse était un peu plus poussée, si tous les ukrainiens étaient pro-européens, il n'y aurait pas de rebelles ce pays est un mélange de russophones et de partisants d'une vie à l'occidentale. Si la propre société civile n'est pas encore prête pour basculer sereinement, provoquer les choses ne fait que mettre le feu aux poudres... (je te relaisse lire l'analyse pour comprendre pourquoi la Russie voit l'influence de l'OTAN comme une menace avec l'Ukraine).

&gt; Il y a aussi une assimilation qui relève du fantasme entre la politique Européenne et celle des Etats-Unis, le tout mis sous le vocable commode de ""l'Occident"" représenté par l'OTAN

* How does key in lock system work?


Well, you know those numbered plastic locks you got with you CB6000? I believe that the idea of the My-Steel key-in-lock system is simply to have the key easily available on or in the belt itself, in case of emergencies etc., but which you can only get to by breaking a numbered plastic lock. The catch is that the keyholder would know if the belt was opened without permission. :) I don't know how the mechanics of the system work, however.

* Do the d rings fold down so they’re not noticible under clothes? I really don't want to bring attention to it.


Yes, I believe that any D-rings on the main belt are afforded at least 180 degrees of up/down rotation. [The D-ring shown on this picture](http://www.my-steel.de/shop/product_info.php?info=p173_d-ringe-fuer-keuschheitsguertel.html), for instance, appears to be angled downwards. (Granted, the product pictures on the My-Steel webpage aren't the most informative.) Otherwise, if you're worried about the D-rings being noticeable, My-Steel can definitely make you a belt without D-rings if you ask them.


* The plastic coated metal wire seems the most discrete option, but how would I use it for the bathroom?


I believe that you can push the wire a bit to the side when using the bathroom. It is not the easiest thing in the world, but definitely do-able. I gather that it is something you'd have to get used to, in the same manner as if you were to get a belt with an ordinary back plate. One of our German peers over at [kgforum.org](http://www.kgforum.org), the “Eigenbau”, has this to say for instance (my translation):

*“As the steel wire runs quite close through the buttocks crack and the front plate also fits rather tightly, going to the bathroom is a bit difficult. Admittedly, I can pull the steel wire a few millimetres to the side, until it is all out, and when cleaning afterwards it is no longer necessary to keep it to the side. Wet toilet paper and the job is done (well, when you have had much practice.)”*
[http://kgforum.org/display_5_2405_70223.html](http://kgforum.org/display_5_2405_70223.html)


* How easy are they to clean while wearing to keep long term wearing in tact.


I can only guess. I believe common wisdom is that long term wear is possible, but for best results it is preferable to have regular cleaning sessions where the belt temporarily comes completely off. One 24/7-user of a My-Steel Transformation belt, “Isabelle”, writes about the cleaning procedure:

*""When it comes to taking care [of the belt] I can only [recommend] lots, lots and lots of water. every evening the lovely thing gets hosed down from every angle with the shower head. I only use soap one time a week at the most. Too much soap irritates the skin under the hip band, and when residues get under the silicon profiles, it begins to stink.""*
[http://kgforum.org/display_5_2405_86534.html](http://kgforum.org/display_5_2405_86534.html)


* Is there anything else you think someone should know before buying a product, or anything I may be overlooking?


When it comes to choosing either which system you want, what penis tube you want or whether you'd prefer a waist or hip model, my best advice would be to contact My-Steel and ask them directly. They can definitely provide you with the answers you need. I gather they could also recommend you a variant which is discreet and intended for long term wear. If you live in Europe and are serious about investing in a full CB, I would strongly recommend setting up a meeting with them! They are situated in Eppertshausen just south of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. They can take your measurements and you could try several of their models to better judge which one would be best for you. 


I hope this helps. If you have further questions don't hesitate to write back. :) Cheers.

Here two very humane, non-chauvinist Germans from Citizen's organizations take to task the German government on this issue. They point out that in the Germany that pretends to not be the heir of Nazi atrocities, that the perpetrators of those atrocities as Nazi German bureaucrats and militarists are receiving funds and pensions from the Federal Republic. They also claim the unrepentant German successor government to the Nazis hides behind the work of their citizen's organizations to rehabilitate Germany's image: 

&gt;[german-foreign-policy.com: ""Justice must be Done""](http://www.german-foreign-policy.com/en/fulltext/58802) 2014/11/10

&gt;COLOGNE On the occasion of the anniversary of the Nazis' November Pogroms, german-foreign-policy.com (gfp.com) spoke with the chairs of two prominent citizens' initiatives about German commemorative culture and Germany's responsibility for Nazi crimes. They are Hans-Rüdiger Minow spokesperson for the Board of Directors of the ""Train of Commemoration"" and Christoph Schwarz, spokesperson for the Board of Directors of ""Stolen Children - Forgotten Victims."" 
german-foreign-policy.com: 'The 70th Anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp will be commemorated in January. Its survivors will look toward Germany. Would this be a reason for you to take stock?

&gt;Hans-Rüdiger Minow (""Train of Commemoration""): Should the survivors actually look toward Germany on January 27, 2015, they will do it with much bitterness and anger. Even in the seventieth year since these mass crimes, the Federal Republic of Germany is still refusing to live up to its inherited responsibilities.

&gt;**Christoph Schwarz (""Stolen Children - Forgotten Victims""): With every official means available, this heritage is either being repudiated or claimed to have already been settled.** For example, the heritage of the crimes committed on tens of thousands of children that the Nazis stole from their families in Poland, Slovenia, Czechoslovakia or Norway and abducted to Germany, because they were blond and had blue-eyes - because they had ""Aryan"" blood. The German state falsified these children's identities and put them up for adoption by Germans loyal to the regime. The Federal Republic of Germany still refuses to recognize any financial responsibility, whatsoever, toward these people, whose lives have been destroyed.

&gt;**Minow: Today they are German citizens. Even in relationship to its own citizens, Berlin does not acknowledge that the Federal Republic of Germany is heir to all the deeds and crimes committed by its predecessor government. On the other hand, Berlin does claim all the rights of this predecessor government, if it means a repudiation of this heritage.**

&gt;gfp.com: How so?

&gt;**Minow: Just this year, Berlin has argued at the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, that its predecessor government's Nazi mass crimes in Italy had been committed in the exercise of the German Reich's state sovereignty. Therefore, the victims have no right to address their claims to the heirs of the culprits. One should keep this in mind, when listening to the ceremonial eulogies in the German Bundestag.** The Nazi regime's terrorist massacres in Europe are seen as acts of sovereignty, that Berlin, today, makes reference to, to avoid its financial responsibilities, as its heir. Whoever uses this argumentation is providing the new Nazis one source of reference after the other.

&gt;**Schwarz: Those rights that the victims of the Nazis are allegedly not entitled to, are easily granted to the Nazi culprits themselves. Every month, the survivors of German soldiers - including war criminals and SS murderers - who participated in the illegal wars of aggression and annihilation waged by the Nazi leaders, are receiving high pensions. This comparison should suffice as a demonstration of how the Federal Republic of Germany is facing up to its heritage as a state.**

&gt;**gfp.com: How does that correspond to the repeatedly praised German commemorative culture, so highly venerated also abroad?

&gt;Minow: It does not correspond at all. The German government profits from the reputations of numerous citizen's initiatives and associations, with whose arduous efforts it is giving the impression abroad that Germany is facing up to its responsibilities - albeit only to the moral ones, because they do not cost anything. The objective is to lull everyone into forgetting the omnipresent material debts throughout Europe with inconsequential commemorative ceremonies and invocation of a nebulous ""responsibility.""**

&gt;**Schwarz: In my encounters with foreign survivors of the children stolen by the Nazis from their families, my experience has been that there is a correlation between the social situation in Europe and Germany's refusal to pay its debts. Many of these elderly survivors subsist in poverty. This is no coincidence. And it is not merely a personal fate. The survivors' poverty is the poverty of today's Europe, where the destruction carried out by the Germans has never really been overcome...**

Todos sabemos que la incertidumbre que se esta fraguando para las elecciones generales, porque temen que les pueda salir una úlcera en los bolsillos y maletines, por eso ese ahinco contra Podemos, por parte del PP$OE y Ciudadans, aunque este último esta actuando muy sutil contra Podemos, para poder decir que no es como el PP$OE, pero la realidad es otra bien distinta, porque ellos de vez en cuando dejan caer alguna critica hacia nuestro programa. Ejemplos: Podemos quiere VENGANZA. Nosotros queremos "" JUSTICIA"". Podemos quiere DEMOCRACIA BOLIVARIANA. Nosotros queremos "" DEMOCRACIA"" EUROPEA. Podemos quiere una renta BASICA pra TODOS. Nosotros queremos una renta BASICA solo para los TRABAJADORES, a los PARADOS NADA, QUE PAGUEN POR TENER UN TRABAJO. Detalles de estos son los que hay que tener muy en cuenta para saber quienes son, a estos les han habierto las puertas de la region de Cataluña, para que entren en las demas comunidades, para acoger el descontento de todos aquellos que el PP, ha dejado en la cuneta (Cómo a mí) pero que no cuenten conmigo, ni con mi familia que les vayamos a votar, ya que hemos decidido votar a Podemos, porque conozco a muchos que antes votaban al PP y ahora van a votar la mayoria a Ciudadans, y los otros no van a votar. Sigo. El miedo a perder lo que ya tenian, o ellos creian tener bien forjado, que es el BIPARTIDISMO, se les puede ir al garete és, con Podemos, no con Ciudadans, ni UPID, u otros partidos regionalistas, de los que ya conocemos, y que ellos en dos comunidades no sacaran ni para pagar los gastos de campaña en esas regiones, excepto en Galicia. El interés que ponen en que Podemos se introduzcan en su dinamica, les delata tanto, como a el lobo cuando va acorralando a su presa, para degollarla. Si esto hace Podemos de meterse dentro de su circulo, le ahogarian hasta matarle, como el lobo a su presa, porque si os dais cuenta les estan acusando cada vez que se presentan a alguna tertulia, que tambien son CASTA como todos ellos...Por eso ayer el del PP la tiró el cebo a Carolina, diciendola que Podemos no sabe negociar, y que van cambiando de estrategia como una veleta, todo iva por lo de Susanita el no querer apoyarla en su investidura, eso es lo que les molesta que no somos como ellos unos traidores, ladrones, mentirosos y sin principios, y eso es lo que les preocupa, que muchos españoles se dan cuenta y ven la hipocresia que hay en ellos, que todo es mentira lo del credimiento laboral, ya que no se puede entender, para muchisimos españoles que haya crecimiento laboral, y sin embargo las arcas de la Seguridad Social esten menguando, día a día, y que las pensiones no les suban, muchos de nosotros si que lo sabemos, pero hay muchisimas personas que no lo entienden, ni comprenden, ese es el miedo REAL a las ELECCIONES GENERALES.

EL MIEDO A PERDER EL PODER O  EL BIPARTIDISMO. Como la gran mayoria de los españoles sabemos muy bien que sus propositos, son forjar bien forjado el BIPARTIDISMO, como en Inglaterra o EEUU, para despues no dar opcción a mas partidos, porque les calificarian de comunismo, radicalismo, antisistemas y así un sinfin de calumnias, que para muchos de nosotros sabemos que es mentira, pero no para la grandisima mayoria de los españoles, como lo estan haciendo ahora con Podemos, acusandole de manera mas vil y mezquina, cuando en la realidad son ellos los mezquinos y traidores de todos los españoles, pero sus intenciones y propositos son destruir a Podemos, porque será la única fuerza politica que les pueda impedir sus propositos, de vender a las multinacionales España, con el TTIP, porque ayer en la sexta una mujer la pregunto a Rosa Diez, una de las que firmaron a favor de entrar en el tratado TTIP. La hizo la pregunta: ¿ Porqué votaron en contra de un referendum sobre el TTIP? Y esta pájara la contestó, que como se iva a hacer un referendum, sin haber entrado dentro del tratado, y cuando no se sabe si vamos a entrar, la mujer que la hizo la pregunta, la podria haber contestado, a esta pájara, entoces porque has firmado estar a favor sin saber su conteneido del texto. No se la puede culpar de su inocencia politica, si nó, todo lo contrario en darla la enhorabuena por el haber hecho una pregunta de tanto interés, para todo el mundo por unos medios tan vistos. Bien seguire con mi reflexión sobre el miedo a perder el poder, y lo mas importante el que haya otro partido que no quiere entrar en su circulo o manada de lobos, ¿ El porqué ese miedo ? Porque ya no se pueden repartir el pastel como a ellos les hubiese gustado, o tenian pensado desde hace años atras, por eso el sacar a Ciudadans, para dividir a la sociedad, pero en el fondo son los tres iguales, y se ha demostrado en el apoyo a la Susanita, pero esta casta y sus medios diciendo que Podemos, ponia unas condiciones muy dificiles, cuando era todo lo contrario, que era salirse del circulo de los lobos...Y como era de esperar no se podria dejar a la loba de Susanita fuera de la familia, ya que Podemos la puso unas propuestas en la mesa, (Pero no condiciones como he oido yo por algunos medios) en resumidas cuentas ahora ya se sabemos de verdad quienes son los de Ciudadans, ahora estan obligados a unirse para no perder el poder, y ese el acometido de Podemos demostrar a los españoles, que las habitaciones estaban sucias y olian a podredumbre, pero sin embargo a Ciudadans, no le ha molestado tanta basura y menos el olor, eso quiere decir que es igual que el PP$OE, ya que ellos seguiran apoyando a los de siempre, y repartiendo unas migajas, para los pocos trabajadores que queden, pero poniendo impuestos ya que si no de donde van a sacar el dinero. Y es aquí, cuando Podemos tiene la grandisima oportunidad de llegar al poder, con sus propias propuetas, de perseguir de verdad el fraude fiscal, y ahcer justicia ante tantos ladrones, sin necesidad de introducirse en el circulo de lobos, eso es realmente lo que les preocupa. Sabemos que Podemos tiene un camino muy difil, y con grandes obstaculos, pero con astucia y siendo audaz, se puede sortear las zancadillas. Ejemplo: La fuerza bruta contra la inteligencia. ( Rusia con Putin, la inteligencia. Europa y EEUU.La fuerza bruta, conclusión, Rusia es un poco mas grande ) Otro día contaré un poco mas de mis reflexiones.

I had no idea that Europe, Malaysia and all these other countries that have tested DPA and found it to be toxic are crazy. ""Bowing to conspiracy theorists,"" as you put it.

Reminds me of a European posting to Reddit last week. He said, ""As an outsider, I'm confused. From the outside looking in, it seems like America is different from the rest of the world insofar as they put products out into the marketplace--and do testing afterward . . . maybe.""

Wow! You need to write that guy and tell him that Europe has gone crazy, testing the products before putting them out. They should take the biotech company's solemn word that they're legit.

Why should we trust scientific institutions and academies in Europe? They're not going to make money on DPA apples. But the biotech companies are.

So they're the ones doing the REAL science.

Thank God we got that cleared up.

And he wasn't just a forward he was all over the pitch, a playmaker and scorer in one person. Some quotes about him:

“People argue between Pele or Maradona. Di Stéfano is the best, much more complete.” 

― Pelé

“Di Stéfano was one of the greatest footballers ever. He had such great balance.” 

― Alex Ferguson

“The most complete footballer in the history of the game.” 

― Eusébio

“Alfredo di Stéfano is maybe the greatest player I have ever seen. [...] He ran the whole show and had the ball almost all the time. I used to dream of that, and I used to hate it when anyone else got it. They beat us 3-1 and he dictated the whole game. I'd never seen anything like it before—someone who influenced the entire match. Everything went through him. The goalkeeper gave it to him, the full backs were giving it to him, the midfield players were linking up with him and the forwards were looking for him.And this was when Di Stefano was thirty. What must he have been like in his youth?” 

― Bobby Charlton

“He was simply the most intelligent football player I ever saw. If I had one player to choose, out of all of them, to save my life, he'd be the one.” 

― Bobby Charlton

“I don’t know if I had been a better player than Pelé, but I can say without any doubt that Di Stéfano was better than Pelé. I am proud when one speaks of Di Stéfano. Pelé would have flopped had he played in Europe, whereas Alfredo has played very well throughout the world. I can say that Maradona could be worse than Pelé. But I emphasize Di Stéfano was better”. 

- Diego Maradona

“Alfredo Di Stéfano was the greatest footballer of all time - far better even than Pelé. He was, simultaneously, the anchor in defence, the playmaker in midfield, and the most dangerous marksman in attack.” 

- Helenio Herrera, European Cup winning manager with Inter Milan

“No other player so effectively combined individual expertise with an all-embracing ability to organize a team to play to his command. He was “total soccer” personified before the term had been invented. Di Stéfano remains to many of us the Greatest Footballer of All Time.”

Clearly you Europeans can't read either.

I stated I leave the vehicle in gear when I am slowing using the brakes and right before I come to a complete stop (around a walking pace) I clutch in and shift into neutral.

You said that I am wrong.

Meaning in Europe everyone either throws it in neutral far before coming to a complete stop. If not that then they just ride the brakes all the way until a stall. 

There is absolutely no need to engine brake and downshift for each stop. Your brakes are for stopping. The engine can assist, yes. There's still no need each and every time under normal driving conditions. Just wears the clutch more and brakes pads are cheaper and easier than clutches to replace. When coming to a complete stop simply leaving it in gear up until the point of around a walking pace clutch in and go to neutral. 

You don't mean to tell me y'all sit at long lights with the clutch pushed in every time? That shortens the life of the throw out bearing to do that each and every time. If its for a quick stop sign, sure, clutch in only. Sitting at a two minute traffic light? Neutral. 

Hell, my last truck had such a heavy clutch I'd laugh at anyone dumb enough to sit there like a fool with their foot on the clutch for two minutes.

Europeans are basically just big bunch of hippies :D Of course there are big international brands who control the market, but natural cosmetic brands are insanely popular here, especially among younger people, therefore we have a broad selection of very good paraben-free alternatives.

I'm not against conventional products or 'chemicals' per se, but it always depends on the benefit-risk-ratio. For example a lot of chemical sunscreen filters are potentially bad, but the benefits outweigh the risks. But things like parabens have NO benefit whatsoever, so there's no reason to use them. Keep in mind that companies only use parabens or mineral oils because they're very very cheap to produce, and I'm sure there's a lot of lobbyism going on to promote them.

I take it you don't know then, that both Russia and Europe are already considered 'super powers' currently. Germany is considered one on it's own. If they continue at current pace I see china rising up to take the thrown.

It all happened so fast. They found the tumor eating my brain away in April , and it was assumed that by September I would be dead. It was shocking, but not nearly as scary as I imagined . At first I could not understand why this happened to me, I never smoke or even drink. The first month was pretty horrible, I was alone and afraid, I had no family since I was an orphan or money and I lost most of my friends after I moved to Chicago. They wanted to give me chemo but I declined, the probability of me living was 5% and I was not going to die after months of pain.

I decided to travel to Europe, I didn't have a lot of money so I had to hitchhike a lot, but I liked it. I met a lot of good people (and some bad ones). I stayed there for 2 months but the cancer started affecting my health. I couldn't concentrate, had constant headaches, twitched a lot, and my hands would shake like crazy. There was a point were I couldn't take it anymore and had to intern my self into a hospital. They flew me back a home a couple days later (I assumed i was close to dying because they kept asking me if I was sure I didn't know or remember about any of my relatives.)

I was lying in my bed and for the first time in weeks I felt okay. I wasn't shaking and could actually hold a thought for more than a minute . I felt at peace. My breathing started slowing down and I could hear a beeping noise, but nothing mattered anymore. ""This is it"" I said to my self while closing my eyes, right at that moment I heard a loud roar and I was knocked off my bed.

That woke up me up just fine. Things got wild in a matter of seconds. The ground was shaking, people were screaming and monitors were beeping. I would've had tried to help but the bed that was pinning my leg hurt like hell. I tried to get the bed off my leg but it was too heavy, meanwhile chunks of ceiling were coming down and grazing me. The wall next to my bed started to crack, it gave into the pressure and finally crumbled on top of me. The last thing I could remember was someone screaming for help.

I opened my eyes but I couldn't see anything in the darkness. I wasn't sure where I was but my leg felt heavy. I said ""hello"" to no one in particular. A door opened and some light came too. two people walked into the room. They looked dirty and tired. There was a woman with a doctor coat, and a tall muscular man with a buzz cut military I assumed. They stayed quiet and that made things pretty awkward, so I decided to break the ice.

""Any of you know its rude to stare?"" I said as I brushed some dust off me.

""Oh, I'm sorry I'm just a little surprised that you're alive."" The doctor replied while writing some notes on a paper

""Well that's a pretty fucked up thing to say to someone."" I exclaimed.

""Calm down kid, she's just trying to help you."" said the military guy

"" Okay, can you turn the lights on? I can't see a damn thing,"" And I could barely tell who was who.

""That's pretty funny considering that there's no power."" Said the Doc

""Wait, what?"" I asked her.

"" 'Wait what' what?"" the doctor cleverly said.

"" 'What' as in why is there no power?"" I replied

""The power grid was destroyed after the quakes, we lasted as long as we could with generators and people looted the hospital, but we survived thanks to Hank"" She said pointing at the military guy.

""I'm pretty confused as to how I'm alive."" I said

""Believe me we are too, you were dead for 20 minutes."" She replied

I didn't say anything I just started at her. She had to be lying. Dead for 20 minutes? That's impossible. Unless this was heaven, and if heaven was endless hot doctor-patient sex I wouldn't be mad.

""I can see you're confused so let me explain before you got back into a coma. When the quakes happened you were found under a wall. Hank helped me get you out, but when I checked your vital signs you were dead. We put a blanket over you and went to help others. A couple of minutes later I went into your room to get some supplies and you were in a different position. So I checked you pulse and I found it."" She explained

""Then the Jane came up to me and told me to carry you to the lab to scan your brain or whatever."" Hank said

""Yes, I did some tests on you because your file said that you were drying but you were alive for 4 days and that was impossible "" Jane said before I interrupted her

""How long have I been sleeping?"" I asked

""2 months."" she replied

""Wait a minute."" I said

""That's what she said boy; we ain't got time to waste."" Hank replied

""Moving on. The point is that you were not supposed to be alive because since the quake didn't kill you then the tumor would have finished you off. I ran some tests and well, it's gone."" She said

""Whats gone?"" I asked

""The tumor. It should be impossible, we never gave you treatment and the tumor was growing rapidly, but just like that it's gone.""

That thing eating my brain is gone? I thought it would eat my thoughts. I guess it changed it's mind (heh, that was funny.)

""Wow. So I'm okay?"" I asked

""Not quite, your leg was crushed pretty badly and we put a cast on it, but don't worry it should be good in a week."" She replied

I had nothing to say and I was too tired. I think she noticed.

""Well get some rest we'll talk to you tomorrow."" She said.

""One more thing Jack."" He said

""What?"" I replied

""Can you explain to me this note I found on you?"" He asked

He handed me a dirty post-it note, it said.

    "" I brought him back for you, you might need him."" -Dad

The Conservatives - based on the current polling - cannot win even a majority coalition with every right-leaning party and the Lib Dems. Now I know polls aren't usually representative of the actual outcome of the election, but I think that they will probably hold true for the most part. I suspect we might even see somewhat of a Labour surge, since the Westminster system does have an in-built Labour bonus (i.e. Labour typically receive fewer votes per won seat than all the other parties). Plus Clegg came out today as saying he will not seek a coalition with the Tories lest he face a devastating split of the Lib Dems. However, a Lab/Lib coalition could survive based upon a policy-by-policy basis with the SNP - probably not a supply and confidence deal - but a Conservative coalition could not under any circumstances survive based on that premise, on account of there being a greater number of Labour sympathetic parties than Tory ones. A Tory government could possibly be shut down by a motion of no confidence, especially, I imagine, because there is perhaps at least a small faction within the Tories seeking to remove Cameron either because a) they are anti-EU and b) because they are pro-Boris for leader, who will probably take over from Cameron following this election. 

Probably wrong, there could be some sort of disastrous 1992 type situation happening again, condemning our nation to a Tory fate (worse than death?).

&gt; In keeping with Ted Cruz&amp;#039;s contention that NASA is for exploring deep space, not studying the varied and pressing threats to our home planet, Republicans in the House Subcommittee on Science, Space and Technology voted Thursday to more or less decimate the agency&amp;#039;s Earth science budget.

1,t1_cqwi6gq,1430673357,hechade,-2,1432747742,"Its interesting when people talk about terrorism and use the word to completely shut down logical discussion. Terrorism is simply political violence. It's because the status-quo is not agreeable by some weaker power, and challenge authority through violence for *political reasons.*

Is violence wrong? Yes. That's an observation that nobody has to point out. It's like saying that *the sky is blue.* It doesn't have to be said. 

But then the real question is why politics would lead to the development, establishment, and continuation of an organization? Hamas was created to resist Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories during the first intifada. Hezbollah was created to resist Israeli human rights abuses during the military occupation of Southern Lebanon.

So the word ""terrorist organization"" seems to be misleading since people in /r/Israel tend to give it a negative connotation. Most those countries on the first list you provided above (US, Arab allies of the US Canada, Israel, Egypt, etc) commit acts far worse than those of these ""terrorists"" and on a much higher proportion. Then you'll find them even arming al-Qeuda, or rebel factions in Syria that they themselves consider terrorists. 

It's all politics. To assume simply because 7 countries that are all allies signed some list to label an opponent as terrorists is simply to give that organization a bad connotation - dehumanize their opponent. Yet in reality it is just because these organizations oppose a status-quo that harms/exploits the people that the organization claim to represent. However, those on your list benefit from maintaining this status quo for political reasons. 

In other words in order to look at the situation objectively we must realize that these lists are political, and when you frame your opponents as ""terrorists"" its easier to justify human rights abuse, murder, exploitation, or acts of war. 

The fact of the matter is that these organizations don't have jets, tanks, nukes, or huge militaries. So their tactics vary into desperate measures. When you have the United States deliberately lying under the Bush administration to invade Iraq to simply to exploit resources, what do we call that? When you have Israelis whining over a stabbing but that same day they arrested a dozen Palestinians, shot a Gazan off the coast in Gaza, demolished some family homes in the Jordan Valley, and enabled their settlers to confiscate more land, etc then what do we call that? The stabbing was terrorism but the actions by the Israelis weren't?

Again, this is all about politics. Those in power will frame any situation they see fit in order to dehumanize their opponents. 

EDIT: Just noticed you also used strange argumentation [here:] (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/34pcr4/israeli_prime_minister_benjamin_netanyahu_does/cqx1a88?context=3)

&gt;Similar examples of this, I'm not sure of. Many countries are founded by immigrants, like the United States or Mexico and all of the Western Hemisphere essentially. 

You took the position of the colonizer/colonialist/imperialist and then made the assumption that this means everything is unclaimed land because European settlers didn't yet colonize it and claim it for themselves... You used this logic to justify Israel.

It will be a long road to an international UBI. IIRC there's an EU country either considering or planning a UBI.

After the first proven successful implementation [hopefully inside a decade] a handful of other countries will hop onboard. The EU will probably consider it, and depending on the weather may just strike it down. I'll go out on a limb and say that most of the world will probably refrain until Russia, the EU, China, USA, and India all have some sort of UBI in place. This could easily be 50 years or more. If the middle east, africa, and south america calm down in that time and stabilize they will have a higher chance of implementing a system if they can get the right people in the right places; without foreign meddling, internal corruption, or treason. A country at war will sooner start a draft then a UBI. If we can stave off earth shattering catastrophes for the next hundred years, and avoid WWIII we could see international UBI before 2300.

But that is not what I am seeing. I am seeing a lot of Americans projecting their own countries issues with racism on the European problems with Muslims. 

Let me quote Christiane Amonpour(who is much more eloquent than me):

&gt;First as the PEN 6 will see from this article in Le Monde (http://bit.ly/1EHNUzt), Charlie Hebdo was NOT obsessed by Islam, was not deliberately inciting hatred of one religion, and was most certainly not aiming it's satire at France's large and beleaguered Moslem minority. The graph shows that of 523 copies of the magazine between 2005 and 2015, religion took up 38 of the covers. Of those, Islam 7, Christianity 21, and multiple religions took up 10.


&gt; In addition, while some of the PEN 6 complain Charlie Hebdo targets or offends French moslems, a precise examination of their satire shows they are actually targeting the absurdity, violence, misogyny, hatred and intolerance of global Islamic extremism. You can like or dislike what Charlie Hebdo does, find it funny or not, but to suggest that somehow they were inciting hatred and violence and ….not so subtle subtext…""oh well, the cartoonists were asking for it then"", is categorically wrongheaded, churlish and morally repugnant.

&gt;Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula groomed assassins to slaughter 12 journalists. Five million people bought Charlie's first post-disaster cover, and a similar number marched through Paris and other French cities to denounce the terrorists and stand-up for our Constitutional right to free speech and expression. Awarding Charlie Hebdo journalists is not politically correct, it fits right into PEN's agenda: Because it is the morally correct thing to do on behalf of ALL our colleagues and friends who've been beheaded, shot to death, tortured, raped and generally shut down by the hate-filled legions of Al Qaeda and ISIS.",,0,False,,literature,cqx2bp9,,0,4,t5_2qhps,t3_34polv,t1_cqx2bp9,False,,1430673351

Thus, a virus or pathogen designed to wipe out Asians could easily jump to Europeans. However, something engineered to attack a SubSaharan African won't be as likely to mutate and attack members outside his subspecies.

Therefore, in order to effectively wipe out the Negro population, some future great scientist will have to engineer several viruses in order to wipe out *all* the SubSaharan African ""human"" subspecies.",,0,False,,CoonTown,cqx2yae,,0,4,t5_351zk,t3_34ppzm,t1_cqx2yae,False,fullape,1430674607

Do you think you guys are special? Because this is what annoys me about Eastern Europeans. The Irish experienced more than 800 years of occupation and total devastation from the British. It was only 40 years ago when Catholics were running to the Irish border to be treated. The Turks and Greeks have a bloody history that stretches over 1000 years. The last major war ended up in Greece carving an extremely bloody path into Anatolia and the Turks punishing Greeks they captured with brutality.

So yeah Russia and Lithuania have a bad past. So fucking what? Do you think after 24 years the Russians woke up and decided to take Crimea just because they could? After ignoring Crimeans for 24 years especially the 1994 referendum and Ukrainian suppression of it?

The fact is that Russia was perfectly happy having their most important naval and military bases in Southern Russia stationed in Ukraine. When pro-Western Ukrainians (with help from Americans and Eastern Europeans) toppled a democracticely elected leader and wanted to join NATO despite the majority of the population being against. 

You damn right they took it. It would have been idiotic for them to leave their most important assets in the hands of an organisation that was built to be anti-Russian.

&gt;So what am I supposed to do now? Start praising the glorious russia and it's glorious army? Of course they would take over us quickly, if NATO didn't get involved, or would get involved just very little. So again I'm asking, what am I supposed to do about it? If that happens, then it happens. No matter what we talk or do will prevent that. I still think that us being in NATO lowers that risk, no matter what you say.

Your comments are ridiculous because you live in a ridiculous world. Nobody has asked for Easternerss to subjugate themselves to anybody. What is being asked is for them to stop ramping up tensions that they need us to help them with.

When American neo-cons come up with a plan to weaken Russian deterrence and leave Russia vulnerable to NATO nuclear strikes without retaliation, you say no. When the government next to you is anti-NATO, you don't undermine them. When you meet anti-Russians from other countries,, you wish them well. You don't start supporting them and becoming their voice in the EU. When Western Europeans see no reason to spread westward into anti-EU countries. You don't go around pushing us to do so. When the Germans say that Ukraine joining NATO is a bad idea, you don't make Nazi jibes.

There is a big difference between subjugating yourself and seeking better relationships. How much trouble do you think Finland and Russia normally have? Very little. For an obvious reason.

Many people will always prefer to spend cash on an original design in a country they may love to give their hard earned money back into their own local place of origin's economy. Also, the high end gear usually has better machined tolerances(not always) and may use superior/safer grade of metal, where as the Chinese equivalents may be suitable but it is also a gamble with their mystery metal alloys. Some people also feel inclined with their morality to support the original manufactures if it is regarding clones. 

Now if we are talking about Chinese ""originals"" there may be pros and cons to them, but some people are still going to be more inclined in buying a Billet Box over a Joyetech eGrip and there are going to be people more inclined to buy an original SquapeR then a Kanger subtank. 

 My only issue with dropping serious cash on high end gear is the nature that those items eventually and quickly becomes obsolete and irrelevant when the next big thing hits the market, and unlike two years ago when I started vaping, the competition is more fierce then it ever was. Quality low priced item were nearly non existent, unless it was overpriced starter kit quality items. China has been great at replicating high end items and making them affordable, but nothing they have done really is innovative, its only evolutionary. Redesigns to airflow options or giving a Kayfun like tank with pyrex and bigger airflow is not innovation, and people misuse the word constantly when it comes to small tweaks to already staple designs that have become almost standard. 

Sure, tanks like the Lemo, Goblin/Goliath and the various subtank out there are cheap and works great that have given newer vapors a good product without having to buy clones or pricey authentics. However, I feel the quality of a Lemo(even though they come clean clean clean) have atteocialy bad threads and the flavor from it is a little bit muted compared to a Kayfun or Taifun GT, which its kind of a resigned Kayfun in essence. The Kanger subtank has become one of the most popular tanks on the market since the Kayfun, and is a hell of a good bit of kit and affordable. Its all I use, but I'm not a fan of its look aesthetically and a lot of earlier adopter of the mini had issues galore with inferior insulators and poorly machined juice channels on the RBA base, which was later addressed. Getting those fixed on earlier tanks can attest that bad customer service it is to deal directly with a Chinese company. Most of the time why people still buy American or European (or even Phillipino goods) is that if an issue arises, typically its easier to address. 

Edited: 

 Also I see that China is more likely to pump product after product to market with little support on the items and more likely to produce a bunch of stuff more geared to the trends of the market here in the states. When copper mechs became popular, even with mods that didnt have a copper version in existence, china was pumping them out. When 26650 mods for those 3-4 months became somewhat popular, china was pumping out 26650 version of mods that didn't have one. When modders were making Hammond boxes with 120w Raptor chips in them, China kicked off the high wattage box mod wars. Now that more and more people are sub ohming in the US, china is flooding the market with sub ohm capable clearomizers and tanks. Due to the popularity of the original Vaporshark and the Chinese iStick, other manufactures went nuts with pumping the market with 20-70 watt mini box mods. 

Give it two weeks to a month, a version 2-100 whatever will be released, adding some small tweaks to the original design and making the former seem silly buying and then the early adopters need to upgrade to be ""current""(which then leaves wholesalers, warehouses, and B&amp;M with older gear that becomes impossible to sell without taking a huge loss on the inventory). Despite people's hate towards companies like ProVape, Hana, V3 Tronix, Reo Mods and few others, they stand behind a product, regardless of how old it gets. Rob has updates a few things with the Reo, but its still the same Reo since 2012. ProVape, despite missing the nail on the head with the P3, had a long track record with the original Provari and Provari 2 for years even when the market seemed to go in an opposite direction. Despite having a few newer mods, V3 backs the Flip second to none. My problem with Chines manufacturers is that they flood the market (which is not always a good thing in Econ 101) but don't back those products, which the consent flooding represents that. Do it right the first time or so, and let it run its course. 

Now we are going to see a flood of temp control mods that do little more than what is already there, before the tech itself gets to a suitable level that is both highly and consistently functional and user friendly for newer users and not alienate older adopters. 

Hell, I see a lot of people call top fill tanks the way of the future, which I find funny is because before the emergence of the Evod and Protank, all early clearomizers were all top fill, which I think a lot of newer vapors fail to realize. I remember a time most people as well as those beloved YouTube reviewer celebs complained when tanks were NOT bottom fill method, and now they want nothing to do with it. In fact if anything, there is no innovation but evolution, and we are going back full circle. For me, all I'm saying, is that China in this industry follows trends and gives us more of same, and seem to spearhead certain trends and movements that were already there to begin with.
