My account number and a 8 digit password. It does not even accept longer passwords. Then if you log in from a unknown machine or IP address you will get one of 5 secret questions. Some of those questions are very easy to figure out for a hacker that is good in social engineering. Like becoming friends on facebook bye pretending to be somebody that you victim knows. Posting some dog pictures in the hope the victim starts talking about her dog. Now you know the answer to the secret question ""what is the name of my dog"".

And of course when you have smuggled a Remote Assistant Tool in to somebodies computer. Now the hacker is seeing what you are seeing and the hacker could just delete all your cookies 5 times. Now after you log in 5 times the hacker would easily have all the answers. Or a key-logger would work too. Anyway let me come to my point. Banks in Canada do this because they don't have much to worry about. You see a transaction you did not make, you call your bank. They will reverse the transaction. You get your money bank and so does the bank. So who is the victim? Well the hacker buys something nice on Kijiji. Pays with a email transfer from your bank account because he has access. The seller on Kijiji get's the money in his bank account .Sends you the stuff. And if the person who's bank account you hacked in to figure out that money is missing. He calls his bank. Bank reverses transaction. Kijiji guy is the victim, suddenly his saldo changes. 

In the richer countries in Europe almost all the banks have random readers. You log on online with your alias or bank card number. Website gives you random numbers. You put your bankcard in the random reader. Type in your PIN. Type in the numbers on the website. Random readers gives you numbers back. You type that in an you are logged on. When you do transaction above a certain value. Before you send out that money, the random reader will ask you to put that number in too. This way you avoid man in the middle attacks. A man in the middle attack is when you think you are logging on to your bank but really you are talking to hacker. The hacker uses all the information you give him and he talk's to your online banking, relaying everything like a man in the middle.  Until you make a transaction, he will change the amount and the bank account it's suppose to go to. A random reader that check's the numbers will prevent this. 

In the end it's all about what is cheaper for the bank. In Europe it's cheaper if the bank protect both itself and it's customer. In Canada apparently investing in online bank security is not worth much to the bank. There will always be a victim, but it's not going to be the bank.  "

That's why Shantae was my jam for so long, even if I wasn't very good at Metroidvania games.  Some people complain about her outfits.  I'm like, ""w/e.  Half-genie girl goes on magical adventure to save the world?  This is what I wanted the storyline of Aladdin to be like.""

Hmmm.  What's _really_ hard to find are _explicitly_ Latina protagonists.  There are a bunch of games with brown-skinned girls of unspecified ethnicity as leads (see Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Oxenfree), but they're sorta blank slates, and you often don't see a lot of real cultural specificity attached to them.  The same way there's the, ""Missus Man,"" trope in video games, you also sorta have the, ""White Girl with Brown Skin.""  That's not to say that Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Oxenfree aren't both amazing games with great writing.  It's just that they're short on substantive racial subtext.  I still give them points for thinking to have a non-white protagonist, though.

There's Nilin from Remember Me.  Again, I'm not really sure what she is.  Maybe?

Miku from Submerged?  No, also reaching.

Oh.  Perhaps the most widely-played single lead woman of color!  Chell.  Most people don't realize that because [this is what they see of her](http://images.gameskinny.com/gameskinny/14762c63cc456bbc41569eff6de24141.jpg).  This is [Chell](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Chell), and this is [Alésia Glidewell](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Al%C3%A9sia_Glidewell), the half-Brazilian, half-Japanese woman who served as Chell's body model.  This isn't exactly what you were looking for, since her model is of mixed race, and she's not even explicitly stated as being such in-canon, but it's the closest I can think of to a Latina lead in a blockbuster video game.

That said, one good place to look for Latina leads is the blossoming Latin video game industry.  There's Toren, a game by Swordtales, which is Brazil-based.  It's a dark fantasy action adventure game with a female protagonist.  I don't think she's explicitly Latina, since this is a fantasy world, but it looks like a Latin woman was at least used as the template here.

I'm sure there are others.  I'm not really that knowledgeable about that scene, though, and it's not that big to begin with.  Most game development is still happening in North America, Europe, and Asia."

-----------
https://youtu.be/58UT5zjFbbs

A hard-hitting behind-the-scenes look at the luxury fashion industry today. There was a time when luxury was available only to the rarefied and aristocratic world of old money and royalty. Luxury wasn't simply a product, it was a lifestyle, one that denoted a history of tradition, superior quality and offered a pampered buying experience. Today's luxury marketplace would be virtually unrecognizable to its founders. Gone are the family-owned businesses dedicated to integrity and quality; the industry is now run by multi-billion dollar global corporations focused on growth, visibility, brand-awareness, advertising and above all, profits. Handcrafted goods are practically extinct, and almost all manufacturing has been outsourced to large factories in such places as China, where your expensive brand-name handbag is being assembled right next to one from a mass-market label that will cost substantially less. Dana Thomas, a journalist who has covered style and the luxury business for The Washington Post, Newsweek and The New York Times Magazine from Paris for the past fifteen years, digs deep into the dark side of the luxury industry to uncover all the secrets that Prada, Gucci and Burberry don't want us to know. Traveling from the laboratories in Grasse, where the ingredients for Christian Dior and Prada perfumes are produced, to the crowded factories in China, where workers glue together ""Made in Italy"" bags by the thousands, Thomas explores the whole of today's high-end shopping experience to answer some pressing questions: What is the new definition of luxury when advertising for this lifestyle is targeted mainly toward the mass market? What are we paying for when quality has given way to quantity? Can integrity survive in a corporate culture driven to meet regular growth and profit projections? Is luxury still the best that money can buy?

I think you haven't understood what I meant in relation to Ireland, I'm not saying that Ireland and its people has no rights.  I'm saying that ultimately and through no fault of their own the Irish are caught in the middle of wranglings between the EU and the UK.

The very serious implications of this, if negotiations do not go well is either:

1. the erection of a hard border with NI-ROI, and the dissolution of the UK-ROI common travel area

2. Ireland potentially facing exit from the EU

I ordered these in likelihood, but neither of those options are particular good for the people of the ROI.

The best option therefore is some kind of compromise deal, that includes ROI, and protects the interests of the Irish people.  That 'best' deal is probably an arrangement that mimics as much as possible the current situation on the ground today.  However we know that exact replication of that is not going to be possible and there is going to have to be some flex.

If the ROI wishes to keep the common travel arrangement with the UK, as the UK does, then something will have to give.  If the ROI wants to prevent a hard border, as the UK does, then something might have to give there also.  There is no question of this being taken out of the hands of the Irish people, in fact any solution must have the consensus of the Irish - I don't know where you could have taken me to mean otherwise.

I have said on here (and I have searched but could not find it, because I post too much lol) that the Unionists up North, and the British government need to be thinking more about their countrymen in the ROI.

I'm afraid I'm just being truthful when I say that out of the EU, the UK and the ROI, the ROI has the weakest hand to play.  They are swept up in a moment of history and the UK and the EU need to be looking to minimize that hurt.

Understand?"

Germany decides its trade and economic policies on pretty much the same economics as the US does. Again, you seem to be ignoring that comparative advantages are a thing and that they matter in these discussions. Germany produces what it has a comparative advantage in, not what it produces against it's own best interests. Germany is not a highly protectionist country - in fact, Germany *can't* be, as it's part of the EU.

In large part, a lot of the suffering of many areas in the US is a result of bad policy...and in the case of rural areas it is more often than not Republican politicians who are trying to buy the favour of the electorate who enact these bad policies. And I won't say it's that they do it solely for political reasons, I think some of them really think they are trying to do good, but they are dangerously uneducated and don't understand even basic econ, which creates the terrible effects we see today. Things like promising to keep jobs that end up doing more to hurt everyone than help them.

Another factor is that modern Americans just seem very stubborn to pack up and leave as the economy mandates. That is to say, when jobs start going away from one region they decide to stay instead of moving to where the new, good jobs are. And in fairness this is due to their economic condition in many cases, but there are also definitely strong stubbornness and cultural factors at play."

I think it is exactly that business of going ""look how far ~~they~~ have come, isnt that great?"" is so disingenuous and frankly the largest symptom of the systemic racism found throughout mankind, yet in this case, specifically, the United States.

It is my belief that social liberals--essentially Democrats--attempts to 'celebrate race' have done nothing more than to exacerbate racial tensions. The proper response would have been to ignore race once they were afforded the full rights and freedoms of the majority population. 

Look back at your history. The worker has been exploited by the owner of the means of production since the dawn of mankind. WAY before Marx ever puts the words to paper (to be fair his partner Eingels put it on paper). The king exploited the peasant, the master the slave, the capitalist the worker. However in only one of those systems does a man have mobility. The peasant is incapable of becoming the king, he was not chosen by god. The slave is...a slave. But the worker can accrue the capital to purchase the land to own the means of production. 

The function of a liberal democratic government is to, independent of all other ties save merit, promotes the private ownership of land and capital, and facilitates and environment for a market economy. 

By extension, possibly the biggest facet of this is education. We are a multi ethnic federal society. We are made up of many ethnic groups, cultures and subcultures. To teach a euro-centric conception of history is indeed disingenuous. The best way, in my opinion, is to be as cold and honest as possible with the hard-to-swallow elements. Then contextualize. Was owning slaves horrible? Absolutely. Was it a common practice in 1776? Worldwide, absolutely. Was the economic prosperity of the United States founded on the backs of slaves until the industrial revolution? 100%. Look at Thomas Jefferson who loved his slaves (note a coincidence with the last name and a large portion of our black population), or John Brown the abolitionist. 


Sure Europeans did some heinous shit. Black cheifs sold their people for short term profits. The spanish mercilessly killed the Incans. Yet without trying first contact would have nearly wiped the continent clean of human life without further European help.

Tribal warfare is human nature. Europeans fought, arabs, tribes in africa, indonesia, far east. 

The only group that hasnt fought itself is liberal democracies. The theory is, if the world were united under democratic  market economies that war would stop. Nation states would not have incentives to declare war. 

As the world has shifted towards more free market (counting socialist market economies like found in Europe) economies and democratic forms of government it has become noticablly more safe. Trending towards safety, even today.

Less people die from conflict today as a % of world population than any other time in history. Less people die from starvation and disease. The world is fundamentally a safer place for humans as time goes on. Even slavery which has in absolute numbers more people in slavery than in the years leading up to the American Civil War, is a much smaller figure as a percentage of the world that prior to the civil war. 

People, Americans particularly, don't feel safe, largely because of mis and disinformation. Fear sells. 

General curiosity, i find it helpful to understand the bias of an individual i am debating with. A black American and a Russian may have similar synthesis on Capitalism. However, the assumptions and set of analyses each used would be wildly different. If one hopes to truly understand the other side they must identify why the other side thinks the way they do.

So in as short and in general terms as i can, White, college educated, lived in 10 states and 1 foreign country for a short time, 27 years old.

In essence i have to think to empathize with those who capitalism has not positively affected. I'm not a fucking dummy so i can sympathize, yet I am the product of the successes of capitalism. "

&gt; Enter Shikari is a four-piece experimental post-hardcore band from St Albans, Hertfordshire, England formed in 2003. The band's music incorporates various rock and metal sub-genres with elements of various electronic genres such as electronica, dubstep, trance, and drum and bass, making the band particularly difficult to assign to one genre. The incorporation of electronic genres has become more prominent in their music throughout the band's history. Lyrically, their music tackles political, social and scientific issues.

&gt; The band is named after a boat belonging to Roughton ""Rou"" Reynolds' uncle, and a character in a play which he wrote before forming the band, both of which are named Shikari. Despite being offered several major label record deals, their debut album Take to the Skies was released on their own label - Ambush Reality - in March 2007, reaching the dizzy heights of #4 in the UK's official Album Charts and going on to sell over 100,000 copies in the UK (the album was released in Europe through PIAS, in North America on Ambush Reality / Tiny Evil, and in Japan on Hostess).

&gt; In March 2008, after spending 12 months on the road across the globe, Enter Shikari set up camp in their rehearsal room (a large shed in Chris Batten's back garden which they christened ""The 'Low"") to begin writing tracks for their second album such as Antwerpen which was released as a free digital-download from the band's website.

&gt; In July they played to their largest live audience at the UK date of Linkin Park's 'Project Revolution' travelling festival alongside JayZ, Pendulum and N*E*R*D, as well as playing several shows with Linkin Park in mainland Europe.

&gt; Enter Shikari followed a UK / Ireland tour in October 2008 with the release of a one-off single 'We Can Breathe In Space, They Just Don't Want Us To Escape' (a finished version of a track the band demoed in 2005 but never got around to ever finishing properly until the summer 2008).

&gt; In mid-November 2008 the band started work recording their second album in Arreton Manor on the Isle of Wight with producer Andy Gray. Here they demoed, produced and mixed new tracks for the band's second album titled Common Dreads which was released June 15th 2009 on CD, Vinyl and digital download. The first track to be heard by the public was Juggernauts aired on 15th April 2009 as Zane Lowe's ""Hottest Track in the World"" on BBC Radio 1. Juggernauts was released on the 1st June 2009 reaching #26 in the UK Official Single Charts and was aired regularly by Radio 1.

&gt; Following the release of Common Dreads via Ambush Reality on the 15th June 2009, the album reached #16 on the UK Top 40 Official Album Chart and was highly-rated by magazines such as Kerrang!, Rocksound and Metal Hammer. No Sleep Tonight was also released as a single on August 17th 2009 with a large number of remixes following it from artists such as ROUT, Mistabishi, The Qemists and LightsGoBlue.

&gt; The band recently visited the US, Germany and the Czech Republic on a mini-tour and have another UK tour scheduled for October 2009 supported by The Devil Wears Prada and also a number of dates with The Prodigy in November.

&gt; After their late 2009 UK tour, Enter Shikari toured throughout the US on the extensive summer of 2010 Vans Warped Tour. November 2010 saw Enter Shikari touring with 30 Seconds to Mars.

&gt; Enter Shikari's third album titled A Flash Flood Of Colour was recorded at Karma Bay Studios in Bangkok, Thailand and was produced by Dan Weller (former-SikTh guitarist). The album was released on the 16th January 2012 in the UK and worldwide. The first single from the LP was ""Sssnakepit"". It was released on September 20, 2011 as a digital download. According to the Sssnakepit Songfacts, ""Quelle Surprise,"" which was made available in May 2011, was originally intended to be the first official release from the set, but the band ultimately decided to not include it on the album in the end, although did include it on the Deluxe Version. The second single, ""Ghandi Mate, Ghandi"" was released as a digital download on iTunes in December, followed by a video of single 'Arguing with Thermometers' posted on YouTube a few days before the release of the album.

**Debate Side**

We both agree information is heavily manipulated, and this influences the vote in a very significant way. However, I know that it is more than the media; and this last election speaks very clearly to that fact. Social networking is a much more significant factor. Word of mouth is how the election was won/lost.

I get you are trying to discuss the validity of representation as a a core value of a government. I would want to add some clarity to several points.

First, Representation OR Suppression, this seems to be your perspective, but I find nothing to indicate a lack of representation is the same of suppressing people.

Second, Representation can and does occur, even if people don't vote directly for something. If I am a dicatator, I can purposefully take time to find out what my people want, and then do it. Technically, I can do this at the same time as arresting my oponents to solidify my power.

In this example, I am both suppression and representing my people, potentially even the people I arrested.

Third, Representation is primarily intended as a means of ensuring the quality of life of the residents. We go back in history, people just wanted to make sure the ruling class couldn't get away with their crimes.

I would guess an order of representation to look something like this: (Please edit the list to represent your own opinion)

I want food &amp; drink.
I want shelter.
I want clothes.
I want employment.
I want legal protection.
I want _________. 

I left the last one blank, because I honestly don't want anything else from my government. Keep in mind, I do not believe that it is a governments job to GIVE me those things, but to give me an equal opportunity as any other person.

So here is the big question. If a governement provides everything you want, but refuses to let you speak out about it's actions. Is this good of bad?

I like the idea of a simplified system. Something like what I said above. I think that combined with your idea could work well.


**Factual Side**

Unfortunately, it already sort of exists. It isn't very clear or easy to understand, but I believe the US government has something like that in place.

Again, I tried searching for it online, and I got no where. So the infromation is far from commonly available, but I think the US voter is supposed to vote 2 times every year (I can't, because I am not a resident at any local body). Those votes are exactly for what I said above.

I typed, into my search engine, ""How many times a year do you vote?"" And got only stuff about presidential election.

Finding out the real numbers and facts is apparently very difficult anymore. Go to your local voting office, they are LEGALLY required to tell you the voting information for your area. If they give you any crap, they are breaking the law and you can threaten to press charges. Then they will say something like...

""Oh THAT voting information. I missunderstood you, I thought you where talking about the BIG vote.""

For every time a person votes for the president, in the region I come from, there where AT LEAST 7 other times people are supposed to vote. These votes influence a lot of the local, daily life aspects of your government.


**My Opinion on the current State of Affairs**

I won't give facts, but I have first hand experience that lends me to believe this is how a sizeable portion of the US system works. Believe it or not, I don't care.

The system is rigged. Not in any corruption way, but in the world's most compicated RED HERRING fashion. The presidential vote is the LEAST important vote of a US citizen, but both major parties don't want that to be common knowledge.

Everything screams, ""PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION"" and that is the trick. Now most people believe that they only need to vote on the 'important' vote, once every four years. Maybe a HARDCORE voter, will take the time to vote in the off season (every two years).

I found the person with real power, controlled how many people knew what and when to vote on smaller issues. In an area of about four states he manipulated the turn out on the semi-annual votes. Effectively allowing him to maintain control over the local governments of those areas.

I will not take legal action, because there is nothing he is doing that is illegal. He is simply informing/recommending a 'network' of 'friends' when, where, and how to vote. It is because most people, DO NOT TAKE THE TIME TO STUDY HOW THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORK, that he is able to manipulate such a large area.

Study the government, originally, local governments where supposed to have almost an absolute say in what happened. Each State, origianlly, was almost a completely unique nation. The National body, originally, was something akin to what the EU is today.

This is, in my opinion, why your system will do nothing, and why I quit my political career. I was disgusted to learn, that the Republicans and Democrats, behind locked doors, where actually on fairly good terms with each other. The guy I knows and his party opposite, treated the political future of four states like a game of Chess. They where frienemies. Taunting the opposite with how they tricked them into losing control over a district.

**EDUCATION**

I am serious, everything you are wanting probably exists on the local level. Go to your local voting office, and start digging. It is all public knowledge.

Oh, I would enjoy continuing the discussion part. Quite enjoyable!"

That's some next level bullshit. What about Syphilis? It is strongly assumed that it was brought to Europe through the Columbus expedition (because it was documentated in America before the outbreak overseas). There were about 5 millions deaths because of the low immunity of Europeans. People from around the world have different immune systems based on the common diseases there. There are even differences in gut bacteria based on the different food and environment. It's that simple. 

**edit**: I found an article I read a year ago about the Hazda, an african hunter-gatherer tribe. Their gut bacteria is surprisingly different.

 “The Hadza not only lack the ‘healthy bacteria,’ and they don’t suffer from the diseases we suffer from, but they also have high levels of bacteria that are associated with disease,”.

So not only they don't suffer from our diseases, they even have pathogens in their guts that would make us sick but they don't give a fuck and are perfectly healthy. If you would live with them and they would share their food with you you would get really sick and most likely die without medical help.

**edit2**: It's also funny that you mentioned the 10k deaths by small pox to prove that their immune system is inferior while there were around 300-500 million deaths worldwide in the 20th century. It would still be deadly to all of us but thankfully we developed a vaccination and whiped it out that way.

China tried something similar but reality stepped in and they are now building their own biotech industry. 

The science is clear on this issue; there is no difference in health or safety between GM and non-GM crops.

so I'm gonna try to give an answer. While I'm a German (proof: äöüß :-) I obviously can't speak for all of us.

I am 38 now; I do care about the Holocaust/Nazi/war history. More than average I should say.

Let's start by saying that the Third Reich was a fascist regime that brought incredible suffering, and violence to Europe and the World. This is generally accepted in Germany, and I would say there is no serious controversy about that. Nobody is ""happy"" about the War here, except possibly extreme fringe opinions.

Nowadays, ~75 years after the invasion of Denmark and Norway, hate and anger are a bit difficult - the people alive are not to blame for the atrocities. However, so much damage has been done that I have from times to times felt anger, grief and shock: For example, learning about the Siege of Leningrad, about the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia. (These are just what I learned as an adult; I'm not even talking about the Holocaust or the War itself, both were covered in my school education.) And sometimes about more benign things - the Nazis really messed with german and european culture in ways that are hard to ignore- science, arts, jewish culture, homosexual subculture and acceptance, the attitude towards ""outsiders"" and ""troublemakers""). We have recovered from a lot of these burdens, but traces remain.

**About Denmark and Norway** - I am not an expert, and I'm trying to answer using only my memory - so prepare for some huge errors in the following. I assume that the Nazis were after Norwegian oil reserves and occupied Denmark to control acces to both Norway and the Baltic sea. Finland was fascist and aligned with Germany, right? Sweden I know was neutral for the duration of the war, but at Germany's mercy? And collaborated to some extend? I do not know how Denmark and Norway were governed during the occupation. Were danish authorities working under german supervision or something? I believe that the jewish population of Denmark was saved from deportation by either the danish state, or by danish resistance, or both. Knowing this, and that there was no effective resistance during the war in Germany itself, this must be a huge success. I believe that in numbers, the death toll in Denmark and Norway were probably much lower than, for example, that of Poland; maybe that's why I don't know much? (On the other hand, the siege of Leningrad is almost unheard of in Germany despite incredible suffering). I just guess that for the occupying Wehrmacht, Denmark must have been relatively peaceful since no large fighting happened on the ground? But I do not know about air raids, I do not know about Danish resistance, and I do not know the circumstances of the danish population.

That's about it. I do not know the exact date of the invasion of Denmark. First Poland, then France, then Denmark? Pretty sure it was before the attack on the Soviet Union. I do not know anything about the Finland-Soviet war, including dates and the relation to Norway and Denmark.

So we (Germans) do not know much about Denmark and Norway during WW2; most people will acknowledge the sacrifice paid and the successes achieved by foreign resistance movements (but I've talked to an old Wehrmacht veteran that was still caught in Nazi propaganda, and for example blame the partisans for any atrocities the Wehrmacht has committed - he also denied any such atrocities, and blamed the victims).

But really most people nowadays don't care much because it's history. Fringe opinions exists that regret the total defeat of Nazism, but they're rare and usually fast to single out one allegedly good aspect (like ""law and order"" :-O ), and some few people consider the post-war Germany as illegal or shameful, like a second Versailles. The prevalence of these minority opinions is difficult to estimate; they are not represented in the political party system, except for the neonazi NPD (but even they are careful), but they are latent in parts of the population.

The war doesn't usually come up in conversations; in most families the involvement of grandfathers in the Wehrmacht isn't known in detail. Memorials commemorating Nazi violence are common: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein

**I would love to hear more about your reasons to ask.**

Well, I guess I'll be heading to the Wikipedia to get me some education.

(As an aside, I would say that ""ordinary citizens"" or Wehrmacht veterans (that is, most of my grandparents) had a share of the responsibility. And after 1945 I think that healing and reconciliation were generally unwanted in Germany, adding to Germany's responsibility. And the idea of a brave, unpolitical, honorable Wehrmacht is a myth.)"

Do you know that Americans and Europeans who you claim to be masters DO NOT even have their own sovereign currencies and the banking cartel is a Bolshevik leftist (communist) ownership.
Do you know that Westerners are speaking out against killing people who DO NOT commit violent acts and demand the rights be given to all Filipinos to the due process of law before being summarily executed based on suspicion?
Do you know that less than 2% of drug users are addicts and the act of ingestion or inhalation is itself a non violent act being punished by death?
Do you know that by suggesting people be killed without being able to defend themselves in court is SCARING / terrorizing people?
Do you know that the number one destination for Filipinos is America? Do you know that the 2nd largest group of immigrants in America is Filipino? Did you know that when Filipinos come to america they are allowed to buy land and a gun for self protection and are allowed to partake in political protests and are welcome to give their views? Do you know that Filipinos in the USA earn more than natural born Americans (no discrimination)
Did you know that Americans and Europeans donated 44 times what China did when you were in need during last storm? Did you know that it was Americans than help liberate your country from the Japanese and many gave their lives to defend you?
Do you know it was the west that stood up for your rights in the spratley islands? Did you know after the European world court decided in your favor that America started to bring military support? Do you know that China and USA are NOT enemies at all and that they are major trading partners. Do you know that Trump and Putin are against the leftist new world order that is behind the pain in this world. Did you know that America and Russia have much to benefit from peaceful relationship and that neither Russians nor Putin hates Americans? Did you even Hear the many speeches Putin has made to the american people via press conference of a warm diplomatic stance of friendship?

You should check *your* sources. You may have missed *the citation on the very page* you link regarding the University at Constantinople as stating ""**the medieval Greek world knew no autonomous and continuing institutions of higher education comparable to the universities of the later Middle Ages in Western Europe.**"" As it is, I wonder what type of reception the University of Constantinople would receive today *in Orthodoxy* as dedicated as it was to Aristotelianism (not made widely known until the *Latins* proliferated Aristotle's writings). 

&gt; Photios I of Constantinople

The schismatic who [perpetrated fraud](http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/4_ch05.htm#_ednref7) and usurped the position of a saint? Just. No.

&gt; Glagolitic alphabet

The following is taken *from the very page you cite*: ""After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, **religious ceremonies and Divine Liturgy were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire**, using the Byzantine rite. **Fearing growing Byzantine influence** and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine Constantinople. As a result of Boris' measures, two academies, one in Ohrid and one in Preslav, were founded.

From there, the students traveled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to Croatia (Dalmatia), where the squared variant arose and where the Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, **Pope Innocent IV granted the Croats of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the Roman Rite** liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of Senj, **the permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the Roman Rite conducted in the Slavic language instead of Latin, not the Byzantine rite), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the Adriatic coast. The Holy See had several Glagolitic missals published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.** In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the Slavic language in the Mass continued, until replaced by the modern vernacular languages.""

Emphasis mine. *Did you read the page*?

&gt; remember that time that the Catholics thought they were helping ""Christendom"" (and empty term if I've ever heard one) and then single-handedly destroyed a monarchic republic that at its zenith straddled three continents? I do.

No, I don't remember ""that time"" because the destruction of the Byzantine Empire (and with it claims of Orthodoxy's supremacy to the Roman Church as the ""New Rome"") came after centuries of mismanagement by Byzantine Emperors and clerics. Are you recalling the sack of Constantinople by Byzantine mercenaries in 1081? Probably not, because you're unaware of it (just like you're unaware of the Massacre of the Latins in 1182; though I could see why since anti-Latin pogroms were and apparently remain common). So you must be referring to the Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople, which occured:

* After secret alliances were struck between the Byzantines and the Moslems during the Third Crusade which betrayed the Latins
* After the Byzantine emperor - himself emperor by intrigue plotted against the previous emperor - was deposed by intrigue by the new emperor, who promptly betrayed the Latins by refusing to honor the treaty signed by his predecessor
* After a Byzantine a surprise attack on the Latin fleet by Byzantine ships as an attempt to starve them 

So - what, are you joking?"

Por exemplo, quando alguém está em algum julgamento e se defende, não se defende pessoalmente (embora a lei permita auto defesa). Mas sim utiliza uma pessoa de confiança (o advogado), o qual tem maior conhecimento sobre o assunto e, em conjunto, ambos formam um plano de defesa.

Neste caso, pelo menos eu acho, é semelhante. Eu li o texto, que é bem curto e com escrita típica de legislação, e precisei de ajuda para interpretar.

Se no meu julgamento eu aceito que determinadas pessoas têm capacidade de interpretar um texto desse, eu posso considerar que há uma probabilidade alta que se eu também tivesse o conhecimento necessário para interpretá-lo eu iria tomar conclusões semelhantes. Não significa que eu estaria correto no meu julgamento, mas sim que é bem provável que iria para o mesmo caminho. Então eu faço essa decisão de me identificar no movimento.

Think about how nervous an exam makes people. Most people hate being tested. What does a test involve? All questions! 

People associate questions with high pressure and nervousness. They don't want to give the wrong answer. In the past, when people gave wrong answers, it made them feel stupid and less than. It could mean a bad grade in class or a botched date or an awkward interaction.

People's favorite subject is not themselves, unless they are really fucking egotistical and vain. People want to connect. The only way to do that is to offer up information about yourself with the invitation to talk about themselves as well.

Here's an idea, instead of asking all sorts of questions and turning every social interaction into an awkward ""interview""... Say something like, ""I don't know about you, but l just love the way that the snow lays a blanket of white over everything. It reminds me of sitting in front of a warm fire and drinking Early Grey tea with my family.""

See how I just took something so cliche and boring like the weather and turned it into something that gives insight into my personality. Not only that, I invited the person to give information about themselves as well.

People don't like to feel obligated to do something, including talking to someone. This is why girls/women often will talk to each other and say things like:

Girl 1: ""So, how was the date?""
Girl 2: ""Awkward as fuck. It was another 'interview' he just asked me a bunch of questions instead of just talking to me. I don't understand why guys do this. We got along really well before we went out, but as soon as we went on a 'date' he acts all formal like some sort of school boy asking for facts in history class.""

Here's a fact: you get to know people by having a real conversation with them. Not by getting logical and rational facts. Socializing doesn't work like homework. 

Here's what I mean. Who do you think that I know better?

Ed is 5'6. He likes metal. He is going to school for Math. He lives in New York. He went on vacation to Europe last month. Ed has a girlfriend named Sally. 

OR

Bill is a really great person. He always seems to have a solution to any problem. From social issues to unclogging your plumbing. Not just that he really cares. He takes a genuine interest in getting to know you and isn't afraid to disagree respectfully. He'll tell you what's up without making you feel like an idiot.

You don't learn that kind of emotional content from asking people questions. I'm not saying that questions are all bad. We are talking about when you are first getting to know people. 

Anyway, I hope that this helps some. I know that others will disagree and that's ok. If the least that this does is give one or two people a little insight, then that's great."

I'd like to add one thought to your post: it may be the case that Armenia under its current borders and geopolitical realities cannot sustain the same population numbers that the Armenian S.S.R. maintained. Think about it: the first Armenian state was founded in 1918, and the Dashnak government was so incompetent in geopolitics, foreign policy, and war that it maneuvered Armenia into a position where both the Soviet empire on one side and the Turkish empire on the other side invaded Armenia. The Dashnak government then signed the Treaty of Alexandropol giving up all land claims against Turkey, and then capitulated and left a broken shell of a nation for the Bolsheviks to do as they pleased. The Bolsheviks (which included many prominent Armenians) signed the Treaty of Kars and further constricted the Armenian state into its current artificial borders, landlocked and very limited in arable land and many vital resources. Armenia was mutilated from the very beginning into a patch of land which was not capable of supporting a large population. The only reason Armenia's population grew after the Soviet takeover was because the Soviets imposed a peace through strict policing, and subsidized Armenian growth through free imports via Georgia and Azerbaijan, guaranteed absolute protection of any threat from the Turkish (or even Iranian) border, and built a decent educational and healthcare system and factories to support jobs for the population. The Soviets even organized massive repatriation efforts numbering in the hundreds of thousands for Genocide survivors from the diaspora. From what I can tell, the Soviets even encouraged things like physical fitness and other quality of life factors in the population. Obviously this all required massive funding and expertise taken from other, more productive and developed areas of the U.S.S.R and redistributed as investments in Armenia as directed by the Kremlin at the time. . . This is not to say the Soviets were perfect or to cover up the repression and killings of hundreds of thousands of people during the early Bolshevik era, the war against the Armenian Church, or the giving away of Artsakh and Nakhichevan, but all things considered this was relatively the best hand Armenia had to play at the time and it is what got us a population of over 3 million and an industrial system which provided jobs to support that population. The alternative would have been to see the Turks finish off  an ""independent"" Armenia (and no, even a million fedayis would not have held off the Turks, nor would any western power have lifted a finger to intervene.)

Now that the old Soviet system has been dead for over a quarter of a century, the old inter-S.S.R. trade is gone, Armenia is languishing. I don't see Armenia becoming a manufacturing hub because in spite of cheap labor, the country is in a politically volatile environment with closed borders and technically at war with Azerbaijan which occasionally heats up. And let's not kid ourselves, if it were not for Russian boots on the ground in Armenia, Turkey would have long sent its troops into Armenian soil, just like it has done in recent decade to Cyprus, Iraq, and Syria. Greece was a member of NATO and Turkey was still allowed to rape Cyprus in 1973, and still called ""a model Muslim democracy."" Simply put, East Asia and Central America make more sense for outsourcing manufacturing than Armenia.

The I.T. sector in Armenia has incredible potential, I want to see Armenia become an technological superpower. But realistically, that one industry can only provide a limited amount of jobs. As far as I can tell, further reintegration into a Russian-led economic bloc  (the Eurasian Union) is Armenia's best chance at increasing economic opportunities and thus supporting a relatively large population like the Armenian S.S.R. did. Existing Armenian products are well known in the former Soviet market and have a better chance at competing than in Europe with its myriad of regulations and state-subsidized manufacturers. Not to mention that Armenian factories may yet find themselves producing components for Russian aircraft, vehicles, weapons, and industrial tools.

The economy is probably the key factor for growing and sustaining a large population in a landlocked and resource-poor nation like Armenia. But cases like Germany, very rich but with unsustainably (genocidally) low population growth shows that a people's mentality and spiritual health also factor in, and this is where social engineering from Yerevan and Etchmiadzin come into play.

inb4 Russophobes come out crying, Armenia will remain in the Russian sphere, and there is nothing foreigners can do to change that from their keyboards in Glendale."

post meio longo, portanto cooperem comigo. mas é interessante. 


**artistic mode: ON**

eu acho a fotografia de natal e ano novo meio depressiva. é colorida e, no meio disso, soturna. mescla isso com o fato de ""paisagem de fim de ano"" ser normalmente noturna e as pequeníssimas luzes coloridas piscam num ritmo meio torto (cada casa com seu jeito), e de forma quieta. as luzes de nossas casas parecem existir, as luzes de natal são tão incomuns que dão esse sentimento mais vazio e quieto. elas parecem mais fantasmagóricas que as luzes comuns. 

o sentimento de fim de ano também é mais aconchegante nas ruas, e, além disso, apesar de ser uma época quente, somos mais apresentados como se fosse uma época **fria**, justamente pelo cinema americano, o que contribui ainda mais para esse sentimento que se passa. 


luzes de diversas cores que piscam em ritmos alternativos (de forma não padronizada, afinal cada casa tem um estilo próprio), as quais se acendem num cenário noturno e (supostamente) frio, o qual já é por si só soturno o suficiente. aliadas a um clima fraternal e esperançoso? 


isso cria **contraste**.


ou seja, a paisagem naturalmente contrastante com o clima dá esse sentimento mais vazio, ou seja, é algo mais comum do que você imagina. 

tudo no fim de ano é contrastante. o natal é uma época feliz, amorosa, colorida, portanto mais **quente**... mas o que lhe é apresentado é uma paisagem soturna e fora de ordem num clima mais gelado, ou seja, é **fria**. isso sem falar que ela quebra totalmente a rotina e essas lembranças vão dar uma sensação **nostálgica**, um sentimento naturalmente triste e frio, o qual vai haver concordância com a parte ""quente"" (amor, fraternal, comida, luzes, etc) e a parte ""fria"" (paisagem noturna, clima soturno e frio). o que gera mais contraste.


pode parecer loucura. mas olhe bem [essa imagem](http://cdn.picturecorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/better-christmas-light-photos-4.jpg) e me diga se ela não te lhe faz sentir mais que um sentimento. gera conflito e só uma parte sobressai.

* EltaMD has a few options that are 41+ SPF, but the only 50 one they have is the sport, so probably not the best for face application.

* Supergoop has a few different SPF50s.

* Paula's Choice Resist Youth Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid is SPF 50. They also have a sport/body one that's SPF50.

* Jack Black has Sunguard Sunscreen SPF45

* CotZ and Dr. Dennis Gross are two other brands you could check out, though the latter is up there in price.

* Chantecaille has an SPF 45, but it's also super expensive. Maybe worth as a splurge someday?

Also: make sure you are applying the proper amount of 1/4tsp for your face, and another 1/4tsp for your neck. It's important to measure out since it's a lot more than most people think. I think this might make it ok for you to stick with sunscreens even in the SPF40+ range, but you could always check with your doctors.

Unpopular opinion time: depending on how these options work for you, this might have to be one of the products where you have to accept not buying vegan and/or cruelty-free. I've spent too much money myself on sunscreens that simply will not work for me for everyday use. 

I have dark skin, so all sunscreens with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide *will not* cut it, not alone or under foundation, and I end up avoiding using them daily. I also have sensitive skin that significantly narrows my choices further. I've accepted that the Japanese sunscreens that actually work for me will have to do for now, until the U.S./Europe/vegan/cruelty-free companies step up their game big time in SPF50 and PA++++ formulations. I keep my eye out for new formulas to try in the meantime. While I'm stuck with non-vegan sunscreen for now, I do what I can as usual to make sure the rest of my consumption is as kind to animals as possible.

Of course, any of the above options might be just fine for you! Fingers crossed!

/u/gent2012 gave a great explanation on why Carter was so ineffective

""After the Nixon and Ford years, Americans came to view their government as being coldly pragmatic but, more importantly, corrupt and incompetent. Moreover, in terms of international affairs, the U.S. was encountering an international system that was becoming increasingly multi-polar. In other words, global power was shifting away from the two superpowers and disaggregating among the Third World states, Asia, and an increasingly integrated Europe. This disaggregation of power was most clearly symbolized by the U.S. defeat in Vietnam and a series of oil crises instigated by OPEC (a conglomerate of oil producing states based in the Middle East, in addition to Venezuela) that made gas prices soar in the U.S.

Carter believed that he could simultaneously renew America's trust in government and reassert America's leading role within global affairs. He failed in both regards.

A lot of it had to do with his personality. He came to Washington believing that he could change the way politics was made. He hoped to make politics more transparent which would, he believed, make politics more effective and less divisive. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Carter's self-perception as a reformer and Washington outsider concomitantly carried what can best be described as a savior complex. He looked down on other politicians, believing his deep-seated morality made him the only one capable of bringing the Washington establishment into line. Thus, Carter arrived in Washington expecting Congress to fall lock-step behind his policies. Naturally, congressmen from both parties weren't to fond of the way Carter handled congressional relations. This tension between the executive and the congress was exacerbated by Carter's aides, who were primarily old friends and staffers from when Carter was governor of Georgia. Georgia politics are, of course, nothing like Washington politics, and Carter's aides were woefully inadequate for the job. Still, he kept them, much to the chagrin of even the Democratic congressional leadership. Due to bad congressional relations, Carter had difficulty passing domestic reforms on such major issues as social security and health care. If this wasn’t enough to derail his policy-making process, Carter’s hands-on approach to everything didn’t help. He was notorious for wanting to personally review and authorize even the most minimal of tasks, going so far as to personally OK each morning who would be allowed to use the White House tennis courts. Not all of the problems with Congress stemmed from Carter's and his aide's personalities though. After Watergate, politicians promised to make politics more transparent. This, unfortunately, made it more difficult for politicians to do the back-room bargaining that leads to compromise and, eventually, the passage of legislation. Moreover, Congress as an institutional structure was changing. During Carter's presidency, Congress split into many different caucuses (basically, groups of like-minded congressmen that ally to create mutually supported policies). These caucuses existed, like always, at the broadest level (Democrat and Republican), but now there were additionally a plethora of smaller caucuses like an African-American caucus, a women’s caucus, regional caucuses, etc. This explosion of caucuses allowed almost all congressmen to gain good committee assignments. Congressmen used these congressional committees, covered intensely by the media, as ways to generate publicity and gain support for re-election. Due to the greater publicity that even junior representatives now held, there was less of a need to rely on their party label when they ran for office. Instead, they could run on personal recognition. All of this ultimately meant that there was less of a need for individual congressmen to hew toward the party line, which made it even more difficult for Carter to gather congressional support for his policies.

In terms of foreign policy, one of Carter's strengths in the 1976 election was that he rejected the Nixon Administration's idea of realpolitik, which held that the international system did and should operate solely on the rational calculation of self-interest. Carter instead believed that the United States should frame its foreign policy within moralistic terms, and early in his administration he made human rights the top priority of U.S. foreign policy. In reality, this didn’t happen. Instead, he relied on traditional Cold War conceptions of world affairs centered on national self-interest. After the shah of Iran, who had brutally repressed the Iranian people for decades, was overthrown during the Iranian Revolution, Carter allowed him to come to the United States. (The Shah was suffering from cancer; Carter allowed him to come to the U.S. to receive chemotherapy). In what is probably a huge understatement, this didn’t sit well with most Iranians. Soon after, the U.S. embassy was overrun and the American staffers there were held hostage for 444 days. Every day that the hostages remained in captivity showed America’s apparent weakness on the world stage. It didn’t help with all of the news outlets reminding Americans at the end of every broadcast that “Today is day [7, 84, 300, etc.] of the Americans’ captivity in Iran.”

To free the hostages, Carter attempted a night-time raid by American special forces. A U.S. plane landed in the Iranian desert carrying stuff for the raid and soldiers. A handful of helicopters carrying more soldiers was coming to meet at the makeshift air field when one of the helicopters flew into the plane, killing many of the Americans. Needless to say, it was a big embarrassment and only seemed to further prove America’s weakness on the world stage. Iran wasn’t the only foreign policy problem Carter faced. In addition, the Soviet Union had been making great gains in the Third World, particularly in Africa. Thus, it appeared that not only was the United States becoming weaker, but the Soviet Union was becoming stronger. This fear of increasing Soviet power culminated with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

All of this was compounded by the worst economic crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression. Carter, no matter how correct he may have been, didn’t exactly instill confidence in the American people. Regarding what appeared to be unending inflation, he told the public that all he had to offer were “partial remedies.” In the face of a rate of inflation in the double-digits, he asked employees not to increase their wages by any more than 7%. It also didn’t help that in general, Carter wanted to deregulate most government agencies. Thus, when many people were calling for some sort of government intervention, Carter was cleaning out many federal agencies.

All of these problems, foreign and domestic, appeared to show an ineffective president. At one point, Carter tried to show that he was being an active leader by asking for the resignation of his entire cabinet, who dutifully complied. Instead of showing action, however, the American public believed the act only proved that Carter could not at all manage the presidency. Not all of these problems were Carter’s fault. The economy was doing poorly when he came into office and it didn’t start getting better for a couple of years into Reagan’s presidency. Nor could he change the way post-Watergate politics was conducted. But his refusal to work with others, his need to oversee even the most miniscule of matters, and his inability (or unwillingness) to carry out a foreign policy that adhered to U.S. moral sensibilities and national interests, really did make him one of the least effective presidents of the twentieth century, certainly of the post-WWII era.""

Middle Easterners love a good conspiracy theory that makes no sense at all in order not to have their world view challenged.

First off all nobody called Assad's bluff. It's clear that the attack was to send Turkey a message and remind them they are in Syrian territory. Their first reaction was their usual bellicose one about responding then later they became meek and assured Russia and Syria that they had no designs or plans on Syria's territorial integrity. Which showed that it worked.

This isn't the first time something like this happened and it won't be the last time. When Turkey launched airstrikes at YPG they got chased out of Syrian airspace.  [Their militants had no aircover and got bombed.](http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-warplanes-to-not-fly-into-syria-after-threat-by-regime-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=105489&amp;NewsCatID=352)	

&gt;**Turkey has not launched further strikes as Syria’s Russian-made air defense system was activated** to cover the region under the Euphrates Shield operation, a Turkish official told the Hürriyet Daily News on condition of anonymity. ...On Oct. 20, the Syrian military warned that **it would bring down any Turkish warplanes entering Syrian airspace**, in response to airstrikes carried out by Turkey overnight in Maarrat Umm Hawsh in northern Aleppo. ...“Any attempt to once again breach Syrian airspace by Turkish war planes will be dealt with and they will be brought down by all means available,” the Syrian army general command said in a statement. The **presence of Turkish troops on Syrian soil was a “dangerous escalation and flagrant breach of Syria’s sovereignty,”** it said. ....A suspected Syrian army helicopter dropped barrel bombs on Turkish-backed rebels on Oct. 25, killing two rebels, the Turkish military has stated. 

Turkish airstrikes didn't resume until the 1st of November when Hulusi Akar went to Moscow. Presumably to get convince Russia that they meant no harm and get the Syrians to back off.

It seems obvious that all of this is to teach Turkey to respect Syria's sovereignty, a concept Turkey has forgotten. The Russians must have known about it and its probably why it occurred on that specific day.

The level of conspiracy theories directed at Iran is becoming a parody at this point. It seems they're the new Jews of the Middle East. The obvious reality is that five years of war in Syria has done everything to make both America, Europe, China and Russia distrust and dislike Turkey. Working with groups like Al-Qaeda or Ahrar al-Sham and turning a blind eye to ISIS was never going to favours. Ambushing a Russian jet, boasting about it and then quickly calling NATO when Russia was still looking for a face saving solution for both countries isn't easily forgettable. Especially when Turkey's border is open and flowing with extremists and weapons.

""H"" was not represented by an actual sound in Latin, and it affected how it is treated as a letter in many languages, both Romance and some modern Germanic (English, e.g.).

The vernacular writing in multiple Romance languages that developed from Vulgar Latin tried to reflect pronunciation shifts. For example ""Centum"" is pronounced ""Kentum"" in Latin, but in Romance vernaculars, the ""C"" in front of ""e"" started to shift to ""s"", ""ts"", ""th"" and other sounds. To mark the difference between how the first letter is pronounced in  ""centum"" vs ""cattus"", Frankish scribes placed an ""h"" after ""c"" in ""cattus"" to get ""chattus"", hence, French ""chat"" for ""cat"".  

Bottom line is: ""h"" has a long story of being introduced into spelling of words as an ""indicator"" letter, and then being incorporated into a new sound (in case of ""cattus"" the pronounciation went ""kattus"" --&gt; ""(ch)attus"" --&gt; ""(ch)at"" --&gt; ""(sh)a"" ). But where it does not form a sound of its own, it does not need to prevent the symmetry, as the symmetry is phonological, not orthographical in this case.

(""Shalash"" is a perfect palindrom when rendered in Russian, and I, am assuming, Hebrew, which have a letter for ""sh"")."

Arguably we don't even have a unified American culture in general anymore.  'White' is a catchall for European heritage peoples mashed together with only skin color in common.  And with Congress when there is a racial majority in a country generally they will have the majority of representation in government, if not disproportionate representation due to electoral majorities in most places.  Black people make up only about 12% of the country, so it's not surprising that a black candidate never really got traction when at white people have never been less than 2/3rds of country and probably around 90% of the country for most of the time since the official founding of it.  

Though the lack of black senators is also a function of Jim Crowe laws disenfranchising black voters in states where they were populous enough to get a senator elected.  Then white majorities by the 20th century made that impossible even with the VRA.  

I would disagree that we celebrate white culture every day in media, American culture is very mixed and includes strong Black influences as well; rap/hip hop and various figures in the media are part of American popular culture and they aren't white or necessarily reflective of white culture.  Increasingly Hispanic and Asian cultures have appeared in American culture.  In some areas Hispanic media is more common than 'white' or at least english language media.  Where I live there is a large Korean community and Korean channels on broadcast TV.  And again we aren't 'celebrating' such culture, we are living it.  It is just a part of our lives.  It is a mix of identities and cultures, though strongly influenced by corporate views and what they think people want to see.  Yes, since white people are the majority in the country, the majority of figures we see in the media are also white, but not exclusively; it is hard to find an all white cast on TV these days (which is a good thing), while there are all Hispanic and Black radio stations.

I think white people wanting to emulate identity politics is much more seeing that is a powerful means of organizing and don't want to be blamed for all social ills and think that a 'pride' movement will make them feel better about being white.  Now being white isn't anything in particular, though it can be a major guilt complex given the history of this country and western cultures in general.  I think it is emulating something that will make them feel better about their racial identity, but it is clearly misplaced.  

White privilege is really the wrong way to frame the effect that it is meant to refer to, really it is minority disadvantage.  Being white doesn't really give you a special advantage in society compared to the majority, what it does give a white person is not having to deal with the shit minorities have to deal with as racial minorities in a country with a racial majority.  When people travel to China there isn't so much 'Chinese privilege' at work as much as foreigner disadvantage from being viewed as an outsider; Chinese people aren't treated extra well for being Chinese, foreigners are just treated differently and often worse for being not Chinese."

Yes, lots of interplay between southern Iberia and north Africa (where FMHS appears very early).  It's possible that homelands of early Southern Iberians are now underwater (and it's not a region where underwater archaeology is flourishing, for various reasons).

Anatomically modern HS seems to prefer a boating/fishing route, but whether you can call the close cousins of Carthage and island Greece ""Spaniards"" the instant they land in Spain is debatable.

Tagging humans as ""Spaniards"" is problematic, of course.  The thing that is Spain today (its language, kinship patterns, religion, etc) is relatively new compared to the appearance of FMHS in Europe.

&gt;* The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Wednesday that more than half a million people had been displaced in 2016, the highest number since 2008.

&gt;* This has been a sharp increase in the number of people leaving their homes due to daily battles between the Kabul government forces and Taliban militants across the war-torn country.

&gt;* Mark Bowden, the UN humanitarian coordinator has expressed concern about the increasing number of internally displaced people in the war-stricken country.

&gt;* Millions of Afghans have been dislodged and tens of thousands more fled to other regional and European countries as a result of the 2001 US-led invasion and the ensuing Taliban insurgency ever since.

&gt;* The militant group lost its grip over Afghanistan in the US-led invasion, but security has not been delivered to the country despite the presence of foreign boots on Afghan soil.

""… there exists... another class of adepts belonging to a brotherhood also and mightier than any other they have to be ranked with the adepts of the Black Arts. These are our Roman Catholic “Fathers” and clergy... A hundred times more learned in secret symbology and the old religion than our Orientalists will ever be…There are more profoundly learned Kabalists in Rome and throughout Europe and America than is generally suspected...Thus are the “Brotherhoods” of “black” adepts more powerful and dangerous…than any host of Eastern Occultists.""

&gt;It is a widely held view in Thailand that the diplomatic skills of these monarchs, combined with the modernising reforms of the Thai government, made Siam the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid European colonisation. This is reflected in the country's modern name, Prathet Thai or Thai‐land, used since 1939 (although the name was reverted to Siam during 1945–49), in which prathet means ""nation"".

I guess it's just old European colonizers translating the words first. But you'd think it would just be called Siam or Thai Kingdom."

The U.S. is also different from most other countries (though i don't think it's unique in this) because the federal government can print it's own money, and that money isn't tied to any commodity (like a gold standard). Essentially what this means is that every time the federal government spends a dollar, it's a brand new dollar. It literally spends money into existence. And these days it doesn't even need to physically print it all. 
The flip side to this is that every dollar the federal government collects in taxes is destroyed. So the federal government can never run out of money and can always pay off its debt in a moment if it ever needed to.  Though, since country debt doesn't work like private debt, it doesn't ever need to and probably should not pay it all off. 
This is not the case for the individual states in the us, and i think is analogous to Greece in the European Union. States can not print their own money and so must collect taxes or have some sort of revenue stream to fund their budget. I hope that helps a little "

I see you focus on the one guys post, but not the others which were upvoted above him. I don't need to reread my history, I can give you references for everything I've stated. For example the Viet Cong was, even by the US admission, supported by at least 80% of the population. That's what I mean when I say the Diem regime had no popular base of support. 



Back to Israel/Palestine. Well straight after 2005 there was an expansion of settlements in the West Bank, and of course the Gaza settlers were resettled there. All with tacit US support. The Baker plan and all that refers to the period 1989-1995. So let's not confuse the two. 



Finkelstein and Pappe rely on Chomsky, he's been writing about this since the 1960's and usually only uses primary sources. Usually Israeli and US sources too - you'd know this if you read any of his works. 



OK so Sadat called for a withdrawal from Egyptian lands before peace. It was still a peace plan, and it was roundly rejected by Israel. This led straight to the Yom Kippur war which was a very close call for Israel - quite a bad judgement of theirs to reject that plan then, I'd say it was a diplomatic catastrophe. They anyway agreed to withdraw and made peace with Egypt in 1980-1982. 



Note that Peres very carefully avoids saying the words ""Palestinian State"" - please find a quotation where he says that. This is ""self-rule"" for the Palestinians as they ""enjoy"" today, meaning they can organise their own garbage collection. Not a state. 



Israel offered once to cede 93% of the West Bank, as Olmert claims. However that was just an oral offer and never accepted by Israel. In fact the next day they called it off. 



Now if you look at the West Bank, and what Israel occupies, remember much of it is desert, you can see that Israel has occupied all the valuable land, especially the Jordan Valley. 



Regarding Ron Pundak: 




&gt;The more time elapses and the number of publications increases, the argument about the facts dwindles: who proposed what, when, and what the response of the other side was. Camp David became an ordinary historical topic about which it is necessary to distinguish between the versions of interested parties. Were they able to read Hebrew, Robert Malley and Agha Hussein would have been able to have made extensive use of the facts that appear in the publications of Yossi Beilin, Gilad Sher and Shlomo Ben-Ami in order to base their criticism of Ehud Barak on the statements of his representatives in the negotiations. This applies to the territorial chapter. At the conference in Tel Aviv, **Dr. Ron Pundak and Colonel (res.) Shaul Arieli (head of the peace administration in Barak's bureau), on the one hand,** and Palestinian deputy minister Samih al-Abed (from the Palestinian negotiating team), on the other, detail with the aid of documents and maps the progress of the territorial negotiations. The gaps between the figures given by the Israelis and those presented by the Palestinian representatives were minuscule.




 http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/shattering-the-myths-of-camp-david-1.96574



He clearly was an Israeli negotiator involved in Camp David. He wrote the agreement which was the basis of the Camp David negotiations.


Here's what Chomsky says about it - it's really not a major point whether Ron Pundak was literally at Camp David or not, the substance of what he says is a major point. Even if he wasn't at Camp David it wouldn't change anything in Chomsky's, or my argument.


&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David, by the way.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: Pardon?

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background, and he was from…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: …He was from Oslo, and his study…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He’s from Oslo. He was never. He was not even close to Camp David, just for the record.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: His study, he was one of the advisors, as you know…

&gt;ALAN DERSHOWITZ: Chomsky says so, it must be true.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: Read it–you’re the one who told me you agree with him. If you think not, tell the Shimon Peres center to fire his director. Those are the basic Israeli documents. Furthermore, they’re supported by plenty of others. If you want to know more about Taba, you can read the European Union report, accepted by both sides, which says exactly what I said. As to your question, yes, I already told you the answer. There is a very good solution on the table. It’s the solution that they came close to in Taba before Israel canceled it, and that was then carried forward by high level Israeli and Palestinian negotiators informally, leading to the Geneva…that’s what I’m telling you.

You said, quote, ""Who are you to put a time limit on the effects of slavery?"". In order for your argument to be consistent, It must be the case that modern Europeans should be reimbursed for the slavery of ancestral Europeans by North African nations in the same way you are arguing that modern black people should be reimbursed for the slavery of ancestral black people. Do you agree?

&gt; You cite nothing to support this claim, and I honestly don't think it's true.

You don't believe me that Japanese, Chinese, Italians, and Irish are, on average, better off than the average black American?

&gt; That article is 8 years old. The current numbers are lower.

According to ""Jewish Virtual Library"" it's 10% of senators and 4.5% of congressmen. So actually even higher than I thought in the senate!

&gt; If the less religious/observant Jews are the ones getting into Congress, how is that a cultural advantage? 

If the less white-identifying whites are the ones getting into Congress, how is that a racial advantage?

&gt; All these disadvantages you're identifying as being rooted in black 'culture' are actually rooted in slavery and its aftershocks

Why do you believe this? Again, the only thing that people have to claim as ""evidence"" for this is the fact that black people are worse off than other ethnic groups in the US; they have zero evidence that it's due to any particular cause, and things like modern cultural challenges and poverty seem vastly more likely than ""aftershocks"" of a class system that died 150 years ago.

&gt; If they're only statistically correlated, you can't reasonably claim they're anything but a coincidence.

To be blunt, this betrays a very serious misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Here's a good article on the matter https://blog.richmond.edu/physicsbunn/2014/02/21/correlation-is-correlated-with-causation/

What a correlation implies (not in the boolean logical sense, but in the bayesian sense) is one of three things: if A correlates with B, then the posterior probability of A being an ancestor in the causal network of B, B being an ancestor in the causal network of A, or both A and B sharing a mutual causal ancestor is increased. 

Correlations are emphatically *not* the same thing as coincidences. Correlations actually give you a ton of predictive power, regardless of the direction of causality that caused the correlation in the first place. For example, let's pretend that we aren't aware that rain causes an area to be wet. However, we see that there is a strong correlation between rain and an area being wet. Despite the fact that we don't know which way this causal relationship works, if we learn that an area is wet, our posterior probability of it raining in that area increases drastically. Note that we're working *backwards* in the causal network; we're starting at the effect and making inferences about the cause. We could go the other way too; if we know it's raining in an area, this increases the posterior probability that the area is wet. Correlations let us make predictions even if we don't know the underlying causal relationship.

&gt; If your theory is that the correlation between black men and prison is caused by black culture, then that's bigoted

Regardless of how you label the theory, can you rule it out? A priori, this theory is pretty likely; there are many cultural factors that could have a strong influence on criminal tendencies. The likeliness of a theory has precisely nothing to do with how (a)moral one thinks it is.

&gt; All of the causes you just listed can be and have been debunked. 

&gt; White people live in cities, often blocks from black neighborhoods

You're right, that's a strong argument for the  ""black culture"" explanation.

&gt; poverty affects people of all colors, not just black people;

While poverty and crime are correlated for all races, you are correct that the correlation is stronger in black communities, which further supports the ""black culture"" theory.

&gt; and to claim that there's something inherent in black culture that would promote crime is probably not a claim you're qualified to make or speculate on, 

That's not actually an argument against the hypothesis, just an indictment of my credentials. You've already helped to partially rule out the other explanations, so what else is left?

&gt; since you probably know little if anything about black culture

I spent 8 years in poor neighborhoods in Chicago; I know a great deal about black culture.

&gt; Also, what about their culture would be SO DIFFERENT from western European cultures or Asian cultures

Not really. She was very specific what will happen and as history shows, exactly as she said it has happened. Down to a single person.

If I hadn't been in medical school I wouldn't have known otherwise to mention that I wished to take all measures possible to preserve my fertility as much as possible during treatment. (I ended up freezing my eggs before receiving total body irradiation for my bone marrow transplant last year - I'm sorry your doctors didn't mention this as a possibility earlier to you.)

However it looks like it might not be too bad possibly given the other posters who've commented and said their periods returned after a year or so? So don't lose hope!! :) Stay positive. There's not much you can do now given the fact that you've already started radiation treatments, but try to not focus on the negatives for too long and make it a long-term goal to focus on the positives, getting better and treating your body kindly now.

It's really hard for your mom to not freak out and think worse case scenarios; my mom's been helicoptering me ever since I got diagnosed too. I try to not talk about my negative thoughts with my mom but use r/cancer and some of my more objective medical school friends and other best friends with health care backgrounds to talk about my feelings and frustrations more frankly. Our moms tend to take our pain and make it their own too, so it's really difficult for me to burden her with more of my frustrations/emotions.

It's still a really fresh diagnosis for you, so I totally empathize with you - It's COMPLETELY okay and acceptable to be upset, angry and overthink all the negatives in your life right now. I was diagnosed October 6 last year in 2015 and I would always break down into tears or frustrated moods or get really upset for the first 4-5 months on frequent occasions if I started thinking negatively. It was around November last year when I remember going on a total crying breakdown and had to call my best friend on the phone in the middle of the night at 3-4am to get my shit together because I couldn't stop thinking about how I took everything and everyone for granted my whole life before getting diagnosed and it spiraled into a giant mess of me hysterically sobbing for an entire night. I remember also crying and grieving over the loss of my fertility over several separate occasions and I hated how unfair it was for me to have to go through IVF/fertility treatments to preserve and freeze my eggs for the future in case I ever want kids of my own.

Everything just felt so unfair and I didn't ask to lose all these things in order to save my life. It's *okay* to grieve and vent and talk about your feelings right now, even if they're angry or negative. It feels excruciatingly painful at first to cry and grieve and talk about it (like equally or more emotionally painful than my first real heart break but also obviously different and worse), but it will get easier and better as time goes on.

Once the time passes and life with cancer becomes more routine for you, it will get easier to think less negatively, especially once things start seeming so scary/uncertain and to focus thinking more positively.

Your doctor just wants you to choose a good time to do the Make a Wish trip so that you can also enjoy your trip and safely do it - radiation can be really exhausting long-term, so the more treatments you undergo, the more likely you'll feel super fatigued all the time that you might not even want to really travel if you're constantly exhausted all the time. And yes, ideally when you're not doing active treatment is the best time to do it because they don't want any medical complications occurring during treatment to happen and risking you not having access to immediate health care/your oncologists.

Make a wish sounds great though! Go somewhere warm this winter like Hawaii or a beach resort location if you live in a cold winter area. Or maybe travel Europe if you like colder vacations and sight seeing. There's lots of indoor museums to explore throughout Europe so you won't be outside all the time anyway.

Side effects wise, I remember getting really frustrated with my inability to recall words or pay attention in my conversations, a super common side effect of chemo-brain and I would like flip out on occasion about it lol. I would also sleep a ton cause I was so tired all the time (12+ hours a day.)

China’s Secretive Space Program Threatens NASA’s Dominance

By Bloomberg News November 28, 2016

The launch of the Shenzhou 11 spacecraft in western China last month marked another great leap forward for the nation’s space program and its ambition to send manned missions to the moon and, eventually, Mars. Yet more than national prestige is at stake: China is counting on its space program to pay huge economic dividends

China is NASA’s biggest rival in space exploration with plans to land “taikonauts” on the moon by 2036 and Mars thereafter. Along the way, President Xi Jinping hopes the space missions will spawn a wave of Chinese innovation in robotics, aviation and artificial intelligence, among other leading 21st-century technologies.

China’s space program is generally shrouded in secrecy, yet Xi’s government is now reviewing a proposal by top researchers to triple investments into scientific missions, according to Wu Ji, director-general of the National Space Science Center. The hope is that advancements made while building new telescopes, monitoring Earth’s water cycles and improving satellite navigation will revive state-owned enterprises and inspire the startup of private ones.

“China has been relying on the knowledge discovered by others,” said Wu, who’s spearheading the effort to lobby for more space missions with possible economic spinoffs. “If China wants to rejuvenate the economy, it needs to put more resources into developing groundbreaking technologies.”

China’s ongoing five-year plan strives to “make original achievements” in fundamental sciences and “lead the development of cutting-edge space technology.” A central economic strategy calls for 70 percent of key technology components—such as semiconductors and software—to be produced domestically by 2025.

To get there, Wu and dozens of researchers asked the central government to boost investment into space science from the 4.7 billion yuan ($695 million) spent in 2011-2015 to at least 15.6 billion yuan in 2026-2030.

That would trail NASA’s space science budget of about $5.6 billion, but a decade ago China spent zero on that effort, Wu said. The government instead poured money into projects with political significance or immediate practicality: rockets, military satellites and vessels for manned flights.

It also developed weapons: In 2007, the nation tested an anti-satellite missile by blowing up a Chinese craft. Now, China is spending big on scientific endeavors, launching the world’s first quantum-communications satellite and a telescope to search for dark matter in the past year alone.

“Scientific space research is expensive and sees very little practical benefits in the short term,” Wu said.

The precise extent of China’s space spending isn’t known, but what’s clear is that some U.S.-based analysts are concerned that China is hitting the accelerator as NASA hits the brakes. NASA ended the space shuttle, abandoned plans to return to the moon and is only committed to the International Space Station until 2024.

China’s stated goals to build its own station, land on the dark side of the moon and put a rover on Mars—all by 2022—prompted U.S. congressmen to ask: “Are We Losing the Space Race to China?” The nation started manned missions in 2003 and launched two more taikonauts in Shenzhou 11.

“China’s more deliberate and comprehensive approach will open up opportunities for Beijing to derive important economic, political and diplomatic benefits from its space program,” Dennis Shea, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told the committee Sept. 27.

Even though NASA already landed on the moon, giving China the chance to accomplish that while the U.S. focuses on manned flight to Mars in the 2030s may backfire, said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

“China uses space to gain political advantage,” Lewis said. “While there are clearly activities related to science and research, the primary purpose for China is to demonstrate power.”

The initiatives come as China’s economy moderates after decades of supercharged growth. Gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent during the first three quarters—heading for its slowest pace since 1990—and exports fell for a seventh month.

The return on assets for state-owned enterprises was an estimated 2.8 percent last year, compared with almost 11 percent for private-sector companies, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

Xi pledged to move China away from the cheap labor-and-debt fueled export model. To generate momentum, local governments are deploying 3 trillion yuan to invest in biotechnology, internet and high-end manufacturing companies that can replace stumbling heavy industries.

China has 38 startups worth at least $1 billion, according to CBInsights’ “Unicorn List.” They include UBTECH Robotics Corp., genome researcher iCarbonX, online educator iTutorGroup and app developer Apus Group.

Xi wants that list to be longer. He told Communist Party underlings last month that internet and information-technology businesses should drive China’s economic growth, and he called for breakthroughs in high-performance computing, semiconductors, quantum communications and software operating systems.

“China has leapfrogged other countries in terms of technology development over the past 15 years,” said Vincent Chan, a Hong Kong-based managing director of Credit Suisse. “The potentially disruptive implications of China’s innovative drive should not be underestimated.”

Some entrepreneurs are inspired by Musk, even if they can’t have the same autonomy because the military controls space flight. Hong Kong-listed KuangChi Science Ltd. is developing an exoskeleton that increases strength, a jet pack so people can “fly like Iron Man” and a capsule to take tourists into space via a giant balloon.

“Commercial activity, invention, research and investment will be very hot in this area in the next five to 10 years,” founder Liu Ruopeng said.

Wu, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wants to inspire those efforts. The academy has championed space projects since the 1950s, when Mao Zedong decided to make China the third nation with a satellite in orbit.

In those early days, scientists did drawings on a cement floor and relied on candlelight to design prototypes for satellites and rockets.

Since 1970, China has launched more than 100 satellites for weather and disaster monitoring, communications and navigation. The first, Dongfanghong 1, broadcast into the cosmos an anthem written for Mao that called him the “Sun of the East.”

As China moves farther into the stars, it’s doing more to study them.

In September, it turned on the world’s largest radio telescope in Guizhou after 22 years of planning. The 500-meter-wide dish searches for radio waves emanating from far reaches of the galaxy—helping scientists learn more about cosmic phenomena and even listen for aliens.

Xi said the telescope, dubbed “China’s eye of heaven,” will fuel economic growth since the nation holds its intellectual-property rights, state-run Xinhua News Agency said.

“The development of space science is important for China,” said Jean-Jacques Dordain, former director general of the European Space Agency. “Space is not only for governments and space fans anymore. It’s fully integrated in the economy.”

In 2020, China will launch a satellite to study the Earth’s water cycle by measuring soil moisture, ocean salinity and ocean surface evaporation. It’s one link in the Water Cycle Observation Mission, an effort with the U.S. and Europe to help forecast floods and droughts, and maintain food security, the academy said.

The nation also is developing the homegrown Beidou navigation network as an alternative to the U.S.-run Global Positioning System. China wants a constellation of 35 Beidou satellites covering the world by 2020, according to the nonprofit Colorado-based Space Foundation.

Beidou provides improved security against interference and interception for military users, and guides about 40,000 fishing boats in the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and the vortex of international territorial disputes.

More than 30 countries use the Beidou system, according to the government.

“We are at the beginning,” Wu said. “But this is a great cause, and nothing should stop China from becoming a power in the space industry.”

They socialized health care, nationalized most of the economy by putting virtually every German to work in infrastructure projects, they took away everyone's guns, instituted nationalized pensions and they blamed all their problems on the ~~Jews~~ wealthy elite.  At least compared to modern American politics that seems very standard left wing to me.  They did support some meritocracy over egalitarianism when it comes to paying workers, but that seems center-right at best.

The right wing policies were basically to destroy the unions.  My first-hand experience in politics begins around Bush Sr.  If Bill Clinton and Obama are the measurement of the left, then destroying unions seems pretty centrist, maybe center-right?  

Is it just that they're considered far right by international standards?  I know that Europeans tend to consider the American left to be pretty far right even, so to people from other countries nationalizing healthcare wouldn't seem left-wing, it would seem centrist."

https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism

&gt;Definitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code 
18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines ""international terrorism"" and ""domestic terrorism"" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the U.S. Code, entitled ""Terrorism.”

&gt;""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:

&gt;Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended    
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;    
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or     
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*      

This is important because it defines who a particular set of enemies of the state are.

First the Email in Question and what Assange actually said about it: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/7243 (Note it was Published on 10/13/16)

&gt;At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, **we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.**

Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the [US State Department approved $115 Billion Dollars worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ)

[Cornell University sites the US Constitution defining Treason](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii)

&gt;ARTICLE III, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 1 

You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line. Chances are that if you disagree about Clinton or Kerry or Obama's culpability in this matter, you would have said Reagan and Oliver North were Traitors if you were asked 5 years ago. For more context, keep reading.

CNN reported that [ISIS was armed with American Weapons](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/amnesty-international-isis-weapons-u-s-/index.html) in December, 2015; and if you read the actual [Amnesty.org](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/) report it says (Pg. 20, 21):

&gt; It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.

A few months prior [The Guardian reported:](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq)

In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

Maybe you would like [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/hillary-clinton-acknowledges-saudi-terror-financing-in-hacked-email-hinting-at-tougher-approach/) to clarify a few things:

&gt; Clinton openly criticized the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments for failing “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” Her newly released 2014 email goes a step further, directly attributing support for ISIS to the Saudi government.

Would you elaborate? Because I do not know what you saying here. Not sure. I use Sephardic as people from the Iberian peninsula who were exiled and settled in different places all over. North Africa, the Balkans and so on.
Also, as written above. 
As written above... What I mean about the intellectualism. Well, it has to do with the white-collar job connection. Some people say that since Ashkenazi are more likely to be white-collar, then there is a higher degree of intellectually among them. Also, don't forget that when some people (even Jews) want to show how successful Jews are, they overemphasize the IQ test and Nobel Prizes. And Ashkenazi rule here. I mean, listen, being blue-collar does not mean you are less intelligent but...in the US, I see Ashkenazi as being the ambitious and go-getters. I think it takes a lot to become an engineer, a doctor and Ashkenazim overrepresent here. Also, maybe because it is a recent event in history but I admire the way the Ashkenazi communities kept going even after the Shoah. There is something unique about going through so much hardship to then becoming one of the most successful communities in the US. And here, Ashkenazi are the example.

&gt;Generally speaking, no. The Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic, Eastern, Italian, Yemenite, and Ethiopian) worlds have a rather large cultural and historical divide. Has there been Ashkenazification of non-Ashkenazi Jews? Yes, and there are plenty who bemoan this fact and that there's now such a thing as ""Haredi Sephardi.""

What do you think of this piece?
http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm

&gt;The Spanish-Portuguese community is Western European in nature, comprised of the descendants of Jews who fled from Spain to Italy, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and eventually the Americas. While having much in common with the Sephardim of North Africa and the Judeo-Spanish communities of the Balkans, they also are distinct from them in the way that Yekkes are distinct from other non-Hassidic Ashkednazim.

That's what I thought. Thanks.

&gt;Slavery took them from Africa, where many of them would have been slaves anyway, to the USA, where living conditions were better. While some slavemasters were cruel, the slaves were also provided for.

Uh, bullshit. The slave trade was self-perpetuating. That means that, while the initial slaves sold to Europeans may have already been slaves, once coastal African rulers learned that they could get modern weapons and other manufactured goods in exchange for prisoners of war . . . they started going to war more often. For God's sake, so many slaves were taken out of West Africa that at one point the region was depopulated and they had to look elsewhere. Not even touching his living conditions bullshit. A dirt-floored shack, clothes that white men wouldn't wear, and working from dark-til-dark under threat of physical abuse sure screams good living conditions!

I got some books for him. Sadly, they aren't the ramblings of a privileged New England clergyman, so I doubt he's going to be interested.

Just on the off-chance:

Foner, Eric. Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877.

Ibid. The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.

Genovese, Eugene. Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made.

Berlin, Ira. Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America.

&gt;Not to mention that under the sharecropper system that immediately followed, blacks lived under largely the same condition...

Holy Jesus. Sharecropping and Jim Crow came about because A) the victorious Union didn't have the testicular fortitude to seize land from defeated rebels to endow the slaves, and B) the white South fought reconstruction tooth and nail for ten years until the north basically said ""fuck it, you guys do what you want, we're tired of this shit."" It's a shameful display of weakness, but holy shit, it's like saying that the Allies caused the Holocaust by preventing Imperial Germany from taking over Europe.

&gt;I would much have preferred that slavery continued in the USA for, say, 50 years and then it was ended properly (i.e. with payment to the masters and the slaves being returned to Africa).

Lovely! Colonization bullshit and compensated emancipation bullshit in one sentence; it's a regular shit sandwich. Colonization plans were perceived by black people at the time as incredibly offensive. They were Americans, not Africans; they had lived here for generations; why would they want to go back to a continent that was as unfamiliar to them as Europe was to the average white farmer? And anyway, the slightest hint of compensated emancipation was anathema to the white South. If in 1860 the national mood was ""slavery forever,"" what would lead anyone to believe that would have magically changed 50 years later?

The user is literally blaming the abolition of slavery for the . . . existence of white supremacy? Abolishing slavery didn't magically wipe away 200 years of racist ideology, therefore abolition forced southern whites to act like crazy dickbags? "

I work in technologies as an IT and I'm agnostic to the brands/marketing so I always buy things based on their performances and based on my needs.

I passed 4-5 full days to browse all available options for a phone under $200 Canadian (I'm Canadian) I browsed every devices available from all brands including Chinese one's.

Compared many many phones side by side to find the best one that will suit my need for at least 3-4 years.Looked over 35 videos to compare the image and fluidity of the shoot.

My first criteria was to have a very good camera with OIS and that can take very good picture.

Second: was to be able to heavily tweak the firmware/OS to be able to customize it and support for Android 6.1 with Future support for Nougat (since few days partial beta ROM for Nouga are available but don't support video at this time).

Third having a very good support in the forums to be able to resolve myself easily issues.

Fourth: Being sturdy and being able to find easily cheap parts on the internet if need arise.

Fifth: Having most of the gadgets that the new phone have IF possible like, Audio jack (More and more phone drop the audio jack those days not only Apple), finger print sensor, RF and QI wireless charger, and many sensors the more the best ;-)


So at the end to have ALL those feature and especially good picture/video quality there was only the LG G3 on the table, the only other that was close in term of feature was the Xiaomi Mi 5 that is not even really out.   

So my choice is the LG G3 and since like you I'm in Canada I chosen the model D851 cause it is compatible with ALL Canadian and US carrier and most from Europe.

Right now I found it on the InterWebZ @  $168.00 including taxes refurbished.

I should order it tomorrow unless something drastic make me change my mind but after 5 days of learning about the smartphone available sub $200 CDN I'm pretty sure I will do a good choice, all the weakness of the LG G/ are know and the CPU is god enough for 3-5 years unless you are an heavy gamer that play latest 3-D smartphone games.

On your side have you found some great prices ?

Many European/Asian countries switched/did not have the ""gold-backed"" currency, which meant their money was a representation of some other precious metal/material. For example, salt may have been a basis for paper bills, as in early times, salt was seen as a precious trade for its uses and 'rarity'. However, salt is nearly worthless today, in that sense. Since the price of gold is pretty constant, it's a good source to back money.

Also, many European countries have a single unit of currency. Therefore, the 50,000 would be like saying ""50,000 cents"" in the US."

Porém adiciono adiciono: Quem parou no primeiro/segundo episódio saiu com um gosto ruim na boca. Os rejeitados dos primeiros episódios são realmente bem ruins, até concordo com quem criticou. Porém, diria eu, vale a pena ficar pelo resto.

Como algumas pessoas já disseram, o romance do Fernando e da Michele é bem forçado, mas a atuação do Michel Gomes foi ótima, na minha opinião. Especialmente notável na entrevista do primeiro episódio. Admitamos, isso é *bastante* vindo de um ex-membro de Rebelde.

(**SPOILERS COMEÇAM**) 

Os problemas principais foram, sem dúvida, o diálogo e a direção. Apontaria o dedo pro diretor por algumas coisas, mas uma que ficou bem marcada de *tão ruim* foi a cena do participante rejeitado cometendo suicídio. **Nenhum dos outros participantes fez um pio**. Poderia ter sido uma cena indescritivelmente poderosa, porém perdida, por má condução dos atores. Esse foi o primeiro exemplo, e o mais marcante da má direção. 

Agora, palmas pro cinematógrafo. Algumas cenas daquele show foram realmente impressionantes, especialmente para os nossos parâmetros já estabelecidos nas produções brasileiras; Nada aos pés de Black Mirror, por exemplo, mas, pegue as cenas do Ezequiel ""se afogando"" na pia, e até mesmo a última, dele banhado pelo vinho, mimicando sangue. Ambas foram maravilhosamente bem feitas. Poéticas, até, de muitas maneiras, e comparáveis à séries americanas (super consigo ver ambas sendo uma cena tirada de Hannibal, falo mesmo).

(**SPOILERS ACABAM**)
 
O meu ponto, para adicionar ao de /u/iderval, é que, mantenham em mente: Esse aqui é o primeiro degrau. Uma das primeiras séries de alta produção televisionada brasileira, e a primeira série brasileira da Netflix! Eu nem me considero tão patriota assim, mas isso pode abrir oportunidade pra muita gente: Para shows melhores, inclusive!

Considere: Nós pegamos diretores/atores/produtores/escritores e vários outros profissionais que sempre se mantiveram no equivalente nacional cinematográfico de matemática básica -- e nós os jogamos para fazer Cálculo 3. Eles não foram tão mal. Podia ser melhor? Lógico. Tinha algumas buracos? Claro que tinha, *tudo* tem. Mas é um **ótimo** primeiro passo, na minha opinião.

E é isso aí mesmo. Só queria dizer: Dê uma olhada, assista os três/quatro primeiros episódios, se o conceito for algo que você possa curtir. Vá de mente aberta, e aprecie o que há pra apreciar. Julgue também, não faz mal, mas dê essa chance, porque são séries como essa que podem, e muito provavelmente irão, ditar o futuro da televisão brasileira. Vale a pena, vai por mim."

The fact that legislation was needed shows that the EU is forcing themselves into a legacy standard that will be a boat anchor for the future. Standards historically don't need legislation, they're agreed upon jointly by companies which is how practically all popular standards are.

&gt; If Tesla wanted to push for their own standard, they should have done that when they had the chance, but they have shown absolutely no interest in doing so.

Their modified Mennekes Type 2 can't handle anywhere near the power output that CCS is capable of and their proprietary America plug doesn't even support 3 phase.

The fact that cars are forced to accept 3-phase shows that we're in the early phrase of electric cars. Long term AC for car charging is dead and non-existant.

&gt; * With the exception of some pro-Turkish rebels, such as the Syrian Turkmen Brigades, who openly welcome Ankaras intervention, no rebel factions in Syria are especially elated by Turkeys entry in the war.

&gt; * Currently we have the Syrian government, various Sunni rebel forces, the Islamic State, Russia, the United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Kurds, and several European powers involved in the war.

&gt; * Moreover, Ankaras overall role in the Syrian conflict has been inconsistent, as the country has at times sharply distanced itself from both Russian-led and American-led efforts in the region.

So maybe the EU/NATO (**OBAMA**) **got** Turkey to declare war on Syria in exchange for Erdogan's deal (open borders and cash) IF Erdogan declared war.

...""my grandma told"" on my experience are not much reliable sources. When revolution strikes once privileged class become outcasts. Of course everything were better back to the ""good old days"" (same happened with post revolution migrants from Russia, they missed the culture of peasants serving aristocrats and nobility).

&gt; Castro was a big part of that culture of fear, and so many are happy he is gone.

And who created such a culture? It sounds like before Castro Cuba was really a paradise. While actually before Castro another one brutal regime existed.

&gt; Fulgencio Batista Zaldívar (Spanish: [fulˈxensjo βaˈtista i salˈdiβar]; January 16, 1901 – August 6, 1973) was the elected President of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, and dictator from 1952 to 1959, before being overthrown during the Cuban Revolution. Fulgencio Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants that overthrew the authoritarian rule of Gerardo Machado. He then appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, and effectively controlled the five-member Presidency. He maintained this control through a string of puppet presidents until 1940, when he was himself elected President of Cuba on a populist platform.[1][2] He then instated the 1940 Constitution of Cuba, considered progressive for its time,[3] and served until 1944. After finishing his term he lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election.

&gt; Back in power, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. **He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.[4] Batista's increasingly corrupt and repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies which were awarded lucrative contracts.**

&gt; To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions; ultimately killing anywhere from hundreds to 20,000 people.[6][7][8] For several years until 1959, the Batista government received financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government.

A cynic would say that Liberals think they are mostly the same, and progressives think they are very different.

According to wikipedia, the definition of **neo**liberal has changed a bit, and contrasts with social liberalism which could include socalism and could include progressivism. Neoliberalism was:

&gt; originally an economic philosophy that emerged among European liberal scholars in the 1930s in an attempt to trace a so-called 'Third' or 'Middle Way' between the conflicting philosophies of classical liberalism and socialist planning.19]:14–5

If you ask [someone famous(ish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52Oz-54VYw) from the 60s and 70s, a liberal is ""10 degrees to the left in good times, 10 degrees to the right of center if it affects them personally"". Now, the concept of left/right politics is a gross oversimplification, and the idea of progressive vs liberal colloquially is rather bound to that oversimplification. A liberal is someone who is right of progressive and left of conservative, and generally thought of as a bit left of center. 

\-\-\-

However, I think the way the terms currently get used is a bit of a word game. There is a group of people who think change is useful, and probably good, but isn't worth sacrificing the current way of doing things over. Chief among these are incrementalists, but this includes anyone who would look at our current way of doing things and say ""the perfect is the enemy of the good"" -- there are people that the system kills and makes suffer, but that is the case with all systems. 

There is another group of people who think that change is necessary, and that the current system has so much systemic injustice and/or other problems that it needs to go to the ER. Chief among these are revolutionists (-aries? no, they aren't armed, that's the political right), but this includes anyone who would look at the current way of doing things and say ""We have to put an end to this kind of suffering"" -- people's lives are at stake, and lots of people are suffering and if change hurts some people that is unfortunate, but there are people who *need* this. 

In democratic political systems, the (larger) first group tends to want to be identified with the second group, because they want the support for their bits of change. The second group, however, doesn't at all want to be identified with the first group, because the first group refuses to help make the ""necessary"" changes and rescue people, and when pressured (which is always) the first group tends to bargain away the change they promised the second group. This doesn't always happen this way, but it seems to tend this way. Actual revolutions tend to go the opposite way, with the second group courting the first group in order to bolster its numbers in order to finally win, with the first group being unhappy with the ""unnecessary"" instability and damage. This doesn't always happen this way, but it seems to tend this way. 

Hence the word games. The word ""liberal"" used to be what ""progressive"" seems to be now, and I think ""progressive"" is now starting being adopted by the political system to mean what ""liberal"" means today (especially with the ""most progressive"" X, Y and Z). But the two groups of people are incompatible, as only one can have practical power -- even if their ideas can sometimes overlap."

I'll have to play more to say it really is gone. I only saw it for a little bit right after switching RGB from full to automatic. So maybe it is tied to that. 

Situation now:

Both the TV and the console directly plugged into the wall.
Only the PS4 has an Ethernet connection. The TV had one, but I disconnected  that.
Booted the PS4 into safe mode and forced 1.4 DHCP mode.
Console connects through the PSVR box.
PS4 output is set to automatic resolution (which in this set-up will be YUV420).
Switched HDR and Deep Colour Output off.
RGB is set to automatic.
Switched off HDMI UHD colour on the TV.
Using Game Mode on the TV.
Not using HDMI 1 anymore, since all the HDR stuff is turned off anyway.

I'm not holding my breath for it being completely gone. If it, is I regret that I can't use HDR with this configuration. 

Sony responded with the advice to force 1.4 DHCP, but that alone did nothing. I have yet to get back to them. Samsung will be doing a remote support session in a few days, which I have no expectations of, but maybe they have some wizards there. I feel I already did all of their work. The retailer said I could have the TV picked up for repair. But I'm not confident they will be able te reproduce the issue with their tests since it only happens with a PS4 Pro specifically. If they do not find any problems they would probably do nothing, send it back after a while and charge me about 50 EU of ""research costs"".

All in all: ugh.

US &gt; Balkans/Central Europe?,,t3_5fv1c8,t5_2r5hw,dancci8,0,nomadpso,8,,0,1483384872,t3_5fv1c8,1480578592,1480578308,IWantOut,False,"Wow hi. I'm pretty much in your same boat (nervous US lesbian, finishing English MA, looking at all of these same options). I'll try to summarize my own research and also hopefully give you some extra ideas based on my own career.

If you can handle the climate, Taiwan wouldn't be a bad choice for ESL. It's probably the most progressive and LGBT-friendly Asian country, where ESL pay is better.

That said, you may be best off finding remote work (1 in 5 marketing agencies are now fully remote!) and then moving abroad on a freelancer or sole representative (I think that's the term) visa. The countries I'm looking at for this are Germany, Romania, Austria, Czech Republic, etc. Here's a [cool link](https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-42474.html) to get you started. It's true writing isn't as lucrative as programming, but a $30,000 salary will go WAY further in many Central/Eastern European or Asian countries than in the US!

Also, you can absolutely find stable work as a writer. You just have to know what to search for. ""Copywriting"" is the big one, along with ""technical writing."" It's not uncommon for copy/technical writer jobs to be stable, full-time positions with benefits. And if you can edit, even better! The more marketing/communications type BS you can do, the better chance you have at getting that kind of job. 

Being a native English speaker will take you far in this field in many places, but they'll probably expect you to also be at least proficient in the official national language. If you have some experience with a language (or not), I'd really hone in on it this last year or two of college. Take language classes for your remaining electives if you can! If not, check resources out of your school/local library and go hard at Duolingo (it gives you a certificate upon completion). If you have no language experience at all, I would highly recommend Dutch! It's extremely similar to English, to the point where you'll have decent reading comprehension within your first semester. (but Dutch is my 8th language, so I'm a little biased). Obviously it will help you find work in the Netherlands (one of the most progressive countries in the world), but many jobs in Belgium and Luxembourg are looking for people with qualifications like, ""Fluent in at least 2 of the following: English, Dutch, German, French."" Landing a job that's actually IN another country is probably the best/""easiest"" way to emigrate, especially if you're blue card eligible.

Also while you're still in school, my advice would be to put together a nice looking e-portfolio of your writing. If you can get on the student paper or even submit a few pieces to that or a campus magazine, that's great. Also consider an internship or student worker job in your school's marketing and communications office. I had an assistantship in my grad school's M+C office, and it was the single biggest boost to my career. They SHOULD (hopefully) help you do all the lucrative stuff: writing press releases, editing in different styles, covering events, using professional social media, maybe even interviewing clients.

Also consider going to another country with cheap or free tuition and getting a master's degree. If you don't plan to get a PhD, I'm not 100% sure I would advise you to get your master's in English. It's not the worst move in the world if you really know you want to get into this field, but you're probably better off honing in on what you want to do and having your master's reflect that. If you adore TEFL and want to supervise teachers or even run your own school, consider an MAT or an MA in TESOL. If you get an entry level mar/comm job and realize you love marketing, consider an MA related to that.

Don't forget the working holiday visa. You'll be eligible in Ireland for maybe up to a year after you graduate, and you can go other places, like Australia, New Zealand, South Korea... I'm not 100% sure on this, but you MAY be able to snag an office type marketing job on this kind of visa since you'll be eligible to work in that country. Then, assuming they like you and want to keep you on, they can apply to sponsor you or whatnot. Again, do your own research before assuming I know what I'm talking about! But it feels like you could do that, and then even if they let you go, you'll have several months of experience to take with you.

Sorry, this is super long. If you have additional questions, please feel free to ask. Hope it helps!"

Except you can't stop it. It's evolution. You adapt or you die trying to fight it. Conservatism won't win in the end. You only end up like a backwater country where everybody suffers. Brain drain will force those who can leave, to leave. The ones left will all be poor, old and sick. What kind of society is that?

The progressive countries leap forward - at the cost of the poor, yes but then they implement systems to pay fair, living wages to poor people so they don't get left behind.

The EU set up an environment in which we all must live - because the threat from the US and in particular China, India and other emerging economies is very, very real. In the modern, globalised world you need to stand shoulder to shoulder in a trading bloc in order to survive as a developed country who barely manufactures anything of mass market appeal. The EU merely set up the environment in which we all must live. It's the fault of our government for not handing out the gasmasks and now we're all asphyxiating. The problem lies solely at the doors of Westminster for not educating young, poor people to be better than simple service or manufacturing industries. Th entire point behind government is to help those who cannot help themselves. We lost that vision somewhere along the way after WWII when profit became far more attractive than helping people.

The EU is many things both bad and good. But at it's core are tenets that allow it's sovereign constituents to compete on a global scale. Alone, we are hideously out-manned, outgunned and out-resourced. "

Indian fixed broadband subscribers are only 18 million or so. The infrastructure of innovation is simply not there for now, so I don't think you can blame the Indian mind. Jugaad exists for a reason, you know ;)

I also think it is impressive just how exceptionally well Indian society has been able to bear the brunt of the demonetisation burden without any major riots. This in a country of 1.3 billion people. Could this happen in richer Arab states like Morocco or Algeria or Egypt? To say nothing of places like Iraq. 

Demonetisation has been a test of the soul of a nation. When push came to shove, Indians showed a remarkable ability to bear and confront adversity without falling prey to sectarian lines and turning on each other. 

It was the same when India got independence. Smug Westerners kept predicting India would fall apart, but it has stood the test of time. Now we're seeing the EU splinter.

Can we help Syrians on their own turf? I don't think grabbing their people is the best answer long term. Here is an interesting post from someone living in a war torn area (found on reddit the other day): 

&gt;African here -- living in Africa. Yes, I am ""black."" I sadly believe that so many emigrants to your lands will never be assimilated, they will never become part of your country. They will simmer in anger and blame you for their unhappiness. They hate you and everything about you. They move to California or Ohio but tell themselves that they can never be anything but a Syrian or Somali. They teach their children to hate you.

&gt;I have traveled for my business, but do not want to move to Europe or USA. But many, many young people in my country would emigrate if they could. I am or would like to be an ""enlightenment liberal"" in that I despise many aspects of our traditional culture which includes great oppression of women, tribal violence, child marriage, etc. For example, a common belief is that ""loose"" women, i.e. western women, are assumed to be bad women ""asking for it."" A woman who walks about, unmarried, not under a male's protection is fair game. I know this attitude is common among young men of Muslim nations as well. Imagine what they think walking about the average colege campus?

&gt;Remember they see Hollywood movies where white western women engage in behaviors that would be impossible or inconceivable for women in our culture.

&gt;Also: Many of these young men are sexually starved--most women in their culture are literally locked up and kept illiterate. The young men are poor so can't afford to buy a bride. [dowry]

&gt;No one ""dates"" in the modern Western sense. They are angry and frustrated. They have many grievances and are very prone to blame other people for their problems.

&gt;If you imported a million young men of this feeling into Denmark or Minneapolis disaster would result. It IS RESULTING.

&gt;Nothing to do with being black, Arab or whatever -- not race. All to do with a poisonous 5th world ideology and culture. But who can change their culture at a border???

&gt;I wish Western liberals would understand this. The solution must come at the source. Moving people is not a good answer. We have to build better nations and cultures where the refugees come from, not move all the people out. We have to admit – – something western liberals hate to say out loud – – that traditional cultures in Africa and the Middle East have simply failed.

&gt;That is more humane and sensible for the long term.

&gt;Supporting mass migration is not compassion--it hurts everyone. Eventually the solution will have to be some sort of mass deportation from Western countries. You will simply never absorb any of these immigrants. They will always be a terrible problem for you.

There are loads of maps spread amongst the main areas of Tyria - Ascalon, The Shiverpeaks, Kryta, The Maguuma Jungle, and The Maguuma Wastes. Taking the time to fully explore all those locations - getting map completion, finding all the interesting nooks and crannies, dynamic events, world bosses, hearing all the lore, the jumping puzzles and minidungeons - will take a long time. You can rush through that if you want, but there's a lot there waiting for you to discover it. 

Along the way there are story dungeons which are fun and offer up even more lore about Destiny's Edge. After story dungeons there are the explorable dungeons paths which offer a good experience and are still kind of profitable. They are an easy and cheap way of getting exotic level weapons and armour. Only Ascended armour has better stats, and for most content ascended equipment isn't necessary. 

At level 80 you will have access to Fractals of the Mists. Like dungeons these are instanced 5-man content, but as you go from fractal level 1 to fractal level 100 the encounters get harder and new mechanics are introduced. 

All of this PvE content is available with the core game. If you get heart of thorns you'll have access to several new maps, some of which have a unique map currency that can be traded for some ascended level equipment. You'll also have access to raids, but if you are looking for more relaxed gameplay without a strong time commitment then raids are probably not what you are after. 

Finally, a quick question. I assume you are on a US server? If you are on an EU server I could offer you a spot in my guild to help you explore Tyria and content in a friendly, helpful and social environment.

And WTF do you think that even means? That CIA is running all these countries or what? And how much money do you think Russia spent in Ukraine since 1991? I can tell you it was a lot more than 5 billion, does that suggest FSB owns Yanukovich? This is nonsense conspiracy bullshit.

Oh its so surprising that long time opposition politician, and one of the main Maidan organizers becomes part of the new government. Other than Yats becoming prime-minister there was 0 specifics about anything else that happened. You're basically reading into shit that's not there. Go listen to that thing again, you're contending that asst. secretary of state along with US ambassador were organizing a coup under the  tutelage from general secretary of the UN Ban Ki Moon and VPOTUS with implicit agreement from POTUS. This is madness. 

&gt;That wasnt US, that was EU. Fuck EU Nuland had her own plans and the moment coup succeeded EU was on board.

You realize same week that phone call was intercepted Nuland met with Yats and Klitschko  AND Yanukovich to work on a deal for peaceful resolution to the crisis (which likely what that phone call was about). Second part of your sentence means that EU (we're talking thousands upon thousands of officials) ALSO had knowledge of the coup and are completely  complicit in conspiracy against Russia orchestrated by the state department, UN, and VPOTUS. This is bordering on the retardation. I'm talking Alex Jones level of utter bullshit. 

This conversation serves no purpose at this point when I have to refute stupid shit like this. You're basically arguing that entirety of Western world is complicit in orchestrating this super evil plan, the whole purpose of which was to fuck up Russia. And goddamn assistants secretaries of state are like little henchmen that make the whole thing happen. And this alleged conspiracy totally excuses the annexation of Crimea, the hybrid warfare, MH17, and ridiculous countless lies and bullshit out of Russia. You're insane."

and 

&gt; Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a **result of obesity** and not enough exercise.

and 

&gt;Type 2 diabetes is partly preventable by **staying a normal weight**, exercising regularly, and **eating properly**. 

and 

&gt;Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes, **including obesity and being overweight** (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization.[19][29] **Excess body fat** is associated with **30% of cases** in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, **60–80% of cases** in those of European and African descent, and **100% of cases** in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.

[Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2)

And it's well known that type 2 diabetes can frequently be reversed in both underweight and overweight persons through dietary interventions (i.e., eating a healthy diet usually consisting of whole foods with low glycemic indexes, ketogenic diets, etc.).

There are lifetime endurance athletes who develop diabetes because of decades of carb loading and people frequently get obese from foods with high glycemic indexes since they're frequently calorie-dense, low in nutrient density, and low in satiety which makes it easy to eat more of them. 

Type 2 diabetes is both largely preventable and reverseable. These are the facts."

First, racial is probably a more accurate word than genetic for what you mean. Each person is genetically different from another, and how people are related by ancestry is linked to how similar are their genetic codes. But where you draw the line between which differences are important, that is, where you define races, is arbitrary and subjective.

You could say Cuba is 100% human and the US is 100% human. You could say Cuba is 30% ""white"", 20% ""black"" and 50% mixed of both, and the US is 60% ""white"", 15% ""black"", 25% ""Hispanic"". You could replace 60% white by 30% ""Germanic"", 20% ""Mediterranean"", 10% ""mixed European"". Each of these races is completely arbitrary and none is right or wrong as long as you are consistent (grouping people of closer ancestry roughly together). No definition is more correct than another (perhaps the ""100% human"" one is, as human can be defined as a species which has more rigorous criteria).

Now, I'm looking at Wikipedia and the answer is yes, Cuba seems to have people of different races by the more traditional definitions of race, and so does the US.

Race still is not necessarily related to ethnicity. Stealing the definition from another comment, ""an ethnic group is a group of people who identify themselves with each other on the basis of nationality or cultural traditions"".

If Cubans, despite their distinct racial origins (where, again, race is arbitrary and socially meaningless*), identify as a group with common cultural traditions, they can be said to be an ethnic group. Conversely, if there are distinct communities with different cultural traditions (regardless of being the same race or different races), they may be considered different ethnic groups.

This is still not a complete answer. Cuba may have distinct ethnic groups (or not, I don't know), and yet Cubans in the US and their descendants may, in the face of being a minority, identify with cultural elements shared by different ethnic groups of Cuba, creating a Cuban-American ethnic group.

\* ^(Race *may also* be understood as a social group based on inheritable physical characteristics, where it is then observed in social interactions rather than defined with basis on ancestry and biology.)

1) Emissions standards in Europe and some parts of the US have gotten really strict. 

2) It is more difficult for diesel engines to pass these tests than for petrol engines. This is because diesel engines work on heavier (less refined) grades of fuel, and the nature of the compression-combustion process also means they emit more harmful substances and particle matter.

3) There are ways to make diesel engines clean enough - they've been used in European heavy commercial trucks for years. It involves using something called AdBlue, an extra chemical injected into the exhaust. Professional truck drivers can be counted upon to just fill up an extra tank with AdBlue every time they fill up their main tank with diesel fuel, but for regular people with their cars, having to fill up two separate tanks is a big hassle.

4) Volkswagen's engines were always amazing exactly because they managed the performance characteristics (power, torque, economy) without having to rely on AdBlue. Every other passenger-car maker said ""We can build an engine like that, but it would need AdBlue"". VW said ""well we have really efficient control of the processes in the engine, so we can do without"".

5) So it turned out, the way VW was achieving the engine performance without AdBlue was actually just not caring about emissions at all.

6) Regulators don't actually test every car that goes on sale. They don't have the budget for it. Maybe now they will, or there will be a requirement for manufacturers to pay a testing fee for each new car/engine, etc. - but that would be a huge job and very time-consuming. In reality the regulators just spot-check a few models every year, and rely on the manufacturers to follow the rules."

Go read a history book;  Large portions of Islam have been periodically waging war on Europe and the West for 1,500 years, and not in retaliation but as a way of advancing their ideology and geopolitical influence.  So much so that back in the day they had to mount a few crusades to keep them in check among other things.  The Ottoman empire at one point controlled much of the Mediterranean praying on European Shipping.  You may have heard of The Great Siege of Malta.......point is, Islamic extremism goes back centuries before America was even founded.  It **is not** a reaction to Western involvement,  rather fundamentalist Islam merely given a convenient target to hit.  The Islamic Middle East has been a hotbed of hate, instability, war and terrorism for over 1000 years at this point.

Nation building isn't all that bad anyway, it worked well for Japan now didn't it.  Held them to ransom with nukes and installed a modern, Democratic political system and now they're one of the most civilized, modern countries known to man.  Maybe if many people in the middle east weren't primitive savages they'd actually build something worthwhile under American Supervision.

Islam, like it or not, is **fundamentally incompatible** with Western Values, both Socially, and Politically.  This is indisputable. 

Don't just take my word for it, listen to Winston Churchill;

''Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome."" - Sir Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister''

Or do you know more than him as well?

Oh, and religion has nothing to do with race as you know, criticizing Islam has **zero** to do with race.  Take your pathetic buzzwords somewhere else.

Since the Eastern Christians were in Communion with the church until the schism, that places them at the edge of Chistendom as well.

&gt; Visa liberalization for Turkish citizens traveling to the European Union may come in effect by December, despite recent tensions between the two, a German daily claimed on Wednesday.

&gt; According to a report based on EU sources by Die Welt, officials from Turkey and the European Union are holding talks for visa free travel to the bloc, which was included as part of a readmission deal signed between the two parties.

&gt; There is a &amp;#039;concrete plan&amp;#039; to ensure visa liberalization and an agreement is almost reached, an EU source reportedly told the paper and added that talks on the subject are expected to start next Wednesday in Brussels.

&gt; STOCKHOLM Sweden proposed rule changes for its taxis on Wednesday that may help ride-hailing services like Uber Technologies in the long term, but also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing should be illegal.

&gt; A government-appointed commission said that Sweden should allow taxis to operate without meters, making it easier for drivers to use their own cars - a development that has helped firms like Uber undercut traditional services in other countries.

&gt; Uber, which has faced setbacks in other parts of Europe, already offers taxi services in Sweden, but has to comply with the same regulations as other market players.

Sending money to the third world while not working as fast as possible to transition to a sustainable economy is very short-sighted, you may help the third world a bit, but you doom mankind as a whole. Also, we should be focused on not growing the economy, but transitioning it away from wasteful practices into long-term sustainable ones. That would mean a shift from fossil fuel use to green energy, and slowing down the economy or even shrinking it at this point would be of benefit, while it may result in a lot of lost growth and jobs it will only have a positive effect on our own species survival.
A significant part of lessening the damaging impact on the environment could also be accomplished by significant foreign import fees from countries and produce known to have obtained in a ecologically harmful way, incentivising foreign manufacturers to adopt more sustainable manufacturing practices, even if it would mean a rise in product prices, the total long term cost to mankind would be lower. It may also bring back manufacturing to developed countries where the cost of labour may now be prohibitive, but would not be with the added import duties and taxes of such goods, and the total harm to the environment would be a lot smaller as first world countries are much better at not polluting the environment due to more strict regulations and a bigger focus on sustainable practices.

Edit: the refugee crisis is a very complex issue, as had it not have been for the interfering of first world powers with their countries, trying to set up false democracies and puppet regimes, things would not have become so bad. If this were a crisis solely of their own making, I would agree, keep them out, let them fend for themselves. But due to our past and current actions and presence in these regions, we have a responsibility to in some way fix what we ourselves may have caused.

My problem is that our economy in Finland is going to shit, and a large part of the problem is our rigid labour laws, and the inflexibility of job markets that come with it. Of course, there are other factors contributing to it, but the labour laws heavily protect some workers on the expense of others. This has generated a divide in our job market, where some (usually older) workers are heavily protected, while others (usually younger) work with no guaranteed pay or hours. As I understand it, this has been happening in many other European countries as well. On top of that, we have high unemployment. I honestly think that the labour laws are not protecting the workers from the capital owners. The working class is the one suffering the most. 

Relaxing labour laws would of course also benefit the capital owners. Maybe even more than the working class. I would be fine with that though, if we got our economy working again."

* Just like American consumers want jobs with the makers of products American's buy, so does the rest of the world. So additional factories were built overseas to cut payroll, shipping and tariff costs that cut into U.S. production for exports.

UKIP on the other hand are a chaotic mess of ideas without euroscepticism binding them together. The whole argument is mute anyway since voting for a 3rd party is pointless under the current system.


Basically the Conservatives are the best of a really bad bunch. I have no love for them but since they're the only thing keeping Labour out of office, I have no choice but to vote for them."

Yeah, it does. Feels like I'm repeating myself here, but EU migrants are much more likely to be employed than natives, they pay more tax than natives, ie. they earn more, they are more likely to be highly educated, they create more jobs than they take away... need I go on?

Yet the immigrants that the government has control over do not have this same kind of performance. So yeah, the free market is doing this just great.

The country would basically not afford the services it provides if migrants didn't come here. That's pretty much the end of it. Natives aren't paying their way, immigrants are. Fine if you don't want them here, but the consequence is more austerity."

The 3 rockets that left Moon after the EE hit America, Asia and central Europe. How is it that if Tranzit takes place in the 60's or 80's can China continue into the 90's and beyond?

The minimum wage isn't a cure-all. One of the big problems in the UK is a lack of wage progression. There are so many workers willing to work for minimum wage despite having 5+ years experience that there is no reason for employers to raise wages of more experienced employees. 

This is hugely damaging for lower class workers who are looking to start a family, but continues to be attractive to many immigrants. 

If I'm a 30 year old Brit earning minimum wage, I can't afford to support a family or bring up children or get a mortgage. If I'm a 30 year old immigrant, i *can* afford to support a family which is in Eastern Europe. *Particularly* if I am claiming various in-work benefits or child benefits which are scaled for the cost of living in the UK. Because the 30 year old immigrant often has a home and family in another country, he (or she) is also much more willing to live in a cramped or borderline illegal flat (max number of occupants rules are rarely enforced in the UK), which reduces costs even more. 

&gt; making it less possible for some local folk to extort money from employers by **refusing to work** for what is a very decent an livable wage

I don't know how much you read the news, but our wage stagnation and the lack of people earning close to or above the living wage is a *very* big deal. 

You must be able to see how one person struggling to survive on minimum wage will come to resent somebody on the same wage who is supporting a family abroad.

&gt; BRUSSELS - European Union officials announced plans for a big increase in military spending on Wednesday, pledging to take greater responsibility for their security at a time when the United States appears to be taking a step back in its role in the world.

&gt; Total military spending by European Union governments was about &amp;euro;200 billion last year, but the union does not currently have a budget for military research or procurement.

&gt; Jyrki Katainen, a vice president of the European Commission, said the timing of the plan had &amp;quot;Nothing to do with American elections&amp;quot; since it had been in the works since 2014.A longstanding goal was to avoid duplication of effort in military procurement, which is mostly done on a national basis, and to improve the compatibility of the various military hardware that European countries acquire, he said.

The EU does not have a significant redistribution system. 

In 2015 the Netherlands was the largest contributor (as a percentage), paying 0.54% of GNI to the EU. Sweden paid 0.48%, the UK and Germany 0.46%.

In the US the top contributing states pay in 10%, and multiple states pay in more than 5%, 10 times as much as EU members.

In the US, 14 states and Puerto Rico get more than 5% of their GDP in federal transfers. 4 of them get more than 10%. 

In the EU, only 1 state gets more than 5% (Bulgaria). Greece, a basket case that should be getting 20%, gets 2.8%

In other words, the EU redistribution system is about a tenth the size it needs to be. Germany, which contributes about 14 billion Euros a year, should be contributing about 140 billion. There is no chance of that happening.

&gt;and the Euro is working. I mean it's not perfect, and it's not incredibly strong (by design) to the dollar or pound, but it's not like it's failing either. Greece and my own country Ireland' problems weren't caused or exacerbated by the Euro, they were helped by it in fact. Italy the same, the Euro is helping them stave off mass inflation and economic collapse due to decades of internal economic ineptness.

The Euro is destroying the southern EU states. Not Ireland, I agree, but Greece, Italy, Portugal etc simply cannot cope with the Euro. They cannot compete with Germany at the same fixed exchange rate. Even if they had the same government, the same policies, the same workforce, the geographical problems alone would make it impossible for them to compete. 

Floating currencies provide a natural stabilisation mechanism. If the Euro did not exist, the DM would now be valued so highly Germany would have difficulty selling its goods abroad, and would be sucking in imports at a much higher rate from other European countries. Greece would have a currency so low that it would drive an even larger tourist boom and encourage companies to set up there. 

&gt;There's a reason why it's such a small sum compared the states in the US give back and that's because these are sovereign countries, not states of a single country. They can get help from other places if they need it like the IMF, while Mississippi cannot.

The IMF hands out emergency loans. Greece doesn't need more loans, it needs ongoing subsidies to compensate it for its geographical disadvantages. Either that, or a floating currency that would automatically compensate."

We all know if there was ever an referendum at any point in the last 50 years on whether the British public want to see a reduction in immigration the answer would have always been a solid yes.

The reason this has happened is because we have a voting system which forces a two party system and neither party really cares to stand up for the public on this issue. Before every general election politicians always say they'll ""reduce the numbers"", introduce ""more controls"", etc, etc. But what have they ever actually done?

The Conservative party has said they will reduce immigration for years now, and people voted for them with that expectation but they never have. And they weren't fucking around either, they said they were going to reduce it to less than 100,000 which would have been less than a third of the current levels. Yet you think this is somehow the peoples fault for not voting against immigration? And that this is really what they wanted all along? You just have to be fucking joking dude.

Surveys have repeatedly shown the majority of the British public want to see massive reductions in current immigration levels. (https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefingpaper/document/249#1) It's undeniable. The fucked up thing is just how true what I'm saying is.

1) _Reading maths when you don't know the symbols is very hard and frustrating._ True. And yet new symbols are introduced frequently. Take a look at some papers in abstract algebra, model theory, algorithmic information theory. Introducing new notation is a fundamental technique in mathematics.

2) _Greek alphabet is historically very used in maths because of ancient Greece contributions to maths, unlike Hebrew for instance._ You think there are no significant Jewish mathematicians?

Also, in between the work of Euclid, Archimedes etc, and today was a long period where, firstly, mathematics was done in prose and not in symbols and secondly, much of the tradition was carried on by Arabs in Arabic, and later re-introduced into Europe, in Latin.

_Every math students and researchers know greek alphabet._ They end up learning it, but I do not believe that many of them are fluent with the Greek alphabet _before_ they study mathematics. They learn it _while_ and _as a result_ of studying mathematics. They could just as well learn other, equally unfamiliar symbols. And they do, in fact: ∇ is not a Greek letter. Neither is ∂, nor are many other symbols _which become familiar after they are used_. Why could this not apply to Hebrew letters beyond א?

3) _When you write mathematics (at least at research level), you want to be understand by everyone. If you start using exotic notations (like Hebrew, Cyrillic or whatever), people will have trouble to understand your work._ See reply to point 1, and for further discussion, Whitehead's _An Introduction to Mathematics_ which illustrates very well the power of good, new, notation to ease the work of the mathematician  by examining some examples. There was a time when ‘+’ was a new a mysterious symbol, unfamiliar even to working mathematicians."

&gt;No entanto, ressaltando que essa é apenas minha opinião, acredito que esse direito à vida do feto ocorre apenas quando este tem a capacidade de manter suas funções vitais, sem depender do organismo materno, e isso acontece por volta das 24 semanas.

Então, se por exemplo desenvolverem tecnologia que permitem sobrevivência de fetos mais novos fora do útero, a *definição de vida* muda? Porque agora mesmo muitos prematuros só sobrevivem graças à tecnologia, eles devem ser considerados não-indivíduos até que cheguem às 24 semanas, quando em tese não precisariam obrigatoriamente de tecnologia?

O aborto também não é uma patologia, é uma ação, um procedimento, e um problema social.

Assim como a gente pode fazer estudos para combater a sonegação e o estupro mesmo com dados imperfeitos, podemos fazer o mesmo contra o aborto.

A demanda está aumentando e etc. Meu exemplo pessoal é aqui em casa, ninguém pegava táxi frequentemente e agora é Uber pra cima e pra baixo. 

Com esse aumento do número de passageiros e expansão para áreas ditas mais perigosas da cidade, o motoristas estão meio apreensivos.

Saying that the Earth has ""withstood all types of temperatures"" does not prove that man is causing modern global warming. One of the primary concerns is not that the Earth will have problems, but that there will be *massive* refugee situations in the next 100 years, among other things. But there is no more debate that the current warming is being caused by CO2 released by humans:


Humans are digging carbon out of the ground in the form of fossil fuels and putting it back into the atmosphere.

Of the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, it has the fingerprint of carbon from the ground. In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing ([Manning 2006](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/icdc7/proceedings/abstracts/keeling.rFF328Oral.pdf)).

Measurements of carbon levels in coral shows a recent increase in the type of C02 that comes from fossil fuels ([Pelejero 2005](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/309/5744/2204.abstract))


Satellites are measuring more heat entering the Earth's atmosphere than escaping it, and this heat is at wavelengths at which C02 absorbs heat ([Harries 2001](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html), [Griggs 2004](http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com/tech_reports/ETR_1_vn2.pdf)).


Of the heat that is not escaping, it is going back down towards the Earth's surface ([Phillipona 2004](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003GL018765/abstract))


Of the heat that is increasing at the Earth's surface, it is also at C02 wavelengths ([Evans 2006](https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm)). Evans 2006 also notes: ""This experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.""


If greenhouse warming due to C02 is happening, it should be warming faster at night than at day. This is observed ([Braganza 2004](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004GL019998/abstract))


Also, if greenhouse warming is occurring the stratosphere should be cooling, and it is ([Jones 2003](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2002GL016377/full)).


If the lower atmosphere is warming and the upper atmosphere is cooling, the tropopause should be rising. This is happening: ([Santer 2003](http://www.math.nyu.edu/%7Egerber/pages/documents/santer_etal-science-2003.pdf)).


If greenhouse warming is occuring, the ionsphere should also be cooling as well as contracting, and it is ([Lastovicka 2006](http://www.ufa.cas.cz/html/climaero/topics/global_change_science.pdf)).

Another suggests there aren't more 'deaths per encounter' than white people in the US, but black people are more likely to be on the receiving end of physical mistreatment by police in similar situations. There is another (this is all iirc but I could probably find them) that suggests that there is a slightly higher death rate. 

The US police are far more 'militarised' and less willing to take risks to themselves than the UK police, the criminal justice system is also pretty different to the UK with a much higher population, way more emphasis on punishment even for minor drug possession in some parts and poorer conditions in a lot of places. They absolutely does need reform to a more social democratic, European model (I guess I would say that though right).

My main problem with blacklivesmatter is that, partly because of the ingroup/outgroup situation in many US cities, black nationalism and/or the coming together and leadership of black people is/should be the best or only way to fix this. I think that it is so far embedded in US social policy that this would have little effect on the wider situation and to be effective they would've had to drop the black/white ingroup/outgroup politics and  expanding their efforts to white and other communities that are on the receiving end of similar police treatment and ultimately to agitating for some kind of welfare state and full employment policies that would reduce the 'informal economy' that goes along with urban poverty and is responsible for much of the crime. They have made some efforts to reach out to other people in their manifesto which seems to have some understanding of these things, but in other ways (calling for reparations only for black people etc) they are basically disqualifying themselves from being a broad-based and active movement. 

There is [some](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/poll-support-black-lives-matter-grows-among-white-youth/) evidence that they have achieved majority support among large sections of the population, but also are thought of as violent (somewhat true) and divisive. They have achieved some success with easing of 'revenue collecting' policing (i.e. fining poor people who can't afford lawyers) in some areas like Ferguson, but these seem like structural problems that might come back. Some of their key points like making the police more diverse seem to have [almost no effect](http://europe.newsweek.com/racial-makeup-police-departments-327312?rm=eu) (or even a reverse one) on police conduct and they have already spawned a backlash that seems like it might have some rooting in fact, with rises in crimes associated with a police 'drawback' from high crime or poverty stricken areas in major cities like Chicago.

Therefore the Holocaust and Nazi Germany should be irrelevant to you. After all it is European history and events that occurred mainly in Europe and concerned with Europe and the victims of Nazi Germany were Europeans after all, correct? Same with the Armenian Genocide. Largely irrelevant to Americans. I mean American isolationism is a thing after all. So you shouldn't even be having an opinion on these matters as we are talking about events which didn't occur on American soil, is that how I should take it? I guess all this talk was irrelevant and now that I think about it it was you you engaged in the thread giving your opinions on events which did not occur in America and as it is the norm around in Reddit when American flags are seen users assume lack of educated opinion. However I don't do that and give the benefit of the doubt. But when you state that absurdity that you are not a European state and thus events and the understanding of a genocide that occurred in Europe shouldn't apply to you, you really don't leave me room to have a discussion now. I don't know what fallacy this falls under though. Maybe you can at least help there. 

Finally just to note that most of the research on genocide is carried out on the US and Israel however where most of the knowledge is put to real practice is in Europe, hence the title of the document which includes *European Values*. 

And regarding your point two, I absolutely didn't ignore that part. In fact if you read the rest of the document you can see the strong condemnations and calls on Turkey regarding reparations, etc. The document makes sure there is absolutely no doubt in making Turkey a party to all this. And the reasons are explained in the document and I already explained in the previous comments, including why just because you brandish unreliable statistics from a supposed Armenian authority of numbers just prior to the execution of a genocide which was already in process for a long while ago, and ignoring that numbers are not even the only determiner for statehood, doesn't negate that Western Armenia was the Armenian homeland. 

Your point 3: the Armenian Genocide timeline's latest beginning date is 1984 and earliest ending date is 1923 with the Lousanne treaty. And this is honestly being conservative, stage 8 is still ongoing, and the earliest stages started prior to 1894 with the Armenian Question. Of course unless you deny that there is no denial by the successor (even continuing) of the perpetrating state, or that there has been no such thing as the Armenian Question and policies surrounding it. Anything else is intellectual dishonesty at best. However I still give the benefit of doubt of the existence of a different world view and perspective in matters relating to human rights, arguably one of its cornerstones being a European perspective.

Not really, because the Cape is by far the longest European settled place in South Africa. That is where European settlement began, so the Coloured population began 350 years ago and has been steadily growing ever since since.  By the time Europeans were settling other places in large numbers there were stronger racial lines in place.   If you look at the 1904 census, well before Apartheid, Cape Province already had a 400k Coloured population, out of a population of only 450k in the entire country.  There were already 500k+ whites in the other provinces at this point, but only 50k Coloureds.  The community was born in the Cape, and unlike the Boers the vast majority did not trek.  Later during the gold rush, colonial period, and during Apartheid they did not have access to the same economic opportunities that would make them migrate. 

I'm sure plenty did claim Coloured status just for improved conditions during Aparthied, but there are other reasons the population is concentrated in the west

If light infantry gameplay is either a strength or a skill you are looking to develop, the 173rd Airborne Brigade might be just what you're looking for! Our unit is based on the real-life 173rd Airborne Brigade that has a history dating back to WWI.

If jumping out of helicopters and transport aircraft with 40 to 80+ soldiers from across the U.S. (plus some soldiers from Europe as well) sounds like fun, you'll definitely enjoy what our unit has to offer.

**CHECK OUT ONE OF OUR SWEET OPERATION VIDEOS!**
https://www.youtube.com/user/173rdairbornedivison

While our unit operation takes place on Saturday evenings, there are other events that would interest you that take place throughout the week.

To be an *Active Duty* soldier you are required to attend at least 2 out of 3 of your required weekly events (squad training, platoon training, and the unit-wide combat operation). This amounts to between 4-6 hours each week (if you plan on attending all 3 events). If you don't have that much time to devote you may enlist as a *Reserve Duty* soldier and only be required to attend 1 event every other week (that event lasts approximately 2 hours).

If you're interested but still need more information feel free to check out the unit's [About Us](http://173rd.us/index.php/page/aboutUs2016.html) page, or you can come talk to a recruiter on our [TeamSpeak Server](http://www.teamspeak.com/invite/ts3.173rd.us/?channel=Request%20a%20Recruiter%20%28Read%20Description%29).

Rendre plus flexible ne dit pas que tu le rends flexible. C'est absurde le coût de terminer un CDI, ça empêche la flexibilité des entreprises. Certes ça nous a bien aidé durant la crise, le coût social a été moindre, mais là on voit qu'on arrive pas à s'en sortir, ça nous a bloqué.

As Chelsea's season gradually petered out in 2015/16, Guus Hiddink remained adamant he was targeting European qualification for the club.

The Blues were already out of the Premier League title race by the time he returned for a second spell as interim manager, replacing the sacked Jose Mourinho in December.

The FA Cup and UEFA Champions League were the Dutchman's only opportunities of silverware that would have provided European football for this season, while Chelsea had an outside shot of qualifying through the Premier League.

As such, the debate that ensued was: Given Chelsea's position, would it benefit the club to take a year out of Europe, thus playing fewer games and focusing on developing a team to serve beyond one season?

The collapse that had followed Chelsea winning the 2014/15 title told us the issues were many. It wasn't surface damage but something that ran much deeper. There was an imbalance brought about by years of hiring and firing managers who had signed players to suit their systems.

It was all disjointed, and the notion was that Chelsea needed some time out in order to put things right. In boxing terms, they needed to lean on the ropes for a few rounds, accept a few blows to their ego but take the breather to come back stronger in the later rounds.

A footballing man to his core, Hiddink couldn't fathom that. For him, any sort of legacy he would leave behind wouldn't look good—on paper at least—if he led Chelsea out of European competition for the first time in two decades.

""It's not Chelsea standard to be happy to be out of the relegation zone, and sit back and relax a bit,"" Hiddink said in March after the Blues defeated Norwich City 2-1 at Carrow Road. That victory extended a good spell of form and continued their rise up the table, away from the bottom half where they had spent too much time for comfort.

""We have to set new targets now with the ambition of Chelsea in the direction of Europe,"" Hiddink continued. ""[...] We'd like to go as high as possible towards the European spots.""

Chelsea never would. Come the end of the season, they finished in 10th place with no silverware. Hiddink's European dream was gone. Out of darkness comes light, however; that failure was actually the Dutchman's biggest success. It was the best possible gift he could give Antonio Conte when he was unveiled as Chelsea's new boss in July.

Now, six months on from when Hiddink left the club, Chelsea are back looking down at the rest of the Premier League. They're the outright leaders, setting the pace on the back of an astonishing run of form that has seen them win seven games on the bounce.

Now Chelsea's players are acknowledging the benefits of not competing on all fronts this year.

""We have one week to prepare for the game and at the end of the week we know what to do when we play,"" Eden Hazard said after Chelsea's 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, per MailOnline.

That Spurs had dominated the game in the first half but still went on to lose was a case in point. Mauricio Pochettino's side seemed to run out of steam and, importantly, ideas, after the interval. They didn't seem to cope as efficiently over the 90 minutes as Chelsea did, something that playing in the Champions League midweek surely didn't help with.

Chelsea’s back line: Making forwards look small since 3-4-3. 🔑 pic.twitter.com/F6JD7kqmpX

— Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) November 27, 2016
While Chelsea were analysing video and being drilled on their tactics, Spurs were suffering defeat at the hands of AS Monaco. They had to travel to the south of France for the privilege.

That fact was alluded to by Hazard, who added: ""Last year [when Chelsea were in the Champions League], we were just doing recovery so we weren't always ready for the game, but that's not the case now. We are concentrating on the opposition during the week and give everything.

""We do lots of tactical work and video work, it depends who we are playing. We do everything to be prepared.""

It's exactly how Chelsea appear under Conte—prepared. After 13 league games in charge, the manager's methods are taking hold. Those days from last season that were spent in recovery are becoming refined training sessions, giving a coach of the Italian's quality that rare commodity in the modern game; time to work with his players throughout the season.

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola hasn't had that luxury nor has Jose Mourinho at Manchester United. Both managers took up new roles this summer, and since pre-season they've been juggling busy schedules with a desire to imprint their philosophy.

New-look Chelsea have upgraded 💪. pic.twitter.com/ou9buw4omg

— Bleacher Report UK (@br_uk) November 26, 2016
They're at different ends of the scale in terms of the success we've seen from both, but each manager is still working to get their players in tune with their way of thinking. Of course, 13 matches is still embryonic, although no other manager this season has made the sort of impact Conte has.

His change of system and how Chelsea's players have adapted so rapidly has been a surprise, yet Hazard's view post-Spurs tells us that it shouldn't be. What we're seeing now is what we should expect when world-class coaches have time to work with world-class players.

In that sense, failure to achieve last year is fuelling Chelsea's success in the present.

Indeed, it's a notion that also impacts elsewhere at Stamford Bridge. Victor Moses has been part of a Nigeria side that didn't qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. As disappointing as that would have been for him, that failure is only going to benefit Chelsea's title challenge.

While the likes of Senegal's Sadio Mane will be missing from the Liverpool squad in the new year, Moses will be on Chelsea's right side, working up and down the wing with the same intensity and productivity we have seen this term.

Conte's side is going to be without disruption, building on the momentum that has taken hold since late September.

Like his Chelsea counterpart, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has the benefit of no European football to contend with. Regardless, however, he could do without a player such as Mane, who has been vital to his team's own pursuit of glory, upping and leaving in midseason.

It's a footballing paradox: From being English football's biggest failures last season, Chelsea are actually the club winning most right now.

That's Russian, you know language of the country we are talking/writing here about.

&gt; I'd love to see whether Russia's economic troubles are anywhere near the level of the 2008/9 crisis for America and Europe

Russia is a fucking poor country compared to countries of western world, at least relative to their ambitions. Russian government spends way too much money for things they cannot afford ant things which never pay off during things, that matter for the future coming short, like health, education, infrastructure, like things for us, for people. Those crisis back in 2008 hit russia much harder, since they completely depend on the trade with western countries. And after that russians never recovered. So basically they are staying in that crisis for 8 years now.   

&gt; Russia doesn't lack for resources or intelligence

Yeah resources, but we don't do anything wit them, we just sell them. And we sell them mostly to western countries. And to mine those resources we often need western technology. So much about russian ""intelligence"".  

&gt; so long as they approve of Putin he will stay

There is no way to know what russian people approve or not approve. And it doesn't matter in russia. It just doesn't matter in so many ways i don't know where to start. First there is no institutions, through which we can influence government or putin's  elites. There is no free media, to speak out, or just to speak independently about things which matter. There is no real political opposition or political parties. Most of people who was capable of doing some political work are either corrupted or driven out of the country or death or scared to death. There is no real elections. All elections are forged, so there is no way you can influence officials with you vote either. And last but not least, there is no way to know how much support there really is just now. Right now it just a figure, but there is no way to validate it or to interpret it, since there is no scientific institutions, who work fully independent from russian government.  

&gt; Cuba, North Korea, Iran

Yes, but they don't have russian corruption and criminality. To go back to state of one of the country from this list, putin will need to purge his whole system of friends and supporters. let's see how he survives that.

Tout d'abord, en comparant avec le transport en commun, en général l'automobile est environ 2 fois plus vite, mais ça dépend des endroits (à Montréal, le métro est plus rapide que la voiture). Ensuite, il y a la constante de Marchetti à prendre en considération. La constante de Marchetti est la thèse, prouvée empiriquement, qu'en général l'être humain tolère un temps de parcours pour aller au travail de 30 à 45 minutes, peu importe le moyen de transport. Le résultat est qu'au final l'augmentation de la vitesse de transport ne résulte pas en des délais plus courts, mais en des trajets plus longs.

Ainsi, au début du 20e siècle, avant la motorisation de masse et avant les autoroutes, le temps passé pour aller au travail était d'environ 30 minutes, soit moins qu'aujourd'hui. Et si on regarde avant ça, on remarque que des villes comme Paris occupaient un territoire formant une sorte de cercle de 5 km de rayon, l'équivalent d'une heure pour aller de la périphérie au centre-ville. Même dans les campagnes, on remarque qu'il y a souvent un petit village à chaque 10 km dans les vieilles régions agricoles du Québec et d'Europe, bref, une distance assurant un temps de parcours maximal d'une heure pour aller en ville (ou à l'Église, à l'époque).

Augmenter la vitesse des transports ne fait que favoriser l'étalement des résidences et des emplois et ne diminue pas les temps de parcours. Néanmoins, certains aiment car ils aiment les grosses cabanes sur des gros terrains, mais le coût d'adapter nos communautés pour subvenir à cette préférence esthétique est énorme. Et il y a quelque chose de sournois dans toute cette affaire, afin de satisfaire les caprices de gens qui veulent habiter ""en campagne"" et toujours travailler en ville, on crée des infrastructures de transport qui incitent les employeurs et les commerces à se disperser. Le résultat est que même ceux qui ne veulent pas de ce mode de vie bâti autour de la voiture se voient forcés de l'adopter, car les commerces de proximité ferment, les emplois se dispersent, et ils doivent commencer à conduire juste pour avoir accès aux mêmes services et emplois qu'avant."

The only reference to other DLC I can find is Horse Lords, which says you are four times -less- likely to be attacked if you can loot (is that the DLC you got?). Also, characters from Empires are less likely to go adventuring.

The ""nation"" of America is ideology that is more or less expressed in Americanism. This allows for much more egalitarianism than a traditional old world nation state as long as groups assimilate. 

Now we did have our Democrat Political Party emulating Europe and that's why we had to fight a Civil war over political diversity and slavery. That war set us back on the path of assimilation. They still emulate Europe and practice racial politics so it isn't like we ever managed to fully integrate everybody but we do pretty well for a state without a nation.

* **TvZ** - 2/1/1 into Marine, Medi, Mine transitioning into a more Marauder heavy bio as the game progresses (speed this process up depending on ability to trade vs ling/bane).  Once on 3 base saturation I like to drop a second SP with TL and a fusion core.  Try not to overextend early to keep my medi count high which in turn allows me to freely transition into libs.  If I am macroing unhindered I tend to finally add Ghosts to help vs Corruptor/Viper.  I personally think that Lib range is the highest priority and MVP of the current match-up, particularly with the addition of Hydra range.

* **TvP** - Marauder heavy bio into Bio/Tank/Lib.  I've been experimenting with 1-2 ravens once two-base sat is achieved.  Due to the immobility of tanks, blink stalkers and adepts are at more of a premium and a single PDD helps out immensely vs stalker heavy comps (not to mention the satisfaction of insta-popping observers).  Final form is always Marauder heavy MMM with ranged lib backup.

* **TvT** - ByuNs 2R/2H delayed expo opener.  Marine heavy Bio/Tank vs Bio (with more marauders mixed in vs Mech).  The current patch favours the oppressive defenders advantage of turtlemech (buck flizzard!) so the decider of almost every TvT (discounting dumb coinflip all-ins or doomdrops) almost exclusively comes down to air control.  Libs decimate tank lines, viking/raven count decides if your libs live and helps defend doom-drops.  My end game comp seems to gravitate towards air-terran feat.

If it is the same brain that led you to the conclusions espoused above, dont be fooled again. As for numbers:

&gt;Furthermore, if we insert our estimate of 1934-35 Japanese per capita estimate of 1,760 dollars (in 1990 
prices)  in  place  of  Maddison’s  2,154  figure  in  the  Maddison  dataset,  it  would  show  a  Japanese  per  capita 
income  lower  than  almost  all  other  Western  European  countries,  including  Spain,  Italy  and  Greece,  only 
comparable to USSR,  marginally  higher that of  Malaysia or  the Philippines for that period.   These  intriguing 
findings seem to point to the  need  for a  more comprehensive research on  pre-War  PPP  for other countries  as 
well

Compared to a lot of autocracies? Huge.

No finding plausible anchors of comparison. If the argument is about Greece, which is a democracy and the point of contention is democracies being well, off, it does not provide a contrast at all.

The amount of low-to no skill jobs is not as great as it was even 10 years ago. You're not where most Western European countries are in terms of the skill tree, but you're climbing it up fast.

As a member of the 29th Infantry Division, I would like to invite you to consider our Charlie Company.

&amp;nbsp;
     
The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

Deutschland sprengt KONSTANT und faktisch täglich die EU Grenzwerte zum Feinstaub und jeder Verbrenner ist Teil des Problems. Selbst eine Halbierung der Feinstaubbelastung bei Neuwagen würde nicht ausreichen und sobald es ein bisschen zu kalt wird muss ja der Motor geschont werden da schalten schonmal alle Diesel die Reinigung ab.

&gt; Deswegen sind Elektroautos mit ihrer mangelnden Infrastruktur, 

Mangelnde Infrastruktur ist keine Kritik am Elektroauto sondern an der Infrastruktur. Die sieht übrigens so beschissen aus weil uns VW und Co auch hier betrügen wollten (Stichwort Ladesäulenverordnung)

&gt; zweifelhaften Reichweiteangaben 

1. Sind das dieselben Schwachsinnsangaben die alle Autos angeben, denn diese sind nach NEFZ genormt. NEFZ hat übrigens eine Durschnittsgeschwindigkeit von ~30 km/H also ungefähr was ein sportlicher Radler fährt. 

2. EPA Reichweiten kann man durchaus auch in der Praxis erreichen. 

Auch hier wieder Klüngelei und Lobbyismus der Autobetriebe die bei allen anderen Autos durchgelassen wird aber beim E-Auto auf einmal ein Kritikpunkt sind.

&gt; und wahrscheinlich kommenden hohen ""Tankkosten"" nicht von aller Kritik freigesprochen.

Da aufgrund der Wirkungsgrade beim Elektroauto selbst das Verbrennnen von Sprit im Generator und dann betanken des Elektroautos immer noch effizienter ist halte ich es für EXTREM unwahrscheinlich, dass das Tanken von Elektroautos teurer wird als das von Verbrennern pro KM. Ich verweise hier immer gerne hierauf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V7DvFFBLJg wo es im Detail nachgerechnet wird. Wenn die Tankkosten für Elektroautos hoch sind, dann hat das politische aber keine praktischen Gründe. Einfachstes nachrechnen ergibt das ja auch:

Ein p100d hat 100kwh akku. Rechnen wir mal mit EXTREM großzügigen 20% Verlust durch laden, Netz, etc. die wir auch noch dem Kunden aufrechnen sind wir bei 120 kWH * 0.25 €/kw = 30€. Die 80€ sind imho ausm Arsch gezogen zumal wir ja schon jetzt mit unserem Steuern absurd viel geld pro Ladesäule draufgeben.

&gt; nicht von aller Kritik freigesprochen. Allerdings wird das vor allem hier wie ein Sakrileg behandelt.

Nein, sind sie nicht. Ich könnte kein Elektroauto kaufen oder fahren, da es viel viel viel viel viel zu teuer ist und ich es nirgendwo laden kann. Das ist jedoch keine Kritik an der Technik oder dem Auto. In Norwegen, Holland etc. sieht es da bereits ganz anders aus. Wer dafür die Kritik verdient hat sind VW und co die durch Klüngelei und Lobbyismus jeden Fortschritt verhindert haben und jetzt panisch reagieren weil einer mal nachgemessen hat was hinten rauskommt. 

Nur wenn die Kritik versucht ""Ich kann nicht mehr 200 auf der Autobahn fahren"" mit ""Wir verrecken am Feinstaub und jede Großstadt ist über den Grenzwerten"" gleichsetzt, dann ist diese Kritik nicht angemessen."

I would agree that they were very primitive in regards to technology but not necessarily lower IQ. Remember the ancients gave us Plato, Cicero, and Aristotle to new a few. The myths of Plato's cave, Odysseus, Jason and the Argonauts, Pandora's box, the legends of Hercules, etc. Most people were bilingual if not trilingual. The period of the European plagues in the middle centuries, the lack of theological and philosophical inquiry with the Reformation and  the Renaissance, the lack of any real scientific understanding, and human fear factor majorly destroyed the positive virtues of ancient society. The Dark Ages were called that for a very good reason besides the practice of genocide, slavery, and cruelty that was systematic till civilization and peace spread as Christian ideas of universal fraternity and equality began surpassing tribal allegiances.  

&gt; Such a creature could still fulfill all of our beliefs in religion and still function as a god to us, the origins and source of power would simply be different.

I held that same view for years. It is quite possible that humanity is where gods once were. That is the base for Mormonism (""as man now is, God once was: as God now is man may be"") and Scientology to a lesser degree (gods are merely a higher up ascended spiritual once alien species but now a force). 

&gt; Such a creature could still fulfill all of our beliefs in religion and still function as a god to us, the origins and source of power would simply be different.

The heart of orthodox Christianity (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestants, Evangelicals, etc) is that there is one true God but a myriad of false ones. That is the Old Testament problem of Israel, they always vacillated towards henotheism or syncretism. The New Testament is that at the incarnation, the one God became simultaneously human while remaining essentially God without the majority of his divine attributes. His perfect life without sin allowed him to redeem humanity as a perfect human sacrifice that so happens to also be God himself. Man never becomes in essence like God but through divine adoption become relationally one of God's children. 

&gt; Such a creature could still fulfill all of our beliefs in religion and still function as a god to us, the origins and source of power would simply be different.

The problem with us humans is not that we worship but we worship such a diversity of ideas and things. There is no unified essentially human version of ""all of our beliefs"". The diversity of beliefs, particularly in the East, where there are estimated 330 million gods, or 33 crore (a crore is the idea of million in Hindustani language or more likely the concept of innumerable) is breathtaking. 

Humans are worshippers by our nature. That is we pursue something to give us meaning outside of ourselves. We worship regardless if it is a deity (Jesus, Allah, the Great Sky Father, The One Above All), an idea (Buddha's dharma, Jefferson's pursuit of happiness in the American conception, Nietzsche's  supermen, or Lenin/Mao communism, or scientific progression and escaping our planet through colonization), a passion (love, sex, power), a object (cash, biggest tv, house, or car), or a person(s) (redheads, gay, straight, bi, relationship(s), whatever floats your proverbial boat).

The early Christians in Rome were often called atheist because they objected to all the gods but One. Those Christians believed that Jesus was the only God to break in to the human story physically in his incarnation, accomplish what they could not (redemption from sin and adoption to God), and that the rest of the gods were false and weren't really worth worshipping.

I take that Lewis/Tolkein had it right that Jesus was the God of the Old Testament that incarnated in to history (recorded essentially true) in the New Testament as Jesus (that name means Yahweh Saves in the original Hebrew-Aramaic). 

Our post-modern scientific age has created a society that just dismisses metaphysical reality because it does not fit in to a naturalistic framework which is the bases of our society. We as a whole are practicalist first and empiricist second. Since we do not normally see the miraculous then we dismiss it as nonsensical at worst or mythic at best. 

I think a lot of his modern followers do a piss poor job of living as the early Christians did as models of peace, kindness, and compassion. Those of us in the West pursue a whole lot of false gods in the name of the real One. Probably me included.

The reason I am a Christian in large part is because there is immense beauty in the story of Jesus. It conforms to the truths that I have seen in reality and explains the state of our world which is as a whole broken but fixable and worth fixing.

The only reason I acknowledge their existence is because they got unfair and discriminatory laws passed, to the point that my children will in all likelyhood inherent a (western) world in strife.

There is no truce with feminists, because they are immaterial.

Our governments and lawmakers are the only one that counts.

One people under one law, no snowflakes, no exception.

.

What is becoming apparent from the USA, Germany, France, Italy, and probably more, is that people are getting fed up  with usual politics, and ready to try something different. Unusual, even.

This is due also, but not only, to men's issues. That sense of getting the shaft while doing most of the work.

.

Our short-term problem in Europe will be the rise of the far right.

Our long-term problem will be the slack in marriage and birth rates. Read, MGTOW. Because making laws and their application fairer won't bring back into the fold all those future young women and men that are currently not being born.

Cue Japan comparison."

The electoral college helps prevent massive states like California from basically taking over the government.  Think of our federal government as the EU, and the states are the member countries.  They all have their own specific interests they're pursuing.  It's one of the things that makes governing our country tough, because you have to deal with all these states that want to do their own thing.  Sometimes we resort to shady tactics and strong arming to punish them into conforming, like funding and the drinking age. 

The problem is that state like California have greatly diminished power. It is crazy that a smaller state gets to decide how California gets to run for nearly half a decade. You are implying that it is unfair that California would get more votes  when we have the largest population, I'm sorry that is not unfair.

Let's put this into perspective. California has the largest population and overwhelmingly provides the most wealth to the federal government. In fact California largely subsidizes and keeps alive failed red states with more electoral power. A person in who-the-fuck-cares Kentucky gets to decide how to deal with immigrants in California who are part of the state's economy and have a large hand in the harvesting of crops that feed the entire country. A person in no-one-wants-to-live-here Louisiana can decide to ban Muslims for fears of terrorism even though they will never be the target of it while cities, which are targets, are more welcoming. People in less populated urban areas get to overpower larger populations in urban areas simply becuse they refuse to advance to the 21st century and live with this notion that they want the ""old days"" to come back. Like fucking hell, we are seriously going to deny climate change because people in red states were promised shitty coal mining jobs back.

It seems to be a perfect union of American and European PM.

While I like Apollo's voice (he ain't with us no more... - in Firewind), the newer albums, despite having some good tracks on each, just sounded too overly processed while lacking the raw aggression and jaw dropping melodies that these albums had.

I think the biggest issue in this country is that we've a fascination with home ownership. A home is seen as some financial investment rather than a place to live.

If you look at Europe, owning a place isn't a big deal and most people rent. The big difference is, as far as I'm aware, that the houses are owned by massive organisations and are managed over the long term rather than short term. This is similar to how councils and housing association work. 

The simple answer to your question is that there's no reason for private home builders to up production or lower cost. Back before RTB, councils and private companies built housing. However, after RTB it was a lose Maker for councils to build general housing stock at they more or less stopped. This left private companies as the only real supplier. "

But I think that those same criticisms tend to extend to other major Abrahamaic religions.  And I think that, if all of those religions have the same awful stuff in their canon texts, the difference between which parts which cultures observe and which parts which cultures ignore is a cultural one.  This cultural difference is determined by the fact that western Europe had the Enlightenment, and the Islamic World really didn't.  Part of the reason for the fact they didn't was constantly being invaded by Europe.  So, what's needed is to encourage the kinds of conditions that gave rise to western European Christianity's own Enlightenment, in order to get the Islamic World the push it needs to secularize enough to buy into a modern liberal democratic state.

The reason for this view is not necessarily my soft-heartedness, but the fact that there are over a billion Muslims on the planet.  Unless you're talking about genocide, then there's no way that the approach you're recommending gets us to integrating them into a peaceful global community.  And if you are talking about genocide, then we've already lost all of our western democratic ideals.

Farage said a number of times before the referendum that a loss of the leave campaign by 48 to 52 would not be a clear enough margin of victory and the leavers would feel entitled to fight on. Then he proceeded to complain when the 48 to 52 result was challenged by the remainers.

Two big problems: 

First, because you with your laptop will be in Germany, the German government will see that as working and generating revenue in Germany. 

This means you are subject to German laws on employment, taxation and (since you are a non-EU citizen) foreigner's law, specifically the rules on residency permits and work permits. 

So you first need a residency permit and a work permit. 

If you want to be employed in Germany, you need to find an employer who will comply with German employment laws, who will pay taxes on your behalf to the German authorities and pay social security payments into the German system. 

Frankly I doubt your US employer is up to founding a branch in Germany just to accomodate you. 

So my suggestion to you would be to acquire a few more clients and work freelance. This will probably be the best way, since getting a freelance visa is relatively easy compared to a regular work permit.  

Another potential solution could also be that a German company makes a contract with your US employer. The German company hires you and pays your wages, taxes and social security contributions. In return they gain your US employer as client and then bill your US employer for your services. Such a contract would be right up the alley of a ""Zeitarbeitsfirma"" (= temping agency). They would take their cut and pay you significantly less than another employer, but this way you could still work for your US employer. If the background is explained (you are legally employed by the US company) it would become pretty clear that the German company wants you and only you and that this contract would not happen with anybody else. Meaning you are not taking a job away from an EU-citizen or a non-EU foreigner with a work permit. 

BTW, this would all be a lot easier if you two were married. Germany does not recognise common-law marriage. Instead of coming over as a dependant, your application will be decided seperately and independently.  "

For one thing, registries interfere with one of the primary functions of widespread civilian gun ownership, resisting tyrannical governments.

More importantly, any onerous gun control in the US will almost certainly happen progressively.  Resistance to gun control comes substantially from gun owners and hobbyists.  Both sides of the gun control debate therefore want to influence the popularity of shooting as a hobby. 

The NRA has outreach programs, and the gun-control lobby tries to pass laws that make shooting more expensive and difficult to get into.  Tax stamps, waiting periods, ammunition background checks, restricting internet ammunition sales, restricting imports, tying the right to purchase a gun to completing a training course or membership in a shooting sports club (an approach taken by some European countries).

Passing weak gun restrictions make it easier to pass stronger ones in the future. It is a slippery slope (which, contrary to popular opinion, is not a 'fallacy').

We quickly became best friends. I co-signed for his first car. I helped him in all his written work, proofreading and revising for clarity. This included his applications to medical school. 

The second year after becoming a doctor he decided to buy his dream car, a BMW M3. He invited me to pick it up with him and said he would cover the hotels and gas. Two weeks traveling Europe? Hell yes! We drove 2400 miles and visited 9 countries. On the way back, he paid to upgrade us both to Business class because the ride to Munich had been in horribly uncomfortable seats. 

In August he invited me to come to Russia, which I did. Upon return, I owed him $2,000 for some of our shared expenses. I visited him bringing him a check for $1,000. However while there, I discovered my car had a blown head gasket. He tore up my check and offered to finance my car. When I found a great car for only $4500, he just said, ""I can pay for it myself and you can pay me back whenever you can."" Last week I gave him $1,000 in cash.

At the time this site, and its stated mission, was all about freedom of speech - thanks site's creator Aaron Swartz.

Collectively Reddit did do some great things over the years such as participated in stopping the SOPA in 2011-12, and a related legislation in the EU. 

Unfortunately that was pretty much the last time Reddit defended the freedom of speech.

Over the years, little by little this site had started to change. 

The corruption was incremental at first: abuse of mod powers, astroturfing, collusion, mods getting money and favours for astroturfing, people getting banned for posting evidence of it. Then it slowly started concerning political opinions: users getting banned for their legal free speech, mods with obvious leftist bias spreading their influence over numerous subreddits, whole subs getting banned for infractions other subs got away with scott free.

It was all incremental. The story of boiling frogs comes to mind. 

To me the final straw was when the gamergate blew up. That really woke me up to see what this site had become and how it had abandoned its core principles.

It's true that some global changes to, eg, captain skills, can be nerfs to them, but if the nerf is too direct then people will be upset.

More importantly, it **sets** a dangerous precedent: if people feel like their premium ships are being nerfed, they'll stop buying them. I sure as fuck won't be buying any more premium ships if the ones I already own are nerfed in ways I believe to be significant: not because I want to be OP, but because I spent my money on a specific purchase that I'd researched and understood. To change it post facto is pretty unacceptable.

Besides, most EU countries, plus Australia and others, have very strict consumer protection laws. If I purchase something, whether that thing is physical or digital, and it is subsequently changed significantly from the description when I purchased it, I have a right to a full refund, with almost no questions asked. Importantly, there is pretty much no time limit on this: it doesn't matter that I've been using the item for a day or 2 years, it's no longer as described and therefore is in breach of the law, allowing me to request a ""repair, replacement, or refund"" - essentially, ""give me the old ship back or refund it"".

That could result in quite a lot of refunded ships, especially if the change affected multiple purchases - they don't necessarily have to have been able to stealth fire in the first place, if they are nerfed in any other way.

Basically, nerfing premium ships could be **very** risky for WG EU. It could potentially result in a lot of refund requests, with very little recourse for WG to refuse. Their Terms of Service would provide absolutely no protection, either, as terms of service can't over-ride the law. Banning users for requesting a refund would open up the ability to demand a refund of all in game spending by that user.

I know that sounds extreme, and a little far fetched, but the law in the EU is very clear: purchases (specifically including digital purchases) **must** be ""as described by the seller"" (phrasing from the UK law: Consumer Rights Act 2015, which implements EU directive 1999/44/EC). If the ship is changed in any way (direct or otherwise) that means it isn't as described when purchased, the buyer can get a refund. This has been clearly demonstrated with various digital purchases of games that promised more than they delivered: No Man's Sky being a high profile example where hundreds or perhaps even thousands of people, by now, have received refunds.

Now, I don't know if many people would actually bother putting the effort in to claim those refunds - but as I said, it sets a dangerous precedent for WG regarding future purchases, and opens the door to find itself facing hundreds or thousands of requests for refunds for quite large sums of money. Especially if people decided to request refunds on principle, or to refund ships they don't really use any more"

112:

* +20mm to tiny patch of sloped side armor, to 80mm. Now this small weakspot is as strong as the surrounding side armor, and not significantly weaker. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/T1SIesy.png) are some [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/I85PnUd.png) highlighting the weakspot.

AMX 50 120:

* +3 degrees of gun depression, to 9 degrees
* +5 degrees of gun elevation, to 11 degrees

AMX 50 B:

* +2 degrees of gun depression, to 10 degrees

* +200 h.p. to engine, to 1000 h.p.
* +30mm to upper front plate, to 150mm
* +105mm to frontal beak, to 225mm
* +10mm to bottom of lower front plate, to 130mm
* +20mm to side armor behind tracks, to 100mm (now all side armor is 100mm thick)

* +55mm-60mm to lower turret cheeks, to 175mm-180mm
* +40mm to frontal turret sides, to 120mm
* *Summary*: flat parts of the turret are easily pennable, but anything that isn't flat that isn't the commander's hatch will be almost impossible to pen frontally. Overall a massive boost to turret armor. Hull armor is also measurably better.

* +9.4mm of frontal turret armor, to 111mm
* +88.9mm to gun mantlet, to 203.2mm.

Sadly the only one who understands value of that is Putin, with his mediocre free market reforms. Which actually where caused by the falling oil and inability of Russia to print money(Rothschild owned central bank). Yet, ""better"" does not mean good in case of Russia."

I am using Gramática de uso del espanol for grammar. English based resources are not ideal, as I already know another romance language well, and therefore don't need explanations of lots of stuff the anglophones usually need. The Gr de Uso goes more into detail than others, and I love it. However, I could certainly do with something more focused on writing practice. I got a nice translation exercise book based in my native language,to drag me a bit further from my comfort zone. I am considering buying a B2 and C1 course (monolingual), which could give me more ideas on writing, a bit more guidance on it. Any recommendation? I didn't like most courses I leafed through in a bookstore last week. So far En Acción 3 and 4 or Tema a Tema B2 and C1 look most practical, but there is no hurry to buy them, I have lots of other sources to work with for now, and don't want to waste money and time on useless resources. I need something focused on practical advice and training, I don't need a leaflet full of selected reading and listening bits, I have tons of better sources for comprehension practice. 

Thanks for the tip concerning the multiple choice task training. Are the answers logical and really based on understanding, or is it more of a telepathy, like many multiple choice tests? 

I am comfortable with European Spanish (except for the andalusian version), and with LA versions I have found in media. I certainly have very little experience with Bolivian or Argentinian variants, as the Mexican seems more represented. Perhaps I should look more into them?

Yeah, I made a draft in one of my previous language exams, and my feelings about it were quite mixed. I have never been able to simply write longer texts without major changes even in my native langauge, so I definitely  need to make some kind of notes, or a structure to follow. But writing out most of the task and than recopy, that was the way to hell, I think I lost quite a lot of points on the last third of the assignment, as I was running of time and getting to the wordcount limit.

&gt; David Perry Lindley (born March 21, 1944, San Marino, California, United States) is an American musician who is notable for his work with Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, and other rock musicians. He has worked extensively in other genres as well, performing with artists as varied as Curtis Mayfield and Dolly Parton. He has mastered such a wide variety of instruments that Acoustic Guitar magazine referred to Lindley, not as a multi-instrumentalist, but instead as a ""maxi-instrumentalist"" in a cover story about his career to date in 2005. The majority of the instruments that Lindley plays are string instruments. They include (but are not limited to) the acoustic and electric guitar, upright and electric bass guitar, banjo, lap steel guitar, mandolin, hardingfele, bouzouki, cittern, bağlama, gumbus, charango, cümbüş, oud, weissenborn, and zither.

&gt; Career:
As a teenager, Lindley took to playing the banjo and the fiddle. By his late teens he was acknowledged as an award winning player having won the Topanga Banjo Fiddle Contest five times. From 1966 to 1970, Lindley was part of the eclectic psychedelic band Kaleidoscope. Between his work in the studio as a session musician or on tour as a sideman or bandleader, Lindley has worked on learning new instruments. He was the leader of his own band El Rayo-X from 1981 to 1983, which produced three studio and two live albums.

&gt; Work with other artists:
Lindley is known for his work as a session musician. He has contributed to recordings and live performances by Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, Linda Ronstadt, Curtis Mayfield, James Taylor, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Terry Reid, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan, Rod Stewart and Joe Walsh. He has also collaborated with fellow guitarists Ry Cooder and Henry Kaiser. Artist Ben Harper has credited Lindley's distinctive slide guitar style as a major influence on his own playing and in 2006 Lindley sat in on Harper's album Both Sides of the Gun. He is known in the guitar community for his use of ""cheap"" instruments sold at Sears department stores and intended for amateurs. He uses these for the unique sound they produce, especially with a slide. In the early 1990s, he toured and recorded with Hani Naser adding percussive instruments to his solo performances, and his instrumental repertoire which he uses in his session work. In recent years, Lindley has also toured extensively and recorded with reggae percussionist Wally Ingram. It is his touring around the world that has exposed him to part of his array of instruments that appear exotic to many Western audiences.

&gt; Lindley's voice is heard in the version of Stay performed by Jackson Browne. Browne's version is a continuation of The Load Out, and its refrain is sung in progressively higher vocal ranges. The refrain of ""Oh won't you stay, just a little bit longer"" is sung first by Browne, then by Rosemary Butler, then by Lindley in falsetto. His slide solo in Jackson Browne's Running On Empty is one of his best-known collaborative works as well.

&gt; Lindley joined Jackson Browne for a tour of Spain in 2006. Love Is Strange: En Vivo Con Tino, a 2-CD set of recordings from that tour, was released May 11, 2010, with Browne and Lindley touring together starting in June of that year. The duo also won an Independent Music Award for Best Live Performance Album.

&gt; Instruments:
Lindley has an extremely large collection of rare, unusual looking and sounding instruments. There is a large and detailed display of quite a few rare guitars, as well as instruments that originate from the Middle East and other parts of the world. Lindley has listed and categorized many of them on his [url=http://[officialsite]www.davidlindley.com]website but admits that he has ""absolutely no idea"" how many instruments he owns and plays, having gathered them since the 1960s.

It's more than just a sport for them, it's a part of their lifestyle. I went to France recently and while I was playing with some kids in the park (family friend who was French introduced us) it's kinda depressing having 12 year old kids who just play for their local club (I.e the same level that I play at except I'm a fair bit older) just completely annihilate me. It just came to them so naturally. I know they play a lot of other sports in European countries, but football is just so overwhelmingly dominant compared to America/Australia. "

&gt;On September 23, 2002 in San Francisco, six months prior to the Iraq invasion, Gore gave a major address in which he roundly criticized “the course of action recommended by President Bush” and offered his alternatives. Yet for all his criticism, Gore supported in principle Bush’s determination to invade Iraq.

Gore criticized Bush’s timing in changing the focus of the “War on Terror” away from Afghanistan, Bush’s belligerence, and his distain for the European allies, but then said this: Nevertheless, Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction.Why? Because…Iraq’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power. Moreover, no international law can prevent the United States from taking actions to protect its vital interests, when it is manifestly clear that there is a choice to be made between law and survival.

&gt;Do you think Clinton will sit idly by if Trump calls for an invasion of Iran? Get real.

She's a war hawk so I dunno. She seemed perfectly happy prolonging the syrian civil war and taking military action in Libya."

Just to preface this, I'm the mod who called him a dickhead over Twitter. 

As I stated in my post where i announced that I'm stepping down, I haven't been active on this sub for months. At most, I come out of the woodworks whenever shit goes down and the hate comes out against my mod mates. This was one of those times. 

Ronin brought it to our attention, as I believe he has you followed on Twitter. This is the first introduction I got into the whole situation. I had nothing to do with your post removal, or temp ban. We discussed that the attack on Red was permaban-worthy, and for obvious reasons. If someone with 10 Twitter followers gets angry and tweets about us, that's one thing - but when someone who is obviously a large member of the community, such as yourself, tweets to 30,000 followers to ""give 'em hell,"" it becomes a step further. A few, actually. I get your point where you wanted to change to happen in terms of the rules, but at the time you must understand that *it did not look that way at all.* It appeared to be your typical ""go fuck with this guy,"" kind of post, which is a straight up witch hunt.

That pissed me off, and it pissed me off badly. To see Red do all the work that he does every day around there without so much as a complaint, then get shit on over and over again for complying with our rules and following them as a moderator is heartbreaking. That's what caused the late night middle finger from me to you. 

This part is more off-topic, but I stepped down as moderator soon after this, because I simply don't feel attached to this community anymore. I've always tried to do nice things and help orchestrate enjoyable things for the community, the most recent one being ReturnToLordran, because I loved and felt loved by this community. Now? Not so much. Not on /r/DarkSouls3, at least. Is this possibly my fault for not being more willing to change the rules or *try* to talk the other guys into changing them? Perhaps, but we also have our reasons for the things we do. We want to remain in good standing with those behind the game. Kimmundi, the EU Bandai Namco Community Manager, regularly drops by /r/DarkSouls3 for example. We've had several instances where FromSoft / BamCo have been watching the Subreddits and doing things with the community. I even had Kimmundi ask me personally if he had the moderator's support / help for a future Pvp project of his. 

I feel that if we as a moderator team allowed things such as glitches, exploits, cheat engine tutorials, and shitposting to manifest without removal, we wouldn't have those same connections to the people as we do (or maybe *did*, now) today. 

So then we have to make a decision on what is best for the community. Do we let everyone do those things and potentially lose the interest of those who *created the damn game,* OR do we simply put it in the rules to not do those things, the same rules we've had since /r/DemonsSouls, and retain those connections with those people? 

We chose the latter. This has obviously caused a huge number of problems - moreso on the Ds3 subreddit than any other subreddit in the past. 

Keep in mind, there's always other places to do those sort of things that we have rules against; SDS for clever / tasteful (they made me say that part) shitposting, and /r/DarkSoulsMods for things featuring cheat engine or modding. 

We aren't trying to snuff out the voices of people we don't like, or throw topics into the garbage bin that don't sit well with us, we're trying to make /r/DarkSouls3 a place where the entire community - the game dev's or publishers included, can all sit well with one another. That's hard to do whenever those higher ups wouldn't want to be around through all the shitposting and ""how to use CE 101,"" type of posts. 

If you feel we hate you and that's why x or y happened, then that's your opinion. That's not how things went down or why this or that happened, but that's an opinion nonetheless. I feel as if you had calmly approached Red and asked him why it was removed, he would understand. If not - you could've messaged the other mods (hell, even in a PM) to try and figure something out. Just because you're a huge member in the community doesn't mean you aren't allowed to do things like that and ask for some help understanding our actions. We make mistakes too, and it's absolutely okay to question what we do - just don't be a dick about it. That's more of a general rule, than a shout out at you, /u/DamnNoHTML. 

There've been many issues before this with people not being understanding of the fact that all it takes is a polite pm our way and things can possibly change. I include the word polite because the shit we usually get is nothing far from a ""why'd you remove our post you SJW autist faggots?? Lmfao fuck you"". 

So to recap: 

I didn't remove any posts, or contribute to the temp ban. I did however, advocate for the ban to be moved permanent after the Twitter thing against Red. Whenever I tweeted at you last night, I had decided that I would step down as moderator of /r/DarkSouls3, and then made the post today. 

I'm not going to recap the rules or why they're there, If you want to know that information then you'll have to actually read my wall of text that I've slowly typed out from my phone. 

Oh, and I'm not the person you need to talk about when it comes to the original removal of the post or the original temporary ban - that would be Red. Regardless of the fact that he removed the post / temp banned, I feel like you should extend an apology to him and relay the information of this post over to him yourself. It would likely mean more and help mend things if you apologize to him like you did the general public in your post here, and probably help the mending process, If there is one to be had.

I would also like to state that I appreciate you saying some of the things you've said here, as well. 

Have a good day, everyone. "

He is also known for singing/co-writing the hooks for the #1 hit Nothin' On You by B.o.B, and Billionaire by Travie McCoy; he also co-wrote the international hits Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

&gt; After the success of the songs he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

&gt; He then released his debut album, Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green, and Damian Marley.  The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010.  The second single off the album, Grenade, was released on September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded ""It Will Rain,"" the lead single from the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

&gt; Bruno Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and Bernadette ""Bernie"" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&amp;B. From a young age, he was impersonating and performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as ""Little Elvis"", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. ""I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan,"" he stated.

&gt; In 2010 he said, ""Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist, my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by it."" He attended President Theodore Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

&gt; Before becoming a successful solo artist, Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's international hit ""Right Round"". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song ""Get Sexy"" and provided backing vocals on their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second studio album Animal, featured on the track ""3D"". He reached prominence as a solo artist after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's ""Nothin' on You"" and Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire""; both songs peaked within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, ""I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of ""Nothin' on You"", it might've sounded like some '90s R&amp;B."" Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: ""The Other Side"", featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of ""Nothin' on You"" and ""Airplanes"" with B.o.B and Hayley Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

&gt; He opened for Maroon 5 on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on October 18, 2010.

&gt; On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of cocaine. He claims ""he has never used drugs before"" and his decision was ""foolish"".

&gt; He has been nominated for seven 2011 Grammy Awards. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; * The head of investigations in Ukraine's Security Services (SBU) has charged that Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Onyshchenko may have been spying for Russia.

&gt; * Hryhoriy Ostafiychuk, head of the SBU's Main Investigative Directorate, told reporters in Kyiv on December 1 that the SBU has obtained evidence that suggests treasonous activities by Onyshchenko.

&gt; * Ostafiychuk alleged that Onyshchenko obtained a Russian passport from Russian authorities in exchange for assisting Russian secret services to destabilize Ukraine.

&gt; * Onyshchenko rejected Ostafiychuk's allegations -- denying that he had Russian citizenship and suggesting he was facing a backlash from authorities because he gave evidence to U.S. intelligence officials on November 29 about what he described as illegal activities by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

Australia's, or really any developed country's as they all operate in the same way, system is the best way to go about it. We establish a baseline and all that meet it and can secure themselves a job are free to move here. I don't care about setting a limit on the number because it will inevitably mean that someone who will be of great benefit (a doctor) would miss out because our 'quota' of foreigners was already met for the year. This system works best because you can stop people moving here to take the low paying jobs (which means that it becomes a cost to the state for them to be here) and can still attract those for high-end professions and also make allowances for sectors with shortages (doctors, nurses, etc).

It's not an economic power. Donald Trump won because the democrats lost the white working class and believed the industrial heartland would accept more globalization and immigration. Britain has never really been at ease with being a EU member. The Middle East is on fire from both economic instability, religious sectarianism, and the lack of a counterbalancing force.

Each of those  things has been the case since the 1990s. Why have they both suddenly come to a head in the same year? Why have Germany, France, and Italy all seen a resurgent far-right in *the same year*?

The Middle East is on fire because Russia is keeping it that way. Instead of attacking ISIS, they're *defending* Assad, which is a different thing. There were uprisings in a number of Middle East countries over the past five years or so, but none were as sustained as Syria. What do we see there more than we see elsewhere? Russian ties and Russian involvement.

&gt;Russia's influence in the west isn't that strong. It's just being used as punching bag for a failed establishment on both the left and right. We may be in the midst of our times answer to the French Revolution, an upending of the existing order that was based on a failed system that couldn't provide for enough people.

That's precisely the line that Russia's selling, and if you buy that, I've got a bridge for you to look at."

The cleaners sockets on older trains are meant to be used when its parked up in a depot by vacuum cleaners and such. If the train is in motion taking power from the overhead lines or third rail then the actual voltage can vary significantly, hence not for public use.

Well yes this is true, but depending on the tax treaty with the US (and also your visa status in that country) you might be subject to US taxes instead of your local country's taxes on investments. This is particularly true if I take advantage of a retirement visa such as Malaysia's retirement visa.

&gt;I am a little surprised that your brokers aren't cool with nonresident citizens. Most brokers ive dealt with are ok with non resident non citizens but these are in the EU

The reason why is that the regulatory burden the US government imposes on financial companies serving US citizens abroad is second to none. As such, many (most?) companies simply refuse to do business with them. It's why I posted a little further down this thread that I was a bit saddened I was born a US citizen since I do plan to move abroad. Basically, as an expat being a citizen of practically any other country on Earth would be better than being a US citizen from a financial and tax perspective due to these burdensome regulations imposed on companies doing business with US citizens.

Sadly, its not that simple. If it were, every nation on earth would be scrambling to take in any refugee or migrant they could get their hands on. The European countries along the Mediterranean coast would be amongst the most prosperous. 

The Australian experiment playing out now isn't about getting the best people that will contribute to our nation building and economy, its about pumping in as much cash as possible, which is why there's special arrangements for people that bring in $5M plus, for foreign investment in property, etc. 

Australia's immigration policy expressly favours people that want to bring in cash, and people that belong to major trading partner countries.

NOT people that want to come over to make a better life and contribute to our country and be part of it. We're locking those people up and treating them like garbage. 

We are letting in leeches that can pay the admission cost. 

The people bringing in that money aren't necessarily being productive. Most are parking their money in what they percieve is a safe/r environment, or simply speculating in a rising market. 

Its a short term, band-aid solution. Those same people will accelerate the decline in prices as they rush to the door to sell an minimise losses. No speculative investor wants to hold a property (which has a big capital cost, costs more money to maintain) if it starts to reduce in value even just a little bit. Not even with the tax incentives in place. "

Full response:
It depends. You can try to claim all of the content back, using the integrated Copyright claim system. This will allow you to do 3 things:

1. Disable income on the video, and getting the channel striked (3-strike they are out)
2. Enable all of the income to be directed back to you.
3. try to get licence from the channel.

The reason why this isn't likely to happen is that you have to prove that you own the copyright on that material, and that its not used in a transformative way. (US Citizens have a law that protects remixes and such, but as a whole, EU citizens don't have that in our EULA).

Your best bet is to claim ownership and hope for the best."

So wie du es beschreibst sollte es auch sein. Aber große Konzerne nutzen verschiedene Rechtslücken aus und schieben ihre Gewinne innerhalb der EU in Länder in denen sie die wenigsten Steuer zahlen müssen. So ist eine Variante das die Firmen die in verschiedenen Ländern operieren offiziell Tochterfirmen sind. Der Hauptsitz ist dann in einem niedrig Steuerland innerhalb der EU. Die gemachten Gewinne werden dann fast 1:1 als ""Lizenz-Gebühren"" (oder ähnliches. Wenn ich falsch liege berichtig mich bitte) an den Mutterkonzern abgegeben.

Here in europe, especially in eastern countries towards russia, submission wrestling is being taught to many many children as part of their daily routine at school, especially in poor areas. 

Wrestling itself is much more aggressive and fast than say your usual no gi bjj gym. I know russian people that you would call *crazy*, they are nice people but rolling they go apeshit. Because they havent been taught any different. They also dont get offended when you use strength and try to push through everything or you try to lock them. The way they are taught there is no ""light"" rolling as far as my experience goes. Watch kids in chechnya wrestling, its unreal. 

There was this one dude visiting from chechnya or russia I think, mma type guy. He told me before rolling that he wont use foot locks, why I asked...he said that he wont let them go when he has them, even when people tap. 

I think its not so much about skill level. I would say its much more about mentality and that they get taught a different ""kind"" of grappling.

You should also be aware Commandante has a large network of EU suppliers stocking their grinders, and people associated with them frequently show up in online discussions without revealing their relationship. There is at least one, and possibly two in that Barista Hustle thread, for instance.

As for the grind quality, it's not really clear how meaningful those Socratic Coffee graphs are. They ran the test by cranking the grinders with an electric drill, so right off the bat it didn't simulate the actual load on the handle and bearings very well. Note the Feldgrind ""wins"" the pourover test by a wide margin if you subscribe to the ""one peak is best"" school of thought.

* USSR Collapses
* Cold War tensions are residual with the way that Russia views the Europe and the US
* The EU is formed, and continues to gather countries over the years, closer and closer to Russia, maintains close ties with the US
* The US has been playing war games in the middle east for decades, they have military bases and outposts that double as a border a few steps away from Russia on all sides.
* Ukraine, a former part of Russia and a former part of the USSR is being considered for the EU, this is a last straw. (Imagine how leery the US would be if Russia created a new USSR incorporating South and Central America, then had been allowed to continue supplying missiles to Cuba, then adding military installations in Mexico and Canada.)
* US/EU and Russia tried their best to influence Ukraine in the events leading up to the Maidan protests and after. Russia emerged the victor after being willing to take Crimea. (I think it should be returned to Ukraine, but my inlaws live there and they 'voted' to become part of Russia. It's still pretty weird there.)

These options would affect the complexity &amp; realism:

**Complexity:**

**Training:** 
*Arcade:* training takes place automatically unless you specifically intervene.
*Semi:* training takes place automatically, but you select the players you’d like to develop and in what areas which can be set for the season, month, etc.
*Full:* Current system (with addons discussed in other ideas).

**Scouting:**
*Arcade:* Players have full stats available to see always.
*Semi:* Scouts will always be looking at players the AI thinks will fit the squad, so there’s a lot more players with revealed ratings
*Full:* You can only see players rated from 1-10 in the attributes (IE Messi has a 10 for Dribbling, 9 for shooting). Some 9’s will be 94, some will be 85 - the only way to see if they’re worth it is by looking at their skill combination (pacey, good at shooting, weak physical) and gamble on the transfer.

**Team management:**
*Arcade:* Players have 30% improved stamina (not in 90 minutes, but in terms of recovery per day).
*Semi:* Assistant manager will suggest automatic rotations each game.
*Full:* Normal

**Quick-sim:**
*Arcade:* Current, with more stats.
*Semi/Full:* Ability to make substitutions and change tactics.

**Realism:**

**Transfers &amp; value (example):**
*Arcade:* Being able to sign Messi with Blackpool in the Championship for $60m. Every player you put for sale will receive a bid or two, even if long-term injured.
*Semi:* Being able to sign him for United for $200m
*Full:* Not being able to sign Messi until he is out of Barcelona starting 11, and only for a massive salary, more likely to sign outside of Europe, never inside Spain (Full).

**Transfer contracts:**
*Arcade:* Loan or buy
*Semi:* Current system + release clauses
*Full:* Buyback clauses, release clauses, sell-on fees, loan contracts with incentives to play the player.

**Training:**
Affects degree to which training can boost players
*Arcade:* Can grow any player to a 90 with enough work
*Semi:* In between
*Real:* Much slower growth

**Rules:**
Only for Full: Submitting 23 man squads for competitions, must meet quotas in particular leagues (BPL Home-grown players).

**Injuries:**
*Arcade:* Current system

&gt;Many of the Obama administration's were undertaken as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and many of those investments were specifically in clean energy. According to a report by Clean Edge: The Clean Tech Marketing Authority, the recovery act included more than $70 billion in tax credits and direct spending for programs involving clean energy and transportation.

Alot of that money was funneled towards solar technology and businesses. As to your second point I'm unsure of you're trolling here or not. Because the scientists say things will get bad if we keep doing what we're doing we should just double down and push for more fossil fuel use? If we had that motto with the other issues scientists were ""exaggerating""  over then we would be well on our way to having to wear sunscreen to walk outside for more than an hour and having to watch weather forecasts for corrosive rain. The point of science is for us to make informed decisions before it's too late. 

We can't just buckle down and ride out a 2 to 4C rise in temperature. I think that's the biggest point lost on a lot of people who don't really worry much about climate change affecting them. Sure some countries may get fucked by a 2m sea level rise and droughts, but we live in a rich country and I'm nowhere near an ocean. So we'll be fine right? The problem is that these issues don't occur in a vacuum and drought/famine/mass migration across the entire globe will cause worldwide destabilizing effects that we can't predict, but we (including the US military)  can pretty accurately predict that these effects will be a great rise in risk to national security over the coming decades. Syria was only about 5 million people and it nearly crippled Europe. Imagine a world with over 50 to a 100 million people desperate for a safe Haven away from war and drought. Here in the US we will feel those effects greatly and so will our children. 

But we can fix it. Obama made the first steps and we have a pretty new burgeoning solar industry. We can push for more nuclear power (new and extremely safe sophisticated plants which can be up in less than ten years)  as a stop gap while we pour money and tax credits into new energy research. We can go along with the paris accords and tax our own carbon use, effectively leveling the playing field for all 1st world economy. It's and being a global leader in the environmental crisis. Just burying our heads in the sand just doesn't seem like a good response to me. "

Anyone who would kill everyone who ever voted Republican without hesitation is literally the furthest thing from a good person that can possibly exist. The exact opposite. You can lie to yourself all you want, but if you'd honestly do as you said, you're the absolute worst human being to ever live ever.

Further, I am NOT a Republican. I have NEVER been a Republican. I am currently a registered Democrat, I have been a Democrat for a LONG time, and before that I was Independant.

&gt;  That's 90% of western civilisation that thinks you're the worst group of human beings to have ever lived.

This is flat out not true. Between Trump and Brexit and all the right nationalist movements that are winning across Europe (see France in Jan and Austria in a couple days for the next big wins for right nationalist parties), right nationalism has NEVER been bigger or more popular.

&gt;  party of corporatist

Hillary Clinton was the most corporatist candidate to ever run for major office in any party in any country in the history of the world. You're detachment from reality is staggering.

&gt; If I had the power to kill every single Republican in the united states it would be a NET GOOD for the planet. 

That is your opinion. And even if you're right, even if it WAS a net good for the planet, YOU'D still be the worst person to ever live. YOU'D still be the biggest mass murderer in history. YOU'D still be worse than Hitler and Stalin and Mao and every other petty dictator that's ever existed ever all put together.

&gt; You're disgusting.

You don't even know me! You have NO idea about ANYTHING except I'm here saying ""Killing all Republicans is bad"" and ""If you don't want Trump to get reelected, maybe tone down the hate a little."" That is LITERALLY all you know about me. And yet I'M the disgusting one. Shit, you don't even know that I'm American (I am) or who I voted for (Trump, but I would have voted for ANYONE but Hillary, Trump literally second worst candidate on earth). You're a complete nutjob and you need to stop making assumptions. Because you know what they say about assumptions...they make an ass out of you and only you.

&gt; You do realise you are insulting your own god-emperor-fuhrer-KKK grand cyclops wizard when you use him as an insulting consequence right?

I don't give a shit about Trump. He's already done the only thing I cared about (killing TPP super dead). Everything past this point is ""gravy,"" so to speak. Seriously, he can't do enough damage in 4 years to cause any long term harm to anyone. It's just not gana happen...HOWEVER, if he gets a second term...well...that'd be a different matter.

&gt; I am not the reason Trump won

Republicans had lower turnout than Democrats. Republicans AND Democrats had the lowest turnout in the last 60 years. Independants turned out in LARGER numbers than in the last 40 years. In other words, Republicans didn't win anything. Independants tilted the scale towards Trump (by a 2-1 margin) and the Democrats not turning out is what sealed the deal. If you think that racists are the reason Trump won, you are literally ignoring all facts and making up your own fantasy world that is LITERALLY devoid from reality.

Let me put this another way. Both Romney AND McCain would have beaten Hillary if they performed like they did when they ran and she performed like she did this year. ANYONE could have beaten her. It just so happens that Trump was the one who did. Trum actually drove Republicans AWAY. But it wasn't enough cause Hillary drove Democrats AND Independants away even harder.

Hillary lost because she was, without a doubt, the worst major candidate for President to ever run for the office. And a LARGE part of that was the absolute hate she had for anyone who disagreed with her, politically. It's the EXACT same hate you have, and if that hate is allowed to carry through to 2020, I will LITERALLY bet you EVERYTHING I own that Trump wins reelection*.

Prends une federation d'etats, avec des etats riches et des etats pauvres. Des etats sont contributeurs nets et donnent leur surplus a l'autorite federale. Les etats debiteurs nets prennent ce surplus pour se developer ou simplement vivre decemment, sans que cela ne choque les etats riches. La Federation en 2010 a decide d'utiliser des moyens Keynesiens pour relancer l'economie. Ces moyens ont ete partages entre tous les etats. Cela a enrichi les etats les plus dynamiques, mais cela a permis aux etats les plus pauvres de tenir le coup. Et les etats les plus riches partagent leur reussite par differents transferts.

6 ans apres, cet etat federal a eu 20% de croissance. Le taux de chomage est descendu en dessous de 5%, avec des differences entre etats pauvres (7%) et plus aises (4%). Le deficit federal est descendu au plus bas. La dette feredale est totalement gerable.

Je viens de decrire les... Etats Unis. La solidarite entre etats est appliquee concretement, non pas par des transferts directs, mais par des administration federales qui payent des salaires tres decents a leurs employes. Un employe de la BLM ou des NPs dans le Wyoming va etre paye avec de l'argent federal. Meme chose pour les postiers, les agents des impots, gestion de la retraite, militaires, autorites federales. Ils vont embaucher un jardinier, consommer sur place. Meme chose pour les grands travaux. Finances au niveau federal, depenses en local.

However he hasn't written 1,000 pages in order for his analysis to glance off the surface of society. He has objectives and sets out his table on why, for instance, the UK is better in Europe (I think his opinion changed before the referendum).

Early reforms, especially land reforms, helped alleviate the worst of this during the years of communist rule. However, the famines of the late 1930s and shortages during WWII essentially wiped out any progress in standards of living that had been obtained. By the time the communist regime fell in 1945 to be replaced by the nationalists, the country was as unequal as ever, although the winners and losers had changed. 

During the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, massive economic growth and new social programs had significantly reduced poverty and inequality in Chackonia, particularly in urban areas. Furthermore, the oil boom of the 1970s brought new wealth to previously neglected rural areas in the north. By the time of the civil war, Chackonian society was economically less unequal than ever before. The war wiped out much of the gains made, unfortunately, and postwar the country struggled with vast chasms between the rich and the poor. 

Today, the country has a small but strong middle class, and a larger working-class population centered around the cities. Many rural areas and regions heavily devastated by the war remain deeply entrenched in poverty, however. Most of the rich are centered around the capital, Deckerton.

&gt; Rokia Traoré (born 24th January 1974) is an award-winning Malian singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

&gt; Traoré was born in Kolokani, Mali as a member of the Bambara ethnic group. As her father was a diplomat, she travelled widely in her youth travelling to Algeria, Saudi Arabia, France and Belgium. As a result of this travel, she was exposed to a wide variety of influences.

&gt; The Bambara also had a tradition of griot performing at weddings although members of the nobility such as Traoré are discouraged from performing as musicians. Traoré attended lycée in Mali when her father was stationed in Brussels and started performing publicly.  As well as guitar she plays ngoni (lute) and balafon.

&gt; In 1997 she linked with Mali musician Ali Farka Touré which raised her profile. She won a Radio France Internationale prize as African discovery of 1997, an honor previously won by Mali's Habib Koité in 1993. 
Her first album Mouneïssa (Label Bleu), released in late 1997 in Mali and 1998 in Europe, was acclaimed for its fresh treatment and unqualifiable combinations of several Malian music traditions such as her use of the ngoni and the balafon. It sold over 40,000 copies in Europe.

&gt; In 2000, her second album Wanita was released. Traoré wrote and arranged the whole album. The album was widely acclaimed with the New York Times nominating it as one of its critics' albums of the year.

&gt; Her 2003 album Bowmboï has two tracks recorded with the Kronos Quartet but still sung in the Bambara language, and was awarded the prestigious BBC 3 World Music Award. As of 2005, she has been nominated three times for this award.

&gt; In 2008, her latest album ""Tchamantché"" was released.

&gt; ADDITIONAL READING:
Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Rokia Traoré’s Beautiful Africa will be released on April 1, 2013, by Nonesuch Records in France and April 8, 2013 in Europe, Canada and USA. The record was produced by English musician John Parish (PJ Harvey, Eels, Sparklehorse) and recorded at Toybox Studios in Bristol, UK. Its lyrics are sung in the Malian–born Traoré’s native languages of French and Bambara, as well as some English.

&gt; Pitchfork described Traoré’s most recent record, 2009’s Tchamantché, as “a guitar album of a particularly understated bent...hauntingly spare yet ridiculously well-defined, the timbre and tone of every string presented in perfect resolution.” And the BBC World Service called it “One of the best albums of the year. An absolute stunner.” Tchamantché also won a Victoires de la Musique (the equivalent of a Grammy Award in France) and a Songlines Artist of the Year Award for Traoré.

&gt; The daughter of a Malian diplomat who was posted to the US, Europe, and the Middle East, Traoré studied sociology in Brussels before embarking on her musical career. Although based in Bamako, Traoré has, for her son’s safety, temporarily relocated to Paris due to the current conflict in Mali. Her music draws upon her homeland’s traditions as well as the European and American rock and pop she has listened to throughout her life.

&gt; Traoré has explored a breadth of directions in her career. She recently collaborated with Nobel Prize–winning novelist Toni Morrison and MacArthur “Genius” Grant winning director Peter Sellars on the theater piece Desdemona. The piece premiered in Vienna in the summer of 2011 and received its New York premiere at Lincoln Center that fall; its UK premiere was at the Barbican in London in the summer of 2012. The Guardian called it “a remarkable, challenging and bravely original new work.”

&gt; The Barbican also produced a three-night series of shows by Traoré that summer, entitled Donguili – Donke – Damou (Sing – Dance – Dream). For the Sing evening, held at the Barbican, Traoré and mandolinist/former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones joined young musicians from Traoré’s training program in Mali, Foundation Passerelle. Dance, at the Village Underground rock club, featured Traoré and her band playing the high-energy, danceable shows she is well known for—joined by Parish on guitar. And for Dream, which took place in an East End theater, Traoré narrated an ancient Malian tale, with occasional musical interludes. Australia’s Sydney Festival also presented Donguili – Donke – Damou in January 2013. Traoré was awarded the inaugural Roskilde Festival World Music Award in 2009 for her work with Foundation Passerelle.

&gt; In the autumn of 2012, Traoré joined Damon Albarn’s UK train tour Africa Express, performing scheduled concerts in Middlesbrough, Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff, Bristol, and London as well as pop-up performances at railway stations, schools, factories, offices, shopping centers, and private homes. Other musicians on the tour included John Paul Jones, Amadou Bagayoko, Baaba Maal, and Paul McCartney. Read more on Last.fm.

We are definitively, institutionally bi-cultural, we do not have the same institutionalized poly-cultural outlook. If somebody is saying that New Zealand is a Western country then they are actively engaging in a colonial act, marginalizing the bi-cultural foundations of this nation, which are the very foundations that allowed Europeans to settle here en-masse in the first place.

Both of these books are ideological propaganda in opposition to each other. 

The references to real history as opposed to mythology as in Tolkien are another tactic Martin uses. LOTR uses a romantic depiction of European history to symbolize virtuous ideals. He's saying this is the kind of world we can ""go back to"" if we're good enough. Martin's grim realism is meant to make us question that proposition, he shows the past as a nightmare to be terrified of, and traditional ideals like patriarchy or hierarchical authority as the source only of pain, not of beauty as in Tolkien.

&gt;The dignity of man is inviolable even in the digital age.

As far as I know, this is redundant based on existing EU material.

&gt;It must be the aim and purpose of all technical development and limit their use.

I'm still a little fuzzy on the precise extent of what ""the dignity of man"" is, but that seems over-restrictive.

&gt; New dangers of human dignity emerge in the digital age, in particular by means of big data, artificial intelligence, prediction and control of human behavior, mass monitoring, the use of algorithms, robotics and man-machine fusion as well as power concentration in private companies.

I'd suggest that documents like this should seek to be timeless insofar as is possible.  I'd eliminate specific technologies where possible.

I'm personally not enthusiastic about the criticism of companies -- as far as I know, this is not the norm for existing EU documents.

&gt; The rights under this Charter apply to governmental bodies and private individuals. 

I don't understand what this means.  Does this means that the rights do not apply to NGOs like Greenpeace or to companies?  Do they apply to foreign government bodies?  What is the jurisdiction here -- do these claim to apply to, say, German companies dealing with private Chinese citizens?  Chinese companies dealing with German citizens?

&gt; Everyone has a right to free information and communication. 

I don't understand what this means.  May be the English translation, but is this *libre* or *gratis*?  Is this a [positive right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights) guaranteeing government-funded Internet service (and access to any *future* information services, without fee, like academic publications?)  How does this interact with existing restrictions on, say, hate speech or copyright?

&gt;It includes the right to non-knowledge.

I don't know what this means.  How can I make the call to not know about something if I don't know what it is?  Does this mean that, for example, it is guaranteed that a government permit a four-year-old me to sign away my right to access to knowledge on various subjects for a candy?

&gt; Everyone has the right to an equal participation in the digital sphere.

Is this a positive right, where government must subsidize to smooth out economic differences?  If someone lives in French Guiana, are they required to have the same throughput available for the same price as someone living in Berlin?

How does this interact with existing hate speech regulation?

&gt; The use of automated procedures must not lead to the exclusion of people from access to goods, services or participation in social life. This applies in particular to health, protection from elementary life risks, right to work, right to housing, right to freedom of movement, and to the judiciary and the police. 

I assume that this is aimed at reassurance for people whose jobs are threatened by automation.  It might be desirable to *control* that rate, but I don't think that people should be guaranteed that the state or companies prevent jobs from being automated at all, or it may seriously hamper Europe's ability to economically-compete.

&gt; (1) In the digital age, internal and external security is threatened in a new way. In the exercise of the responsibility for the protection of the state, strict legal limits must be observed.

Seems redundant -- this is just saying ""laws must be followed"", yes?  Surely that would already have been the case.

&gt; (2) Security authorities shall not access private data. Exceptions are only permissible on the legal basis for the protection of particularly important legal goods.

I've never liked loopholes like this that might obsolete the guarantee entirely, but from what I've read of constitutions and similar documents in Europe, this kind of ""soft"" guarantee is a lot more common over there, so this may just be a difference in approach.

&gt; (3) Massless monitoring is not carried out.

The translation is bad here.  I don't know whether this is ""baseless"" monitoring (as in, monitoring without a warrant) or ""electronic"" monitoring.  The former *might* be viable, but seems excessively-broad -- for example, that would seem to ban, say, traffic cameras.  The latter seems too broad.

&gt; (4) Weapon systems may not be fully automated.

I would be more-specific.  For example, does an ""on/off"" switch suffice?  Does someone have to take action at every point in time?  Do the rules change when at war?  What about defensive systems?  I can understand establishing certain ""lines"" that everyone can agree on, like standardizing the degree to which long-range missile systems require human authorization.  I am a lot less-sanguine about placing restrictions on point-defense systems like [Phalanx CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS), [Tunguska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K22_Tunguska), [DS30M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30mm_DS30M_Mark_2_Automated_Small_Calibre_Gun), [Meroka CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroka_CIWS), [Goalkeeper CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS), [GDM-008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall_Oerlikon_Millennium_Gun), and similar.

My belief here is that the goal is to avoid unbounded automated escalation.  For example, a small glitch causes a robot to act, which causes a larger counter-reaction, which causes a larger counter-reaction, and so forth, and within the hour, a nuclear World War III is underway, with limited human involvement.  I think that this is a technically-complex task that would be better served by an international, UN-level treaty.

* First, the action taken here should be bilateral between potential opponents, not unilateral, since the main incentive to do this is that one's opponent might also do it.

* Second, this is of limited value in avoiding automated escalation unless both sides coordinate specifically how to avoid escalation, draw specific lines.

* Third, it may make more sense to agree on bans on weapons that take effect and *require* very fast reactions in response, like use of laser weapons.  It may make sense to require that automated response may not exceed weapons that give a particular range or a particular destructive power.  It may make sense to require actors to describe in response what they would consider an action requiring automated escalation (e.g. ""any projectiles traveling towards this ship at more than X speed and reaching Y range may permit for an automated response"").

Basically, I don't think that a document on civil rights guarantees, where being unilateral is fine, is a good place for commitments on weapons.

&gt; Everyone has the right to freely express his opinion in the digital world. A censorship does not take place.

I like the idea.  I'm going to be honest -- a document on digital rights is almost certainly *not* the place to change European policy on hate or political speech.  There is no reason to tie this to electronic communication.  If Europe wants to say ""you are guaranteed the right to advocate for communism"", it makes no sense for that to be online only.  Further, I don't think that that right should be bundled up with a lot of these other things -- it's too important.  If the EU wants a Declaration of Freedom of Speech, let that stand on its own.  It's not just keeping up with technological change.

&gt; (2) Digital incitement, bullying and activities which are likely to seriously jeopardize a person's reputation or integrity shall be prevented.

This -- in particular the ""jeopardize a person's reputation"" -- is almost *certainly* more-restrictive than the current state of affairs.  I'm not enthusiastic about that, and I'd suggest that people carefully consider the consequences.  Does accusing a corrupt politician of corruption jeopardize his reputation?

&gt; (3) A plural public discourse space is to be ensured.

Sounds grand, but not concrete.  What does this actually wind up meaning?  Can private forums be moderated, for example?

&gt; (4) Public bodies and operators of information and communication services are obliged to ensure compliance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.

I don't know if the EU has US-style [common carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier) status, but normally in the US, telcos can simply disclaim responsibility for the specifics of communications unless they are made aware of an issue.  That is, they have no obligation to actively-monitor for these.  I think that if this is not the case, it may place a heavy burden on telecommunication operators -- it is not clear to me whether this is compatible with such a status.

&gt; Profiling by government agencies or private is only permitted on a legal basis.

I don't understand the point of this.  Surely it was already the case that laws needed to be followed?

EDIT: Maybe this is a politically-acceptable way to sneak in an explicit guarantee that profiling is explicitly allowed?

(think Earth from the European perspective in the 19th century, Borg and Dominion are like Australia and Asia, far away, and you're still more immediately concerned with other European powers, but you can get there if you need to with a bit of time, whereas in Voyager, the gamma quadrant was more like being stuck on Mars in the 20th century. Beta quadrant is like the Americas)

Transporters would be more integrated, more casual. You don't go to a transporter room, you just have the computer do a site to site transport. (maybe some areas are only accessible via transporter) 

The computer should be a true AI at that point. If we want to go that way, it could have holographic representation throughout the ship. It should still lack somewhat in originality and the ability to go on away missions.

With a computer like that the crew could be somewhat small. Could have a crew of 20-50 man a ship the size of the Enterprise-D. (you wouldn't have to, but it's a possibility) Maybe just whatever you decide the main cast needs to be.

Replicators and transporters should happen more quickly. Transporters should have better range and precision, but still wouldn't be able to beam through shields (which had also advanced) or disruption fields.

I'd like them to have replicator medicine, transporter medicine. (Are you injured? No problem, we'll just have the computer whip you up a new body from your last transporter log), those could even be subverted in some of the plots (what if someone alters the log so when you are reconstructed for some reason, the new version of you is loyal to him?)

Weapons should be more precise and have longer range. I don't have specific ideas but it's something that would be fun to work out. The important piece is that defensive tech would have kept up, so there is still a balance.

But it's perfectly reasonable to compare Western developed democratic countries, it's something that we've been doing for decades. As a Brit, it's fine to criticize American foreign or domestic policy because you don't think it fits its democratic ideals. Democracy goes further than just our civic rights, and we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard and speak out when we believe someone is not abiding by that standard. 

I've always personally been against Germany banning people from denying the holocaust. I think doing so is disgusting and outright stupid, but I also don't agree with the government interfering with your basic rights. There are Germans who would disagree with Americans being allowed to fly the Confederate flag, or wear a KKK hood. 

I do think it's completely undemocratic to ban the burqa and that's why I'm stating my point that I don't see such a ban flying in the states. I also don't see this ban flying in Canada (even though there has been attempts).  I am criticizing the Dutch government for pursuing such a ban because yes I think it's okay for me to believe that they should be held to a higher standard because of the fact that they are a democratic Western developed nation. If you want to start banning certain freedoms of expression, and religion, and culture by all means pursue that. It's your right as a European citizen to begin that shift to the right.

Second:
I have a friend who does statistical investigations on various WoW things for fun because he's a huge math nerd, and it turns out most players do not get that far.

Getting level 885 gear requires either mythic kills on raids, Mythic +9 or +10 kills, or very good luck on legendaries/titanforged gear. There have been a bit over 10,000 groups that have killed Mythic Nythendra even once. That's not many. Multiply by 20 and that's 200,000 characters -- out of 1.5 million players -- that have killed Mythic Nythendra. Now, killing a mythic boss does not give you 885 level gear immediately and you care about people who can farm early mythics, not just who got a kill that one time. In other words, people likely to have 885 gear are the people who are around 4/7 Mythic and can farm the first half of Emerald Nightmare.

Now, who's at 4/7 Mythic? 4700 groups. That's well under 10% of the playerbase. Now you have to account for who has it on farm and farms regularly.

9/10 people do not have a very reliable source of high level gear from raids. So, 10% at absolute best, now add in some people who are somehow not raiding but still doing constant farms of high level mythics...let's be generous and tack on an extra 5%.

15%. That's it. Now decrease this by the number of people at any given moment who aren't doing something else, like raiding or dungeons or old content or just aren't even online.

And frankly, if you need 885+ in your group, unless you're doing double digit mythic+ for multiple chests and stuff, you're wrong, elitist, or wanting things to be overgeared so you don't have to try."

Ik was benieuwd waar de richtlijn nu werkelijk om gaat, de FAQ van de EU zelf vat het geloof ik aardig samen: [Payment Services Directive: frequently asked questions](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-5793_en.htm?locale=en)

(Heel) kort samengevat lijkt men met deze richtlijn het 'monopolie' van banken op betaaldiensten enigzins te willen verruimen (ruimte maken voor innovatie), alsmede bestaande gerelateerde diensten te reguleren.



Hiertoe introduceert men twee nieuwe entiteiten:

1.

&gt; **account information services - AIS** These services will typically allow consumers to have a global view on their financial situation and to analyse their spending patterns, expenses, financial needs in a user-friendly manner.

Ofwel, bijvoorbeeld online huishoudboekjes, die nu compleet niet gereguleerd zijn en waar je *zelf* je informatie moet invullen/uploaden.

2.

&gt; Other third party providers facilitate the use of online banking to make internet payments (so-called ""**payment initiation services - PIS**""). They help to initiate a payment from the user account to the merchant account by creating a software “bridge” between these account

Dit lijkt een soort iDeal-achtige services te behelzen, alleen dan opgezet door partijen anders dan de banken zelf. Ik kan me voorstellen hier in veel EU landen vraag naar is, in Nederland hebben de banken het wel aardig voor elkaar met iDeal geloof ik, lastig om daarop te concurreren.


*Maar misschien nog belangrijker:* het artikel lijkt te willen suggereren dat banken je gegevens 'zomaar' kunnen doorverkopen. Dit is klinkklare onzin:

&gt; Those offering payment instruments or payment initiation services will only be able to receive information from the payer's bank on the availability of funds (a yes/no answer) on the account before initiating the payment (**with the explicit consent of the payer**).

En:

&gt; Account information service providers will receive the information **explicitly consented by the payer** and only to the extent they are necessary for the service provided to the payer.

Er zullen altijd partijen zijn die rijker willen worden van je transactiegegevens, maar  gezien de safeguards zie ik het verschil niet helemaal tussen PSD2 en als je *op dit moment* besluit je bankgegevens te uploaden bij een online kasboek."

While checking off one of the newer items, she is reminded of the *one* checkbox of the original 100 that has not been checked yet and decides it's about time to fix that. The item in question? ""Go on a date and acquire first kiss"". She doesn't want to go on an actual date, though, just the formal justification to mark the item off. And so she decides to ask one of her friends on a fake date, designed as an experiment, hoping that it might end on a not too awkward peck on the lips or whatever. But when the choice falls on Rainbow Dash and she takes her aside to explain about her new science project, Rainbow immediately zones out.

Eu nem falei em ofensivo. O vestuário não me ofende. Simplesmente considero que tem consequências nefastas, como expliquei.

Ao que referi nesse comentário acrescentei mais noutro, que pode ajudar a compreender a minha posição. Citando-me a mim próprio:


&gt; Nota que nem afeta só as relações extra comunidade mas mesmo intra. Supõe que alguém começa a ter dúvidas sobre a sua fé. Com essas dúvidas continua a usar a Quipá? Mas tirá-la num meio onde todos a usam e onde a usou durante anos vai dar nas vistas. E a reação da sua comunidade?

&gt; Este fanatismo religioso (sim é fanatismo, imagina alguém que todos os dias veste camisola do PSD... é fanatismo), tem sérias consequências sociais.

&gt; Há aqui um elemento de profunda lavagem cerebral, e de imposição identitária em volta da religião, e mesmo de uma espécie de fascismo no sentido da vigilância comunitária.

Many of the left don't think all of the right are idiots. But they perhaps feel that they are easily to manipulate and con. They may feel that the fact many on the right are against climate change and anti-vax make it seem that many on the right are against facts. I've know many Republicans who are great people and will speak there mind but this election seem to overshadow some of them. 

America culture is already first. It's even 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. I've been on the other side of the world and our culture is there. From Eastern Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, Middle East. 

I'm independent and I always enjoy hearing what Republicans have to say on certain issues. I believe America works best with both parties have solid viewpoints.

That may have been the case in 1900. But you sold out. First off the MENA refugees with a much higher fertility rate will simply out breed you.

Secondly you sold your country to us voluntarily in exchange for trinkets. 60% of the FTSE 100 is owned by foreigners by currently 90% of your electricity generation capacity is owned by foreigners too.

Last week Skyscanner was bought too. A few months ago as was ARM via a Japanese company. These are all voluntary and nobody forced you. You made your choices. You sold out your nation so it belongs to us now. You can rent it back from us of course.



&gt; China is a massive place though. Britain isn't, so it expected there would be more famine there.

Fine we'll compare Europe then. 10million vs 9.8million sqkm. in 1000 years about 50 famines. Vs 1000.

&gt; Well clearly you're not a smarter people then are you?

It was a natural selection event. 
 

&gt; No I don't know so much about Chinese history, what I do know is that Britain stood above everyone else. So saying we're stupider than you is silly. 

By stealing and enslavement. Something terrible called the Empire.

&gt;You can't expect me to allow you excuses when you're not allowing jobseekers any. You should've stopped eating rice.

Rice is only eaten by about 25% of Chinese. Only a small % of the land can grow rice. Most eat wheat.

&gt;, but I doubt any other nation would've done differently were they to have the power we had.
 
See Ming China. They could move 20,000 men around easily the Europeans could only move around on tiny galleons with less than a 100 people. Yet did we go on an empire building spree? Nope.
 
&gt; Well, that's where your history is rusty. Columbus didn't kill anyone and never even set foot in North America. 

All those who came after did though.

&gt;And the British intentionally genocide the Native Americans, it was disease that killed most.

I'm not talking about that. There are a great number of crimes you cover up and think are OK.

In the last 100 years.

Kenya had massive death camps where 1.5million people were worked to death. Auschwitz style. This was in the 1950s
In the 1960s 500,000 Chinese were detained and worked to death in Malaya
In 1943 Bengal had a moderate famine. Churchill (which the British voted as a hero a few years ago for his genocidal tendancies) diverted grain away from that area exacerbating the famine. 3 million dead. 


&gt;     Just look at the rape and murder in Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You're right, but we're only guilty because we're the only ones capable of being guilty, most other nations don't have the power to wreak that kind of destruction. 

Many did and do have the power. I go back again to Zheng He the ability to land 20,000 troops 6000 miles from home in 1400 was a super power. Did they do this? No they did not.

&gt;China itself killed millions of its own people and Russia destroyed Afghanistan and much of the middle east. And China, I'd argue, had it not been for Communism China would probably have passed Britain long ago.


&gt; That's the problem of being over civilized. I believe deep down our nation has reached or will soon its end point; radical individualism. You can already see it happening. We've opened pandora's box with it, and we're using it to destroy ourselves. Greed, the idea that you're a special snowflake and your opinions are the Truth™, blatent treason, not looking after your family... These things will unravel the fabric of our society and we'll be taken over by a culture that isn't like that, which people can call their's.

Yes you will be Islamic. 

&gt; It may be true, but then why has Japan succeeded where China hasn't? China is an example of the popposite of our dilema of individualism: confuscism, which completely disregards the individual and encourages blind obedience, which isn't good either.

How has Japan succeeded? They're at 400% GDP to debt. They have a shrinking population. Everything great you attribute to Japan technology wise has occurred in the PRC as well. They aren't food self sufficient and you only praise them because they've been under military occupation for the past 70 years.

Go look at the Okinawa military base and how the military personnel and those attached to them have a rape rate exceeeding 1600 per 100,000.

Some people could very well vote for her telling themselves a referendum wouldn't pass - cf your 70% poll - and whether it's a wise decision or not wouldn't change their votes.        

As for being right wing, Le Pen is in term of immigration and nationalism, but she's center-left on economic issues, while Fillon has some very liberal propositions on his program that are considered right wing by many frenchmens.
People on the left could very well vote Le Pen or refuse to vote Fillon rather than see a privatisation of the healthcare system, for example.

Egyptians weren't white. They likely weren't sub-Saharan African black either. They ranged in skin tones as reflected the immigration and emigration customs of the region over the thousands of years. http://observationdeck.kinja.com/no-egyptians-arent-white-but-they-arent-black-eithe-1665322870

Ancient Greece which held most of what we currently think of as Ancient Greece was present AFTER much of Ancient Egypt. The Old Kingdom dates back to approximately 3000 BC whereas the earliest recordings from Ancient Greece date back to 1200.

The Pyramids were built during this time around 2500 BC.

The Parthenon was only built around 500 BC. 2000 years later.

This is to say nothing of China who has recorded history dating back 2100 BC and the Xia dynasty. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China?wprov=sfla1

Let's not forget that the two oldest civilization aside from Egypt are Mesopotamia and the [Indus River Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation?wprov=sfla1) civilizations dating back to 3-4 millennia before Christ.

There is virtually no written record in most of Europe before the Romans arrived, and they eventually fled because most of Europe was too chaotic and splintered for them to effectively manage.

You could argue ""but that just shows white people did so much more in such little time"". Except they didn't.

We White people took knowledge from other groups and consolidated it. Arabs and Indians created much of our modern mathwork (we use the Arabic number system not Roman Numerals), China created gunpowder, the Middle Eastern Sumer were the first to forge metal (Bronze 4000 BC), we didn't even come up with our own religion.

""But Rome-""

Let me stop you there, Rome wasn't founded by white people. White people as we know today were seen as Barbarians and deeply mistrusted within Rome. Africans could gain Roman citizenship and political power with greater ease. Arabs made up a significant portion of the Roman population. And you can hardly call the deeply tanned people of the Mediterranean (Greeks and Romans) white, they are to white people what Indians are to Asian people. http://www.cracked.com/article_20536_5-ridiculous-lies-you-believe-about-ancient-civilizations.html"

The indiana factories wouldn't be a thing until 1738.

&gt; That shit needed a shit-ton of money for the infraestructure, as it needed a lot of water. The Meseta wasn't very suitable geographically, but Catalonia was. So much wealth invested and generated in return that would have been lost. Basically all of Spain had their money invested in a single region, for the most part.

Again, I'm gonna need a source on that. I'm pretty sure that the banking institutions that made the raising of capitals for the Catalan industrialisation possible, like the Bank of Barcelona or the Catalan General Society of Credit, were created by locals. Also, [here's a list of all of Catalonia's industrial colonies](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llista_de_col%C3%B2nies_t%C3%A8xtils_de_Catalunya). Please, try to find one that wasn't founded by Catalans.

&gt; It's funny when some independentists say that Spain or ""Madrid"" is just a leech, when historically we've been actually fightning to death for Catalan interests. When we lost Cuba we actually had an economic boom because the Catalan bourgeoisie came back and we boomed like hell - they couldn't have been in the colonies in the first place if the rulers didn't want to.

The loss of the Cuban market was a relative hit, actually, just much smaller than expected. The economic boom at the beginning of the XXth century is posterior and was the result of the other European countries having to import goods because they were fighting WWI, which in fact benefited factory owners but harmed the workers because of the resulting inflation.

&gt; Catalonia is today what it is thanks to Spain and Spain is today what it is thanks, in part, to Catalonia. It's been a mutual benefit.

See, the lack of an ""in part"" in your first phrase irks me. A big part of Catalonia's modernisation should actually be attributed to foreigners who settled here and introduced new technologies in the fields of energy, transportation, etc. In general, in your post there's a clear subtext of Catalans not being really able to do much by ourselves.

Food banks didn't really exist before Cameron so this is a bit off.

&gt; and a record low in first time buyers is the only break on a run away housing sector price.

I note that for much of the 20th century the majority of the population rented, in 1918 it was 77% of the population so your record low for first time buyers is bollocks.

I'm not really one to judge what the optimum proportion of owner occupiers to renters is, I note that in [Europe(figure 2)](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Housing_statistics) there is a range of proportions, it could be as a function of land prices or demand or anything, but I haven't read enough of the literature on the subject to comment on the subtleties.

&gt; Work remains an important foundation of life support and self-realization.

Not specific to the digital world.

&gt; Effective employment protection must be ensured in the digital age.

All right, this is a contemporary issue.  It seems to me that this warrants its own document too, and this is *exceedingly* vague on a critical issue -- it's hard to know whether to buy into this.  It could range from requiring employers to put money in escrow to spend $N on retraining if the industry fails to having the government keep defunct industries alive just to make work available, which could be fantastically-expensive.

I do not think that this is a solved problem.  I was reading about how US federally-funded retraining was not very successful a while back.

I think that it would make more sense to, rather than start guaranteeing rights, to instead fund an organization with the target of ensuring that unemployment/underemployment above a certain age falls below a certain level and to deal with automation or shift in demand.  I do not think that there are good policy answers yet.

Further, I would encourage that any policies enacted at the level of the European Single Market.  Because the EU is a single market, if one member enacts one sort of protection (e.g. subsidizing auto factories that make heavy use of manual labor), and another does not, this creates a wildly-uneven playing field.

I would also point out that while this is a concern, at the moment, my understanding is that youth unemployment is much higher in many members, and may take precedence.

&gt; Rights holders are entitled to a fair share of the proceeds from the digital use of their intangible assets. These rights must be balanced with non-commercial use interests. 

Too vague.  What is ""fair""?  Who, in the absence of this text, would have advocated for an ""unfair share"" to be allocated?  Where is this balance to be struck?  Who strikes it?  I mean, great, nice-sounding principle, but are you granting authority to the EU to make this call on balance, shifting authority from member states?  If not, it's not clear to me what the function of this item is -- it doesn't seem to have any actual function.

&gt; (1) The interpretation of the rights contained in this Charter is ultimately the responsibility of the European Court of Justice.

Ah, see, I should have read this first -- should have been up front, since it's critical to understanding the purpose of the document.

Okay, so the point of this document is basically, ""we want to move member state authority on many things to the EU level"".

I agree with some of the moves to the EU authority level.  I think that it is extremely dubious that the ECJ is the appropriate body for this, though it *might* be the right body to make calls about legislation written to implement some of these goals.  Why the ECJ and not the EP, say?  I mean, these are so vague that there must be masses and masses of concrete rules made, and the ECJ's goal is to clarify legislation, not to write it, yes?

My friends found it cheaper to do this type of education on a side during a trip to Europe.

I'm not going to elaborate the importance of true ecological education for the populations of the large cities. To me (and many other) it is obvious that the kids will learn the true cycle of nature: how the cow's shit becomes a natural fertilizer in a vegetable garden  etc.

How many kids will be kept of of prison? No idea.

There have been multiple studies conducted on this. For instance, [The Economist conducted a study on integrating refugees](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21688938-europes-new-arrivals-will-probably-dent-public-finances-not-wages-good-or). Apparently, in an advanced economy like Germany, only welfare would be slightly depressed, and that won't even last that long. Continuing on with refugees, others have pointed out that actually, [investing one Euro into a refugee is likely to gain two back within five years](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55462dd8e4b0a65de4f3a087/t/573cb9e8ab48de57372771e6/1463597545986/Tent-Open-Refugees+Work_VFINAL-singlepages.pdf), although it's worth pointing out that once again, this is more in Germany's case. 

&gt;Someone in that position would say 'well if there wasn't such unchecked free immigration, Disney wouldn't have the option to hire some Indian kid for half my salary'. Is that person wrong?

Unfortunately, yes they are, because the issue isn't the immigrant, it's the fact that the corporation can get away with paying an immigrant a lower wage. 

&gt;The sexual assaults at public pools in Europe

I haven't seen anything that indicates that the rate of sexual assaults is higher from immigrants. In fact, I find the notion that immigrants are more likely to assault people to be very strange, because a lot of immigrants probably spent a lot of time and money to immigrate in the first place. Why on earth would they suddenly throw away their chance at a new life? Anyway, if there was a study proving this, please point it out to me.

&gt;the push to legitimize sharia law in parts of the UK

There's a big difference between setting up Sharia ***courts*** and actual full-blown Sharia Law. Besides, these courts don't even have any legal power - they're all ***advisory*** and don't take precedence before British law.

Even if they actually were setting up Sharia Law, keep in mind [the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams himself said that British culture is compatible with parts of Sharia Law](http://rowanwilliams.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/1135/sharia-law-what-did-the-archbishop-actually-say).

&gt;If you take people from a country where there is no such thing as rape of a wife by a husband, and it's considered perfectly fine to kill a woman who has premarital sex to preserve family honor, it might take longer than 15 minutes for them to fit into Western society, no?

You do realize that most immigrants understand there are going to be cultural differences between what is accepted and what isn't in their new country, correct? I'm well aware that there is [a large amount of Islamic Fundamentalism in Europe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2013/12/13/how-widespread-is-islamic-fundamentalism-in-western-europe/?utm_term=.15f16cdac941), but also keep in mind that the same report mentioned in the link stresses that religiously-motivated violence - including misogynistic violence - is not necessarily linked. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that 27% of Europeans also thought [that rape is acceptable under certain circumstances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/29/27-of-europeans-think-rape-may-be-acceptable-in-some-circumstances/?utm_term=.114e0d613d9b). So, with all due respect, I find it hypocritical to see you complain that immigrants can't control themselves when you completely ignore studies like that.

&gt;Take the sexual assaults- when that started, the right blew it up as proof that all immigrants are terrible, and the left tried to sweep it under the carpet

I have yet to find a single left-leaning individual who claims that the assaults never happened."

I obviously agree with you on Gay marriage, armed service, trying to sexually reprogram kids to be straight, conversion therapy, etc... But so do most republicans I've met. Nearly all conservatives have put these things are in the past, just as the democratic party has put the KKK in the past. Sure, conservatives 20 or 30 years ago would be weird about me being gay, but this has changed.



I've been to many high profile right wing events in the United States and Europe, and have found (especially in Europe) that people on the right aren't homophobic at all, but the media portrays them as such.



More interesting is that many gays seem to want socialism and economic interventionism. You can be perfectly socially liberal on issues surrounding homosexuality without demanding that the state raise taxes, redistribute money, etc...


Also I am conservative because Im deeply worried about less tolerant groups like Muslims who attack gays- France has seen a 78% rise in hate crimes against gays - especially gays in the Arab or Berber communities. "

I think that this is basically too-vague in its form to be actionable for companies and individuals.  I simply cannot know whether something I am doing will violate it or not.

If I understand correctly, the goal here is to shift authority from member country level to EU level.  I agree with this in at least some cases.

I think that a legislature probably has to hash out the details before something like this enters into force.  These are so broad and overarching that it's nearly-impossible for a company to know whether its actions might run afoul of it.

I do not think that tying together the grant of authority and the specific guarantees is the best way to do this -- it hands an immense wad of power to the ECJ and creates huge uncertainty, if I understand this correctly.  In the US, if you wanted to move something from state to federal level, someone would propose a Constitutional amendment.  Three-quarters of the state legislatures would need to agree.  At that point, the amendment comes into force, and the states cede control over the item to the federal government.  It would *probably* say something like ""The federal legislature shall have the authority to pass laws on this issue"", rather than detailing all the fine points itself -- that is, the grant of power would be independent from the legislation in question.  *Then* the legislature would create the laws (which would be specific-enough to be something that one could take action on).  You could look at, say, the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), which federalized authority, and the separate [Volstead Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volstead_Act), which used that authority to establish the precise rules.

It may be that I am unfamiliar with the EU's processes here, and that there is some other mechanism involved or some reason why this is not necessary.

What it *seems* to me is the case, though, is that the idea is to let members retain legislative authority in the area, but then to let the ECJ push them back into line if it thinks that they have crossed the boundaries.

However, it seems to me that this three-stage process makes more sense:

1. Member states agree to move authority over an item to the EU level.  They still will retain input on the item, but only as a member -- they won't have absolute control over it within their borders.

2. The EP uses that authority to establish new laws.

3. These laws may be evaluated by the ECJ.

Again, this may just be due to a misunderstanding of EU process on my part...but if my understanding is correct, it really does seem like having a tight, understandable set of expectations for companies and non-commercial organizations and individuals in advance is much preferable to them having to guess whether-or-not an action is legitimate, take it, and maybe be whacked by the ECJ."

I was just pointing out that Egyptians were Caucasoids largely (although African elements did exist, but they were lower class citizens), and most would be genetically closer to Greeks than Saharan Africans just based on place of evolution. 

Except not. Heiroglyphs show that there was little race disparity between classes. If anything black people were often in the higher classes because they generally weren't immigrants and were the first to colonize the region.


&gt; I already knew this. When did I claim otherwise? 

You didn't. I was just pointing out that the older civilization was the non-""white"" civilization.


&gt; China is interesting, because while they did have somewhat of a empire, there levels of innovation and conquest never reached that of European and Middle Eastern empires. 

Yes, no, that's just untrue. Their levels of mass industry far exceeded anything that Europe had for centuries.

The Forbidden City was built incredibly fast and remains standing whereas European constructs from the same time period are destroyed or else are in very poor shape.



&gt; When did I claim that Middle Eastern and South Asian civilizations did nothing? Because I certainly don't remember doing that. 

You didn't. But the idea that White People are superior comes with the notion that Whites have created more than the other races. Which again is just plainly untrue 


&gt; And did nothing with it. 

The oldest record of gunpowder dates back to 142 AD. By 1040 there were already chemical recipes detailing the most explosive mixyures, implying it had long been weaponised at this point.

By 1115 China had mass-produced lightweight cannons which used a charge to launch a flurry of arrows.

The first record of gunpowder used in Europe was from Roger Bacon when more advanced versions of the Chinese arrow-cannons were used against Europeans at the Battle of Mohi in the 1320s. By that time the Mongols had already made relatively lightweight cannons.

They did a hell of a lot with it, which Europeans simply refined.


&gt; Okay? 

Again just showing that a non-white civilization was the first to smith metal. Something which wasn't done in Europe proper for millennia.


&gt; Have you never heard of European Paganism? 

You mean what is essentially the same religion that humans brought out of Africa, seeing as they used many of the same elements?


&gt; That's not really true. They're white, as they evolved in Europe, although Southern. 


Europe =/= White. That was the point of this entire thing. Socially and genetically Rome and Greece had more in Common with Northern Africans than they did with Germans or Vikings or Britons.

Lumping Northern European Barbarians with Sophisticated Southern Europeans is granted undue congratulations on Northerners who didn't do anything.

And it strips away the importance of civilizations such as those in the Middle East and Northern Africa which truly did have more of an impact and did exponentially more to further the human race than Northern Europeans did."

Then you look at the average Haitian IQ: 68. Compare that too the average Anglo-Saxon IQ of 102. That's a difference of 34 points on average. 

The difference between the average Haitian and the average Anglo-Saxon is still less than the difference between individual Anglo-Saxons. 

The thing is, that doesn't actually mean anything. All traits are placed on a bell curve. Nobody expects all people of one ethnicity to be the same. 

&gt; You claimed, among other things, ""Europeans, and Caucasians on the large, have historically been the people to accomplish the most."" If X is ""Accomplishing the most"", then you argued that Caucasians are superior at accomplishing things.

They're superior in someways. Maybe in ways that we value today. However unless God actually said one race was superior (as he is a all knowing being) then there is no objective way to judge overall superiority. 

In Africa a African is probably supreme, as it was the environment he was genetically adapted to succeed. Same with Europeans in European, and so on.

The 2 week with no tournaments played rule causing teams to be omitted from the power rankings can feel so inconsistent due to how these leagues work now.   
  
  
 I understand why it's there, it was the answer to teams never playing but staying at the top with no recent results. However, 2 weeks feels short to me. We have two of the best teams in North America  going to the finals  of the biggest tournament in our games history who are invisible on the power ranking right now. Sure it follows the rules currently in place, but I can't picture this situation happening in other big esports.    
  
  
 Imagine going into the world finals for LoL and TSM/ CLG are omitted from the power ranking read by millions, simply because they didn't play in the lesser tournaments 2 weeks prior to worlds. (While they are boot camping) Sure RL is not as big as LoL yet, but it's definitely bigger than it was when this rule came to be. Maybe the time has come where our scene is about to outgrow this rule we had in the past when ESL was the biggest calling.  
  
  
Perhaps there shouldn't be power rankings when RLCS is not happening. There could also be a break between the RLCS qualifiers and the world finals, where there is only one power ranking just before this tournament here in Amsterdam that is both EU and NA combined and they only consider the teams in contention. Then when the next RLCS circuit begins to start up, so does the power rankings again.   
  
  
I think it's still a growing period as the RLCS is a really short lived circuit, followed by a tournament where other esports have more strict and long lasting leagues that make a power ranking easier to gauge.     
  
  
So those are my thoughts, feel free to disagree or poke holes in them. Thanks for the hard work.  "

Percentiles are easy to understand, and I've used that system to run one-shots for people with no tabletop experience. A CoC campaign as either a one-shot palate cleanser or a quick arc would be pretty great, I think.

Most other common systems take too long to learn. Even L5R/7th Sea - my all time favorite system - takes a little while to get a handle on. It becomes much more robust and intuitive than D&amp;D after you get going, but you also do a lot of probability guestimation, which is less dramatic in audio form.

I do think 7th Sea would be phenomenal, especially since the system is built to reward big cool dramatic gestures of the kind that are great on podcasts. Yes D&amp;D can do that with inspiration, but it's much more central to the game in 7th Sea. The setting is also great and rewards history and European politics jokes. Like, Mother Russia is a living force of nature that actively murders anyone who attempts to invade, and it's fairly common for Russian nobles to be able to turn into bears.  

Shadowrun is my favorite setting, and (like White Wolf) pop culture references work in the context of the universe - It'd be totally normal to have someone's Shadowrun character be a former youtube cooking celebrity. I'm not suggesting they'd simply reincarnate their TAZ characters but those options are present in Shadowrun. Also I've played in like ten shadowrun campaigns and eight of those characters have been flip wizards. The newest version made that build less of a thing but I miss my amoral flip wizards so much. I once had to jump out of a speeding taxi while levitating and do a streetlamp swing/wall kick maneuver to slow down enough not to die, which saved my life but also caused me to become a meme and made it harder for me to go unrecognized. That kind of stuff is glorious. 

The problem is that Shadowrun's combat system is incredibly interesting but godawful to run. Just a mess. And min-maxed characters so easily dwarf ordinary characters in power. I only slightly optimized a character in my last campaign (I nerfed a popular build into the ground because it didn't match my RP sensibilities) and I still solved like half of our problems myself. Sure, I was a utility mage and utility mages are awesome in Shadowrun, but it also reflects how easy it is to make an ineffective character, and how underpowered default loadouts from the book are sometimes.

There are a lot of other great systems, but these are the ones I have the most experience with.

The battle was part of the Crimean War, and a contributory factor in bringing France and Great Britain into the conflict. This was the last major battle between fleets of sailing ships. 

&gt;The attack was seen by external powers as unjustified, as it was believed that Russia had no need to fear the Ottomans. It was referred to in the British press as the 'Massacre of Sinope', and caused a wave of anti-Russian sentiment in Western Europe.[10] The attack strengthened the pro-war factions in Britain and France, and provided them with the justification for a war to curb Russia bellicosity. Hawks in London pointed to Russian tactics as violating both the accepted articles of war and human morality. The shelling on Sinop Harbor and attacking ships of a lower class were both considered war crimes. Several doves attempted to stem the patriotic fervor, arguing that a global war with Russia over the Ottoman Empire was a waste of British talent and treasure. Lord Palmerston resigned over the affair and numerous anti-war articles ran in Paris and London. In the end however war hawks in the National Government won out and Sinop was seen as a just cause for war.

No I didn't, I acknowledge that throughout history most peoples have accomplished great things (other than Africans and arguably Amerindians). I just don't think they were in scale or frequency that Europeans did.  

 &gt; f we want to look at the really awesome shit happening right now in america? Try coming out here to Silicon Valley - it ain't just the white people making shit happen. The 5th largest economy in the world - California - is an economy that subsidizes half of white america and that is itself minority white.

And who works in silicon valley? Whites and Asians. That'd seem to fit my point about IQ fairly well, actually. 

 &gt; I simply do not agree that whites are being damaged or destroyed by people from other cultures. My life is unambiguously enriched by most of the people I know, and many of them are not white. The likelihood that my life is bettered by a person is thoroughly unrelated to their skin color.

Well, maybe you're a genetic outcast, but the vast majority of humanity has a biological in group preference. And that's not a bad thing: being more comfortable around people you are more similar to genetically makes a lot of sense. 

&gt; Are you actually suggesting that most non-white immigrants coming to this country are doing so on the agenda of anti-white global factions?

Not individuals, of course. They're coming for a better life. The reasons as to why they're being allowed to come here are very nefarious, though. 

 &gt; WTF is ""white culture""? I have a culture, I am white. My culture is way more similar to a chinese person in shanghai than it is to most white folk in Alabama.

Individualism. Delay of gratification. Conquest. All white culture. 

If you truly think you have more in common with the Chinese, than I suggest you move there. You'll see very quickly how similar you're. 

 &gt; Do you think that we don't have social conflict when we get rid of race?

No, we will still have conflict likely. Conflict seems natural to all species. 

 &gt; There is more genetic disparity between people within the same race very often than there is between people of different races.

I've debunked this a couple of times already.

2) You are utterly wrong on the reasoning. The book Guns, Germs and Steel tells you why but I'll give you the quick go through.  
For innovation two key things are needed resource and competition. In Africa there was competition but no excess of resource. In Asia there was resource but no competition. Though Africa was made up of many Kingdoms and tribes there was little extra limiting the people to what they could do. In Asia there was resource but there was one state (Chinese dynasties) who ruled over their own Empire like autocrats and the neighbouring states were all tributes to this one Empire. In Europe there was both excess of resource and competition between states, leading to thinks like the Italian Renaissance and other renaissances (Alfradian, Carolinian, etc.). This made Europe the hot bed for discovery and innovation in both the middle ancient and modern world. Nothing about Europeans innate. There is excess resource and competition around the European thus creates this not genetics.  
  
Africa could be better; it is European style farming that led to desertification of the north most part of sub Sahara. The Rwanda genocide would never have happened. Africa would eventually settle as a set of Confederates of (Nations/Tribes/Kingdoms) rather than nations of a mix of people drawn up in the Berlin Conference 1884/1885.  
  
Asia society would evolve over time in a way similar to Marx's view on history (which I agree with to some extent).  
  
The Middle East... The Middle East is in Asia, so much for this white supremacy.  
  
3) Your equation is wrong, (Diversity + Proximity) * Fucking Petty Retards = Conflict or in true Algebra (D+P) * F=C.  
  
Responding to your responses to others.  
  
&gt;Egyptians were Caucasoid largely  
  
False the Egyptians like any ancient Empire was ruled by a series of peoples, mostly Egyptians and Persians. The last native Pharaoh of Egypt was Pharaoh Senedjemibre Nakhthorhebyt (13th dynasty) whose rule ended in 343 BC. Egypt was then ruled by the Persians till 332 BC and then ruled by white Greeks from 332 BC till 30 BC when it was ceded to Rome. You are looking at a empire lasting nearly 3000 years and basing the information on the last few hundred.

ARK: Survivor’s Pack bundle

The game will come in a bundle; the ARK: Survivor’s Pack and can be purchased in both North America and Europe. The bundle contains ARK: Survival evolved (the base game) and the recently released ARK: Scorched Earth DLC. In addition, some special PS4-only content will be available: a Bionic Giganotosaurus Skin and an entire Manticore armor set for your character.

large-583ee96b0ee26_ps4manticorearmor-jpg-1d19536ea357346afb3c43dc35b08372

What will it cost?

Depending on where you live, the bundle will cost you $54,99 USD (in North America) or €49,99 (in Europe). In addition, you will be able to buy the game and expansion separately in Europe. This means that you can buy the base game for €34,99 and the Scorched Earth expansion for an additional €19,99.

Updates

Just like the PC and Xbox One versions of ARK: Survival Evolved, the PS4 players will be getting updates with new content (such as dinosaurs, weapons, armor, etc.). This will be the case until the game fully releases, which is said to be in spring 2017.

Go prepared

Thinking of getting the game on your PS4? Make sure to download the Survive ARK Companion app to guide you. You can easily find all the information you need at your fingertips and will be able to easily copy over admin commands from your phone to your console (which, believe me, saves you a lot of time and frustration)! Download it now on iOS or Android.

The underlying decision can be read **[here](http://www.employmentandlaborinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/328/2016/08/Dont-Tread-on-Me-EEOC-case.pdf)**

The important bits are *(in my opinion)*:   

* This complaint follows a previous one.  The details of that complaint aren't described, but the EEOC had found that a complaint had been improperly dismissed.  This is important, because it's not as simple as a stand-alone, 'That dude has a hat I don't like!' complaint.

* The decision is ultimately **only** that the complaint must be investigated.

* The decision is a procedural direction.  It provides a formalised opinion that the criteria to dismiss the complaint was not met and instructed the post office to investigate the complaint.

* The decision **does not** on any level address whether the complaint had any validity, or that wearing the Gadsden Flag could amount to racial discrimination.

**Cologne:**

It's possibly of note that the Algerian was convicted for being an accessory to the assault, since he prevented a man who was with the assaulted women from intervening and apparently asked him to ""abandon the girl for 5,000 euros.""

The victim testified that the Iraqi had licked her face and also touched her buttocks and genitals.

It appears that as a direct consequence of what happened in Cologne and the difficulty in securing convictions **[Germany has altered the law around rape](http://www.dw.com/en/no-means-no-germany-broadens-definition-of-rape-under-new-law/a-19385748)**.

So, yes, they're pieces of shit.  No, the result isn't good enough.  No, it's not as the linked article puts it, ' totes acceptable'.

**Austria:**

Ok, I'm going to low-effort this one.  **[Link](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iraqi-refugee-raped-10-year-old-boy-swimming-pool-vienna-austria-sentence-conviction-overturned-a7377491.html)**

* The Austrian Supreme Court made a procedural determination of a mistrial.  This is because they didn't bother to address intent properly.  

* This is important, because it makes the difference between a criminal conviction for sexual assault and a criminal conviction for violent rape.

* There will be a new trial next year.

* The rapist is staying in prison in the interim.

Again, he's a piece of shit.  He's in prison, where he belongs.  He'll be convicted next year.

In my experience it's just a lot of fun to learn swearwords of other languages. It's a topic that always comes up within the first 30 minutes or so when talking to other peeps from Europe(or anywhere else, really), even though I don't necessarily want to learn their language. Sometimes the translations, or rather the idea behind the word, is actually funny. E.g. in Germany ""Lappen"" can be used as an insult for an unusually weak person, but it's basically just the word for ""rag"". If I tried insulting someone with that word in english, you guys would give me a funny look and that's about it.

I just don't think they were in scale or frequency that Europeans did. 

Let's talk history then

* Sumerians, they invented freaking writing as we know (knowledge accumulation). That's one of if not the biggest contribution to human kind ever. They ruled the developed world for about two thousand years. Not whites
* Egyptians. Invented many things. Incredible advancements in writing, mathematics, astrology etc. They build one of the World Wonders. Ruled the world for about 2.5 thousand years. Not whites.
* I'll skip Romans here and say they were somehow white. In fact, they were not. Actually, the ones they called ""barbarians"" were the whites. Let's count as whites.
* The Incas, Mayas and Aztecs. You [can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire) [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization) [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec). Again, thousands of years, not whites. Also from South America, btw
* I'll skip the Ottoman Empire because it was so recent you must remember it, but again, not white


Now Europe. When did ""whites"", that is, germanic or scandinavian ties, became relevant? If we are optimists we can say that after the Renaissance the world was white dominated, that's a bit of stretch, but let's go with it. That's around 1000 years ago. So if we consider those and we let the Roman Empire be considered ""white"", that's 2 against 3 highly advanced civilizations. If we are strict with the ascendancy, that's less than 1000 years. Also notice that I completely skipped anything in Asia

European accomplishments are extremely recent. No matter how you look at it, saying that you ""don't think they were in scale or frequency that Europeans did."" is either ill intended or uninformed

There are plenty of gourmet food carts and places to buy booze inside at reasonable prices. You can't bring outside liquids in containers, but you can bring snacks, sandwiches and the like.

Incidentally, DOT is why the higher pressure EU cylinders aren't legal in the US. We do breathe aviator's oxygen as well - the big gas cylinders the O2 comes out of are clearly marked as such, the gas is analyzed, and then pressurized to 3000 or more PSI by an O2 booster pump before being dispensed into our deco bottles.

There are a few catches:

* Medical regulators aren't made to handle 3000+ PSI, but this is largely a moot point because...
* Many dive shops don't have O2 booster pumps, and can only fill a cylinder to around 1500 PSI of pure O2.
* Tank valves have burst disc valves which will dump the contents if they're over 5000'ish PSI at sea level. You might want to disable these, unless you want to go out in a literal blaze of glory.

I use [these](https://www.divegearexpress.com/luxfer-al-40); it's about $200 with O2 safe valves, and a full O2 fill to 3000 PSI costs about $40 at a dive shop. [Here's](http://www.rescuean.com/) an inexpensive medical regulator adapter, though I have no idea if altitude/ambient pressure affects it.

Edit: Side note - we're extremely picky about what we breathe. If the O2% isn't known or correct, we can either suffer from oxygen toxicity (underwater seizure) if we're too deep for the deco gas, or DCS (decompression sickness) if it's a lower percentage of O2 than what we were expecting. We can also suffer from hypoxia and hypercapnia (from rebreathers or full face masks) depending on what mix of gasses we're breathing. Any pollutant in the gas (eg; diesel exhaust) can be fatal at depth."

&gt; Scotland&amp;#039;s minimum age of criminal responsibility will be raised to 12 years, in line with UN standards, after the current minimum age of eight, the lowest in Europe, was labelled a &amp;quot;National embarrassment&amp;quot;.

&gt; In 2010, the Scottish government raised the age of criminal prosecution to 12, assuring that no one under that age could be prosecuted or sentenced in the criminal courts but would be dealt with through children&amp;#039;s hearings.

&gt; &amp;quot;Raising the age of criminal responsibility from eight to 12 is an important step towards fully incorporating the UN convention on the rights of the child into Scots law. Many children who find themselves in children&amp;#039;s hearings are also victims themselves, and are often ill-equipped to deal with the situations they find themselves in. Raising the age will help ensure that Scotland is a fair place for children, and shift focus to supporting children instead of criminalising them.""

________

I personally dislike this definition of JRPG and WRPG. I believe that is an oversimplification for the purpose of political correctness. The purpose of classifications, especially in media and forms of art is to aid people to seek similar things, to avoid them and to enable easy discussion. As a result, I believe this myopic PC definition of ""JRPG"" is counterproductive and serves to undermine rational debate.

I think most people who are fairly knowledgeable about RPGs are cognizant of the creative differences that differentiate the majority of JRPGs from WRPGs and vice versa. 

From early Final Fantasy games, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean, Tales, Chrono Trigger, Persona (and the greater SMT), Valkyria Chronicles....you name it - It is quite clear that these games share fundamental creative ideas.

They all have very narrative stories, with pre-set, fully fleshed out characters with tons of backstory, heavily fantastical worlds largely devoid of realistic influence and much more that I haven't thought about.


I'm not as well versed in the world of WRPGs as I would like to be but from my understanding, WRPGs tend to have more blank and customizable characters (there are some exceptions but no where to the extent of JRPGs), not as heavily narrative, tend to be more experimental with their battle systems and sometimes heavily overlap into other genres, tend to have more realistic worlds and tend to be darker and grittier much like the world that we live in. 


As a result, I think it would be unfair for me to recommend Bloodborne or a Fallout, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Borderlands or Skyrim-esque (from Japan) games to someone who enjoys pre-FFXV Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Persona, etc. There's a reason why the majority of people who love Bloodborne and Dark Souls play WRPGs and other western games....at least from what I've seen anecdotally.


Don't get me wrong, Borderlands is one of my favorite games of all time, I loved The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition and Lords of the Fallen has been sitting in my backlog for quite some time but I don't that we should turn a blind eye to the fundamental differences that divide the majority of western and Japanese RPGs.


I don't think that the **J** in **J**RPG or the **W** in **W**RPG refer to geographical location. I believe it refers to the creative ideas that a prevalent in the RPG genre. An example of this can be seen in the popular term ""The West"". What is ""The West""? Does it refer to any country that is west of Asia? If so, then why is Australia considered part of the west? That's probably because ""The West"" doesn't refer to geographical location but refers to the cultural and societal similarities to that of European and American culture and society. Australia is heavily influenced by European and American culture and so it is considered a western state despite being very close to Asia....and Japan by extension. I think this analogy applies to JRPG and WRPG. It is not about the location of the developer but the creative ideas present in the game that are predominant in either the west or Japan.


I haven't played FFXV yet so I can't comment on the game. I'm downloading it right now."

The [VW Golf](http://www.vw.com/models/golf/) starts at $19,985, which is almost the cheapest entry level vehicle around.  There is a class of cars cheaper, but they don't fit in this example.  So start there, and end with [the Golf R](http://www.vw.com/models/golf-r/), which *starts* at $39,375.  Go ahead and trick one out on the website and see how high you can get that figure.

It's the same frame, or 'platform' as it's known in the car biz.

But it gets better.  That platform is also shared by the [Audi A3](https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a3-sedan), starting at $31,200, and ending with the [S3](https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-s3-sedan), starting at $42,900 (try to see how much higher you can get it than the Golf R!).

So we have two highly regarded cars, the Golf R and S3, both sought after by automotive enthusiasts, but are based on the [same platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group_MQB_platform) as VW's entry level car.  And if you read that wiki, you'll see that it's also used by other car companies in Europe, like SEAT.

Notice that the body panel lines are strikingly similar between the Golfs and the Audi's, particularly the A3 Sportback, which is also a hatchback.  The main differences are in the grill, head and taillights and bumpers, but nearly everything else is identical on the exterior.

Ford does this with Lincolns, Toyota does this with Lexus ([this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus_CT) adorable little guy is based on the Corolla and Matrix), etc. etc.  In almost every luxury brand, there is one or more models that are based on 'lesser' models from the main brand.  Chevy also does this, but they tend not to share as much exterior detailing and only share the unseen parts of the platforms.

So too, are engines and other components shared.  The powertrain in the S3 and Golf R is identical (as of 2015, when I last read deeply into those cars), and the horsepower figures were also identical.  The only differences were the interior options and exterior cosmetics, yet there was a $6,000 price difference.

This makes the luxury cars much cheaper to produce, arguably driving down their prices (but definitely driving up their profitability).  One of the reasons BMW's are so expensive is that they don't have a non-luxury brand to share parts with.

This also allows their entry-level vehicles to have an upscale feel to them, since the frame itself needs to be as rigid and reliable as would be expected for a luxury car, and this also improves their safety performance.  So if you want a good, cheap car, buy one that a luxury car is based on.  If you want a cheap, reliable luxury car, buy one that's based on an entry-level car.

BTW, the Jetta, Passat, Audi A4, A5, and some Porsches also share parts up and down the range.

Further Reading:

There has been a lot of homogeneity in the auto world recently, and that's due to changes to global safety standards.  Both China and the EU introduced regulations to protect pedestrians by requiring more empty space *inside* cars between the outter sheet metal and the inner structure and engine.  This makes a ""softer"" impact for any pedestrian hit by a car, and reduces injury.

But this also limits what car designers can and cannot do, so cars look more similar today than they used to.  The same goes for interior safety regulations, which has required the use of certain materials, the adoption of certain ergonomic standards, and certain distances between elements, meaning that the insides of cars are also pretty similar across the board.

Then add into this the tendency of non-luxury Asian auto companies like Hyundai and Kia to emulate the styling of European luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes, and the gap between the family sedan and the typical luxury car narrows."

His rule was seemingly quite inelegant, and his life as king raised much rebellion. So, in 1058, Lulach was captured by a high-ranking man named Malcolm, who wished to ""rightfully"" claim the throne for himself. Malcolm had killed kings before (most notably Macbeth), and he knew that his autocratic habits would eventually cause someone to usurp his reign. Malcolm, being the manipulative man he was, made a deal with Máel Snechtai of Moray (the only son of Lulach at the time), promising him riches as long as he agreed with the execution of his father. However, Máel was not without honor and believed his father deserved a distinguished parting ceremony. Instead of brutally killing him, Máel convinced Malcolm to send him off, out of Europe to die on the high seas. However, Lulach was sent away with enough food to last more than a month, a gift from his son in secret. The gift was meant to last until he could moor on the coast of another European country, but the currents had other plans,. So, in late-1059, he was sent off, with over a hundred prisoners from Mercia, Wales, and Ireland in a ship built for sixty. While he aimed to sail southwards to Asturias, he quickly lost track of his surroundings, and ended up travelling west. After a gruesome five month journey lasting through the middle of winter, Lulach successfully piloted the ship to a new land. Surprised to find themselves anywhere other than Asia, Lulach used the supplies from the moored ship to found a small settlement on the coast. He named the settlement Cerenandred, and it immediately became a factory for supplies needed to survive.

Out of the 112 early settlers, 91 made it through the first winter; far better that Lulach hoped to do. After realizing the population of this ""New Land"" was more than zero, they began to present themselves as peaceful helpers to the natives. The new settlers in ""Ednícarseld"" (New Home) rebounded, learning the ways of the land within a couple months. The natives, however, were not so lucky. Many moved inland to escape disease, others died from the amalgamation of ailments. By 1100, the population of Lulach's land quickly grew to nearly twice the size it was when they first landed. He resided in Ednícarseld for thirty years, dying of old age in 1089. However, this did not mean the end of the settlement; he had two children with a young native woman, meaning an heir to give his new kingdom to. The entirety of his domain was meant to go to his son Ælfgar, but his little brother Lalor wished for his own land as well. After a small rebellion, the nobles in the second (smaller) settlement of Swétnes claimed their loyalty to Lalor. These two domains were named “Ælfgaríce” (Ælfgar’s Kingdom) and “Laloríce” (Lalor’s Kingdom). The entirety of British land in Ednícarseld needed a name, however, so the amalgamation of domains became known as ""Lulachfrýgyld"" (Lulach's Heaven). Throughout most of its history, Lulachfrýgyld was not a single entity, rather a confederation of small principalities under an umbrella of culture.

In the 1100's, a population boom occured, most likely instituted by King Lalor to make the population of his land closer to that of Ælfgar's. Throughout the twelfth century, ship technology became vastly more usable, and small farming settlements were created up and down the Ednícarseldian coastline. After the death of Lulach's sons, the two original kingdoms became two of many. The House of Alpin stayed in power for many years in the formative region, while other cadet braces reigned in the north. Some of the natives formed English-influenced states as well, such as the Cætaba people. These new states gained a lot of power, influencing the government and language of Frýgian culture. However, the nations themselves remained purely English (or Gaelic, in the spirit of Lulach) in name, due to old tradition. By the end of the century, places were being named not after the people who founded it, but after things like the famous saints and figures of Christianity. The religion had taken over Lulachfrýgyld, pushing out the various forms of paganism for more of a native-influenced type.

The thirteenth century saw a major boom of exploration, with ship technology an even more massive step forward. Contact with Europe was quietly re-established, with ships sometimes passing in and out of the ports of major nations. The resources of Ednícarseld provided good for easy expansion, allowing settlement on the peninsula of Edscóníeg (Florida) and a few minor trade posts on the Walganus River (Mississippi). Influence on the natives took effect, as the diseases had killed most of them nearly a century before. Confederations of tribes began to form, influenced by the language and 36-letter alphabet of Lulachfrýgyld. By 1300, settlement took control, with farmland being sought out more than influence. By this time, the kingdoms began to elect a presiding leader, to loosely rule over the Frýgian realms. They went through many kings and reagents, some even managing to kick out all the cadet branches (briefly), and ruling over the entire kingdom singlehandedly. By 1450, the realms of Lulachfrýgyld were expansive and wealthy (if a little divided), trading as far inland as OTL Utah via the Pearl Road. The population was nearly 77,000 citizens strong, having grown on a necessity basis. Lulachfrýgyld was becoming centralized and strong, and seemed ready to face the world after Europe realized their presence fully."

دعني أستشهد ببضعة سطورٍ من الوثيقة السياسية التي أصدرها حزب الله عام ٢٠٠٩

إنّ أخطر ما في منطق الهيمنة الغربي عموماً، والأميركي تحديداً، هو اعتباره منذ الأساس أنه يمتلك العالم، وأنّ له حق الهيمنة من منطلق التفوق في أكثر من مجال، ولذا باتت الإستراتيجية التوسعية الغربية - وبخاصة الأميركية - **ومع اقترانها بالمشروع الإقتصادي الرأسمالي إستراتيجيةً عالميةَ الطابع، لا حدود لأطماعها وجشعها.**
إنّ تحكّم قوى الرأسمالية المتوحشة، المتمثلة على نحوٍ رئيسٍ بشبكات الإحتكارات الدُّولية من شركات عابرة للقوميات بل وللقارات، والمؤسسات الدُّولية المتنوعة، وخصوصاً المالية منها، والمدعومة بقوة فائقة عسكرياً، أدى الى المزيد من التناقضات والصراعات الجذرية، ليس أقلها اليوم: صراعات الهويات والثقافات وأنماط الحضارات، إلى جانب صراعات الغنى والفقر.
لقد حولت الرأسمالية المتوحشة العولمةَ إلى آلية لبث التفرقة وزرع الشقاق وتدمير الهويات وفرض أخطر أنواع الإستلاب الثقافي والحضاري والإقتصادي والإجتماعي.

&gt; Is it because it is against the status quo, or is it because Hezbollah is a militant Islamist group that doesn't allow others to step on their toes. I mean, look at who we are talking about!

If Hezbollah had stood behind such an action it could have galvanized working class support for itself. You seem determined to reduce it to a scary entity [I take it that's what ""look at who we are talking about"" is supposed to mean] that has no real political stance except to take actions that you are determined not to read in terms of politics.

&gt; No, what I am saying that it is a foregone conclusion that decidedly Eastern political movements are going to have different goals and outcomes than what a 19th century Prussian or early 20th century Russians theorized about and did.

Ignoring all the Orientalist resonances of ""Decidedly Eastern political movements,"" the fact is that people all over the world are facing economic mechanisms [i.e. capitalism] that are remarkably similar to those faced by Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. Hezbollah professes to fight such mechanism (as part of a greater attempt to establish, as you have mentioned, a ولاية الفقيه). However, it looks like if Hezbollah were somehow to take control of Lebanon today its wilaayat al-faqiih would be more like a neoliberal religious nightmare controlled by a Shi3a upper-middle class Beyrouti elite than anything like Imam Ali prescribed. 

&gt; This conversation has put me in an odd position. I don't like Hezbollah and disagree with their entire platform (aside from their defense of Lebanese territorial integrity which is why they're allowed to continue existing) but I feel as if I sound like I'm defending them from accusations of not being leftist enough because I am saying that they never claimed to be leftists. We have a communist party and they're well known, they aren't that popular.

Honestly, this article isn't directed at you. Leftists in the Arab world and in the West are interested in how religion can provide interesting points of opposition to capitalism (c.f. emancipatory theology in South America), precisely outside of the Western frame of reference. The big question is why do Islamist movements that challenge capitalism based on its incompatibility with Islamic morals (إن الله يأمر بالعدل والإحسان) inevitably end up part of the system they promised to fight. This obviously isn't of any relevance to you as a liberal determined to see Hezbollah within strictly sectarian potentialities. But the fact is that Hezbollah appeals to disenfranchised people in Lebanon in part because of its anti-imperialist anti-capitalist rhetoric (which cannot be separated due to the globalized nature of capitalism) but Hezbollah in its current configuration does not seem to follow through on any of said rhetoric. An economic analysis of Hezbollah and how it has allowed the creation of an upper-middle class Shi3a elite that doesn't have any interest in structural change is thus interesting, though not necessarily to you...  

&gt; Also, I hate this pop economics where liberalism has become some kind of terrible thing. Liberalism is pretty much acknowledged to be a good economic model for growth and prosperity.

خخخخخخخخخخخخخخخخخ

&gt; If we had a stronger state and more solidarity, and didn't have to spend so much on national security we could have a healthy liberal economy that has enough resources to assist people who are having bad times.

A 'stronger state and more solidarity' is in none of the business and ruling elite's interests so good luck with that."

If current projections about the US hold true, then by 2042, whites will have gone from 90% of the population to 50% of the population in roughly the span of one human lifetime.  And they will have lost a considerable deal of social power.  So things can change quickly.

&gt;Even if they do slowly become an ethnic minority, I don't really see that being a big issue on its own.

If the indigenous Europeans were to become minorities, it would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the nature of European countries.  Although I doubt that Africans and Arabs are genetically incapable, as groups, of enacting European society, the fact remains that, as a simple empirical matter, Europeans would not transfer the entirety of their culture and way of life over to the new majority migrant groups.  The new dominant character of European nations would be a mix of the new imported African and Middle Eastern cultures and some aspects of the displaced European cultures; what the proportion would be, I cannot say.  Certainly, cultural evolution as well as mutation through cultural exchange is inevitable, but if change in European cultures is inevitable, then I would rather it occur primarily through the actions of the European peoples, rather than through the fact of their displacement by foreigners."

This was a massive opinion poll. The Government will take the opinion of 48% into consideration or risk losing popularity for many many years. The mist likely option is to remain in the single market because of this very reason..

The remain voters should absolutely have their opinions listened to, but not at the expense of the side which got the majority. 

&gt;No. I didn't say we should have a 2nd referendum on the EU. I said on the single market. I'm making the point that Leave wouldn't win a second referendum in any form.

Unfortunately for remain, you only get one crack at the whip. Remain voters are constantly angry at Brexit voters. I think they should direct that anger at the people who agreed with them about the EU but couldn't be bothered to turn up to the polling booth. If I were a remain supporter, I would be livid at all these young people who sat at home and whined about Brexit without bothering to try and stop it. 

&gt;I think the best option is to pay for single market with no FoM. While I'm a Europhile at heart it has grown too fast with Eastern countries joining too quick. 

Personally, I'd rather we had a free trade agreement with the EU, even if we had to throw in freedom of movement in return for passporting. Immigration was never a huge factor for me, although I'm sure most Brexit voters wouldn't agree with me about this. 

&gt;They should have been phased in over 30-50 years rather than all at once. Since the vote we are seeing a decrease in Western European immigrants and increase in Romanians et al., which I'd have to see isn't really beneficial in the wider scheme of things. 

I agree. I was a believer in the European project when I was younger, but the whole thing has been horribly executed. The Euro is a pyramid scheme that needs the constant addition of new economies to keep its value. Eventually they're going to run out of European countries to add, which will be bad news for the EU. 

&gt;A lot of the Eastern Europeans are horrible racists if I'm honest. The younger Polish and Latvians seem fine.

I agree with this too. People like to say that Brexit was racist, but white nationalism is a much bigger problem on the continent, especially in the Soviet bloc. Young people from Eastern Europe are great, but the older folks who grew up under communism are quite often horrible people, in my experience. It's probably a similar to what's happening in China. People who grew up dirt poor are suddenly getting wealthy and travelling to countries where there's a much different standard of acceptable behaviour. 

The EU should have a cap on all immigration, which slowly rises as people in new states adjust to their newfound wealth. Not only would this be better for countries like the UK which gets inundated with immigrants, but it would be better for the new EU members themselves. Eastern European countries are suffering from serious brain-drain right now as the young people leave to start a better life in the EU. I think something like a third of all Lithuanians live outside the country right now, which caused a anti-migration party to be elected in a landslide recently. The EU is going to have a major pension crisis in 20 years because an entire generation has moved abroad. "

Rabindranath Tagore (Illustration: Subrata Dhar) Rabindranath Tagore (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)

In 1908, Rabindranath Tagore wrote a letter to his friend, A M Bose, and said, “Patriotism can’t be our final spiritual shelter. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live.” Three years after he wrote this letter — part of Selected Letters of Rabindranath Tagore, published by Cambridge University Press in 1997 — his composition, Jana Gana Mana, was sung for the first time at the Calcutta session of the Congress. Now, 105 years later, as a Supreme Court bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy makes it mandatory for movie halls to play Jana Gana Mana and for people present to stand up as part of their “sacred obligation” to the national anthem, Tagore’s composition has come to symbolise nationalism — something the Nobel laureate was not only critical of, but had famously described as “carnivorous and cannibalistic”.

Recently, Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Bose said in Parliament, “I sometimes fear that those who are defining nationalism so narrowly will end up one day describing Rabindranath Tagore as anti-national if they read some of the sentences in his book on nationalism.”

Watch What Else Is making News

Throughout his life, Tagore remained deeply critical of nationalism, a position that pitted him against Mahatma Gandhi. Tagore argued that when love for one’s country gives way to worship, or becomes a “sacred obligation”, then disaster is the inevitable outcome. “I am willing to serve my country; but my worship I reserve for Right which is far greater than country. To worship my country as a god is to bring curse upon it,” Tagore wrote in his 1916 novel, The Home and the World. The words were spoken by Nikhil, one of the two protagonists in the novel, who many thought to be Tagore’s alter-ego.

Further, Tagore argued that disagreement and different notions were of utmost importance. Writing from the Soviet Union in 1937, Tagore reacted positively to the Soviet Experiment, particularly their attempts at eradicating education, but warned of any attempt to curb “freedom of mind”. He wrote, “It would be an uninteresting but a sterile world of mechanical regularity if all our opinions were forcibly made alike… Opinions are constantly changed and rechanged only through free circulation of intellectual forces and persuasion. Violence begets violence and blind stupidity. Freedom of mind is needed for the reception of truth; terror hopelessly kills it.”

From 1877-1917, Tagore’s stance on Swadeshi and the anti-Partition movement of Bengal were one with the political climate. But from 1921, as fractures in society — communal and caste — became apparent, Tagore confessed, “I took a few steps down the road, and then stopped.”

Though Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi shared a philosophical affinity and mutual respect, their disagreement on nationalism would culminate in debates that continue to be relevant. Tagore had warned Gandhi that there remained a thin line that divided nationalism and xenophobia. Tagore and Gandhi had met in July 1921 at his home in Calcutta, where the two had a long and argumentative conversation about what Tagore described as the “bondage of nationalism”.

In the then influential Calcutta journal, Modern Review, Tagore wrote about an international desire to “achieve the unity of man by destroying the bondage of nationalism in order to achieve the unity of man”.

India, he argued, didn’t have a “real sense” of nationalism and noted that “even though from childhood I had been taught that the idolatry of Nation is almost better than reverence for God and humanity, I believe I have outgrown that teaching, and it is my conviction that my countrymen will gain truly their India by fighting against that education which teaches them that a country is greater than the ideals of humanity.”

Tagore’s dismay for the fervent nationalism that had gripped India was further shaped by the first World War in 1914. Speaking at Japan after the war, he warned that “the political civilization” that was overrunning the world was “based on exclusiveness” and it is “always watchful to keep at bay the aliens or to exterminate them. It is carnivorous and cannibalistic in its tendencies, it feeds upon the resources of other peoples and tries to swallow their whole future. It is always afraid of other races achieving eminence, naming it as a peril, and tries to thwart all symptoms of greatness outside its own boundaries, forcing down races of men who are weaker, to be eternally fixed in their weakness.”

Then again, writing in 1933, when Adolf Hitler had been appointed chancellor of Germany and was rapidly achieving full dictatorial power, Tagore wrote in an essay, The Changing Age, later compiled into the book, Towards Universal Man: “Germany, in which the light of Europe’s Culture was at its brightest, has torn up all civilized values — with what ease has an unspeakable devilry overtaken the entire country.”

Even in his lifetime, Tagore’s criticism of nationalism didn’t make him a popular figure. Gandhi had famously commented, on being criticised by Tagore, that “the poet lives in a magnificent world of his own creation — his world of ideas”.

The poet, though, was hardly unaware of the criticism that his ideas opened him up to. Writing to his friend C F Andrews in 1921, from New York, speaking critically of the non-cooperation movement led by Gandhi in India, he admitted to being “afraid” that he would “be rejected by my own people when I go back to India. My solitary cell is awaiting me in my Motherland. In their present state of mind, my countrymen will have no patience with me, who believe God to be higher than my own country”.

He added, “I know such spiritual faith may not lead us to political success; but I say to myself as India had ever said, ‘Even then – what?’.” The letter was published by S Ganesan in 1924 as part of Tagore’s Letters from Abroad and was quoted by historian Ramchandra Guha in his 2009 introduction to Tagore’s Nationalism.

You seem to believe that there is no limit to the size or efficiency of ""corporatism"". Tell me then, why do nations still exist in the EU? Why not incorporate them all? Why not incorporate all nations globally into a single world government? Wouldn't that be the most ""efficient solution"" to any degrees of ""isolationism""?

The reality is that biggest corporate body is not always the best. Corporate bodies should be as large as they need to be in order to achieve the ends they need to achieve. The EU does not govern all of its members because it recognizes that its member nations govern themselves better than a single body would govern over all of them. That is not to say the EU has no purpose, it serves an important one, one that cannot be served by individual nations.

Please if you are not American, have not seen how different the needs and cultures are of different parts of America, don't preach the need for corporatism from your ivory tower. My principle is simple, government should be as local as possible, as much as possible. It's really easy to brag about corporatism when you live in a country roughly the size of just one of the 50 United States. I certainly would not have as many concerns with paying taxes into a system I am involved in and have a local stake in. 

But I want you to imagine the EU asking all of the citizens of its member nations to pay taxes to the EU itself rather than to their countries, and simply trust that the money will be distributed well and efficiently among the citizens of all the member nations. Imagine the shitstorm. So much for corporatism, but that is exactly what the federal government does at the expense of local and state government in the USA. It isn't about the ""concept of individual taxation"" at all, it is about where power is localized, and in the USA most of the power is localized thousands of miles away from the people."

No. People say ""As a European"" all the time even when Europe isn't the subject. For example, people are talking about how something is done in a certain country, and people will chime in with ""As a European we do it this way"" or ""In Europe, this is illegal"". Clearly there are many distinct sets of cultures and laws in ""Europe"", but many ""Europeans"" talk about it as a monolith.

&gt;Like who? You can say people would like Europe (I'll just give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're talking about the European Union when saying ""Europe"") to become a nation, but there must be some serious educational issue if someone thinks it is already a nation. Can you point out an example?

No, you don't need to give me your condescending ""benefit of the doubt"" because these aren't my words these are the words of self-titled ""Europeans"". It doesn't matter whether they're talking about the EU or Europe. There are [people](http://whatukthinks.org/eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Analysis-paper-2-Do-we-feel-European.pdf) that [identify](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5enhvi/europeans_of_reddit_what_issue_do_you_see/daec3i3/) as ""European"". Not sure how you haven't heard that.

The serious educational issue might be with someone who doesn't realize there is a difference between a nation and a state. ""Nation"" is a nebulous combination of things including [common traditions, morals, and social concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europeanism). Europe isn't a state, but it is considered a nation by some people.

And I don't know what's the point of your worthless final paragraph and then linking to post of two Americans talking about their ethnicity. I said a Japanese person wouldn't say ""As an Asian"" the same way that many ""Europeans"" say ""As a European"".

You play LoL. I don't know how you can not have seen the constant spam of ""EU &gt; NA"". I haven't played in many years, but I've no doubt it's gotten even worse. You somehow think this isn't nationalism? People cheering for a team because they're from the same geographic area? Maybe you want to pretend it's not because ""Europe is just a continent"". Even if you wanted to pretend that isn't nationalism, how could you honestly believe that it's significantly different?

An even more clear example is Street Figher and other fighting games. You can see people type ""EU &gt; JP &gt; US"". Those are ""Europeans"" cheering for a person from ""EU"". They view European as an identity comparable to Japanese and American."

I mean liberalism as an entire system of government with all that it entails. 


&gt;If you haven't noticed, the history of the twentieth century was the history of working people trying to emancipate themselves from capitalism. 

The history of the 20th century was Europeans and Chinese people suffering because instead of creating better conditions they moved to a worse system, and anti-colonial movements getting coopted by communists since the Soviet Union would support them against westerners. Also in the 20th century was the greatrst proliferation of wealth and growth in living quality for countries in Western Europe and North America who adopted a liberal system.


&gt;It might be 'acknowledged' as a 'good' economic model (how laughable this is, given the catastrophic levels of wealth inequality and global political decay and upheavals) in the think tanks of Washington D.C and the liberal elites on Wall Street, but for the working classes of the world there is no such consensus.

Firstly don't claim to speak for the working classes of the world. It is no coincidence that communism is moribund pretty much everywhere. I am talking about hard facts and data, countries who became part of the liberal system saw the living standards of all of their people improve.

It bothers me to no end when communists have the audacity to speak for the working classes of the world, when they have no evidence that the working classes of the world want to be spoken for by them.


Every nation has a communist movement of some sort, and for a very substantial majority they aren't supported by their nation's working class. 


I'm sure you'll try to explain that away with ""well they voted for the opposite of a communist, but what they were trying to say is they want communism.."" or something."

We're comfy, well fed, happy, entertained, and overall we have everything we could ever want. The west is a society unparalleled in history in its ability to provide comfort and service to its citizens. Our problems are ideological in nature. We may disagree with some laws, but rebelling for real would mean throwing everything else away. Risking death or imprisonment in heated combat against impossible odds. The west won't revolt unless it has nothing left.

Syria, on the other hand, was living under the fist of totalitarianism. Assad would arrest anyone who protested or dissented and disappear them to prisons where they would be brutally tortured and killed. There was also a colossal unemployment rate, shortages of most goods, and serious social divisions in the country. The last part is most important. What we see on the map as Syria is a land deeply divided between unions of ethnic and cultural groups that are currently locked in a bloody total war for survival. Same with Libya and Egypt in smaller doses. 

I'm also scared of what revolt in America would look like. The battles would be larger, bloodier, more horrifying than anything in Syria and Libya. Social divisions between ideologies would break away into paramilitary armies and clash while the federal government tries to secure control by any means necessary. Mexico would man our new border wall and use it to keep Americans out, and Canada would arrest and deport illegal American refugees. States like California and Texas would want out entirely, while groups like black nationalists and white nationalists would try to carve out their own shit in the chaos.

As I said in a previous comment - the EU needs to either fund the countries in the Middle East that have been struggling with refugee crises since the 1950s and make it possible for refugees to live safe lives there and maintain basic levels of human dignity, set a system in place that can deal with millions of people being displaced (ideally both), or realize that people will flee to somewhere they feel they can better make a life for themselves over the many years it will take this conflict to work out.

It's easy for you to say they should follow the system (which takes years, by the way) when they're caught between a war zone and packed refugee camps in countries dealing with far larger and longer refugee crises than Europe has ever seen on a shoestring budget. "

So a couple years ago, I worked part time at a Sbarro's in the mall overcharging people for seven hour old pizza. There, I met a young lady named Marina (not her real name) with who I became completely infatuated. Marina happened to be a huge Twilight fan. I myself had only seen the first one and was thoroughly unimpressed by it. Ok, Edward's Vulva was kind of cool as far as Swedish cars go, but that was about it. Anyway, I feigned an interest in the series to get close to Marina, just to have something to talk about with her and stuff. It worked.

What started with workplace banter -- mostly Twilight references (""You know, your mood swings are kind of giving me whiplash!"")-- led to us seeing each other outside of Sbarro's. We'd often visit the multiplex in the mall (mall employees got discount tickets) and watch movies together. This meant seeing Twilight: Eclipse. And not just once, mind you. More like twice a week for the five straight weeks it was in that theater. I swear, I was having dreams of Jacob trying to warm me up while I was stuck in the middle of a blizzard. For some reason, I was always bottomless in these dreams. Felt like Winnie the Poo.

Somewhere along the way, I started going over to her apartment. There, we would play video games and watch movies. Naturally, the movie would either be the first or the second Twilight film.

In spite of us growing close enough to fart in front if one another, I remained just a friend. But I was not to be discouraged so easily. I kept up an incrediby subtle pursuit for her affections. My thinking was that if she watched her beloved Twilight saga with me enough, she would start to associate me with the series. Then, whenever she thought of Twilight, she would think of me and become moist.

Even more weeks went by, however, and though we spent an enormous amount of time together, it was clear I'd hit a brick wall. I was going to need to take a different tact.

Marina's birthday was coming up and her roommates were having a big house party in her honor. I needed to get her a present, but had no idea what it should be. A Twilight-themed gift was a must. Unfortunately, shopping for a Twilight gift for Marina was like buying a butt plug for Wendy Williams. She already has all she'll ever need. I was lost.

The week before her birthday arrives, one of my friends mentioned how he was going to shoot a student film with a bunch of guys he knew from school. They were from the local community college's film class. That's when it hit me - an idea for the greatest gift a person has ever given to another person since dad decided not to pull out of mom that one time. I would need actors. It would be great. My gift was going to be the greatest gift of all time. And if it happened to remove Marina's panties in the process, then so be it.

The night of the party arrived. The house was packed. Every corner of the place had a twenty-something douchebag drunkenly dancing around to the loud, crappy music that was vibrating my genitals. I kind of stood off to the side and drank Zima by myself, trying to look cool. In hindsight, the Zima may have been counterproductive.

When midnight rolled around, my actors arrived. One was a pasty-looking student all the way from Newcastle, England, Great Britain (it's in Europe). He was my Edward. My Jacob, a theater student at the local community college, had olive skin and was rather short. I wasn't sure of his heritage, though. Samoan by the looks of it. Their appearances were on point. I had spend $450 wisely.

When Marina saw them for the first time, she freaked out. Even though she was already having a good time, seeing these guys put her over the top. That's probably why she didn't think to thank me. Of course she knew it was me, though. At least, I *think* she knew it was me.

I tried for a second to elbow in near her, to tell her I put them up to this, but I couldn't penetrate the crowd around her. I went back to posting up near the bathroom with Zima number five and left her to hang out with her gift. I could always tell her the next day.

So a couple hours go by and the party is experiencing its death throes. I realized that I hadn't seen her or my actors for quite some time. I'll admit was worried. She had been drinking after all. What if she passes out and chokes on her own vomit Jimi Hendrix-style? I needed to find her.

After looking around the living room, the kitchen, and even the back lawn, I moved my search upstairs to the bedrooms. There, st the top of the steps, I was greeted with by a rythmic knocking accompanied by what sounded like a cat gagging on a chicken bone. It came from the end of the hallway, where Marina's room was. Jesus, she was doing a Jimi Hendrix impression, I thought.

I raced down the hallway and threw open her door. The scene was gruesome and shocking; Marina was on her hands and knees in the middle of the bed. My lookalikes were on either end of her and were stuffing her like a Thanksgiving turkey. 

""Edward,"" dick so far down her throat it was probably getting digested by Marina's stomach acids, was up front. ""Jacob,"" looking like he was unsuccessfully spearfishing with his dick,  took her from behind. Worst of all, they were screaming Twilight dialogue back and forth.

""Jacob, your thoughts are so loud!"" cried Edward.

""You have to consider the idea that I'm better for her than you are!"" Jacob shouted back.

""Aarrrgglllack!"" gargled Marina, summoning charisma that somehow evaded Kristen Stewart's performance. 

She then turned from Edward's navel, her eyes fixing mine as she did, and gave me a wink. In that moment, I knew I would have been better off just getting her a gift card.

Now, this hole ordeal shouldn't have scarred me so deeply. Marina was a modern woman, after all. She  spat in the streets and voted. Getting filled out from both ends by a couple of drama nerds in cosplay was simply another aspect of it. I accept that. 

But it was the little wink that mentally devastated me. My eggo was pulverized. Any confidence I had in life shriveled inside of me as if it had just dove into a cold lake. I was also completely turned off to film adaptations of young adult literature. Seriously, I was watching the Maze Runner the other day and just could not enjoy it.

In the end, I quit Sbarro's and moved in with my nana. She lives two states away. Now, I spend my days wrapping her medication in bacon. It's a boring life but at least I'm pretty sure I won't walk in on her getting double teamed.

There's a great deal of difference between ""we could've handled things better"" and ""I wish I could turn back time"" too, but I'm done with semantics. Can I make a personal plea to you, seriously?

I'm not European, no shock there, I'm in the US. I'm not moving to Europe any time soon, nor will I be visiting in the immediate future. Literally all I can do to follow this situation is Google and attempt to engage in conversation on reddit. I can find articles about European refugee/migrant attacks easily. Tons of them, it's a cakewalk to find countless articles about how the situation in Europe on that front is not good. Finding the opposite, an article about this shit being perfectly under control, was difficult to begin with and is getting more difficult by the day. As far as I saw, Merkel was as pro-immigration as they come when this whole thing started, so to see even a *question* in her mind seems telling to me.

I was in middle school when 9/11 happened, and I felt awful about the fact that one of my Muslim peers had to be pulled out of school for a couple years purely because his family was afraid of the climate that that event created. This kid was a badass and friend to *everyone* (still is even as an adult), I'm confident that nothing would've happened to him had he stayed at our school. When he came back we were all elated, and nobody ever gave him shit... ever, let alone about his religion. ""It doesn't mean all Muslims are like that"" is a phrase I heard almost daily from 2001-2003, and pretty often from that point on, and I agree with it. Anyone who thinks all Muslims are extremists is ignorant at best, a racist at worst, and I'm not in their category. That is not me on any level of that spectrum.

I was never the sort of person who assumed what type of person an attacker was when I heard about an attack. Could be anyone, for any reason, political or not, the world is batshit and I don't know why killers kill. However, for all of these years, I've been living in a country with notable rising islamophobia and xenophobia. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Some of my country is racist, no shock there given that plenty of people who were alive in 1950 are still alive today. I figured it was pretty much par for the course for my country because you're right, we have plenty of hateful people and I'm not arguing against that. But it's gotten *worse* since then. It's been well over a decade since 9/11, but terror attacks still happen and there's a new person afraid of Muslims with each one. I've near-constantly run into islamophobes and told myself ""they're just ignorant"" every single time, like clockwork, for all these years.

But now I'm finding myself in a world where almost every single time there's an attack, I think something like: ""I hope it wasn't a Muslim extremist, that'll just fuel the hate more"". In the majority of cases, it turns out to be a Muslim extremist anyway. Then the story mysteriously disappears from my Facebook feed as my liberal friends go from ""whoever did that is awful"" to ""well we can't focus on that, Muslims have it tough enough already"". Given that Muslim extremist attacks happen so frequently, how long is this supposed to go on? I see an attack happen, my more liberal friends say that our hate created the attack, but the attack (understandably though unfortunately) creates more hate. We seem to be caught in an endless loop where each side is claiming that the other is the cause. What is supposed to end it?

To tell you the truth I have no clue how to feel about this issue. It's to the point where I have a *huge* amount of people all around me on both sides, from blatant racists who think all Muslims are Osama bin Laden to people who think we should somehow carve up a section of the middle east and try to appease ISIS with it, and the entire spectrum in between those extremes. I don't know how the fuck to feel apart from the fact that I have Muslim friends that I do not intend to lose, and I *really badly* want terror attacks to stop or diminish at the very least.

So I see two options:  

1. Tell everyone who is afraid of Muslims that they're being stupid, and keep telling them that over and over until they magically say: ""oh I see now, you're right, I'm not scared at all anymore"". In other words continue to berate them for their fear, exactly as we've always done with no results so far.

2. Decrease immigration from the middle east for now, until things cool down a bit. I'm a pretty big fan of Canada's immigration laws, and that's why I support this one. If it doesn't cut the attacks, it'll cut the haters for sure because that's all it would take to put most of their minds at ease. Then we can revisit immigration later on, when the middle east and our own nation are more stable.

I might be completely wrong on that conclusion. If that's the case, fine, fuck me. Fact of the matter is that Muslim extremist attacks are frequent enough to keep the US' islamophobia rising, I'm taking my life experience into consideration, and I can't know anything about Europe that doesn't have a giant red question mark over it because I'm getting it from the internet.

I'm doing my fuckin best dude. If you have anything that might help me besides a vague ""nah man, Europe is totally fine and you don't know shit"", that'd be fantastic. Enlighten me, I'd love for this to be a little easier to unravel."

Immigrants should be vetted, not based on race or religion, but based on values, especially socially progressive values. In fact, immigrants and minorities should not be given a free pass on mysogyny, homophobia and atheophobia.

I'm against the European idea of just opening the floodgates to any person who washes up ashore and handing them a citizenship. I do believe the European crisis is blown out of proportion especially by clickbait news, but there is a larger picture, which is true. Europe committed a huge mistake.

Unfortunately, as a minority in America and socio-liberal person, there seems to be no middle-ground on this.

I'm not sure what you're getting at.



Debunking you're ridiculous denial that we are Arabs and your Phoenicianisn.

&gt;A few simple questions should help us settle the matter.


Alright.


&gt;1) Where are the Arabs from?


The Arabs are an ethnolingustic and cultural group that stretches f Iran's borders to the Atlantic coast in Morocco.


2) Was there a population that inhabited our lands before the Arabic influence and were they left intact?


Yes, and yes.


The people that lived here before the Arabs were influenced by Greeks and by Assyria (Aramaic was the language of many common people by the time of Jesus). Being Semitic language speakers for the most part when Arabic became the important language it was easier for us to adapt too than the Greek of the Byzantines.


Of course we were left intact, there was no genocide and wholesale replacement like what the Europeans did to America. We are here now! If you're asking if we were ""pure"" then no and we never were. We culturally mingled, we had mixed marriages, we interacted. It changed us and we changed them. That is the history of all mankind. 

Nobody is as they were 3000 years ago.


&gt;3) Was the Arabic language imposed on us?


No, it was the useful language for trade and contact so we slowly adapted to it. Along the way we changed it, which is why we speak distinctly.


If you want to make the argument it was imposed on us, then that imposition stopped in the 13th century when we were conquered by Turkic speaking peoples (Mamluks, then Ottomans) but other languages like Greek survived well into those times. Arabic was more useful, it was the language of commerce and arts and culture and prestige. Remember when Europe was burning in the dark ages the cities of the Levant were centers of cultural enlightenment.


&gt;If;
The answer to #1 is: not from our lands The answer to #2 is: Yes. The answer to #3 is: Yes.


See above.


&gt;Then I don't see how you can justly tie us to the Arab identity.


Well firstly see my answers, but secondly even if the answers you gave were the correct ones it would not mean a thing. Identity and culture evolves with time. Aside from historical curiosity it doesn't matter what we were it matters what we are, that is Arabic speaking people with a shared culture and ethnicity with our Arab neighbors — Arabs."

If you are looking for fish spawns then check [Famme's BDO Maps](http://www.somethinglovely.net/bdo/) site and select the Fishing Hotspots overlay will give you a good idea of general areas to check for them.

If you want to catch them in open water then refer to my Fish List which gives the fish tables of al sea areas in the game currently;

[BDO ‘New Fishing’ - Ocean Fish Species List](http://forum.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?/topic/102746-bdo-ocean-fish-species-list/#comment-1368003)


I suggest fishing on Velia beach which is the only static *hotspot* in the game now. You will see other fishers as it is a popular spot. Basically W of the wharf up to the Coastal Cliff boundary (and a bit over also). There is Grunt there.

Or, in open water you can fish the Seas of Nox which has Grunt too:

    Seas of Nox  
    Origin Node: Invernen Island  
    
    Grunt   
    Angler   
    Yellow Swordfish   
    Bluefish   
    Clownfish  
    Skipjack  
    Dolphinfish

Good luck with the Grunt.

I've read about the supposed science behind people preferring people that look like them. It doesn't fit cross-culturally, those studies probably have a WEIRD bias (European white sample groups). Look man I have an anthropology degree. The evidence of that study is people that already grew up in a CULTURE that gave them certain ideas about who is good or bad then reacted when shown pictures of people of different backgrounds. That says nothing about human biology. Culture is defined as LEARNED BEHAVIOR. 
Ethnic nationalism is FELT and experienced by people, that doesn't make it right. It is a LEARNT phenomenon, in some cases inculcated at a young age by state-run education systems. Remember?

In contrast, globalisation has been a total shitshow in the Middle East, and the rise of extremism there is essentially the result. The problems there were much greater than elsewhere, but still existed in the US and Europe. Over time these small issues have grown until they finally have some political traction; enough to change the established power structures.

IMO though this is simply a wave. It will come and it will go as societies adjust to globalisation; as the people who lost jobs move out of the workforce, as the crime and drugs are countered by better policing, and the migrant crisis is handled better if not resolved.

So I started looking at other sites, and saw Amazon sells the ps4 digital code for 30 so I bought it.

After attempting to use it, it turns out it's a NA Code.

So I look for a Ps4 HW Eu code, but no luck, there is no one online that ever sells Eu digital code, the only way you'll get it is through buying the physical copy and then use the code that comes with it (hell, I'm not even sure if that's even the correct way)

So I been trying real hard to sell the code for 20.

I'm never getting the full value, but atleast I'll be getting something.

Or looking real hard to trade someone with an EU ps4 code, but no luck! There is no Eu digital code for the ps4 at all!!

The reason I can't buy the physical copy is the insane pricing it comes with the shipping.


I just hate this so much.

Not only that but I accidentally bought the PC running code too!

I'm not very proud of myself and this is the first time I buy codes online and I just feel so secrwed up, and I absolutely hate it.

If you TRULY got unlucky worst case is you'd get an email from your ISP letting you know that you were caught...they themselves don't really give a shit, but let you know you were caught. If caught the company who caught you won't know your name, just your IP to which they contact your ISP and tell them that person with the IP xxxxxx has been found pirating their product. Your ISP will then look up the owner of that IP on record and let them know. However, if they do decide to press charges your ISP would have to give them your information. This all depends on where you live. idk if you're from the states, EU, or Asia. 

The grey area...copyright infringement is a double edged sword. There's things that are 'illegal' but technically not because another section of the law contradicts it. In this case, you can technically pirate something you already own. If you've bought WoW before, you're just downloading a game you bought already. What patch you download doesn't matter as long as you have purchased that base game. 

The thing is, there's a difference between having something illegal and using something for illegal activity. Torrent software for example is totally legal, but it's how it's used where it becomes illegal. Similarly, having any version of WoW on your computer is not illegal as long as you bought that expansion. Where it becomes illegal is the moment you use your client to connect to a private server. The only reason private servers are illegal is because it allows you to play Blizzards game via third party and Blizzard loses revenue since the game requires a sub. I believe there's something about emulating the game itself making it copyright infringement as well. 

Anyway, this is getting too long. The chances of you being caught pirating something on occasion is extremely low. The only time a company tries to press charges is if you pirate in copious amounts which will make them think you're selling what you're pirating. Now WoW on the other hand is an MMORPG so it's impossible to say you're selling their game...unless you somehow hacked into something and grabbed a bunch of keys. Then of course if people are running a private server and accepting any sort of payment that can add to the list of charges since it'd kind of be like 'selling their game'. 

Pretty much absolute worst case is a very unlikely email I promise Blizzard won't even do anything about and the people running the server could be sued. No your retail account won't get banned"

Unfortunately, for the European Union, it is not a matter of representing Europe as a whole but key powers within it who wish to dictate European policy at a grander scale. 

And of course, a reform was made as the EU had become to Levaithan for most common citizens causing them to support Euroskeptics, but the reform was simply grasping not at the European Union but at it's use as an external organ for key powers in Europe.. Rhetoric says it's for the common heritage of Europe, but we disagree. Thus, we would be open to further relations with Danube. Italy has become a large threat, and uniting against the threat is the best solution. 

Danube is in a tough position, and if it would like to protect itself, it would require severe measures of posturing against Italy in a way that it cannot offensively attack Danube. Which is assuredly possible. Such a manuevre would likely take years of foreign policy work, but simply the establishment of closer relations would be the first step. "

I don't think liberals have the right to bitch about Steve Bannon when they have thrown Jews under the bus. College kids are the worst--shouting down Jewish/Israeli/Zionist speakers they don't agree with, their anti-Semitic BDS votes, asking Jewish students if they can remain ""impartial"" in student governments, trying to restrict access or walking out of Jewish events, etc. The Left has also never demanded reparations for the 850,000 MENA Jews who were expelled from Arab countries and for all the talk about helping refugees, they don't care about Jewish ones. I am also fed up with the Left saying Jews are privileged; this is just code for the Left thinking all Jews are ""white"" Europeans and that we have white privilege. We are white-passing and there is a difference. My ""whiteness"" disappears the second I wear a Star of David around my neck in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon or Hell, even in Europe. The Left ignores Jews of color and ror all the talk about saving indigenous people, they don't believe Jews are indigenous to Israel, despite's thousands of years' worth of archaeological evidence. And the Left has no right to claim to stand for women's or gay rights when they bitch about Israel--the only country in the Middle East offering those protections--and praise the Arab countries. I'd love to send those dipshits to those places and see how well they turned out afterwards. 

So yeah, I'm a liberal who supports Israel and am fed up with how she has been treated by the Left. Their hypocrisies about her and Judaism generally are disgusting.

Canada has less people than the state of California. It's not entirely an unreasonable point to suggest that a system that works for a relatively small country (population-wise) wouldn't work as well in a much larger country.

None of the top 10 countries have universal healthcare in the way that Western European countries and British Commonwealth nations do. You could argue that this is because high population introduces a prohibitive cost to universal healthcare.

I'm a nurse in the US and, while I support a single-payer system I'm fully aware of the ramifications of such a system. Mainly that our healthcare system is EXTREMELY understaffed as it is. Add in millions of currently uninsured people who can now seek medical care without prohibitive cost and you'll eventually see the true problems in healthcare. 

This is why I tell all my friends, liberal or conservative, that if they really want to fix the ""healthcare problem"" media buzzword the best way (arguably the only way) is to get into the field for yourself. Conservatives argue that the wait times in Canada are a problem, and I think they're wrong there. But you bring a system like Canada's into the US and suddenly they have a valid point.

If pressed, I definitely consider myself a social liberal who tends to liberal federal representation and conservative local - but honestly it's more fine grain than that - I like certain ideologies in certain offices at certain levels of government. 

Most liberal position: 

Aside from social issues that have recently been addressed by the courts (Gay Marriage) it would probably be legalization of Marijuana (I don't smoke but it is a silly law that was enacted on false data, plus grew up in a college town so know plenty of highly functional smokers, way more functional than the alcoholics I knew) or single payer universal health-care (spent 7 years in Europe courtesy of Uncle Sam, it works and private practice and insurance can operate right along side of it for those who have the means). Take your pick which is more liberal.

Most conservative: 

2nd Amendment, grew up around guns (a shooting range in the basement, served 10 years in the Navy, 3 years in the Guard as 11B/C (Infantry). Though I do have caveats, there should be mandatory screening and training. Most importantly, more stringent investigation into 'accidental' shootings. There are very few accidents and a whole lot of negligence. I know this doesn't sound very conservative to hard-core 2nd amendment types but I feel very strongly that the 2nd is the only Constitutionally guaranteed right which allows a single individual to deprive another of their Natural Right to life which the founding fathers set up the Constitution to protect, so yes some controls need to be in place. I personally don't know any responsible gun owners who think I am out of line with my thinking.

Doesn't fit: 

Welfare reform - not just giving more money or cutting the budget. Rather define the end goal (the stated goal has been to give people a path to self-sufficiency), assess the current program and try something different if the end goal isn't being reached by a solid majority of those in the program (I suspect it isn't). This could very well end up costing more in the short term. Though I have no data to prove it, I suspect that work programs like the depression-era CCC would be a viable to explore.

Capital punishment - I support capital punishment, but think there should be evidentiary requirements if capital punishment is on the table. Corroborated eye witnesses of the act and DNA is where lean currently. I realize there are holes in this idea that need worked through.

Pet peeve: 

Stop cherry picking Amendments that you champion while dumping on another. None are more important than the others - except for explicitly overriding a previous one (Prohibition). Don't treat the 2nd as holy then try to restrict someone based on being a Muslim (1st)....and vice-versa."

I falt on floor because of laughing lol. Guys same for the Bogdan you always think about Bogdan will be a star or Teo will be superstar or something like that.  Firstly you should watch carefully EL games and calm down. You talked about CSKA players and the same roster last winner Euroleague and this year they are strongest candidate again for championship. You guys looking to everybody like next Drazen Petrovic. But they are not gonna be ! But of course Teo is really talented player. He can be back up point guard for right now. I wish he could come NBA early cuz he has talent. 

If you want to watch real talent, look Luka Doncic. He is just 17, played with Real Madrid. Last year he transferred to Real Madrid and played 43 GAMES Spanish Division and Euroleague and he was just 16. He has already big expreiences.  He is one the best player in Europe who can play like Point Forward.

As much as you don't understand why Americans tolerate a private insurance health care industry, I don't understand why non-Americans insist that they do not have rationed care or that they do not have longer wait times when both are factual necessities of nationalized health care systems, just like higher costs and worse access to care is a factual necessity of a privatized insurance-based health care system.

I live half the time in Europe and I deal with both systems.  I think the USA should implement a system like the UK or Canada.  But it's not as simple as people on Reddit think.  The big problem is not insurance companies or drug companies.  The big problem is the salaries that health care providers earn - meaning doctors and nurses and everyone else in the medical industry.  They earn 200-500% in the USA what they earn in most of the rest of the world.  And that is the single biggest reason why USA health care is so much more expensive.

But no politician is ever going to get elected on a campaign to cut salaries of health care workers in half, extend wait times, ration care to those over 70 and implement means testing.  So they blame the convenient boogeymen of drug companies and health insurance companies, and people buy into it."

Point of order, you can't call the entire US defense budget as a NATO expenses since most of our military is off doing things entirely outside of NATO's mission.

Also there's FUCKING NOTHING stopping the US from lowering its defense budget on its own, the fucking GOP has been acting like if we cut one cent out of the budget the Russian tanks will roll into Europe or whatever bullshit hell scenario they've got in mind.

Truth is, NATO members don't have to spend massively on their defense because the threat to their sovereignty is as low as its ever been even with concerns about the Baltics.  NATO's mission is to protect the sovereignty of its members, not be drug along on every war the US gets itself into.  Its not some auxiliary of the US military, its an organization for the territorial defense of its members.  Period.  End of Story.  And its members spend enough to accomplish that mission, just because the US spends more on defense to do a hundred different other things around the world is NOT free riding."

That would explain why he is dressed in modern operater-like gear while seemingly commanding what appears to be American paratroopers from WWII. The patch on their arms doesn't appear to be either 82nd nor 101st, but the spades the one soldier's helmet at 2:55 indicates that he is from the 506th infantry regiment of the 101st airborne. Knowing Kogima's attention to detail, he would not let these inconsistencies slip, so there must be more reasoning behind this likely pertaining to the story. 


The cords coming from Mads leads me to believe that that is how he is controlling these undead soldiers. The cords are similar to the tank that drove over the bridge, which, as far as I can tell, does not seem to be an allied tank from the WWII era judging by its angular chassis and its tread design, leading me to believe that, like Mads himself, might be from a different time period, especially since it drags a cord along that seems to be attached to the soldiers just like Mads. The setting appears to be Europe during WWII as indicated by the cobblestone architecture, sewer system, the building structures in the background, the WWII planes flying overhead and in formation, the WWII American paratroopers (albeit undead) walking around, and the general desolation of the scene suggesting prolonged engagements with heavy shelling and bombing. There are many places in Europe that still maintain architecture reminiscent of the WWII era, so a modern/future/post WWII setting is not out of the question. Maybe all of those undead soldiers were resurrected and used for warfare? 


As for the dude with the baby in a jar (Guillermo Del Toro), He seems to be wearing modern attire and has an interesting badge on his lapel that looks like an outline of the US. Perhaps he's another time traveler or something like Mads in this alternate universe. It's probably fair to assume that the baby is of great value and the object of Mads' search, which might be indicated by the fact that the baby doll was pulsing with an orange glow as it flowed down the sewer-the same orange glow that surrounds Mads and his gear, leading me to believe that he was scanning for ""the baby"" and picked up on the doll's signature which is why he showed up in the sewers to check it out. I'm sure there are many other thematic references and symbolism behind the babies/baby dolls and don't want to go too far out on a limb with speculation, but as far as the bio matter/body parts/tentacles, it seems that there's a lot of death everywhere, especially from animals as you can see the piles of dead dolphins and sharks at 1:59, which could suggest a source for all of that, although it doesn't really explain the tentacles bursting out of the tank and flowing under Mads in the sewer. It could also just be that Kojima is Japanese and likes tentacles and decided to use them to blow our minds. My guess is as good as anyone's. It's Kojima-he unapologetically creates weird shit and we all love him for that. "

Esp funny was the one all mad at our election of Trump, cause he wants us to go back to clean coal ""again"".

I wasnt aware that the US had ever gotten off of coal, since it still provides most of the power in ""Murica"".

I assume this comment was from yet another ignorant one living in one of these awful places in Europe, that thinks everything they do is a zillion times better than anything the US does. Same attitude as Californians.

And guess where the greatest environmental mess is in the US? California.

So much for their limitless wisdom.

Clean coal is better than dirty coal, gasoline is better than diesel. 

Deal with reality, and learn to love nuclear power, if you want clean air.

Solar and wind is hardly worth the effort and expense. It will solve nothing.

Short of nuclear, better to develop clean coal and oil. Really smart people would mine the frozen methane and burn that as fuel. Turns the worst greenhouse gas into CO2, which a lot less worse than methane.

Would it hurt anything to clean it up at least a bit?

Or is all this too complex to understand?  Take the simple way out, quote an american cartoon and say its all ""Murica""!

And yes, ive seen the mass transit shit, even in the US. It always results in worse traffic, insane high prices, congestion and business failure. This makes people prefer to drive their own cars. 

I mean I wouldnt ride a bus or train if they payed me $50/hour.

No ty to all the rude ""people"" loud ""music"" glaring threats and their sweaty stinking bodies.

I drive my own way. Make it to the destination 5x faster, no stinking people acting like the animals they are, can have my own stereo going playing whatever I want to hear, and the AC or heat as I like it.

Mass transit, and everything else that it creates or destroys, is a nightmare.

But London thinks this is the way to the future. So do the big cities in the US. They are ALL wrong on every level.

To clean up the air, make it efficient and fast to drive. Think like the autobahn. It doesnt matter how efficient any vehicle is, as long as its sitting around in traffic, its wasting huge amounts of fuel and polluting the air. Getting zero miles per gallon. Extra bonus. When people are allowed to drive at warp 10, they end up burning far less fuel in the end. That causes less greenhouse emmisions.

Screw the fancy overpriced choo-choo trains which ruin everything wherever that ugly idea appears. (always has, always will)

None of them anywhere on the planet can even be self sustaining. They charge really high prices, but lose money anyway, so now everyone has to pay extra taxes to keep them running.

Since coal usually provides the electricity they use...  lol
May as well just be a bunch of cars anyway. One form of fossil fuel is the same as the next. Hiding the real power source under a nice new overpriced, tax supported choochoo train with electric motors and pretty paint changes nothing. They eat basically oil anyway.

Pre-emptive to ones who may comment ""hurr-durr""... its all cheaper anyway cause 50 people on one lightrail car is more efficient. 

In the real world, the vast majority of the time that the thing is running, each car may have 10 people. They still run late at night too, with zero people.

My car doesnt go out at night and drive itself around wasting fuel and money while I sleep. Mass transit does. Including not just the super expensive ""electric"" light rail, but also all the nice shiny new pretty diesel stinking busses. Ive been on buses in the city at night after classes at college, years ago. Could have been driving a car for less money for me and a hella lot less money to the taxpayer and the horrific pollution the things (diesel buses) put out, while eating fuel at some ungodly rate.

Zero riders, but myself. What a waste of money and resources.

This kind of thinking is why London is so congested and polluted.

Same deal with the US cities.

Out of control socialism really.

the poor who cant afford to buy a car, must be provided to go to their shit jobs at McDonalds. Which pays so little that they cant afford a car.
Who wins? McDonalds.
ghetto types who want to go do some crime, like robbing homes in places they could never afford to drive to, since they dont have a car...
welcome mass transit too.
The crime rate always goes way higher once mass transit is available.

I am fortunate to live out in the middle of the desert. Its amazing that I even have internet. Everyone around here has lots of guns.

There is no mass transit. If you want to get around, better have a really reliable car, or several. The rate of crime is zero. It has been zero for the past 4 years. The speed limit is 75 MPH. Add 10 more before you get a ticket.

Kinda like the good parts of Germany.

The main artery from California to the rest of the US is nearby, interstate 10. Uncountable people and business drivers on that thing, all day, every day. Provides a good deal of all the food the US has, and also most of the crap imported from China to everyone else in the US. Very high speed driving, no mass transit crap. Pollution level nothing.

Both gasoline and diesel is very nice at 75 MPH, with no stop and go stuff going on. This is what the cities all over the world should aim for.

Make it very fast and efficient for cars and trucks. The level of smog will drop by 10x within a week. This would naturally take money, but so does their half thought solutions, more expensive since the old ways dont work. People will spend less money on fuel and waste less time sitting in traffic, a boost to the economy.

I am fed up with the USA trying to dominate the world and the West in general wanting to impose our way of lives on the whole planet, saying who's good, who's bad, etc. We often get involved in wars for lousy reasons and our system try to portray this in a completely different fashion. I see Russia as an European power that stands up against the USA and are actually saying ""no"" when my country, France, has been a slave for a long time now.

So, I respect Russia's point of view about a multipolar word and I respect the fact that they stand. Besides, I hate the politically correctness and minorities whining we have in the west and Russia is also a countermodel with much more traditional values and strong national feelings, when we in the western Europe are just plain willing to send our countries to the toilets and let them be replaced by non discriminatory areas where gay pride and sharia would live alonside each other with people communicating in a horrible globish english. You see what I mean I guess.

I am not really pro-Russian actually, I'm pro France and pro Europe, but not European Union. I'd just like us to be more neutral towards the USA and Russia and bring our own voice. 

I also can't stand the media bias and Putin bashing. It's too much, seriously. When 100% people are saying the same thing all the time while we are supposed to be in a democracy with ""free press"" and millions of French citizen have actually some sympathy for Putin, you know there is something wrong. Then, you just have to listen to the way they present the Aleppo siege nowadays and everything is clear, they take us citizens for dummies and have absolutely no shame in presenting what they want to that it satisfies their own views, the same than the elites in power actually, curiously enough.

I hope my answer is understandable, it's quite complex for me to explain why I feel sympathy but I guess I got at least some elements covered (multipolar world system, standing up to the USA when they try to mingle in everyone's affair, proud people, media bashing in my country, etc.)"

We have been marinated in PR from the establishment and their faithful repeaters that we have this mystical ""influence"" over Turkey. It's been disproven again and again, but it's a zombie idea. No matter how many times it dies, it keeps getting resurrected.

Turkey is fundamentally a stable country. The reaction against the coup showed that the people was pretty much united against any non-democratic interference, from left to right. It's a strongly nationalistic country. The fear that Turkey will ""fall apart"" if we don't guide them with our white hands is hilarious. 

Then there's the BS about the Turkey deal being important for stopping refugee flows. The reality is that closing the balkan border was what did it. Sweden introduced border controls overnight. The result? 90% of border entrants fell within a week.

The main problem is really the pull factors. Merkel is still holding out until the end, but whether she wants it or not, the forces are moving against her, both within and outside the country. 

Turkey will likely become an independent agent, moving away from NATO into an uneasy sphere where it will move towards Russia, China and the EU in equal measure depending on the issue. It could also entertain military adventurism in the Middle East, as we've seen with incursions into Iraq and Syria lately. 

Whatever the excuse, its long past time to cut ties with the country. There is a secular minority, which is of significant size, but they are simply being outbred by the Anatolian ignorants and the kurds. It is they who nursed fantasies of Turkey becoming European. 

It was a beautiful dream but now its time to close the chapter. No more delusions. Allow Turkey to once again become the Middle Eastern, pro-Islamist country it has been for most of its modern history. They are only returning to their roots after a brief detour. We should have nothing to do with them other than cordial relations. No close partnerships. No pretentions of accession. "

You might have more luck trying to narrow this down by brand. How narrow do you need the boots to be? I find the Bay and Browns (and maybe Nordstrom) carry a decent selection of boots that are relatively narrow (or come in B as well as M width) and waterproof. For example: Michael Kors, Aquatalia ($), Blondo, Artica, Geox, etc. For some cheaper options, you could also try places like Naturalizer, Ronson's, Ingledews, etc. that sell more European brands which often fit narrower than North American brands.

This is precisely why it is entirely wrong when both Conservative America and Liberal America sees  Europe as something like an Ultra-Liberal America. We are actually conservative for exactly this reason. In the 1960's America provided state healthcare programs for the needy (Medicare, Medicaid) and most European countries provided state healthcare programs for all. The result is that Americans see it as a charity to the poor, Europeans see it like customers do, a service the damn bureaucrats provide _me_ for my taxes and I raise hell if it is not good enough. 

In short, European state programs - they are not welfare programs for precisely this reason - are based on a conservative spirit, they want to put the taxpayer into an ""I am your customer, serve me well"" mood. American welfare programs are more or less explicitly created as a charity for the poor. They put the taxpayer into the ""this is what I pay for the poor"" mood.

This, in my opinion, is a perfect political flametower. The American approach puts liberals into a holiness-signalling mood like ""let's be all nice and pay healthcare for the poor"" and it puts conservatives into a ""no enforced charity, take your dirty hands out of my wallet"" mood and alt-righters into a ""this is a racial tax"" mood and it is a perfect flamethrower because it is very good for making everybody hate each other. While universal programs actually pot everybody into a ""I the taxpayer am the customer of the state, want to be served well"" mood. Of course we have enough flamethrowers still, like immigration or ethnic nationalism. But this is the reason why education or healthcare is not a flamethrower here. Because our left was less keen on signalling holiness (i.e. forming it as a charity) and accepted forming it as a business transaction between the taxpayer and the government and forming it that way it acceptable for the right."

One of they most common arguments against the mandatory Swedish (and Finnish) is that the students don't have any motivation to learn the language and thus don't learn it. The followup argument is that the students have no use of the second domestic language. I.e the language they studied for several years yet have no command over and can't use it in a real conversation.  

It's a huge leap to conclusion that the second domestic language is useless to learn. studying something you don't learn at all is by definition useless especially a language.

Even in the USA the biggest states like Texas and California can push their agenda when they disagree with Washington, the Californian policy on climate change is a good example.

The balance we will strike in the EU puts more power in the hands of the member states, but it is still part of that spectrum. It won't be set in stone either, as long as the EU exists we will be debating that and that is okay too. Sometimes the EU will do more and sometimes lees. The EU doesn't have to become a new state or take on most of the powers of the state, it just has to provide member states with value. It does put a limit on the scale of EU cooperation and integration, but nothing in life is free, sovereignty has its price too. That might mean that the euro or the Schengen zone are unsustainable, but that isn't all the EU provides to its members.

The issue I have with this video is that the interviewee is suggesting that the EU could safeguard democratic institutions in member states. That is not certain. In Spain there are signs that the EU or to be precise its predecessors put an end to the political ambitions of the army. In Poland and Hungary we are seeing that the EU can't stop an elected government from implementing policies that put democratic government under pressure. What is happening there is not entirely unlike what Erdogan is doing in Turkey, though Erdogan is taking a more direct approach.

Are you gonna play it ""pure""?

The only mod I use is ""Grim Dawn Item Assistant"".

I held off on using it when I first started playing because I wanted to play within the limits.

I have since decided there is no point. 

All it does is give you unlimited stash space and a VERY useful and easy way to search through the loot you've collected.

It can filter by type of piece, bonuses, damage types, etc.

Seeing as this game gives you a lot of gear that your character can use but one of your other 16 can, the stash space given is woefully inadequate if you are an altaholic.

Take a look and see if you find it useful. The only drawback is how you feel about it.

A tip:

I ruined my first char because I didn't know how things worked in this game. Since then I've made quite a few and this rule has been the way to go: dump only as many attribute points as you need into physique to wear what you need for your following upgrade. 

Attribute points and mastery points are 100% unrecoverable (unless you use a mod or character editor), but the skill points and devotion points are all 100% refundable (they have a higher cost the more you refund).

Experiment. The game doesn't really get ""punishing"" until very late game.

Resistances are KEY in this game. If you are dying a lot, then take a look at them. That'll be your problem :]

And welcome!

Edit:

I also recommend, if you are going to play this a lot, to get the Crucible DLC. I won't tell you why now (cuz it may make you want to do this already), but it is super useful for alts (and end game farming gear).

Yes you're supposed to lose a lot of games. Everyone does. You're not supposed to be losing &gt;90% of your games though. 

Here are some tips I give all the newbies:

1. Watch Trumps teachings, make the decks, play them. [This is the Link.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjprrvlbAcbVjzHsnH9PjDX). They're still good enough to be competitive at the bottom of the ladder. I'm an EU player, but I sometimes play arena's on the US server. Last month I played Trumps basic decks to rank 17 US while completing quests. Someone who's actually trying should be able to do better.

2. Play Ranked mode more than casual. Casual is full of people playing strong decks for practise. As a result, ranked is the best place for a new player to find a fair game. Be aware though, the monthly reset means there will be more strong players at the lower end of the ladder for the first week or so of every month.

3. Get all your classes to 10 to unlock all the basic cards. Then get a class to 20 to unlock the tavern brawl (weekly extra pack.) Reroll 40gold quests as much as possible. Do the [hidden quests](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Quest#Unique_quests).

4. Don't expect to hit legend without investing serious time in the game. You probably are losing a fair number of games to people with better decks and better collections, however you're losing the majority of games due to mistakes your making that you probably don't even know you're making.

Welcome to Hearthstone, Good luck!"

You cannot translate the modern concepts to the past without taking the whole shebang with it. Obviously my comment on drawing the line somewhere in the middle of the six velayets was figuratively, not technically, as to even trying to find out what could have been a real line drawn had there been no genocide or confiscation of arms or the other myriad of measures placed on the Armenians, and even including these measures without the genocide, no one knows how the lines would have been drawn, because you bet Armenians would have made a good fight defending what they considered to be their lands. Even during the genocide they put a massive fight in Van, holding the city up for a considerable amount of time. You are approaching this massive question of what-if only using unreliable and dubiously drawn up statistics (Fuat Dundar gets into detail) and using the argument of democracy without the rest of the modern concepts to *determine* how the lines should have been drawn. I have literally brought you many arguments against your supposition among them the example of the Karabakh and Azeri as a prime example that in the modern times representation is not taken away no matter what and that human rights is a thing. Look at other examples in Europe, such as the Catalans in Spain, and try to apply the same understanding and concepts of over a century ago to the current problem. You would have military oppression, irregular Spanish groups terrorising Catalans, economic hardships and taxes, outright massacres if Catalans dared to speak up, and finally an outright genocide and then in the year 2100 someone comes and says that Catalans had no right to Catalonia because [numbers](http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/cataluna/elecciones-catalanas/2015-09-15/mas-de-un-millon-de-catalanes-no-nacidos-en-cataluna-decidiran-las-elecciones_1016448/)(and this doesn't even take into account where the parents are from as ""ethnicity"" is not kept or recorded, but the migrant population from other autonomous communities to Catalonia in the past few decades outnumbers the local Catalan population, where a significant portion of the population have close ancestors from other regions). All of this is also only taking into account that there are no other factors involved in state determination. Ownership and citizenship means a LOT today. You cannot go today subjugate, massacre, or deport and void the representation of [the minority Catalans who want independence](http://www.politico.eu/article/record-level-of-support-for-catalan-independence-poll-spain-catalonia/) and then claim that since they were a minority Catalans do not ""deserve"" Catalonia in a zero-sum game of either or all. The place is still called Catalonia, it is one of the widest autonomous regions in Europe, and it is not going anywhere even if it never gets independence. This is precisely why modern self-determination concept generally applies to people under oppression and not just because, a concept which applied to the Armenians back then but doesn't seem to be applicable to the Catalans. There is a middle ground in the modern world because of rights, some of which was precisely what the Armenians were fighting for in their own home land, rights which were brutally taken away from them. So please don't bring up your feeble stick of an excuse of democracy in a land where savagery was the ultimate solution to an inconvenient problem.

Previous from the Lula administration, our world highlights were a diplomatic skirmish with Britain during the XIX Century (whih i'll not detail to not prolong the text, but, if you're curious, it's called [Questão Christie] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest%C3%A3o_Christie).

Only now we are beginning to be relevant, heading the BRICS with China and playing some relevant parts in the international diplomacy (although we did fail on the agreement with Iran and Turkey and our lobby to get a permament seat in the UN's Security Council also failed miserably).

In fact, I see reddit complaining a lot about Trump, focusing on his agressive rhetoric, but the most important point of the borning Trump administration is how he's pushing away US long term allies. I can say straight from here that we were a reliable ally down in the south. Even during the 13 years of left-wing government, US-Brazil relations improved, China was still in second plan as a business partner. Now, China bought Argentina's ferries and most of the infrastructure reforms and we're closing a lot of trade and polictical agreements with them. The tendency is the BRICS step further and further away from the US and, as far as I can see from other users, Europe will also be pushed away. From down here, I can't understand fully what's going on in the US, I can only try to understand the urges of the US, but, as a foreigner, I must say: you should be less worried about internal struggles and more worried about the US being isolated from the world.

La pensionata risponde a logiche vecchie. La mia personale linea è che non si può combattere la disinformazione ma si può solo fare disinformazione in direzione della verità, ovvero sostenere fatti reali, posizioni etiche e progressiste usando gli stessi strumenti e la stessa dialettica dei disinformatori.

TERA was a really great game for the first month or so for me, exploring the pretty sights, meeting players and making friends/guildies, as well as playing the diverse mix of classes and getting them to level cap. Certainly a game well worth trying out. Best of all, it's *FREE*. For those still unsure, I'd say give it a go. I didn't regret trying it out, and I'm sure you'll enjoy some aspects of the game. :)

How about this. If you want to play with them, you get put into the pool of players with 180+ ping with them?

I never proposed we shouldn't allow them to play on the EU or US servers. I said that there should be a separate player pool for people who get high pings across every server. This way, only people with 100 or lower ping get matched together, and people with 100 or up get matched together. IF you want to play with them you volunteer to be put into high ping games.

You really, really don't want to live as the wrong sex. Studies suggest more than 40% of trans people attempt suicide. A woman wrote a book about 18 months trying to live as a man, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Made_Man_(book) - she got depressed and had to stop. Trans women give up all the benefits you associate with being male to live as some of the most marginalized women in society, and usually still see it as an improvement. Gender is a really, really deeply rooted thing within you, and you can't mess with it - any advantages one gender or the other has are tiny compared to living as the gender you are.

Consider moving to Western Europe (perhaps Scandinavia or the Netherlands). There is less physical assault of the type you mentioned (not none), and you'll feel like much less of a target while having a girlfriend. Get a breast reduction if you want one. Get yourself into a social environment where you feel safer, then think again about whether to participate in activities that increase your confidence or self-defence skills.

&gt;&gt; A list was made for fires that were definitely started by arson, and it includes most of the big ones.

&gt;Palestinian groups claim Israel as their land and blame them for destroying their land, while literally destroying the land. That's terror for you. Although I consider myself closer to the Palestinian position, as a Turk I understand that terror can never go with noble or rightful political positions. I support Kurdish national movement in Turkey but they make it really hard to be on their side sometimes too.

Kurds deserve a state. They'll have to settle and compromise, but they will get it eventually. Turkey, understandably, will fight it, but it's inevitable.

&gt;&gt; far left Europeans and greater Arab-Muslim world that are fundamentally based on anti-Semitic beliefs.

&gt;I don't think it's fair to throw these two in the same basket. I consider myself a marxist, and most marxists here are on the Palestinian side but they usually want the 67 borders (Or for some dreamers, a united Palestine where Jews and Arabs live in peace. Great entiment but doesn't seem realistic) while Islamist groups literally want ethnic cleansing. 

'67 borders were a relevant framework in Oslo. No more. By now, the sense that the Palestinians are entitled to anything they claim is absurd. How can a people so entrenched in fighting and refusing every partition agreement feel such a great sense of entitlement to any border they choose is beyond me. In reality, what will happen is that this mentality will lead them to getting practically nothing as Israel will not be strong-armed in to any deal that will lead to outright chaos. What foreigners *believe* should  happen here is very different from the facts on the ground.

As to lumping those two together: the lump applies to the arguments produced and not particularly the people and their motives. I do find peculiar that the end result of course is both groups marching down European cities bashing Israel together.

&gt;&gt; I'm aware we are treating the wounded people that are placed in our care regardless of affiliation.

&gt;Regime soldiers too? If they do, that's a really nice olive branch. I personally don't like helping jihadists, but can't argue with the humanist logic there if it applies to both sides.

I have played in 1-2k mmr brackets with my friend's account and winning by playing very gank intensive heroes is definitely possible. Now if you pick a non-core like dazzle, or rubick -- heroes that depend on team to be most effective-- you are essentially putting your game winning potential in your team's hands. You might be understanding the game by watching professional games and trying to replicate their actions, but know that their metagame is very different from yours. They know that most effective way to play non-cores is by making space early on so a hero who can exploit that space can eventually capitalize on it. But the game you're playing in, people are not good enough to capitalize on that space. You know this, so you use that information.  
So what should you do? You should be picking ganking heroes at your bracket(they require highest amount of game sense imo). Alternatively, you should be picking aggresive scaling supports who also do well with farm. If you are better skillwise, you should be getting a lot of kills/assists early game. Then that should be converted to proper items later on. This should be your general game plan.

You face the issue of putting too much faith in your team to play like you think the game is to be played. Your game sense might be correct, but you make the mistake of thinking your space making will have an impact on your carry's farm. If your carry can't last hit, all your efforts are just wasted. You might as well have taken last hits in his lane and he would have performed no worse. Inability to device an accurate game winning plan even after knowing this is probably what is losing you games. 

I'll get into some specifics. Just a few weeks back I played a skywrath mage game on 3.6k EU server. In my opinion, solo skill level of EU is quite low compared with SEA, but they make up for it by expressing a general attitude to play as a team. Anyway, so I pick support Sky, zoning out the offlaner and other standard stuff till their carry abandoned in first 5 min. So my team is playing very confident but we start getting owned 4v5. Our Luna and OD were feeding constantly to their mid Lina, supp Pudge and Legion. I knew each and everytime when they were gonna die. I even warded in all the appropriate locations. But since my team was just bad skillwise, they kept feeding.  
What I did? I changed my gameplan. I switched to carry role. Because I had a better game sense, I was always able to predict fights and positioned myself accordingly. I finished the game 6- slotted with a score of 15/6/x. I won us the game because I re-evaluated my game winning strategy. No way an AC rushing Luna was gonna win me the game. No way a 0/3 OD was gonna recover from that start without getting lucky in fights. So I stepped up my game. I'm outside now, but I'll post Dotabuff of that game as soon as I reach home.

If you can link some game of yours, I am 100℅ certain I can tell you how you would have won that game purely based on game sense. 

But if you're truly desperate to gain mmr, you should probably focus on improving last hits and other obvious areas like farming and laning. Flexibility is the easiest way to gain mmr. Skills like game sense are too abstract to improve on and require you to play and think differently to win. Sometimes it is just not possible. For instance if you are playing after a bad day at work, you just can't put 100℅ of your brain into the game; and when you can't, all the skills that make you win are just gone. And you in fact become far worse a player than you are because you are not able to use your skillset. 


EDIT: https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2747427345 The game I talked about. PS. Skywrath is one of the heroes on which you can play core without being good at last hits

Europe is doing better overall it's true, but crossing our arms and blaming the Chinese is dumb

They still do. It doesn't matter whether they emit more because they have a high population or a high consumption: it will cause global warming just the same.

In addition, they have high emissions because they have pursued a policy of concentrating industrial activity in China. If they want the benefits, they also should take the responsibility.

&gt;especially since most of the damage has been caused by the western world. China has only recently industrialized, while we've been polluting hard for decades.

Their emissions were spread out over a larger time, giving them more time to decay and therefore they contribute relatively less to present-day carbon emissions. Conversely China can now also enjoy the advanced technology, that is the result of that activity, so they are already enjoying the benefits to some extent. Ultimately, we have to do something about emissions now: it makes no sense to masochistically self-flagellate and blow billions to avoid 1 or 2% of global emissions, if China, Indonesia, India etc. could do the same at a fraction of the cost. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything, we should just continue on the path of eliminating fossil fuels, and when that's done start with sequestration, but that doesn't mean China can pollute all they want in the meantime."

In theory, you could manage with Swedish only (and it's definitely a bonus if you know Swedish too in Finland) but Swedish-speaking communities tend to be otherwise quite insular and even harder for outsiders to get into. 

Finding gainful employment can be a challenge, as it is to us Finns too, and coming from elsewhere you won't have the same networks while lack of Finnish skills will restrict your options. But many others have managed it so this shouldn't be a deal-breaker, just an added complication and a challenge you need to take realistically. 

What I hear from many foreign-born folks is that getting ""accepted"" by the Finns seems very hard, but sometimes or possibly even often this is just an illusion because we aren't very outgoing or open to *anyone.* If you're accustomed to different social milieu, we can probably seem very distant or even actively hostile. A friend of mine used to work with international exchange, and one of her stock warnings to those students who lived with a Finnish family was that ""they don't hate you even if they are quiet all the time, including during the meals."" Apparently, more outgoing Southern Europeans in particular had had hard time with that...

Then there will be those who don't really accept you no matter how hard you try, and you'll remain ""the American"" or ""yankee"" to them forever. But those people can be safely ignored and it's not as if they go out of their way to make your life miserable. (Except perhaps when drunk, which for these folks tends to be a common state of affairs.)

So, in general I believe your odds of actually integrating are definitely higher than average simply because you are accustomed to cold and dark. If you can survive the inevitable culture shock of moving to a different country and trying to create a life there, you should be fine. I for one would be just happy if you ended up somewhere here along the Turku archipelago. "

The families of the Operation Valkyrie members were shunned after the war. They were often seen as traitors or Nestbeschmutzer (someone who fouls his own nest). After the war it was popular to say that Hitler and the Nazis seduced the german people and lead them in a war under false premises. But if _those_ people who resisted were able to see and even had the courage to act despite the real danger for their life which excuse does anyone else have? That's touching a very sore spot and this is one of the reasons why german resistance fighters were almost invisible in the german post-war society. At least during the first decades.

Elsers history was almost forgotten for decades. There was nothing that remembered of him in his hometown. No memorial or museum. This has changed in the last decades.

Edit: I even found an [english article about it.](http://europe.newsweek.com/look-behind-plot-kill-hitler-263200?rm=eu)

&gt;Today, the 200 or so participants of the plot are treated as heroes. But for a long time they were considered ­traitors. Dr. Axel Smend, a corporate lawyer, recalls how his mother was often called in to meetings with his teachers because of his and his siblings’ poor grades. “Once,” recalls Smend, “she mentioned to my maths teacher that my father had been a member of July 20th. ‘Well, then it’s no surprise that he’s bad at maths’, my teacher responded. ‘He’s the son of a traitor.’”

&gt;Smend, who was four months old when his father died, sheds a tear as he recounts the painful meeting with his teacher, one of many indignities that Smend’s 26-year-old mother and her three young children underwent. Neighbours avoided the family; “traitor widows” were, a court later decided, not eligible for the pension every other war widow received. Renate Smend didn't discover that her husband had been executed until the postman delivered a small package containing Günther’s wedding ring, a notebook he’d kept at Plötzensee, and the bill for his execution.

&gt;Von Trott, says Müller-Plantenberg, knew that the plot could fail. “He always told my mother, ‘If something goes wrong, please tell the world about us’.” The widows tried, but even after the war many ordinary Germans considered the July 20th members traitors. In a 1951 survey, only 43 percent of men and 38 percent of women had a positive opinion of them, and in a 1956 survey a mere 18 percent of the respondents approved of naming a school after von Stauffenberg or the civilian leader of the plot, former Leipzig mayor Carl Friedrich Goerdeler. A planned law granting the plotters’ widows pensions was never introduced, although, as a compromise, the families eventually received an annual sum. Amid such disapproval, one of the few conspirators who had escaped the gallows, a young lawyer named Fabian von Schlabrendorff, took on the thankless task of shoring up support for the shunned families. “He received death threats until his death [in 1980],” recalls his son Jürgen-Lewin, a banker. “Germany had lost the war but Nazism still permeated the country.”

---



&gt;Gradually, the so-called “traitors” gained respect. In 1967, Berlin politicians decided that the Bendlerblock should feature a memorial to the asssassination attempt, and in the 1980s a resistance documentation centre was added. By 1970, 39 percent of Germans viewed the would-be assassins positively. In 2004, only 5 percent of Germans said they opposed or despised the plotters. Today, the July 20th families’ association, which initially disbursed the government compensation, makes presentations to schools and jointly organises the commemorations.

&gt;Since 2002, German military recruits have sworn their oaths on July 20th. This year’s speakers at the Bendlerblock were the Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and von Stauffenberg’s oldest child, retired general Berthold Schenk von Stauffenberg.

&gt;“When the Bundeswehr [German military] introduced the [July 20th oath] I thought, of course!” exclaims Müller-Plantenberg. She’s not resentful of her father’s fate, arguing instead that today’s Germany strives for the values he died for: “democratisation, the rule of law and the protection of minorities.”"

I mean funding for a public university often works in a way that you get local/state taxes which pay in part for the uni. Then you got federal taxes which go to the federal government, get redistributed there and end up in part back at the university. (In case of Europe you might get EU funding as well). 

This surely can't be as effective as a University saying we need this amount of dollars per student, student x, y, z can't afford this, so we'll pay for them (and raise tuition fees for the rest, like for example Stanford). Or perhaps if the school doesn't do it, there would be a lot of charities/richer families willing to pay for the poorer students. Some schools offer studying tuition-less if you sign a contract saying you pay a percentage of your later income for an agreed amount of years (if you're earning more than a certain amount). Additionally a credit would be always an option, but interest-rates could be quite high without government backing and dependent on the subject you're majoring.

I'm certain all these options would be more effective and fairer than being forced to pay it as taxes."

Here's [some maps](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36616028) of the 'bubble' you're talking about. Looks like a pretty big bubble. In fact it looks like a large part of the entire country except London is part of this bubble. Or is it that London is the bubble and Londoners don't realise they're on the inside looking out?

&gt; Islam and its practises as concurrent and compatible with our own.

You can believe this if you like but it's demonstrably untrue as yet. We can evidence the social unrest in areas with large, growing islamic communities. We can point to the fact that these aren't isolated incidents but rather we see the same story in all areas of the country. Actually all across Europe if you want to go that far. Not just inner cities or rundown areas, not just rural areas, not just working class towns and not just gentrified university towns. All kinds of places and demographics, the only common factor being... islam. 

Or we can be more specific and say look at something like the exceptions made for halal meat. We had to make a small exception in the legislation regarding humane slaughter of animals - an EU directive actually that we adopted. The small exception was to allow for cultural practices in some instances. Because the islamic practice was not *compatible* with our own laws. 

Now guess what. It's not a ""small exception"" anymore as it was intended. Halal meat is now the default option in universities, hospitals, public buildings with cafeterias, schools, colleges and in most ready meals. 

Another 'small exception' was that somehow they also got an exemption from having to label it halal. No doubt they realised the majority of the population wouldn't like being told all their meat is being slaughtered in a cruel and inhumane way because some cunt wants to say a prayer while it bleeds to death. 

Don't be telling me about how islam is compatible. It's only compatible if you're willing to bend over backwards and change the rules to accommodate them. 

&gt; slagging these people off in the media every few, or worse kicking them out ramps the paranoia up more

When they stop blowing stuff up it will stop being in the news. 

&gt; Talking about the ills of the Muslim community when benefit fraud, sexual abuse, inequivalence of females, crime, 'atrocities' happen up and down the country no matter what colour your skin is or what language your god likes to be prayed too.

Untrue. Plenty of evidence that unemployment rates are highest amongst islamic communities. Even higher amongst women in those communities. Plenty of evidence that those demographics are disproportionately represented in crime statistics, especially fraud and benefits fraud. Plenty of evidence that domestic violence against women and children is endemic in those communities. And lets not even talk about sexual abuse.

Immigrants are victims more than a problem, as global warming and conservative religious values destroy societies along the equator pushing people to more successful northern climes (Norte America and Europe). The result is havoc for people most vulnerable in those northern nations--- social welfare stretching to the breaking point while native born see a labor pool diluted with low wage workers. Tradesmen like myself see this first hand. White color professionals are blinded by their security while those guys stacking boxes at Walmart also sees it first hand. Obamacare oddly gives you another perspective as the cheaper plans force you to go to hospitals that only cater to poorer people where most of the doctors and nurses are foreign born. I don't mind it so much. Heck, in places like West Virginia you can't get native born doctors to work but when that laid off Coal miner knows that his Pakistani doctor makes 20 times what he makes and Bosnian nurse makes 8 times his income (now he down to SSi or odd jobs) the resentment builds. 

I am saying Legal Immigration rates should be cut and more educational opportunities be given to Americans rather than letting Capitalists import ready made professionals from where's ever. A grand bargain: give a little red meat to the ReThugs in exchange for a better safety net and training for Americans. Even Fareed Zakara, a favorite commentator of mine sees the problem-- the percentage of foreign born in USA is extremely high historically in a time of middle class decline. Just because an awful shithead like Ann Coulter is spewing out venom about doesn't excuse Democrats from ignoring the problem.

Ilmainen neuvo Nokialle: Kukaan ei valmista enää puhelimia nörteille/pelaajille/tietokoneen tehokäyttäjille. Olisitte laittaneet tuohon piilossa olevan fyysisen näppäimistön (esim. HTC Desire Z), infrapunaledin ja jopa pienen FM-lähettimen joka on ollut EU:ssa laillinen jo 10 vuotta. Kuten HTC Desire Z:n kohdalla kävi tehokäyttäjät koodaisivat ensimmäisen viikon aikana Nintendo-emulaattoreihinsa näppäimistötuen, infrapunaledistä tehtäisiin yleiskaukosäädin ja radiolähettimellä voisi striimata musiikkikirjastonsa suoraan autoradioon ilman kalliita bluetooth-hässäköitä tai johtoja. Mainostajina toimisivat internetin näkyvät tietotekniikkaihmiset ja puhelin vietäisiin pian käsistä kuten ""hankalasti"" ostettavat OnePlussat.

Wikileaks show US meddling way way before any ""revolution"" started in any of those.

&gt;Russia did complain about Ukraine joining NATO starting from around 2007-2008 when they got oil rich and got too big for their shoes.

Russia warned US that Ukraine is ethnically divided country with strong polarising views on NATO and that any push for NATO would lead to instability/civil war. And exactly that has happened. 

&gt; And frankly its none of their fucking business whether that would happen or not.

So if Russia decides to start a movement to overthrow a government in Canada it would be none of US business? Or lets say baltics where there is sizeable Russian minority. Am i to expect your outrage when non baltic country sends military units there to prevent possible local Russian uprising? If you want i can link you few dozen threads for you to voice your outrage that its ""none of their business""? 
&gt; In previous year they sucked welfare off Europe and US

lol what?

&gt; If this was the plan all along Ukraine would be in NATO already.

You realise this is real world and not some tv show we are talking about? Ukraine didnt have any leadership willing to join NATO until now and now its impossible due to active conflict and border dispute with Russia. 

&gt; US can stick nuclear missles within 2 meters of the Russian border if they wanted to.

Again.. real world, not TV.

&gt; Nobody in NATO wants Ukraine there. EU doesn't want them. US doesn't give a shit about them... 

Just wtf are you smoking? You would be correct had you said that since the conflict started they arent wanted anymore. But before... They were part of NATO membership plan as well as EU passed a resolution for allowing Ukrainian membership in 2014. How the hell can you voice an opinion while knowing so little? 

&gt; but Russia decided to start a war there because of half-baked conspiracy theories.

Real world, not tv.

&gt;Now they're enjoying quasi-state that's run by the thugs in Donbass,

They are ""enjoying"" exactly what Russia warned would happen. 

&gt;and vitriolic hatred of 30 million people in Ukraine. Mission Accomplished. Geopolitical victory all around. If US was truly evil, this would be exactly the end result they would have wanted, and Russia made it happen for them.

If we look at eastern europe hysterical hatred of Russia in Ukraine would have happened even if Russia did absolutely nothing. All it needs is US sphere of influence and anything that US perceives as a geopolitical rival is hated. Just drop by in /r/europe if you want a sample of that. Baltics and Poland are most vocal groups spewing hatred there. "
