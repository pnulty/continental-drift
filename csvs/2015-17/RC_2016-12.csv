The conflict is that he wants to have a relaxing vacation, while I want to ensure that we do some mountain hiking.

The biggest issue is that I have this tendency of wanting to see and do everything, especially if there are a ton of hikes and there is a lot to see. So I need to find a place that is exciting and has a lot of fun things to do, but not too many things so that I will be angry that I missed out.

Not with 7 hours to spend, dude. Though 10am to 7pm looks like 9 hours to me :) Come back when you have 3 more days on top of this one. 

Take a look at [this](http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/what.to.do.with.2.3.or.5.days.in.budapest) and try to do slightly less than half of the 2-day one. With just 7 hours, I would buy a 24h pass costing 1650Fts. 

10.00 Make your way to Buda Castle (from Népliget bus station with M3 subway line, then bus line #16 from Deák Ferenc tér) 10.30 Start at the Castle, Fisherman's bastion, Matthias church, walk around, take pics of the panorama and Ruszwurm patisserie is a nice place for coffee and cake. 12.00 Then descend the hill with the funicular, walk across the Chain bridge and toward the Parliament, checking out the Shoes on the Danube bank memorial, commemorating the Jews who were shot into the river at that location during WWII. 12.30 If you are EU citizens bring your student IDs, the Parliament's entry ticket will be 1200Ft then, which is more than okay and makes the visit worth it (crown jewels + the building itself is beautiful too). [Buy your tickets online in advance](http://latogatokozpont.parlament.hu/en/jegyvasarlas) to skip the long queues and and guarantee yourself a place on one of the guided tours(45mins), like the English language one starting at 13.00. 14.00 Have a late and **quick** lunch at the party district (Király utca and vicinity), if you want Hungarian, [Kőleves](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d797853-Reviews-Koleves-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html) is decent and affordable. 15.30 Check out St. Stephen's Basilica and then stroll along Andrássy avenue, maybe taking the subway all the way to Heroes' Square (Hősök tere). If you are still not too behind on this itinerary (you probably will be), you can finish the day off backtracking your steps and having a few beers and maybe a shot of pálinka at Szimpla. 

What I outlined is definitely rushed and skips a ton of places, but that's what you have to work with. Have some roaming data enabled so you can use Google Maps, Tripadvisor, etc. so you don't waste time being lost. "

&gt;As Trump prepares to enter the White House, many pundits have concluded that “political correctness” fuelled the populist backlash sweeping Europe and the US. The leaders of that backlash may say so. But the truth is the opposite: those leaders understood the power that anti-political-correctness has to rally a class of voters, largely white, who are disaffected with the status quo and resentful of shifting cultural and social norms. They were not reacting to the tyranny of political correctness, nor were they returning America to a previous phase of its history. They were not taking anything back. They were wielding anti-political-correctness as a weapon, using it to forge a new political landscape and a frightening future.

&gt;The opponents of political correctness always said they were crusaders against authoritarianism. In fact, anti-PC has paved the way for the populist authoritarianism now spreading everywhere. Trump is anti-political correctness gone mad.

Hmmm.  What's _really_ hard to find are _explicitly_ Latina protagonists.  There are a bunch of games with brown-skinned girls of unspecified ethnicity as leads (see Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Oxenfree), but they're sorta blank slates, and you often don't see a lot of real cultural specificity attached to them.  The same way there's the, ""Missus Man,"" trope in video games, you also sorta have the, ""White Girl with Brown Skin.""  That's not to say that Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Oxenfree aren't both amazing games with great writing.  It's just that they're short on substantive racial subtext.  I still give them points for thinking to have a non-white protagonist, though.

There's Nilin from Remember Me.  Again, I'm not really sure what she is.  Maybe?

Miku from Submerged?  No, also reaching.

Oh.  Perhaps the most widely-played single lead woman of color!  Chell.  Most people don't realize that because [this is what they see of her](http://images.gameskinny.com/gameskinny/14762c63cc456bbc41569eff6de24141.jpg).  This is [Chell](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Chell), and this is [Alésia Glidewell](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Al%C3%A9sia_Glidewell), the half-Brazilian, half-Japanese woman who served as Chell's body model.  This isn't exactly what you were looking for, since her model is of mixed race, and she's not even explicitly stated as being such in-canon, but it's the closest I can think of to a Latina lead in a blockbuster video game.

That said, one good place to look for Latina leads is the blossoming Latin video game industry.  There's Toren, a game by Swordtales, which is Brazil-based.  It's a dark fantasy action adventure game with a female protagonist.  I don't think she's explicitly Latina, since this is a fantasy world, but it looks like a Latin woman was at least used as the template here.

I'm sure there are others.  I'm not really that knowledgeable about that scene, though, and it's not that big to begin with.  Most game development is still happening in North America, Europe, and Asia."

The Einsatzgruppen was formed in 1939, and was responsible for an estimated 2 million deaths over the war.

On wikipedia it says they killed just over a million people. Not saying that's a small amount, but once again fairly common for the time. By this logic the US and UK were gearing up for a genocide of Germans, seems how they killed that many or more German civilians in just 3 or so years. Like I said before, I recognize the Nazi's were willing to kill Jews. That doesn't show that they had a plan to exterminate them though. 

&gt; Honestly, the Madagascar Plan was hardly any better honestly. It was prety much common knowledge a large portion of the jews would die en-route and most would likely not be able to survive, let alone flourish on the island. 

I don't believe the numbers given here at all. Far more than 500 people could live in Madagascar. The Island is huge is currently around 23 million people live there. Jews are a very high IQ population, and the idea that they couldn't survive on a a resource rich Island seems ridiculous to me. The trip from Germany to Madagascar is a far nicer one than the ones the Europeans made to the new world, and they survived fine and built empires. 

&gt; Anti-Semitism has existed in most of Europe for a long time, you're quite right (for example, the Pogroms). That being said, the Holocaust is notably different due to the intent and scale involved.

Sure, but that doesn't mean Germany was uniquely against Jews, which is a idea often taught in schools. 

&gt; They absolutely kept as much of the civilian population in the dark as possible, although this applies to both Germany and Poland, not to mention a few other countries.

I wouldn't say this applied to Poland as much as Germany, though. For sure they did try to hide it from Poles, but honestly from what I've read Poles were even more anti-Jew than Germans at the time.

&gt; You say this as if it makes the Nazis less terrible. It doesn't. If anything, it just makes the other nations worse.

It shows the hypocrisy of other countries. I think it is fairly important to show that the allies had no 'moral high ground' in WW2.  

&gt; That's almost entirely because you live in a very Euro-centric area. 

Okay, so why don't schools and the media harp on all the other exterminations and genocides by European nations? Especially when other ones were just as bad if not worse? I get not focusing on Asia and stuff, but if this was true they'd be covering all the exterminations done by Europeans equally. This is clearly not the case, I'd wage that the average America has never even heard the words ""Bengal Famine"" or ""Dresden bombings"". 

&gt; Are you really going there?

Yes. Although I always try to do my best to stick to the facts, I am a anti-Semite. Of course I support the right of Jews to live peacefully and have there own nation, but that doesn't mean I like what they have done to my people.

There were about 5 millions deaths because of the low immunity of Europeans. People from around the world have different immune systems based on the common diseases there. There are even differences in gut bacteria based on the different food and environment. It's that simple. 

**edit**: I found an article I read a year ago about the Hazda, an african hunter-gatherer tribe. Their gut bacteria is surprisingly different.

 “The Hadza not only lack the ‘healthy bacteria,’ and they don’t suffer from the diseases we suffer from, but they also have high levels of bacteria that are associated with disease,”.

So not only they don't suffer from our diseases, they even have pathogens in their guts that would make us sick but they don't give a fuck and are perfectly healthy. If you would live with them and they would share their food with you you would get really sick and most likely die without medical help.

Or let's take a dog which has no problem eating raw meat while you can't. Does that make you inferior to a dog?

**edit2**: It's also funny that you mentioned the 10k deaths by small pox to prove that their immune system is inferior while there were around 300-500 million deaths worldwide in the 20th century. It would still be deadly to all of us but thankfully we developed a vaccination and whiped it out that way.

You really are convinced of your superior white race bullshit which makes it hard to find a common basis but it's really easy to prove every single one of your claims wrong.

so I'm gonna try to give an answer. While I'm a German (proof: äöüß :-) I obviously can't speak for all of us.

I am 38 now; I do care about the Holocaust/Nazi/war history. More than average I should say.

Let's start by saying that the Third Reich was a fascist regime that brought incredible suffering, and violence to Europe and the World. This is generally accepted in Germany, and I would say there is no serious controversy about that. Nobody is ""happy"" about the War here, except possibly extreme fringe opinions.

Nowadays, ~75 years after the invasion of Denmark and Norway, hate and anger are a bit difficult - the people alive are not to blame for the atrocities. However, so much damage has been done that I have from times to times felt anger, grief and shock: For example, learning about the Siege of Leningrad, about the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia. (These are just what I learned as an adult; I'm not even talking about the Holocaust or the War itself, both were covered in my school education.) And sometimes about more benign things - the Nazis really messed with german and european culture in ways that are hard to ignore- science, arts, jewish culture, homosexual subculture and acceptance, the attitude towards ""outsiders"" and ""troublemakers""). We have recovered from a lot of these burdens, but traces remain.

**About Denmark and Norway** - I am not an expert, and I'm trying to answer using only my memory - so prepare for some huge errors in the following. I assume that the Nazis were after Norwegian oil reserves and occupied Denmark to control acces to both Norway and the Baltic sea. Finland was fascist and aligned with Germany, right? Sweden I know was neutral for the duration of the war, but at Germany's mercy? And collaborated to some extend? I do not know how Denmark and Norway were governed during the occupation. Were danish authorities working under german supervision or something? I believe that the jewish population of Denmark was saved from deportation by either the danish state, or by danish resistance, or both. Knowing this, and that there was no effective resistance during the war in Germany itself, this must be a huge success. I believe that in numbers, the death toll in Denmark and Norway were probably much lower than, for example, that of Poland; maybe that's why I don't know much? (On the other hand, the siege of Leningrad is almost unheard of in Germany despite incredible suffering). I just guess that for the occupying Wehrmacht, Denmark must have been relatively peaceful since no large fighting happened on the ground? But I do not know about air raids, I do not know about Danish resistance, and I do not know the circumstances of the danish population.

That's about it. I do not know the exact date of the invasion of Denmark. First Poland, then France, then Denmark? Pretty sure it was before the attack on the Soviet Union. I do not know anything about the Finland-Soviet war, including dates and the relation to Norway and Denmark.

So we (Germans) do not know much about Denmark and Norway during WW2; most people will acknowledge the sacrifice paid and the successes achieved by foreign resistance movements (but I've talked to an old Wehrmacht veteran that was still caught in Nazi propaganda, and for example blame the partisans for any atrocities the Wehrmacht has committed - he also denied any such atrocities, and blamed the victims).

But really most people nowadays don't care much because it's history. Fringe opinions exists that regret the total defeat of Nazism, but they're rare and usually fast to single out one allegedly good aspect (like ""law and order"" :-O ), and some few people consider the post-war Germany as illegal or shameful, like a second Versailles. The prevalence of these minority opinions is difficult to estimate; they are not represented in the political party system, except for the neonazi NPD (but even they are careful), but they are latent in parts of the population.

The war doesn't usually come up in conversations; in most families the involvement of grandfathers in the Wehrmacht isn't known in detail. Memorials commemorating Nazi violence are common: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolperstein

**I would love to hear more about your reasons to ask.**

Well, I guess I'll be heading to the Wikipedia to get me some education.

(As an aside, I would say that ""ordinary citizens"" or Wehrmacht veterans (that is, most of my grandparents) had a share of the responsibility. And after 1945 I think that healing and reconciliation were generally unwanted in Germany, adding to Germany's responsibility. And the idea of a brave, unpolitical, honorable Wehrmacht is a myth.)"

Do you have a smoke detector or fire extinguisher? Do you do fire or bad weather drills? Do you have car or home or renters or life insurance? Do you look both ways before crossing the street even in light traffic? It's the same mentality. I don't expect to be attacked, but I'd feel stupid if I didn't take precautions.

Now, pretend that doing fire drills or buying insurance is also a hobby that is REALLY. FUCKING. AMAZING. If you haven't ever shot, it's kind of hard to explain. It's meditative, it demands physical and mental discipline, it's immensely and immediately rewarding, it's challenging, it's full of fun and diverse people, it even smells nice. It's the closest I get to Zen. It's a hobby that makes me a better person and has civic application.

Carrying is an imposing responsibility. IMO carrying is a key component of being a good citizen and the single most meaningful. Voting is essentially meaningless, contacting elected officials is a waste of time, and paying taxes sucks. But taking on the responsibility, implicitly promising to people I care about/my community that I'm trained and willing to take on the consequences of stopping a life-threatening crime? Very different. It's real and useful in the ways those other things aren't.

There's a cultural aspect to it as well, like you said. Weapons ownership is a part of American culture in a way that it isn't for Europeans. I've actually been shocked by the extent to which British acquaintances of mine seem to be comfortable with living in a soup of constant, low-level state of hooliganism. To a large extent middle-class Americans simply don't have to deal with this shit. The flip side of that is that some parts of American society are extremely, lethally violent due to a number of social and economic issues that *European countries simply do not have to deal with*, and in turn it makes sense to have guns because that's what the criminals have and those criminals aren't ever going to lose their guns. 

And then there's safety. Personally, there's a measure of comfort and reassurance. I'm a lesbian and I live in places that are extremely homophobic but have generous carry laws. I'm confident in my ability to stop a threat at close range, and it makes me feel safer. My wife was raised in a gun-free family that experienced a violent home invasion, and she feels safer knowing that I have the gun/the gun is there when she's at home, and she has even recently started shooting with an eye to getting a permit herself.

Perhaps this helps?"

&gt;Why isn't Yanukovich in the trenches right now, fighting back the goddamn propaganda nazis in Kiev?

Its not his job to fight for position he was elected in. Its the job of military and police to do that. He could have ordered cleanup of the mob like Egypt did where they killed over 800 people in just 3 days, but he didnt. He didnt want to kill nor be killed so he ran.

&gt; Photios I of Constantinople

The schismatic who [perpetrated fraud](http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/4_ch05.htm#_ednref7) and usurped the position of a saint? Just. No.

&gt; Glagolitic alphabet

The following is taken *from the very page you cite*: ""After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, **religious ceremonies and Divine Liturgy were conducted in Greek by clergy sent from the Byzantine Empire**, using the Byzantine rite. **Fearing growing Byzantine influence** and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine Constantinople. As a result of Boris' measures, two academies, one in Ohrid and one in Preslav, were founded.

From there, the students traveled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to Croatia (Dalmatia), where the squared variant arose and where the Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, **Pope Innocent IV granted the Croats of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the Roman Rite** liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of Senj, **the permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the Roman Rite conducted in the Slavic language instead of Latin, not the Byzantine rite), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the Adriatic coast. The Holy See had several Glagolitic missals published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.** In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the Slavic language in the Mass continued, until replaced by the modern vernacular languages.""

Emphasis mine. *Did you read the page*?

&gt; remember that time that the Catholics thought they were helping ""Christendom"" (and empty term if I've ever heard one) and then single-handedly destroyed a monarchic republic that at its zenith straddled three continents? I do.

No, I don't remember ""that time"" because the destruction of the Byzantine Empire (and with it claims of Orthodoxy's supremacy to the Roman Church as the ""New Rome"") came after centuries of mismanagement by Byzantine Emperors and clerics. Are you recalling the sack of Constantinople by Byzantine mercenaries in 1081? Probably not, because you're unaware of it (just like you're unaware of the Massacre of the Latins in 1182; though I could see why since anti-Latin pogroms were and apparently remain common). So you must be referring to the Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople, which occured:

* After secret alliances were struck between the Byzantines and the Moslems during the Third Crusade which betrayed the Latins
* After the Byzantine emperor - himself emperor by intrigue plotted against the previous emperor - was deposed by intrigue by the new emperor, who promptly betrayed the Latins by refusing to honor the treaty signed by his predecessor
* After a Byzantine a surprise attack on the Latin fleet by Byzantine ships as an attempt to starve them 

So - what, are you joking?"

Native European religion is a variety of paganisms. Relatively close to each other on the Indo-European tree, but still. Christianity (and monotheism in general) is the slayer of the ""local"" religion, whether that is worship Enlil or Inana being abandoned for Ahura Mazda, Isis and Horus for Yaweh/Christ, or Perun and Jarilo for Allah. 

My main point is I think culturally Europeans (and many others) were better served by the gods that were created by their culture. Aspects of their collective psyche anthropomorphized and personified, their native cultural values crystallized in morality tales. I don't think Christianity is inherently bad, but I wish Christ had become one God among many, a peace God perhaps, rather than becoming part of the Roman state (and with that, being stringent in how worship took place, doctrinal disputes, forced conversion etc) being naturally propagated. Most native Europeans transitioned to Arian Christianity anyway, which is much more like what jive with their cultural and cosmological systems than the universalizing Jewish God. Besides, the Jewish God wasn't even the only one for the Jews until they cut out all the rest of their pantheon (partially from conquest of Canaan, partially from influences from Zoroastrianism) around the 5th century bce.

As for which version of Maehwa is running in the NA/EU version, I'm not sure. Even for Musa, seeing your gif shows that the Musas are running with pre-normalisation OP Chase, but at the same time, I've read that they have the WP recovery buffs on their skills that were only added post-normalisation on KR. Does this mean that the current NA/EU version of Musa hasn't received his Chase nerfs *and* has the post-nerf adjustment buffs too? Godlike...

For what it's worth about the murmurings of Maehwa being 'weak' on release and getting some kind of massive buff further down the track, the only buffs she has received so far in Korea are some animation adjustment tweaks to help things flow a bit better, and WP cost adjustments for some of her skills. She has not received any damage buffs (in fact, Petal Bloom has undergone 3 successive damage nerfs), yet she is considered a premier damage dealer and hunter these days. Her 100% Rage skill is considered one of the strongest among all the classes. It's right up there as a 'delete player button' on par with Warrior's.

So basically her damage hasn't changed from the 'weak' release version, it's just that after the initial knee-jerk reactions have died down and once people learned how to play the class to its strengths, the power built into her design has come out front and centre. As just one example, some might be tempted to compare the damage % numbers on Maehwa's skills and compare them to Musa's, or other awakenings, and be shocked at how they're generally lower. How can this class be a walking delete button and a 3-skill rotation full kill class? Then people began paying attention to the sheer amount of high Crit % buffs all over her skills, and her E buff skill, and then finally realised that she's a Crit based class and all those 'low' percentages are consistently being multiplied for bonus crit damage. 

As for the gif, yeah, it's just alternating backwards Sleet Steps with Chase. What's even more impressive is, my Maehwa alt was only wearing her Farmer's shirt, if she had been wearing a proper gear set with Stamina bonuses from boss sets, crystals, Khalk earrings, etc., her Stamina pool would be much higher and she'll be able ice skate even further before she's forced to chill. xD"

Vou ser honesto com você: Sozinho não sou capaz de interpretar o texto. Descobri que não tenho o escopo para entender por conta própria. Eu já li a constituição de cabo a rabo e não acho que sairá de mim as melhores interpretações dela.

Mas estava discutindo isso com uns amigos, de pessoas que vão sem ter lido o texto. Pois sempre tentam quebrar a manifestação argumentando que se não leu não tem como saber porque está manifestando. E eu discordo disso. A interpretação de um texto é um assunto separado do texto em si.

Por exemplo, quando alguém está em algum julgamento e se defende, não se defende pessoalmente (embora a lei permita auto defesa). Mas sim utiliza uma pessoa de confiança (o advogado), o qual tem maior conhecimento sobre o assunto e, em conjunto, ambos formam um plano de defesa.

Neste caso, pelo menos eu acho, é semelhante. Eu li o texto, que é bem curto e com escrita típica de legislação, e precisei de ajuda para interpretar. Aí cabe das minhas convicções creditar quem eu considero confiável, segundo as minhas opiniões. Há pessoas as quais eu concordo e respeito e há pessoas com as quais não concordo e tenho pouco respeito. Se no meu julgamento eu aceito que determinadas pessoas têm capacidade de interpretar um texto desse, eu posso considerar que há uma probabilidade alta que se eu também tivesse o conhecimento necessário para interpretá-lo eu iria tomar conclusões semelhantes. Não significa que eu estaria correto no meu julgamento, mas sim que é bem provável que iria para o mesmo caminho. Então eu faço essa decisão de me identificar no movimento.

Acredito que se você compreendeu o texto em sua totalidade, você deve ter um conhecimento legislativo, o que em mim faltou.

Mas eu li sim! Duas vezes. A viagem deu 15 horas, tive um tempo bom para gastar."

Global warming is always a player, but there's another explanation more acute and that's economic. Over the past 40 years, there has been a shift towards free markets and globalization, begun under Reagan/Thatcher. This has moved jobs and mfg from first world countries to places like China and India. As their boat rose, the middle-middle and working classes in the USA and Europe remained stagnant. The center-left politicians, who once championed this base, have lately become the champion of globalization which benefits the elite. The reasons are complex but has to do with slowing global growth, deflation and creditors (banks) which the center-left traditionally support. The banks are in trouble they have too much bad debt on the books and they need center-left politicians to bail them out. So in among this mess, the forgotten and leaderless classes are rising up in popular revolts .. using every election opportunity to make radical changes in leadership both towards the left *and* right (depending on the country). The revolts are characterized by greater nationalism and xenophobia. "

Thankfully it's not really a matter of opinion. A couple of years of below (or above) target inflation in the face of the worst recession in seventy years doesn't erase two decades of success. See [UK](http://imgur.com/a/yD6MU), [Australia](http://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/images/inflation-long-run.gif) or well pretty much any other developed country in the period after they set a numerical inflation target. The claim that this happened by accident is quite frankly laughable. Anyone making this claim is engaged in [slothful induction](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slothful_induction) in defence of dogma. Your examples are cherrypicking for the following reason:

&gt; Japan is the prime example having seen low inflation despite central bank efforts since the early 1990

When their target was price stability. They only recently announced a numerical inflation target 

&gt;The US and Europe are now also examples

Even in your own graph the US performance amounts to a remarkable success. The ECB does not target 2% inflation. The mandate is to maintain price stability. Which they interpret at inflation *under* 2%. They also raised rates in 2011. Because they were trying to avoid overshooting their target."

It obviously is lost on most of the outsiders (non-Armenia Armenians and foreigners) who post here, and who view Armenia as some sort of far away lab project where they can safely experiment with failed neo-con regime change policies that have wrecked a wide swath of the Earth from Syria to Central Asia.

I'd like to add one thought to your post: it may be the case that Armenia under its current borders and geopolitical realities cannot sustain the same population numbers that the Armenian S.S.R. maintained. Think about it: the first Armenian state was founded in 1918, and the Dashnak government was so incompetent in geopolitics, foreign policy, and war that it maneuvered Armenia into a position where both the Soviet empire on one side and the Turkish empire on the other side invaded Armenia. The Dashnak government then signed the Treaty of Alexandropol giving up all land claims against Turkey, and then capitulated and left a broken shell of a nation for the Bolsheviks to do as they pleased. The Bolsheviks (which included many prominent Armenians) signed the Treaty of Kars and further constricted the Armenian state into its current artificial borders, landlocked and very limited in arable land and many vital resources. Armenia was mutilated from the very beginning into a patch of land which was not capable of supporting a large population. The only reason Armenia's population grew after the Soviet takeover was because the Soviets imposed a peace through strict policing, and subsidized Armenian growth through free imports via Georgia and Azerbaijan, guaranteed absolute protection of any threat from the Turkish (or even Iranian) border, and built a decent educational and healthcare system and factories to support jobs for the population. The Soviets even organized massive repatriation efforts numbering in the hundreds of thousands for Genocide survivors from the diaspora. From what I can tell, the Soviets even encouraged things like physical fitness and other quality of life factors in the population. Obviously this all required massive funding and expertise taken from other, more productive and developed areas of the U.S.S.R and redistributed as investments in Armenia as directed by the Kremlin at the time. . . This is not to say the Soviets were perfect or to cover up the repression and killings of hundreds of thousands of people during the early Bolshevik era, the war against the Armenian Church, or the giving away of Artsakh and Nakhichevan, but all things considered this was relatively the best hand Armenia had to play at the time and it is what got us a population of over 3 million and an industrial system which provided jobs to support that population. The alternative would have been to see the Turks finish off  an ""independent"" Armenia (and no, even a million fedayis would not have held off the Turks, nor would any western power have lifted a finger to intervene.)

Now that the old Soviet system has been dead for over a quarter of a century, the old inter-S.S.R. trade is gone, Armenia is languishing. I don't see Armenia becoming a manufacturing hub because in spite of cheap labor, the country is in a politically volatile environment with closed borders and technically at war with Azerbaijan which occasionally heats up. And let's not kid ourselves, if it were not for Russian boots on the ground in Armenia, Turkey would have long sent its troops into Armenian soil, just like it has done in recent decade to Cyprus, Iraq, and Syria. Greece was a member of NATO and Turkey was still allowed to rape Cyprus in 1973, and still called ""a model Muslim democracy."" Simply put, East Asia and Central America make more sense for outsourcing manufacturing than Armenia.

The I.T. sector in Armenia has incredible potential, I want to see Armenia become an technological superpower. But realistically, that one industry can only provide a limited amount of jobs. As far as I can tell, further reintegration into a Russian-led economic bloc  (the Eurasian Union) is Armenia's best chance at increasing economic opportunities and thus supporting a relatively large population like the Armenian S.S.R. did. Existing Armenian products are well known in the former Soviet market and have a better chance at competing than in Europe with its myriad of regulations and state-subsidized manufacturers. Not to mention that Armenian factories may yet find themselves producing components for Russian aircraft, vehicles, weapons, and industrial tools.

The economy is probably the key factor for growing and sustaining a large population in a landlocked and resource-poor nation like Armenia. But cases like Germany, very rich but with unsustainably (genocidally) low population growth shows that a people's mentality and spiritual health also factor in, and this is where social engineering from Yerevan and Etchmiadzin come into play.

inb4 Russophobes come out crying, Armenia will remain in the Russian sphere, and there is nothing foreigners can do to change that from their keyboards in Glendale."

I can completely understand the cultural context surrounding the group.  However, that doesn't mean I can't also say that I disagree with it and hope the they have better conditions in the future.  I can look at things like the Industrial Revolution and understand why working long hours for peanuts when you're ten in hazardous conditions was important at the time.  I can also say that child labor laws stopping that sort of thing from happening is a good thing.  I can understand the cultural context of female circumcision and still think that it's a practice that needs to be stopped.  

I also watch Korean esports.  My favorite player has been working in tournaments for two years straight, 12-16 hours a day, with a week off here and there (one in May and another in December) because he is the best player in the world and ends up in every major tournaments offered in the game, including the fan voted one.  I think that the schedule is unhealthy and should be revisited to make sure that top players can have the choice of having a longer break to prevent injury and just giving them a mental break and more time with their families.

Context is important, but that doesn't mean that someone can't also disagree with practices.

&gt;Lay and Chanyeol in particular spend every waking moment making music and honing their craft

I know a lot of programmers who have a programming day job, then have a side project that they fiddle with in their off time.   However, there's a big difference between having to do something and choosing to do something.  Working for 80 hours in a week because you are contractually obligated to and working 40 hours in a week and spending another 40 on a hobby are not the same thing.

Entertainment is a tricky beast.  You expect to work long hours for the sake of your craft, but eventually, you do need more than a day or two break, especially if you're putting 60-80 hour weeks for an extended period of time.

In addition to the cultural context of Korea, you also have to take into account the cultural context and backgrounds of the people posting.  Most people here are going to be international fans.  A couple weeks of vacation time a year is pretty normal in the US.  Europeans tend to get even more time as standard (yes, I'm jealous). The average international fan is going to look at their schedule and go, holy fuck when do you sleep?!?!?!!

Also, you should keep in mind that the company that they're with doesn't have the most stellar reputation historically in regards to idol treatment.  I think it's pretty understandable that EXO-L, of all fandoms, would have a little PTSD when it comes to idols being overworked and unhappy.

So yeah, I don't see anything wrong with people saying that they wish they would take a break.  I wouldn't mind them taking a few more breaks here and there myself (Four comebacks since June for our favorite subunit does seem a bit much, no?), but I also understand striking while the iron is hot.

Another example of high popularity due to marketing and time of release heaping a game with undue praise is Fire Emblem Awakening. As a FE game it's bottom of the barrel trash and fails on nearly every level. But since it released at a perfect time to gain new fans and was properly marketed it's seen as one of the best games on the 3DS and what most people think of when they hear the name Fire Emblem. Obviously FFVII is better than Awakening in the context of their respective franchises but it's another good example of popularity not being a good indicator of quality. "

""H"" was not represented by an actual sound in Latin, and it affected how it is treated as a letter in many languages, both Romance and some modern Germanic (English, e.g.).

The vernacular writing in multiple Romance languages that developed from Vulgar Latin tried to reflect pronunciation shifts. For example ""Centum"" is pronounced ""Kentum"" in Latin, but in Romance vernaculars, the ""C"" in front of ""e"" started to shift to ""s"", ""ts"", ""th"" and other sounds. To mark the difference between how the first letter is pronounced in  ""centum"" vs ""cattus"", Frankish scribes placed an ""h"" after ""c"" in ""cattus"" to get ""chattus"", hence, French ""chat"" for ""cat"".  

Bottom line is: ""h"" has a long story of being introduced into spelling of words as an ""indicator"" letter, and then being incorporated into a new sound (in case of ""cattus"" the pronounciation went ""kattus"" --&gt; ""(ch)attus"" --&gt; ""(ch)at"" --&gt; ""(sh)a"" ). But where it does not form a sound of its own, it does not need to prevent the symmetry, as the symmetry is phonological, not orthographical in this case.

(""Shalash"" is a perfect palindrom when rendered in Russian, and I, am assuming, Hebrew, which have a letter for ""sh"")."

The most important thing a conductor has to do is interpret the music. If you listened to the same piece from five different conductors, there may be small nuances that show themselves based on the conductors own ear and decisions. They essentially ""play"" the orchestra themselves, while the instrumentalists play the music.


They also have the final say in a lot of matters, which ties in to what I said earlier. Every large group needs a leader. Who says how long to hold this fermata? Is pp a dynamic or color change? Is it better to think of this 5/4 measure as 2+3 or 3+2? A lot of these things are intuitive and don't need as much explaining when you are playing by yourself, but again if you get 50 people together there is bound to be some arguments. Especially between a European and American player. Also, European conductors tend to conduct before the beat, as opposed to on the beat. Just another small detail that is a regional difference, and thus may have a small influence on how something is played. 


When it comes to the actual performance, the conductor is there mostly for show in my opinion. If you aren't on time, know your cues, and know your phrasing, you probably aren't going to be playing at the concert. It depends on how desperately they need you. Also, shit happens.

---

&gt;* WARSAW (Sputnik)  In October, Poland's Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said that Egypt resold the two Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia for the symbolic price of $1.

&gt;* The Russian Defense Ministry and the Egyptian embassy in Moscow denied Macierewicz's statements, while a group of Polish lawmakers from an opposition Civic Platform party wrote a request to the Poland's Defense Ministry, asking to provide the source of the information on the sale of the Mistrals.

&gt;* ""The information concerning the deal between Egypt and Russia originates from the secret sources,"" Poland's Defense Ministry said in a statement, posted by Agnieszka Pomaska, a party's member, on her Twitter page.

&gt;* In August 2015, Paris and Moscow formally terminated the 1.2bln euro ($1.35 billion at the current exchange rate) deal on the construction and delivery of two Mistral-class helicopter carriers as France had refused to transfer them to Russia over its alleged role in the Ukrainian conflict.

&gt;* Shortly after, French President Francois Hollande confirmed that a deal had been reached with Egypt on the delivery of two Mistrals.

For example the Viet Cong was, even by the US admission, supported by at least 80% of the population. That's what I mean when I say the Diem regime had no popular base of support. 



Back to Israel/Palestine. Well straight after 2005 there was an expansion of settlements in the West Bank, and of course the Gaza settlers were resettled there. All with tacit US support. The Baker plan and all that refers to the period 1989-1995. So let's not confuse the two. 



Finkelstein and Pappe rely on Chomsky, he's been writing about this since the 1960's and usually only uses primary sources. Usually Israeli and US sources too - you'd know this if you read any of his works. 



OK so Sadat called for a withdrawal from Egyptian lands before peace. It was still a peace plan, and it was roundly rejected by Israel. This led straight to the Yom Kippur war which was a very close call for Israel - quite a bad judgement of theirs to reject that plan then, I'd say it was a diplomatic catastrophe. They anyway agreed to withdraw and made peace with Egypt in 1980-1982. 



Note that Peres very carefully avoids saying the words ""Palestinian State"" - please find a quotation where he says that. This is ""self-rule"" for the Palestinians as they ""enjoy"" today, meaning they can organise their own garbage collection. Not a state. 



Israel offered once to cede 93% of the West Bank, as Olmert claims. However that was just an oral offer and never accepted by Israel. In fact the next day they called it off. 



Now if you look at the West Bank, and what Israel occupies, remember much of it is desert, you can see that Israel has occupied all the valuable land, especially the Jordan Valley. 



Regarding Ron Pundak: 




&gt;The more time elapses and the number of publications increases, the argument about the facts dwindles: who proposed what, when, and what the response of the other side was. Camp David became an ordinary historical topic about which it is necessary to distinguish between the versions of interested parties. Were they able to read Hebrew, Robert Malley and Agha Hussein would have been able to have made extensive use of the facts that appear in the publications of Yossi Beilin, Gilad Sher and Shlomo Ben-Ami in order to base their criticism of Ehud Barak on the statements of his representatives in the negotiations. This applies to the territorial chapter. At the conference in Tel Aviv, **Dr. Ron Pundak and Colonel (res.) Shaul Arieli (head of the peace administration in Barak's bureau), on the one hand,** and Palestinian deputy minister Samih al-Abed (from the Palestinian negotiating team), on the other, detail with the aid of documents and maps the progress of the territorial negotiations. The gaps between the figures given by the Israelis and those presented by the Palestinian representatives were minuscule.




 http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/books/shattering-the-myths-of-camp-david-1.96574



He clearly was an Israeli negotiator involved in Camp David. He wrote the agreement which was the basis of the Camp David negotiations.


Here's what Chomsky says about it - it's really not a major point whether Ron Pundak was literally at Camp David or not, the substance of what he says is a major point. Even if he wasn't at Camp David it wouldn't change anything in Chomsky's, or my argument.


&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David, by the way.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: Pardon?

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background, and he was from…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: …He was from Oslo, and his study…

&gt;AUDIENCE MEMBER: He’s from Oslo. He was never. He was not even close to Camp David, just for the record.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: His study, he was one of the advisors, as you know…

&gt;ALAN DERSHOWITZ: Chomsky says so, it must be true.

&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: Read it–you’re the one who told me you agree with him. If you think not, tell the Shimon Peres center to fire his director. Those are the basic Israeli documents. Furthermore, they’re supported by plenty of others. If you want to know more about Taba, you can read the European Union report, accepted by both sides, which says exactly what I said. As to your question, yes, I already told you the answer. There is a very good solution on the table. It’s the solution that they came close to in Taba before Israel canceled it, and that was then carried forward by high level Israeli and Palestinian negotiators informally, leading to the Geneva…that’s what I’m telling you.

You said, quote, ""Who are you to put a time limit on the effects of slavery?"". In order for your argument to be consistent, It must be the case that modern Europeans should be reimbursed for the slavery of ancestral Europeans by North African nations in the same way you are arguing that modern black people should be reimbursed for the slavery of ancestral black people. Do you agree?

&gt; You cite nothing to support this claim, and I honestly don't think it's true.

You don't believe me that Japanese, Chinese, Italians, and Irish are, on average, better off than the average black American?

&gt; That article is 8 years old. The current numbers are lower.

According to ""Jewish Virtual Library"" it's 10% of senators and 4.5% of congressmen. So actually even higher than I thought in the senate!

&gt; If the less religious/observant Jews are the ones getting into Congress, how is that a cultural advantage? 

If the less white-identifying whites are the ones getting into Congress, how is that a racial advantage?

&gt; All these disadvantages you're identifying as being rooted in black 'culture' are actually rooted in slavery and its aftershocks

Why do you believe this? Again, the only thing that people have to claim as ""evidence"" for this is the fact that black people are worse off than other ethnic groups in the US; they have zero evidence that it's due to any particular cause, and things like modern cultural challenges and poverty seem vastly more likely than ""aftershocks"" of a class system that died 150 years ago.

&gt; If they're only statistically correlated, you can't reasonably claim they're anything but a coincidence.

To be blunt, this betrays a very serious misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Here's a good article on the matter https://blog.richmond.edu/physicsbunn/2014/02/21/correlation-is-correlated-with-causation/

What a correlation implies (not in the boolean logical sense, but in the bayesian sense) is one of three things: if A correlates with B, then the posterior probability of A being an ancestor in the causal network of B, B being an ancestor in the causal network of A, or both A and B sharing a mutual causal ancestor is increased. 

Correlations are emphatically *not* the same thing as coincidences. Correlations actually give you a ton of predictive power, regardless of the direction of causality that caused the correlation in the first place. For example, let's pretend that we aren't aware that rain causes an area to be wet. However, we see that there is a strong correlation between rain and an area being wet. Despite the fact that we don't know which way this causal relationship works, if we learn that an area is wet, our posterior probability of it raining in that area increases drastically. Note that we're working *backwards* in the causal network; we're starting at the effect and making inferences about the cause. We could go the other way too; if we know it's raining in an area, this increases the posterior probability that the area is wet. Correlations let us make predictions even if we don't know the underlying causal relationship.

&gt; If your theory is that the correlation between black men and prison is caused by black culture, then that's bigoted

Regardless of how you label the theory, can you rule it out? A priori, this theory is pretty likely; there are many cultural factors that could have a strong influence on criminal tendencies. The likeliness of a theory has precisely nothing to do with how (a)moral one thinks it is.

&gt; All of the causes you just listed can be and have been debunked. 

&gt; White people live in cities, often blocks from black neighborhoods

You're right, that's a strong argument for the  ""black culture"" explanation.

&gt; poverty affects people of all colors, not just black people;

While poverty and crime are correlated for all races, you are correct that the correlation is stronger in black communities, which further supports the ""black culture"" theory.

&gt; and to claim that there's something inherent in black culture that would promote crime is probably not a claim you're qualified to make or speculate on, 

That's not actually an argument against the hypothesis, just an indictment of my credentials. You've already helped to partially rule out the other explanations, so what else is left?

&gt; since you probably know little if anything about black culture

I spent 8 years in poor neighborhoods in Chicago; I know a great deal about black culture.

&gt; Also, what about their culture would be SO DIFFERENT from western European cultures or Asian cultures

[Less of a focus on education](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=16), extremely high occurrence of single motherhood ([almost three times as much as for white people!](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/don-lemon/cnns-don-lemon-says-more-72-percent-african-americ/)), much more of a focus on gang culture ([15 times youth gang membership as much as for white people](https://www.ojjdp.gov/pubs/96natyouthgangsrvy/surv_6c.html)), etc.

So what agreements like the Geneva Conventions do is basically say ""You don't kill our POWs, and we won't kill yours""

https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/terrorism

&gt;Definitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code 
18 U.S.C. § 2331 defines ""international terrorism"" and ""domestic terrorism"" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the U.S. Code, entitled ""Terrorism.”

&gt;""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:

&gt;Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
Appear to be intended    
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;    
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or     
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.*      

This is important because it defines who a particular set of enemies of the state are.

&gt;At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, **we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.**

Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the [US State Department approved $115 Billion Dollars worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ)

CNN reported that [ISIS was armed with American Weapons](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/08/politics/amnesty-international-isis-weapons-u-s-/index.html) in December, 2015; and if you read the actual [Amnesty.org](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/) report it says (Pg. 20, 21):

&gt; It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.

A few months prior [The Guardian reported:](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq)

In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

Maybe you would like [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/hillary-clinton-acknowledges-saudi-terror-financing-in-hacked-email-hinting-at-tougher-approach/) to clarify a few things:

&gt; Clinton openly criticized the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments for failing “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” Her newly released 2014 email goes a step further, directly attributing support for ISIS to the Saudi government.

This brings us to [The Refugee Crisis](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911) (BBC) in Europe. This is projected to [cost Germany alone well north of a Trillion dollars](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/691638/Germany-migrant-crisis-immigration-economy-trillion-pounds) (Express) over the next 2 decades. A cost which could [conceivably be passed on to the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/senate-poised-to-override-obama-veto-of-911-legislation/2016/09/28/809fd2a4-854b-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html) (WaPo) because of [America's insistence of supporting terrorist states](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal) (The Gaurdian).

This has had significant effect on international relationships too that threaten [the longest peace in western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Europaea) since Augustus Caeser. According to Vox [""Anti-immigrant backlash is driving support for Brexit](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/23/12005814/brexit-eu-referendum-immigrants) which was only exacerbated by continental Europe's refugee crisis.

The US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe by knowingly arming ISIS and is why [Turkey may leave NATO](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/turexit-turkey-leave-nato-160721105010182.html); This is why [Russia](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/04/world/europe/uk-nato-summit/index.html) may invade the rest of Ukraine.

Would you elaborate? Because I do not know what you saying here. Not sure. I use Sephardic as people from the Iberian peninsula who were exiled and settled in different places all over. North Africa, the Balkans and so on.
Also, as written above. 
As written above... What I mean about the intellectualism. Well, it has to do with the white-collar job connection. Some people say that since Ashkenazi are more likely to be white-collar, then there is a higher degree of intellectually among them. Also, don't forget that when some people (even Jews) want to show how successful Jews are, they overemphasize the IQ test and Nobel Prizes. And Ashkenazi rule here. I mean, listen, being blue-collar does not mean you are less intelligent but...in the US, I see Ashkenazi as being the ambitious and go-getters. I think it takes a lot to become an engineer, a doctor and Ashkenazim overrepresent here. Also, maybe because it is a recent event in history but I admire the way the Ashkenazi communities kept going even after the Shoah. There is something unique about going through so much hardship to then becoming one of the most successful communities in the US. And here, Ashkenazi are the example.

&gt;Generally speaking, no. The Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic, Eastern, Italian, Yemenite, and Ethiopian) worlds have a rather large cultural and historical divide. Has there been Ashkenazification of non-Ashkenazi Jews? Yes, and there are plenty who bemoan this fact and that there's now such a thing as ""Haredi Sephardi.""

What do you think of this piece?
http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm

&gt;The Spanish-Portuguese community is Western European in nature, comprised of the descendants of Jews who fled from Spain to Italy, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and eventually the Americas. While having much in common with the Sephardim of North Africa and the Judeo-Spanish communities of the Balkans, they also are distinct from them in the way that Yekkes are distinct from other non-Hassidic Ashkednazim.

That's what I thought. Thanks. 
The senior Rabbi of Shearith is Askhenazi and there is a book (unfortunately, I don't remember the title) about how the synagogue has become more Ashkenasified with time. "

At the end of the season top500 was somewhere in the 4.1-4.2k range. So thats a full 600-700 point difference (two entire ranks as you said) for the same caliber players.

His rating increased by 800 points. Compare it to the 6-700 difference I explained above and thats not a whole lot different. If you add that since they're spreading apart the ranks this season, 2.7k players are going to be ~2.9k etc. So adding that to the equation makes up for the other 100-200 points and he does stay at a similar percentile.

Why did I take all those classes and read all those journal articles and monographs on the subject? Clearly, the only source you need is a traveler's account of the South in 1854!

&gt;Slavery took them from Africa, where many of them would have been slaves anyway, to the USA, where living conditions were better. While some slavemasters were cruel, the slaves were also provided for.

Uh, bullshit. The slave trade was self-perpetuating. That means that, while the initial slaves sold to Europeans may have already been slaves, once coastal African rulers learned that they could get modern weapons and other manufactured goods in exchange for prisoners of war . . . they started going to war more often. For God's sake, so many slaves were taken out of West Africa that at one point the region was depopulated and they had to look elsewhere. Not even touching his living conditions bullshit. A dirt-floored shack, clothes that white men wouldn't wear, and working from dark-til-dark under threat of physical abuse sure screams good living conditions!

&gt;You should probably read this book before you talk about slavery: https://books.google.com/books?id=sCg7P2c3W5MC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false

I got some books for him. Sadly, they aren't the ramblings of a privileged New England clergyman, so I doubt he's going to be interested.

Just on the off-chance:

Foner, Eric. Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877.

Ibid. The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.

Genovese, Eugene. Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made.

Berlin, Ira. Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America.

&gt;Not to mention that under the sharecropper system that immediately followed, blacks lived under largely the same condition...

Holy Jesus. Sharecropping and Jim Crow came about because A) the victorious Union didn't have the testicular fortitude to seize land from defeated rebels to endow the slaves, and B) the white South fought reconstruction tooth and nail for ten years until the north basically said ""fuck it, you guys do what you want, we're tired of this shit."" It's a shameful display of weakness, but holy shit, it's like saying that the Allies caused the Holocaust by preventing Imperial Germany from taking over Europe.

&gt;I would much have preferred that slavery continued in the USA for, say, 50 years and then it was ended properly (i.e. with payment to the masters and the slaves being returned to Africa).

Lovely! Colonization bullshit and compensated emancipation bullshit in one sentence; it's a regular shit sandwich. Colonization plans were perceived by black people at the time as incredibly offensive. They were Americans, not Africans; they had lived here for generations; why would they want to go back to a continent that was as unfamiliar to them as Europe was to the average white farmer? And anyway, the slightest hint of compensated emancipation was anathema to the white South. If in 1860 the national mood was ""slavery forever,"" what would lead anyone to believe that would have magically changed 50 years later?

&gt;The way it was ended was impetuous and did almost nothing to improve their conditions... in fact, their lot didn't really improve until the 60s, about 100 years later. I think it would have been preferable for slavery to end 'properly' 50 years later.

The user is literally blaming the abolition of slavery for the . . . existence of white supremacy? Abolishing slavery didn't magically wipe away 200 years of racist ideology, therefore abolition forced southern whites to act like crazy dickbags? "

As much as our presidential candidates railed against them, the globalized trade networks that we've created make any kind of large-scale war, even amongst second-order powers, almost impossible.  The same 1% that many of us are at the least resenting and sometimes actively protesting - and don't get me wrong I'm not saying that we shouldn't - have enough power over governments which have enough power over enough military might to prevent such things.

Slow-boil wars will continue, too many people derive too much money from them for them to be stopped.  Terrorism will continue, there is simply no way to prevent it without both raising the global standard of living to Western levels AND providing no-charge comprehensive mental health care AND removing social barriers to seeking that help AND doing things like stopping slow-boil wars.  Poverty will remain a problem, because that's just kind of the way that capitalism works and capitalism is the system that works better than any other we've tried - although a bright point here is that as capitalism spreads and progresses countries are experiencing development that took the Western world centuries in decades, and there is an according increase in the standard of living of even the poorest as this occurs.  In other words, China has gone from a largely agrarian rural economy to the factory of the world in a fraction of the time it took Europe and America to do so, and now they're looking to be the next S. Korea or Japan while the horrifying jobs that used to define that country are shifting to other countries.  Of course, the only way this was possible for them was to engage in a huge amount of trade with the same countries they were nominally rivals with politically and militarily, which is why there hasn't been and won't be a war between those countries.  It'd be bad for business.

Overall, it's not a perfect system and there's a lot about it that I personally hate, but it does seem to be working and we are extremely unlikely to experience an end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it (EOCAWKI - handy acronym!) event any time in the near future.  The trend I most worry about is automation - more than 15% of the workforce in the US alone will be replaced by automation in the next two decades - and that estimate is actually conservative.  We don't really have the economic, political, or social systems to deal with such a large number of jobs simply going away.  Hopefully we'll adopt a UBI, but there's quite a lot of opposition to such ideas.

On the whole though, I am extremely optimistic about the future - and I am both a born-and-bred pessimist by nature, a worrywart, an unemployed veteran getting by on VA disability benefits, and a person who thinks about these things all the time.  We live in the best possible time to be alive, and things are likely to get even better as time goes by. I only wish I'd been born more recently so I could see more of it.

(...but I haven't yet given up on a solution to mortality in my lifetime!)

*edit:* I totally forgot to mention climate change, which was like the whole reason for making the post :(  Anyway, I hope to convince as many people as I can to advocate for non-LWR (preferably Thorium LFTR) nuclear power, which can solve so many of our problems and is exceptionally safe and clean, and the technology is ready to be deployed right now.  Even if we fail to employ this method to head off climate change however, there is no limit that I'm aware of to human ingenuity, especially when motivated by profit.  A lot of very plum real estate is at risk as a result of climate change, and this will cause a large influx of research capital into mitigation and prevention tech in the coming years, providing jobs and wealth to entrepreneurs and perhaps even saving the world.  Climate change will be the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, but I believe we will overcome it with the aggressive application of ingenuity as we have every other challenge we've faced since we first became humans."

He still owes them money, but he refuses to release his tax records, so nobody knows how much, or how generous the terms of the loan are.

The concept of militaristic 'jihad' cannot be just whisked away from historical context, given the 1400+ year history of the term.  Nor do early Muslim scholars, or Muslim scholars today, agree on the terms and definitions, etc, of Jihad.

Nor is the Muslim world united in any sense of the word.  Most groups who are fighting are liable to use the word 'jihad' in order to give their cause some sort of religious or cultural merit, the same way people say 'crusade' here in America, or the 'good fight', etc, in order to invoke cultural and national feeling.

The IP conflict is complex, but in some cases the Palestinians have a point, in others they don't.  Some of the biggest resistance movements have NOT been Islamic in character (such as PFLP,) and even Hamas did not exist until the Intifadas in the 90s.

As for Europe, this is a complete conspiracy theory.  Most polls predict that the Muslim population will never reach over 10% even in France or Germany.  People are simply alarmist for their own nationalistic/racialistic ends and because cultures meeting each other will inevitably have some clashes.  The benefits of an open society to trade, to counteract lower birthrates brought by prosperity, etc far outweigh these, however."

The crux of the matter is that between the Middle Ages and now, Industrial revolution happened. What it did was that where before material was expensive but labour cheap, now it is the other way around. We can get all sorts of quality stuff incredibly cheaply (relatively speaking) so long as it's mass produced; but the moment you want something unusual that somebody needs to spend time on, the price shoots up.

To put it the other way around, the problem back in Middle ages wasn't that people would cut corners on the work, but that quality material and tools weren't consistently available. It's pretty easy to shape a hunk of steel into the shape of a sword, and if you learn from someone who has done it a number of times you can even make a decent one. The problem is that you don't know whether that hunk of steel is good enough to stand the abuse, and while it *might* be, you have no way of knowing whether it *is*.

Smiths in mediaeval Europe, as well as Japan and most everywhere else were able to produce some pretty good steel *sometimes*, but because they went by trial and error and had no knowledge of the underlying material science, as soon as someone found a formula that worked consistently, it would be adhered to religiously. Until it stopped working because of almost undetectable variations in the composition of the ore, or coal, or something else.

Likewise, good quality whetstones of consistent known coarseness were precious items.

So essentially, what money bought you in a sword was either bling, or ""brand"" associated with quality of the material and the product (e.g. Ulfberht, Klingenthal, etc.)."

Renouncing in itself isn't bad if you know what you're doing. I've seen a plethora of comments talk about renouncing but I've also seen a lot of people get offended by the mere thought of it since they can't seem to think outside of their own personal circumstance why someone would want to do something different than them. I just read a comment here that came to the conclusion that the majority of Spain wants to move to the US because 4-5 Spanish people she knows wants to move there in addition to the clerk at some store, so therefore it must mean something. When I say this I'm not particularly targeting you, it's just the general mindset people have when counterarguing against renouncing.

The thing about the US is, despite the largest economy, has one of the world's worst income inequality and thus the citizens only get the crumbs of the economy that is monopolised by millionaires and billionaires who virtually own more than 3/4 of it but constitute only 1% of the population. This doesn't mean Americans are poor, but it means they're on the same playing field as Europeans, Canadians, Australians, etc. in the majority of careers in terms of income pay. Accompany this with authoritarian tax laws which people seem to be downplaying a lot. People say it's just ""forms"" but this is a severe invasion of privacy and that does not sit well with everyone, including me. It's nothing wrong if you're OK with that but it doesn't sit well with me either how some people in this thread are bastardising people who want to renounce for this reason/and or others. There's opportunities everywhere and with the world economies being so intertangled with each other there's not really any particular country that monopolised high-paying jobs anymore. I swear the way people counter argue against renouncing US citizenship, you'd think the US was a Switzerland-esque country. There's a lot of problems and depending on your mindset (and simply because it's optimistic doesn't mean it's realistic) and your personal circumstances the cons may outweigh the pros. This is a globalised world man, no need to be  pegged down in one place, especially if you don't like it."

The inaugural Grand Prix of Azerbaijan was held in Baku this past season. In the run up to the race, there were rumors that the circuit facilities were not quite up to par and that abandoned buildings that were visible from the track were being covered with facades to make them appear clean. At the race itself, digital signage announced to TV viewers that ""Baku welcomed us all!"" most likely in an attempt  to combat the negative stigma surrounding the race (venue, location, clash with Le Mans, it being the European GP, etc.). Another prominently featured sign was ""Well done Baku!"" It was so comical and unorthodox that FOM would feel the need to display messages like this that it became a running joke. You didn't see ""Well done Austin!"" signage. So the fact that it was Baku (like really wtf is Baku) and FOM obviously felt the need to pat Baku on the back on a world stage led to people referencing ""Well done Baku!"" in parody. 

tl;dr In 2016, Baku exceeded expectations and FOM showed digital advertisements on the broadcast that read ""Well done Baku!"" as a nod to the organizers putting together what ended up actually being a successful Grand Prix, and the whole thing was so forced it became a running joke. "

Christianity didn't oppose science as much as you might think in the middle ages, in fact monasteries were vitally important for people like Ockham. Galileo was much later than ~1000, and that was no more extreme than the fate of the Ulugh Beg observatory. There was one case where the Papacy tried to get the crossbow banned, it was ignored. I will say it's fortunate that we had the reformation, but even the Papacy was never as overbearing as the Caliphate. We never had an intellectual group going extinct like the Muta'zilis, unless I am forgetting something.

&gt;Why is Africa exempt from this religious judgement

Because if the whole place is pretty much at rock bottom then it's hard to judge differences.

&gt;Absolutely the same thing as the anti-abortionists in the united states, or the anti-gay marriage supporters. How are you so one sided on this?

No it really isn't. You wont have the religious right trying to get a non-Christian politician prosecuted for 'blasphemy'. Islamists don't just oppose abortion and sodomite 'marriage', they go much further than that. And faggot marriage is obviously retarded, I'm an atheist but that doesn't mean I think having a wife and children is no more valid than shoving your dick up another man's arse.

All of those 50-60% Muslim countries would be much worse off if they were 95% Muslim because then Islamism would be stronger. If you want to claim Islam is irrelevant then finding countries that have huge non-Muslim majorities and saying they're doing ok is not the way to go.

As for your list of 50-60% Muslim countries that are still shitshows: Nigeria had a huge problem with Islamists a few years ago, the three post-Soviet ones are not really that bad, and Lebanon is blatantly better off than all the nearby 90% Muslim countries. Lebanese society, even the Muslims there, is more secular and free because of the large number of Christians. Actually Azerbaijan is 95% Muslim but still secular because it's post-soviet.

&gt;Did I say that the countries became Islamic due to poverty? 

I didn't say you did. What you said, unless I'm very confused, was that the bad political climate was due to poverty. They clearly didn't become extremist due to barbaric conditions such as being under siege. When has Saudi been under siege? 

I agree that wealth isn't the only factor, Islam is a bigger one.

In order to avoid Islamism in a country, you either need a lot of non-Muslims, or a monarchy/military secular establishment to keep the islamists in check."

The Norinco .22 is a clone of a decent European rifle but has the usual Chinese binary quality control: crap or perfectly fine. 

Plenty of good used .22s around - I'd suggest picking up something clean and tidy and having a go.

Someone suggested bigger than a .22 - madness. You'll be shooting at objects in trees and if you miss even a .22 will go a long way and still be lethal (remember the arms code). The other Rimfires (.17HMR and HM2 / .22WMR) are noisier, far pricier and not really necessary.For possums a silenced bolt action firing &lt;say&gt; 42gr subsonics is perfect.

If you're not really rural (I.e a miss could go somewhere it shouldn't) - another option is a high powered air rifle. I've killed probably over 200 possums with a break barrel .22 air rifle. Sure some I had to shoot two or three times, but almost no chance of a missed shot doing someone or something an injury. Worked out at 4-12c per dead possum....

Indian fixed broadband subscribers are only 18 million or so. The infrastructure of innovation is simply not there for now, so I don't think you can blame the Indian mind. Jugaad exists for a reason, you know ;)

I also think it is impressive just how exceptionally well Indian society has been able to bear the brunt of the demonetisation burden without any major riots. This in a country of 1.3 billion people. Could this happen in richer Arab states like Morocco or Algeria or Egypt? To say nothing of places like Iraq. 

Demonetisation has been a test of the soul of a nation. When push came to shove, Indians showed a remarkable ability to bear and confront adversity without falling prey to sectarian lines and turning on each other. 

It was the same when India got independence. Smug Westerners kept predicting India would fall apart, but it has stood the test of time. Now we're seeing the EU splinter.

People, conservatives especially, don't like being told their view is wrong. But there have been many GOP politicians who began supporting gay rights when they had a family member come out. When it has national momentum, it will come. In this same vein, using executive orders to mandate social change can backfire, and is not a good idea. Obviously everything is a case-by-case basis, but some things are clearly more fringe or politically toxic (see: gun rights and abortion in certain states) to begin leftwards shifts at the national level. It must come from the ground up. This goes hand in hand with the Dems needing a better strategy for getting on par with the GOP dominance in local political arenas like school boards and city councils. 

Leftward shifts in workers' rights seem ripe for adoption, but the Dems **cannot** abandon free trade. It is a disastrous idea and anyone who understands anything about economics knows this. Fair trade policies, rising the tides for **workers, both here and in the countries we trade with**, and consequently lowering them for executives and cracking down on safety infractions and shoddy infrastructure. 

I think the Dems desperately need to take back the mantle of ""the Patriotic Party"" from the GOP. Symbolism matters. This can come from an increased support for the military- not necessarily invade more countries and build more fighter planes, but don't be afraid to defend the need for conflict. If the progressive Dems can do one thing it's empathize, they love to get emotional over a cause. Why not Syria? Did Gary Johnson really make everyone associate Aleppo with a dumb interview? Isn't supporting the EU a good cause, especially when you frame it as needing more cooperation to deal with refugees? Instead of building a wall to keep the Mexicans out, why not treat the cause instead of the symptoms and encourage investment in infrastructure and reducing corruption and increasing unity in the Central American countries where those illegal immigrants are really coming from? Why is no American interested in the FARC-Columbia peace process? I'd bet over 60% of millennial liberals have watched Narcos, this is part of the real life version of that story. What about Eastern Europe? How long do we let Russia bully its neighbors, after a convincing amount of evidence has built to show they interfered in our election? 

Stop demonizing religion and start celebrating it. Progressives are so deep down the rabbit hole of appealing to minority groups they forget that theirs a lot of friendly people who also believe in Jesus, the Bible might have some absurd stuff in it but it is a powerful story that is ripe for a modern take in the form of the arts. Tasteful things that celebrate it for what it is and also appeals to the liberal side of religion, the treat others the way you want to be treated/love thy neighbor part. We can reboot superhero movies a half dozen times and get excited over Hamilton, why not dabble in the Bible's stories? I'm very much not saying I want a half dozen Left Behind's a year or a Netflix show about Jesus from the perspective of a southern megachurch, but there are plenty of talented actors, musicians, writers, and artists who aren't fringe-evangelical who could take a turn at this. 

Similarly, don't just talk the talk about supporting Muslims and pretend to know everything about Sunni/Shia when the depth of knowledge is really ""(Sunnis = ) Saudis = Wahhabis = ISIS = Al Qaeda, Iran = Shia, Hezbollah = ?, Syria = :(, Assad = stability tho look at this picture of Damascus 30 years ago I saw on Facebook"". The ME is so much deeper than ""their religion needs a reformation like Catholicism had"", Islam is just an engine that has been used to drive more local conflicts throughout the region's history. Understanding sectarian differences is of course important though- exactly why it's dangerous to allow Iran to have unrivaled influence over large groups of rebels in Iraq and Syria in this black hole of a conflict. There's a large amount of Sunnis in the area who would not react well to being liberated by forces of Shia who may well impose rule over them in turn, and on the other hand we have the Saudis turning Yemen into a private practice battleground. Is it not better to have a say then to continue to go through the cycle of ""we strongly condemn x for y..."". Sometimes a little action can go a long way, but limited, restrained action as a demonstration of seriousness can work well. Terrorism is not the cause, it's a symptom of much larger issues and won't go away if we bomb Isis, cut off the Saudis, and tear up the Iran deal all in one afternoon. 

Yet it will only get worse before it gets better unless smart action is taken, and at some point that will probably include military action beyond the Special Forces that have been there for a while now. But why not use the military to encourage humanitarian aspects too? **Dedicated** infrastructure development and reconstruction after intervention or internal conflicts by an expanded Army Corp of Engineers or some other umbrella group would go a long way towards improving the global name of the US military in conflict zones, as well as allowing for young people (see: millennials with college degrees and no job prospects) to help people, gain hands on experience in real industries like infrastructure and logistics as well as experience a global perspective. This is obviously way easier said than done but I believe this is a great idea that could easily be framed as pro-military, responsible geopolitically, and anti-conflict. And if after the US military had swept through Iraq in the 2000s, if the average Iraqi had seen Americans rebuilding roads, constructing homes and hospitals and schools, and teaching local children and adults, instead of having to live in fear of constant conflict between any local resistance, Islamists, Allied forces, or any other player in the region, they would likely have a far better opinion of American intervention and influence in their country, and thus a tendency towards stability and democracy."

What I know of the Ibizan hounds is that they are more playful and higher energy then a greyhound. They are boisterous outside but are happy to seek out warm places to snooze during the day as long as they've had a good run around. 

Ibizans (and I believe Pharaohs) are built for more stamina then a greyhound. While most greyhounds need 20 min or so of break neck frolicking before crashing for the day, Ibizans need more. I see one out jogging with his owner in the woods frequently. They seem to not be prone to dog-aggression issues and all the ones I've met are friendly with other dogs.

Can't speak to barking, I only meet them outside on walks and never heard them bark but it would'nt surprise me if they make good alert dogs. 

They are also very snuggly and affectionate with their owners.

I love the look of the Ibizans (and Pharaohs) with the huge erect ears and dainty build. But they aren't trustworthy off-leash (like most sighthounds) so I don't expect I'll ever have one.

Original Post:

Author: /u/Felipegutiez

**(Spanish citizen in Brussels for European Union Institutions hiring policy) Why rejected if clearly apt?**
&gt;I passed a competition exam for Spanish translators organized by the European Union Institutions 1997. EURLA98 is the name of that competition. In 2004 I worked as a temporary agent for the European Commission in Brussels. In 2006 I applied for a job as Spanish translator published by the European Economic and Social Committee, one European Union institution. Despite being the only candidate and fulfilling the requirements of the post (German, English and French languages into Spanish) the authority invested with the power to  fill the vacancy decided not to do so and leave the post vacant instead.
&gt; Despite considering that there had been a case of flagrant injustice in the hire policy of the institutions, I decided to abandon the case thinking that the institutions would finally do justice by offering me another job.
&gt; In 2010 I was offered a contract agent position at the European Commission office in Paraguay. At the last moment, shortly before the medical examination, they decided to leave the post, without clear and transparent reasons.
&gt; I have requested several times to send me my personal dossier kept by the Institutions, to check what they put in it.
&gt; Finally, I have decided to seek a lawyer to deal with the case, since I consider myself incapable of fighting such a huge monster as the European Union institutions.
&gt; I just want justice done. The translator job I earned with thousands of hours of effort and sweat. The fact that a person is not the son of a Prime minister or political party sympathizer cannot be the main reason for rejecting a well-qualified European citizen who has proved his ability by passing a difficult test.
&gt; It is unacceptable that a European citizen may cease to be selected for reasons other than his professional training and his Europeanism.
&gt; I ask for help. Is there a place in Internet where I can ask for help to lawyers who will work just for a percentage of the future benefits of the case?
&gt; Thank you very much in advance for your help.

The political landscape is shifting because contemporary liberalism has *failed* to adequately address a number of national and international grievances.

Nope, none of those things. I believe the UK has an opt out of EU obligations to take asylum seekers so we actually take less than many other EU countries. 

They're not included in EU free movement because they are not (generally) EU citizens.

The UK is not part of Schengen so we have our own border controls. If weak border enforcement was the problem, we wouldn't need to leave the EU to fix it.

The reality is that many people just don't realise that immigration from non-EU countries has very little to do with the EU. So they voted to leave the EU because they believed that somehow that would limit the number of immigrants from coming in, regardless if where they're from."

Go read a history book;  Large portions of Islam have been periodically waging war on Europe and the West for 1,500 years, and not in retaliation but as a way of advancing their ideology and geopolitical influence.  So much so that back in the day they had to mount a few crusades to keep them in check among other things.  The Ottoman empire at one point controlled much of the Mediterranean praying on European Shipping.  You may have heard of The Great Siege of Malta.......point is, Islamic extremism goes back centuries before America was even founded.  It **is not** a reaction to Western involvement,  rather fundamentalist Islam merely given a convenient target to hit.  The Islamic Middle East has been a hotbed of hate, instability, war and terrorism for over 1000 years at this point.

Nation building isn't all that bad anyway, it worked well for Japan now didn't it.  Held them to ransom with nukes and installed a modern, Democratic political system and now they're one of the most civilized, modern countries known to man.  Maybe if many people in the middle east weren't primitive savages they'd actually build something worthwhile under American Supervision.

Islam, like it or not, is **fundamentally incompatible** with Western Values, both Socially, and Politically.  This is indisputable. 

Don't just take my word for it, listen to Winston Churchill;

''Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome."" - Sir Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister''

Or do you know more than him as well?

Oh, and religion has nothing to do with race as you know, criticizing Islam has **zero** to do with race.  Take your pathetic buzzwords somewhere else.

To many people brought up in the Reagan drug war era with the ‘drugs fry your brain’ message, psilocybin may seem a strange and possibly even a dangerous drug treatment of serious mental illness. For this reason, we have asked a number of significant figures in relevant research areas to provide commentaries on the two studies. These experts in the fields of psychiatry, trial design and end-of-life care provide their perspective on the research and its implications for clinical practice. The fact that everyone we approached agreed to provide a commentary, despite short notice, is a testimony to the interest that these two studies have sparked.

**The honours list of the commentators reads like a ‘who’s who’ of American and European psychiatry, and should reassure any waverers that this use of psilocybin is well within the accepted scope of modern psychiatry.** They include two past presidents of the American Psychiatric Association (Lieberman and Summergrad) and the past-president of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (Goodwin), a previous deputy director of the Office of USA National Drug Control Policy (Kleber) and a previous head of the UK Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (Breckenridge). In addition, we have input from experienced psychiatric clinical trialists, leading pharmacologists and cancer-care specialists. They all essentially say the same thing: it’s time to take psychedelic treatments in psychiatry and oncology seriously, as we did in the 1950s and 1960s, which means we need to go back to the future. As the commentaries point out, much more research needs to be done into optimising this approach, evaluating the breadth of possible target disorders and exploring the underpinning mechanisms. But the key point is that all agree we are now in an exciting new phase of psychedelic psychopharmacology that needs to be encouraged not impeded.""

Always happy to back that up - It's the general consensus that it was and possibly still is. Former governor of the Bank of England and the IMF (both of who were pro-remain) are on record as saying so:

&gt; Taking an average of these approaches and
allowing for uncertainty suggests sterling
overvaluation in 2015 of about 5–15 percent.

Interestingly this article from 2015 which cites Deuste Banks analysts has correctly predicted that the GBP will drop 1.2X and this is NOT taking into account leaving the EU - they predicited it would happen regardless. Brexit seems to merely have be the catalyst for a more correct revaluation.

IIRC,  98% of income comes from oil rent. Oil prices fell, and so did the countries attempts at social democratic reforms. The privatization of public institutions is already underway.

The PSUV implemented protectionist policies and price controls so the poor could afford food, for example. These are pretty generic Keynesian policies that have been employed in Western European countries before (Depression, World Wars). 


Capital flight, there is no purpose in investing in Venezuela atm when it's unsure if the Government will fuck you over.

Price controls lead to many other issues like it being more profitable to get your cheaper goods in Venezuela and then sell them over the border for a higher cost over the border in Columbia, also fucks up pricing mechanisms and signals too suppliers etc.

But the biggest issue is the PSUV is incredibly incompetent, corruption is rife and there are essentially no functioning institutions.

Wage labor and commidity production still exist, private control of industry still exists, etc. 

The problem with the idea of a 'socialist country' is that, while gains in the right direction can be made, economic systems are global and countries exist and compete on a global level.

I also don't believe that any real attempts at socialism can start at the top (i.e. from the government down). Just my thoughts, though.

The market is in the advantage of the landlord in probably every major European city. In the Helsinki region, the problem is quite severe, and tenants' rights have little (or nothing) to do with it. That said, our tenants' don't really have excessive rights like they do in many other places in Europe. Our largest issue by far is that we've been building way too little for way too long. Politicans are mostly to blame for that, because they have stalled planning at least for a decade. The second largest problem is probably laws on constructing apartment buildings. We have all kinds of stupid rules like, what the average floor-space of an apartment should be, resulting in way too many larger flats, and a major shortage of 25-35 m2 one-room flats. There are also rules on the number of parking spots required for every apartment building, and several others, that raise the costs of housing with very little benefit."

Your argument only works if r/the_donald is inappropriate content.  It's not.  The point is they're not breaking any rules.  Reddit is supposed to be social media. It reflects popular sentiment. Why do you think no one realized Donald Trump was on track to win the presidency? Because places like reddit tried to steer the conversation by censoring places like r/the_donald, trying to limit its exposure, and thus failed to realize that the biggest thing happening on social media this year was the Donald Trump campaign.  r/the_donald are just regular people who have been the most active users on the site and have reached the top under the exact same rules as everyone else.  Changing the site's rules to limit the exposure of r/the_donald is just a small group of people, mostly a bunch of easily offended European SJW's,  taking control of the site and trying to steer the conversation in one particular direction.  This is social manipulation.  If you treat r/the_donald like everyone else, they'll dominate the site until they don't, and people move on to the next thing.

Right now people like you and the reddit admins are acting in a way you can't come back from.  You are so secure in your moral certainty that you feel perfectly comfortable censoring a grass roots movement because you don't agree with it.  What if u/spez had disagreed with Obama or Bernie Sanders? Both those candidates had huge reddit communities that often dominated r/all.  They would have been silenced.  It's exactly the same thing.  This sets a dangerous precedent, and if you don't see that this is the beginning of the end of reddit, you don't know social media.

What it comes down to is that SJW's like you don't actually care about political freedom of expression as a human right.  I know reddit is a private site, but it's also a public social media site. Rules tend to reflect people's values, and you've shown what yours are loud and clear.  You'd rather live in a world where people you disagree with can be silenced.  "

They already pay significant taxes, and the Euro *is* working. I mean it's not perfect, and it's not incredibly strong (by design) to the dollar or pound, but it's not like it's failing either. Greece and my own country Ireland' problems weren't caused or exacerbated by the Euro, they were *helped* by it in fact. Italy the same, the Euro is helping them stave off mass inflation and economic collapse due to decades of internal economic ineptness. The ECB/troika/IMF restrictions were definitely unpopular here, but they absolutely helped get us out of the mess and into a sustainable financial future. It's not the fault of the Euro that certain countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal in particular) put populism before economic sense and therefore had decades of economic mismanagement and systemic corruption where the economic timebombs were masked and able to be put off by the help recieved by joining the euro... but it's helped them when the inevitable happened too.

The Euro *has* been a success... I mean it's not as big a success as many hoped for, nor the cure-all the politicians were claiming, but it's not a failure either.

And the thing is that the EU is *not* a federal state as much good as that would be, it's a union or similarly aligned countries in joint economic zone. There's a reason why it's such a small sum compared the states in the US give back and that's because these are sovereign countries, not states of a single country. They can get help from other places if they need it like the IMF, while Mississippi cannot."

&gt; STOCKHOLM Sweden proposed rule changes for its taxis on Wednesday that may help ride-hailing services like Uber Technologies in the long term, but also recommended that profit-making ride-sharing should be illegal.

&gt; A government-appointed commission said that Sweden should allow taxis to operate without meters, making it easier for drivers to use their own cars - a development that has helped firms like Uber undercut traditional services in other countries.

&gt; Uber, which has faced setbacks in other parts of Europe, already offers taxi services in Sweden, but has to comply with the same regulations as other market players.

Sending money to the third world while not working as fast as possible to transition to a sustainable economy is very short-sighted, you may help the third world a bit, but you doom mankind as a whole. Also, we should be focused on not growing the economy, but transitioning it away from wasteful practices into long-term sustainable ones. That would mean a shift from fossil fuel use to green energy, and slowing down the economy or even shrinking it at this point would be of benefit, while it may result in a lot of lost growth and jobs it will only have a positive effect on our own species survival.
A significant part of lessening the damaging impact on the environment could also be accomplished by significant foreign import fees from countries and produce known to have obtained in a ecologically harmful way, incentivising foreign manufacturers to adopt more sustainable manufacturing practices, even if it would mean a rise in product prices, the total long term cost to mankind would be lower. It may also bring back manufacturing to developed countries where the cost of labour may now be prohibitive, but would not be with the added import duties and taxes of such goods, and the total harm to the environment would be a lot smaller as first world countries are much better at not polluting the environment due to more strict regulations and a bigger focus on sustainable practices.

If you're asking about how I personally would feel about it - I think 600k is too much for a country of 10 million, but otherwise I care little about peoples' skin colour or nationality, however I do care about their cultural background and their general values. So as long as the migrants were compatible with our values and as long as they contributed to the society I would not mind about them. And by contributing to the society I mean working and paying taxes. And no, they don't all have to be doctors and rocket scientists, however I would be very sceptical of migrants with little to no education at all regardless of their skin colour. It's just that the ratio of people with very poor education happens to be the biggest in developing African and Asian countries. 

If you're asking about the general public reaction, it would depend a lot on whether they were muslim or not. A lot of the ""racism"" and ""xenophobia"" in CEE is actually islamophobia, which from my point of view is not completely unreasonable. Racism against gypsies is widespread, that's true, but it's also not completely black and white, since it Roma people often fail to integrate pretty much in all European countries.

I wouldn't say that racism towards all non-white people is that prevalent. We have a quite big Vietnamese community and they're pretty much accepted. Prague is nowadays at 15% foreigners, including people of different colours, and there are little tensions.

The attitudes of people in small towns and villages would be more hostile though.

I understand your point though and I'm not saying that there are no racists in the CEE. There are for sure people who feel themselves superior to Blacks/Asians. I was definitely not trying to claim that we're a tolerant paradise while the UK is a racist hellhole. I was just responding to the question of the OP and while I do realize that a huge influx of migrants would create some negative reactions in this region as well, I did not find it relevant to the original OP's question."

Muslims have been in Eastern European countries for a long time, this is true. They have been in contact with the Muslim world for a long time, this is also true. However the history of contact between the Muslim world and the Christian world in Eastern Europe has been one of warfare and conquest from 1500 all the way to the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Muslims conquered Eastern European nations and territories, installed institutions that favoured muslims, and took Christian and Jewish children as slaves to serve in the armies. Likewise the Austrian, Hungarian and Polish nations reconquered that territory in a number of violent and bloody wars. Modern Muslims are not to blame for this in any way. Modern Christians are not to blame for this in any way. But the affects linger. 

Meanwhile the Jews were an underclass abused by both sides. There is no lingering ill will, and in fact lots of lingering guilt because of the Holocaust. So much guilt in fact the anti-semitism movement in Eastern Europe is likely a response to the belief that Jews are getting too much from the guilt.

Hopefully Slovakia and other nations will be able to move past the history of conflict with powerful muslim nations. But it will take time.

1) Sobre o canal: a proposta é ótima! Canais e vídeos de ciência são muito bem-vindos e têm público!

2) Sobre o vídeo: o tema é bom, mas no ínicio você fala que a proposta é desmistificar os problemas sobre a energia nuclear e no final você se posiciona completamente a favor da energia nuclear. Esse foi um posicionamento muito forte que não me pareceu razoável nem dentro do tema. Você deveria falar o que é mentira e o que é verdade, falar das vantagens e desvantagens, os campos de aplicação e etc...

3) Sobre o aspecto científico: não sei de que área você é ou que nível de formação você tem, mas eu sou da área de engenharia elétrica e estou terminando mestrado. Meus professores sempre frisam muito que não se deve utilizar palavras enfáticas em textos científicos do tipo ""Isso é MUITO RUIM"" ou ""Isso é PÉSSIMO, HORRÍVEL"". Falar apenas ""isso é ruim"" já é beeeem desaconselhável. Você deve citar valores e deixar que o leitor decida se isso é bom ou ruim. Você fez muito bem em alguns casos como, por exemplo, ao citar que ""acidentes de carros são quatro ordens de magnitude menor..."" e tal. Porém fez muito errado ao falar que ""a energia nuclear tem um ÓTIMO custo benefício"". Eu costumo desrespeitar um pouco essa ""regra"" em alguns casos para ser mais didático e deixar o texto/fala mais flúido, mas ainda assim, meus professores sempre reclamam.

4) O /u/E-Nezzer falou um pouco da sua voz. Concordo em muita coisa com ele, mas acho que você pode melhorar. Houve trechos do vídeo que sua narração foi bem melhor do que em outros... provalvemente você já estava sem saco de tanto editar o vídeo. Acho que você pode praticar e vai ficar bom.

5) Conteúdo: tente encontrar alguém para revisar os seus scripts. Eu achei algumas coisas imprecisas e se eu ou outra pessoa tivesse lido antes, teria feito correções. Eu me disponho a tentar revisar alguns de seus scripts. É uma promessa que não sei se poderei cumprir, mas você pode entrar em contato. Também tenho interesse em fazer um canal no YouTube, mas ainda não sei bem a temática.

Suppose it were Romanians, from a Romanian neighbourhood who, for sixteen years, raped white British minors.

Suppose these Eastern Europeans also created their own parallel and controversial culturally sensitive ""civil courts"", where women's rights were put at stake.

1) Spain, France, Germany, and Czechia are your best bets for Visas. It seems like you know the Entrepreneur/self-employed visas for Germany and Czechia. France and Spain are quite generous to Americans (hence large expat communities) as well. Rather than rely on the internet, just ask each embassy directly re: their requirements for their different visas. My experiences have been VERY different than many who post on here. I have found Visas to be very easy to obtain and straightforward. If you tell them ""I want to do XYZ in your country, how do I do it?"", they will tell you what you need to submit. 

3) You will have to have health insurance for the visa. Most plans are dirt cheap (500 euro/year or so as a young adult) so long as you don't additionally request coverage for the US as well. Most will automatically cover you for 30 days in the US each year, but no more. Check the fine print. 

4) It's Europe. Travel by bus (Flix, Ouibus, Hellö, DB, etc.) and flights are cheap. Just be sure to be near a ""real"" airport (i.e. Berlin, Madrid, etc.). Second tier airports are not as affordable. If you have particular destinations, check the route maps at each airport.

Edit 3: Just an update in case somebody finds this via Google in the future or something. The drain was indeed caused by Google Location Services. I saw the solution from a guy nicknamed spixel in the miui.com and xiaomi.eu forums, he says that:

* Location off = no problem

* Location set to device only = no problem

* Location set to high accuracy/battery saver + Location history on = no problem

&gt; Parents in London were today advised to &amp;quot;Take care&amp;quot; when taking their baby outside because of toxic air pollution levels.

&gt; The firm put the level of air pollution in London as &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; this morning based on World Health Organisation limits, which are stricter for some pollutants than EU rules used by the Government and other experts.

&gt; Experts at King&amp;#039;s College London, using the EU limits, put air pollution at &amp;quot;High&amp;quot; in Brent mid-morning and &amp;quot;Moderate&amp;quot; in Sutton, Westminster, the City, Lambeth, Croydon and Ealing.

Therefore the Holocaust and Nazi Germany should be irrelevant to you. After all it is European history and events that occurred mainly in Europe and concerned with Europe and the victims of Nazi Germany were Europeans after all, correct? Same with the Armenian Genocide. Largely irrelevant to Americans. I mean American isolationism is a thing after all. So you shouldn't even be having an opinion on these matters as we are talking about events which didn't occur on American soil, is that how I should take it? I guess all this talk was irrelevant and now that I think about it it was you you engaged in the thread giving your opinions on events which did not occur in America and as it is the norm around in Reddit when American flags are seen users assume lack of educated opinion. However I don't do that and give the benefit of the doubt. But when you state that absurdity that you are not a European state and thus events and the understanding of a genocide that occurred in Europe shouldn't apply to you, you really don't leave me room to have a discussion now. I don't know what fallacy this falls under though. Maybe you can at least help there. 

Finally just to note that most of the research on genocide is carried out on the US and Israel however where most of the knowledge is put to real practice is in Europe, hence the title of the document which includes *European Values*. 

And regarding your point two, I absolutely didn't ignore that part. In fact if you read the rest of the document you can see the strong condemnations and calls on Turkey regarding reparations, etc. The document makes sure there is absolutely no doubt in making Turkey a party to all this. And the reasons are explained in the document and I already explained in the previous comments, including why just because you brandish unreliable statistics from a supposed Armenian authority of numbers just prior to the execution of a genocide which was already in process for a long while ago, and ignoring that numbers are not even the only determiner for statehood, doesn't negate that Western Armenia was the Armenian homeland. 

Your point 3: the Armenian Genocide timeline's latest beginning date is 1984 and earliest ending date is 1923 with the Lousanne treaty. And this is honestly being conservative, stage 8 is still ongoing, and the earliest stages started prior to 1894 with the Armenian Question. Of course unless you deny that there is no denial by the successor (even continuing) of the perpetrating state, or that there has been no such thing as the Armenian Question and policies surrounding it. Anything else is intellectual dishonesty at best. However I still give the benefit of doubt of the existence of a different world view and perspective in matters relating to human rights, arguably one of its cornerstones being a European perspective.

Not really, because the Cape is by far the longest European settled place in South Africa. That is where European settlement began, so the Coloured population began 350 years ago and has been steadily growing ever since since.  By the time Europeans were settling other places in large numbers there were stronger racial lines in place.   If you look at the 1904 census, well before Apartheid, Cape Province already had a 400k Coloured population, out of a population of only 450k in the entire country.  There were already 500k+ whites in the other provinces at this point, but only 50k Coloureds.  The community was born in the Cape, and unlike the Boers the vast majority did not trek.  Later during the gold rush, colonial period, and during Apartheid they did not have access to the same economic opportunities that would make them migrate. 

I'm sure plenty did claim Coloured status just for improved conditions during Aparthied, but there are other reasons the population is concentrated in the west

If light infantry gameplay is either a strength or a skill you are looking to develop, the 173rd Airborne Brigade might be just what you're looking for! Our unit is based on the real-life 173rd Airborne Brigade that has a history dating back to WWI.

If jumping out of helicopters and transport aircraft with 40 to 80+ soldiers from across the U.S. (plus some soldiers from Europe as well) sounds like fun, you'll definitely enjoy what our unit has to offer.

**CHECK OUT ONE OF OUR SWEET OPERATION VIDEOS!**
https://www.youtube.com/user/173rdairbornedivison

While our unit operation takes place on Saturday evenings, there are other events that would interest you that take place throughout the week.

To be an *Active Duty* soldier you are required to attend at least 2 out of 3 of your required weekly events (squad training, platoon training, and the unit-wide combat operation). This amounts to between 4-6 hours each week (if you plan on attending all 3 events). If you don't have that much time to devote you may enlist as a *Reserve Duty* soldier and only be required to attend 1 event every other week (that event lasts approximately 2 hours).

If you're interested but still need more information feel free to check out the unit's [About Us](http://173rd.us/index.php/page/aboutUs2016.html) page, or you can come talk to a recruiter on our [TeamSpeak Server](http://www.teamspeak.com/invite/ts3.173rd.us/?channel=Request%20a%20Recruiter%20%28Read%20Description%29).

First off wanna thank you to being the second person to actually get my point. Funny how (judging foolishly by flairs) the person who didn't get my point was a ""fellow brit"". Why I understand OPs question I choose not to answer because I feel its more important that I dont want someone to assume or think that the British people as a whole dislike EEs or CEs, even though I know you don't think that in general but I feel to smell a slight odour of it. 

I won't restate my point since im happy you got it. But you said something which is bloody spot on. ""The attitudes of people in small towns and villages would be more hostile though."" - This is what happened to EEs and CEs in the UK. Not saying London is a paradise by any means but those in the small less economically benefitted towns have had the biggest ""shift"" in their communities by influx of european immigration and thus have had the greatest change to them. This has caused a LOT of friction. One has to remember most of these places who did voted to leave Brexit (most) are the ones which throughout history have been fucked the most by successive governments and always get the scraps of pile. I would honestly compare it to Germany pre second world war where Jews and polish (not exclusively) were blamed for ""this country is shit because of them grrr"". When people are in a bad mental state already and don't have a good environment for propagation of freedom or great thoughts i.e they are swimming in shit, they get angry and bitter and look for a way out. 

Instead of working hard and pulling themselves out of the cesspit (some do) they look for reasons to blame as to why theyre in that place. It not my fault its other people etc. Eastern europeans were the perfect scape goat. In a service based country which ruined its industry in the thatcher era EEs were a fucking gold mine. Mostly educated CHEAP labour hard working? No contest. Sadly after the baby boomer generation a good chunk of the UK and its population has become intoxicated on the social welfare standard (you owe me a living). When people came along who did not think like this it threatened their way of a lax life. Globalisation is a bitch huh. Cue the garbage media and their owners latching onto this resentment milking it for the udders (EEs claim benefits, claim NHS benefits etc) and people got madder and madder. Why are these people getting things ""for free"" when they just came here? When we've been here since birth and we get nothing? - General sentiment. 

The problem occurred when people who can't really think for themselves start being spoonfed propaganda by the shovel full.  EEs get this EEs get that. Just because a couple handful of people abuse the system (Brits do it too) doesn't mean its their fault, its the fault of a garbage system being riddled with loopholes which allows it to happen. Don't want to get robbed? Lock your door. This is the essential piece. ""locking of the door"" or in other words cut off from the EU - Brexit. The sad part is some people after voting OUT actually claimed they didnt know why they voted out and just did it because they thought people would vote in the majority for in. And also you got to remember a LOT of people who could vote did not vote because they were not given the correct facts. There was garbage propaganda from everywhere and sadly the british aren't too used to thinking with a clear head and only see what they wanna see (when in a badmood but hey who is). Ye i guess its an island mentality we have and sadly Ill be the first to admit too many of us have an arachaic garbage superiority complex which we need to divorce from as fast as possible. All this ""they're only coming here for 'our"" benefits and money"". We've been through a lot of shit post war. 

But dont think that out of that 52% 100% of them have a resentment for EEs, its not true. Yea some do. But some just despise the despots in Brussels which personally sicken me too. How a group of unelected people can dare talk about and discuss lawful changes to politics in relation to a country it has no ties to is kinda messed up but hey. 

For what its worth I voted to stay in cause i couldnt give a flying fuck what language someone speaks or who comes to this country.

It's just pro-white man instead of pro-minority. It's kinda hard to spot because they've taken a big mix of liberal, libertarian, conservative and populist positions but the common ground between them all is that they are in some way pro-white man. 

Usually their positions are pro-individualist, a stance which indirectly benefits white and asian men more than other groups. But some of their positions don't fit that philosophy and are just protecting white men and european culture because they think it's a smart social investment to gear society in favour of the group/culture that has been historically dominant.

It's shit rationale for a myriad of social and economic reasons let alone their incredibly annoying dick swinging tactics. 

I'm not surprised that they behave pretty similarly to progressives when they get scrutinised because their core beliefs are built on sand and simplification.

In one of them a native British shithead picked up the Romanians (think it was 6 in a flat, literally just mattresses everywhere.) and took them to a field to work for 10 hours. Offered them £50 a day (10 hours) which is way below national minimum wage.. Then never even paid them. 

I felt bad for the Romanians. They clearly just wanted to get a better life, but they were taken advantage of from the get go. 

None of them could speak much English.. They're ripe for taking advantage of like that. Cash in hand, not minimum wage.. They'll do whatever to survive. 

They're jobs that would have been £7.50 an hour for a Brit who knows his rights, and who to call if he gets screwed over.

Answer: Because you need a big-ass single market. The current EU single market is riddled with more holes than Swiss cheese. Spotify openly said it was easier for them to expand to the US than to expand to Spain. That should tell you something.

Also, the language barrier. 

There are a decent amount of tech companies in Europe(DeepMind, ARM, Soundcloud, Spotify as well as IT infrastructure companies like Ericsson, Alcatel, Nokia etc). The problem is the dispersal. 

If you don't have a *real* single market, you can forget about it. There is also a need to concetrate much of the talent in a single location, which is also open for immigrants. To my mind, only two places would cut it. Barcelona or London. 

Barcelona because of the weather and the closeness to the alps, just like California is both warm and has snowy mountains. Drawback is that you'd have to start from scratch and the local language is non-English. 

London's strengths are self-explanatory, but problems is expensive housing(although SF isn't doing better) and worse weather. If the UK goes out of the EU after the negotiations, it will also be hard to justify it on those grounds. "

There was never any concentrated effort to get Trump to explain his plans on the issues, and he was given a complete free pass for the plans he didn't have, or the ones that were found to be highly questionable at best. They never questioned how these plans would deliver on the promise to help the Middle Class.

Trump was never grilled on his campaigns ties to Russia, or the real concerns people had, and still do about the support he received from White Nationalists, and the very controversial stances his campaign team had on matters of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.

Trump was never taken to task about his business practices, and what they said about his treatment of the working class, and middle class. He was never taken to task on this. He totally robbed students with his College, and we didn't get a peep on it.

Questions were never raised on his stances on NATO at a time when Russia and Putin have been increasingly expansionist, and threatening along Europe's border.

It has still never been questioned how we're suppose to come together as a country after the decisive campaign he ran.

We didn't have time to question Trump on issues of how to lead this country, and we didn't have time to question Hillary either. However, we had plenty of time to go over the E-mail scandal that started in 2015, and go over Benghazi from 2012, which we already had more investigations on that anyone can count, none of which found anyone guilty of anything other than trying to pass the attack off as inspired by a Youtube video. The most under-covered part of Benghazi is probably the fact that, despite intelligence that the situation was becoming more dangerous, Congress denied the Presidents request for an increase in funding for security, but decided to keep funding at current levels. I can't tell if both sides were incompetent, or the Democrats were just stupid, and the Republicans were trying to create an incident they could blame on the Democrats.

So we covered that crap like it was breaking news for over a year. And never had time to figure out if Donald Trump was a bigger piece of shit than Hillary Clinton.

I'm not saying I'd take either as my boss, but between getting fucked by Hillary, or fucked by Trump, at least I know what she's going to do. Now all of a sudden, we find out Trump is into castration, and all the signs where there if they had been reported correctly. Oh well, too late now! Good bye penor!

&gt;De dienstplicht passen wij aan naar een opt-in systeem, waarbij Nederlanders vanaf hun 18e jaar te kennen kunnen geven beschikbaar te zijn voor militaire dienst wanneer de nationale veiligheid ernstig bedreigd wordt. Hiervoor bieden wij zowel schriftelijke als digitale mogelijkheden aan.

Dit is een moeilijke voor mij, maar wat wel duidelijk is, is dat het geen dienst *plicht*. Ik moet zeggen dat mijn persoonlijke overtuiging dat niemand gedwongen mag worden om te doden en mijn mening dat het impliciet aan het sociale contract is dat je in tijden van extreme nood je gemeenschap moet verdedigen als een van de 'kosten' hier op gespanne voet staan. Allicht is het een idee om dienstplicht te behouden maar voor mensen met gewetensbezwaren een optie te geven voor niet-gevechtsdienst?

On ne peut pas tous être des programmeurs informatique.

Il faut que l'on puisse préserver un filet de sécurité social pour empêcher nos plus pauvres de payer les pots cassés à chaque crise.

Macron a proposé d'aider les entreprises industrielles à monter en gamme, pour pouvoir ne plus subir la compétition à bas coût du moyen de gamme sur laquelle nous sommes positionnés actuellement. Il a déjà baissé le coût du travail pour le rendre moins cher qu'en Allemagne, et donc qu'on soit plus stable à la prochaine crise ! 

Mais il faut faire attention aussi, quand tu imposes à tous une sécurité sociale telle que la notre, tu bloques aussi les gens que tu veux aider: on te prends ton argent pour te le rendre plus tard quand tu as des problèmes. 

Sauf que peut-être t'aurais aimé garder ton capital pour toi pour profiter de ton chômage, pour le rendre utile sur un plan personnel.

Par exemple, mon meilleur ami a été en apprentissage de ses 16 à 20 ans. Ensuite CDD jusqu'à 22 ans. Et on lui dit ""heureusement que t'as le chômage"" mais queuedal, il l'a payé une fortune son chômage quand il travaillait, et il aurait préféré utiliser cet argent pour s'acheter qqc, voyager, prendre des putains de vacance qu'il a jamais eu car on l'a foutu en apprentissage à 16 ans pendant que je me touchais le zizi au lycée.

Oui mais non, car son entreprise pouvait pas le prendre en CDI de base, car il y a trop de connard anciens de France Telecom qui branle rien et dont Orange peut pas se séparer ! Et puis son assurance sociale, on lui a pris sans rien lui demander ! Là on lui verse au compte goutte en voulant le forcer à travailler.

Mais il veut pas. Il veut se reposer, rendre son chômage utile, voyager. Mais il peut pas, on lui a pris son argent, pour le ""protéger"".

En gros les règles qu'on a imposé pour nous protéger nous coûte, nous empêche de faire ce que l'on veut avec le produit de notre travail. Elles réduisent nos libertés.

For a scale model country in a little bottle Singapore is actually a very livable place. A bustling, high tech, harmonious and peaceful multicultural city with great food at all hours. Dogs and cats, hindus and christians and muslims living side by side. Roti prata and kopi-o at 2am. $60 tickets to Bangkok. $150 to Hong Kong. $250 to Tokyo. A great base for exploring SE Asia. Everything just works here. 

Since I graduated from school I've lived and worked in five different countries (including Singapore) plus several US states. I'm old enough to have seen first hand the slow decline of the US, UK, EU, even beautiful Scandinavia where the sometime widely admired social democratic great society maintained fine and free hospitals; these have withered to the point where non-emergency procedures can have 2-3 year waiting lists. The old people get almost no help from the government anymore, and retirement homes looks like prisons or refugee camps. 

 My Danish uncle was in hospital for a minor malady and lost a leg to sepsis that he got from the perpetually soggy, moldy and bacteria-laden carpet in his hospital room. They closed down most of the regional hospitals in the country so now ambulances have to ferry patients up to 60 kilometers for the nearest emergency room.

There are things about Singapore I find absurdly regressive, like their conservative anti-LGBT policies and media censorship, and so on. But Singapore takes care of its own, with great efficiency. Their hospitals are second to none. Citizens get subsidies, and even if you have no medical insurance (which is cheap), procedures and examinations cost only a fraction here of US prices, and there is no waiting. There are virtually no homeless people here. The needy will receive public housing. They don't sequester the old into retirement ghettos; they live side by side with younger couples and remain part of society. I could go on.

&gt; Austrian duo Reinhard Rietsch and Markus Wagner, otherwise known as Camo &amp; Krooked have quickly become one of the hottest production outfits in Europe. Working together since 2007 and signing exclusively to Hospital Records in 2010, the Viennese pair have created a whirl of dancefloor anthems and a fearsome reputation for their untouchable production skills.

&gt; Since signing to Hospital Records they have have brought us soulful, sultry tracks like massive hit single “Turn Up The Music” alongside raw power of smashers like “Climax”, proving that they are not only super talented, but they are also incredibly versatile.

&gt; In autumn 2011 they released their first album on Hospital “Cross The Line”; a fourteen-track rollercoaster ride of emotions, veering between polished vocal-led beauties to filthy tear-out monsters, which delved into dubstep, drumstep, electro-house and everything in between. The album was a universal success and the duo won not one, not two, but three awards in the Drum &amp; Bass Arena Awards 2011 for “Best Producer”, “Best Video” and “Best Album”.

&gt; Another exciting development was the birth of Camo &amp; Krooked live show; a multi-sensory show, featuring the pair perched inside an LED-lit cage using iPads and various MIDI-controllers to rearrange and modify their recent hits and trigger visuals, with album vocalists. The pair toured with the live show throughout the rest of 2011.

&gt; 2012 saw the release of their remix album “Between The Lines” which featured remixes of key “Cross The Line” cuts by a range of producers including Metrik, Mefjus, Subwave, BCee and more.

&gt; Since then, the boys have also had their music featured on some high profile computer games and have released LP ‘All Night’ in anticipation to their new album 'Zeitgeist', due out on 30th September 2013. With Eighteen months of hard graft under the belt, ‘All Night’ foresees the new album in its influences from French house, disco and minimal techno that creates yet another angle to the Camo &amp; Krooked signature sound, as does the recently released follow up 'Move Around'.

The electoral college helps prevent massive states like California from basically taking over the government.  Think of our federal government as the EU, and the states are the member countries.  They all have their own specific interests they're pursuing.  It's one of the things that makes governing our country tough, because you have to deal with all these states that want to do their own thing.  Sometimes we resort to shady tactics and strong arming to punish them into conforming, like funding and the drinking age. 

The problem is that state like California have greatly diminished power. It is crazy that a smaller state gets to decide how California gets to run for nearly half a decade. You are implying that it is unfair that California would get more votes  when we have the largest population, I'm sorry that is not unfair.

Let's put this into perspective. California has the largest population and overwhelmingly provides the most wealth to the federal government. In fact California largely subsidizes and keeps alive failed red states with more electoral power. A person in who-the-fuck-cares Kentucky gets to decide how to deal with immigrants in California who are part of the state's economy and have a large hand in the harvesting of crops that feed the entire country. A person in no-one-wants-to-live-here Louisiana can decide to ban Muslims for fears of terrorism even though they will never be the target of it while cities, which are targets, are more welcoming. People in less populated urban areas get to overpower larger populations in urban areas simply becuse they refuse to advance to the 21st century and live with this notion that they want the ""old days"" to come back. Like fucking hell, we are seriously going to deny climate change because people in red states were promised shitty coal mining jobs back.

Reactionaries and radicals are both defined in terms of opposition to conservatives. Conservatives are people who are basically fine with the foundational basis of a given political order - they can advocate reforming or preserving elements of that order, but they are fine with the order itself. Most Americans, left and right, are 'conservative' on this definition. Radicals want to generate some new political order, whereas reactionaries want to return to some past (imagined or real) incarnation of political order. The difference is that reactionaries think that this order has a historical basis in a country's identity.

For someone to be a liberal reactionary, they would desire to fundamentally change the American order to one that is more liberal. Given that the basis of American politics *is* liberalism, this is incoherent in our context. It would make more sense to speak of a 'liberal reactionary' in, say, USSR or Nazi Germany (as someone who wants to restore liberalism of Weimar or the Russian Republic)."

Keep in mind in most European countries, any forum of the sort, with right wing or Nationalist ideology, with freedom of expression, is instantly censored/shut down, and people are fined or jailed for it.

By the way, the opposite and often even worse, coming from non-white communities, including hate-speech, is tolerated by the system (courts, media, politicians, etc).

All I have to say is that the USA is probably the country with the biggest allowance for what I call ""White self-determination &amp; thought"" in the Western world. But its very logical to me, that there will be attempts by some groups to make the freedom of expression as limited as it is in Europe regarding these topics.

The reason is that in the USA, you have the same individuals and groups as in Europe, who hate racial thought and white consciousness. Its just that they haven't succeeded in implementing the same hate speech laws as in Europe, so they are still in the process of attempting to implement that. **And it will come if you do not fight, legally especially. By the way these same groups act for gun control, gay rights, etc. It all comes under the same umbrella of things to destroy/limit**

Take it from European, and especially German society: This is NOT how you want to become. Make no mistake, Trump got elected purely thanks to freedom of speech. And this is why in Europe such a thing isn't possible. Its well known that freedom of expression leads to populist candidates having the opportunity to convince people of their message. "

And honestly what Fener is bragging with is even more pathetic. Like their biggest win against us or their unbeaten streak at home. But that just proves my point... Everyone works with what they got.


I mean should we act like we don't care? That may sound like a cool, edgy thing to do but it's just gonna help everyone else forget. We have to stay relevant.

remember the EU want to trade with us like we want to trade with them, they make billions off exports to us. they do NOT WANT THAT AFFECTED. if were still paying a certain amount into the EU budget it wouldnt seem like theyd be giving us special treatment which they ofc fear, it would look like a victory on their half as well, and so im sure a reasonable conclusion will be met. 

they only want to put up a tough stance to prevent any other eurosceptic movements from rising, they need our trade, like the car manufacturers especially. they wouldnt continue to make things hard like giving us access but not control of free movement, they want trade to resume without bending over and letting us get whatever we want. i see this as both meeting halfway.

Two big problems: 

First, because you with your laptop will be in Germany, the German government will see that as working and generating revenue in Germany. 

This means you are subject to German laws on employment, taxation and (since you are a non-EU citizen) foreigner's law, specifically the rules on residency permits and work permits. 

So you first need a residency permit and a work permit. 

If you want to be employed in Germany, you need to find an employer who will comply with German employment laws, who will pay taxes on your behalf to the German authorities and pay social security payments into the German system. 

Frankly I doubt your US employer is up to founding a branch in Germany just to accomodate you. 

So my suggestion to you would be to acquire a few more clients and work freelance. This will probably be the best way, since getting a freelance visa is relatively easy compared to a regular work permit.  

Another potential solution could also be that a German company makes a contract with your US employer. The German company hires you and pays your wages, taxes and social security contributions. In return they gain your US employer as client and then bill your US employer for your services. Such a contract would be right up the alley of a ""Zeitarbeitsfirma"" (= temping agency). They would take their cut and pay you significantly less than another employer, but this way you could still work for your US employer. If the background is explained (you are legally employed by the US company) it would become pretty clear that the German company wants you and only you and that this contract would not happen with anybody else. Meaning you are not taking a job away from an EU-citizen or a non-EU foreigner with a work permit. 

BTW, this would all be a lot easier if you two were married. Germany does not recognise common-law marriage. Instead of coming over as a dependant, your application will be decided seperately and independently.  "

It was used at least 5,000 years before Adolf Hitler designed the Nazi flag. The word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svastika, which means “good fortune” or “well-being."" The motif (a hooked cross) appears to have first been used in Neolithic Eurasia, perhaps representing the movement of the sun through the sky. To this day it is a sacred symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Odinism. It is a common sight on temples or houses in India or Indonesia. Swastikas also have an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian European cultures.

The symbol experienced a resurgence in the late nineteenth century, following extensive archeological work such as that of the famous archeologist Heinrich Schliemann. Schliemann discovered the hooked cross on the site of ancient Troy. He connected it with similar shapes found on pottery in Germany and speculated that it was a “significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.”

In the beginning of the twentieth century the swastika was widely used in Europe. It had numerous meanings, the most common being a symbol of good luck and auspiciousness. However, the work of Schliemann soon was taken up by völkisch movements, for whom the swastika was a symbol of “Aryan identity” and German nationalist pride

This conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people is likely one of the main reasons why the Nazi party formally adopted the swastika or Hakenkreuz (Ger., hooked cross) as its symbol in 1920.

The Nazi party, however, was not the only party to use the swastika in Germany. After World War I, a number of far-right nationalist movements adopted the swastika. As a symbol, it became associated with the idea of a racially “pure” state. By the time the Nazis gained control of Germany, the connotations of the swastika had forever changed.

In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler wrote: “I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.”

The swastika would become the most recognizable icon of Nazi propaganda, appearing on the flag referred to by Hitler in Mein Kampf as well as on election posters, arm bands, medallions, and badges for military and other organizations. A potent symbol intended to elicit pride among Aryans, the swastika also struck terror into Jews and others deemed enemies of Nazi Germany.

Despite its origins, the swastika has become so widely associated with Nazi Germany that contemporary uses frequently incite controversy."

At the time this site, and its stated mission, was all about freedom of speech - thanks site's creator Aaron Swartz.

Collectively Reddit did do some great things over the years such as participated in stopping the SOPA in 2011-12, and a related legislation in the EU. 

Unfortunately that was pretty much the last time Reddit defended the freedom of speech.

Over the years, little by little this site had started to change. 

The corruption was incremental at first: abuse of mod powers, astroturfing, collusion, mods getting money and favours for astroturfing, people getting banned for posting evidence of it. Then it slowly started concerning political opinions: users getting banned for their legal free speech, mods with obvious leftist bias spreading their influence over numerous subreddits, whole subs getting banned for infractions other subs got away with scott free.

It was all incremental. The story of boiling frogs comes to mind. 

To me the final straw was when the gamergate blew up. That really woke me up to see what this site had become and how it had abandoned its core principles.

Aaron Swartz used to be the #1 hero of reddit! Sadly now you rarely hear his name any more."

&gt;this is why i think terming it **'apartheid' is buffoonery**.. the palestinians are treated as an enemy because they positioned themselves that way, they are not segregated because of their religion or ethnicity.

**This** is the only buffonery

Israel declared their state without approval which took 55% land over the natives. What else were they to do there was no basis to self determination for the palestinians which a clear violation of UN charter principals. The israeli's literally treat the Palestinians exactly through Apartheid the british handed over all responsibilty to the UN. The Europeans never fired rockets at germans after the war was over how can you agree with that idiotic motion. The israeli's even try to control Palestinian caloric intake and water. You seem to forget the germans were literally accused of ethnically cleansing the Poles, the ukrainis, and the **european jew**. Which doesn't excuse any violence towards these people but the reality is most of the violence perpertrated on the germans after ww2 was at the hands of soveiets, (who they renegued a pact of non agression with), poles (who they almost made not exist for another 100 years) and the french ( who they utterly humiliated ) however when you research the atrocoties to the german  people after world war 2 seldomly would you hear that germans were excecuted at the hands of british forces. Even though some were tortured which is terrible but that never justifies how the israelis are literally attemping to restrict caloric intake and water.of palestinians. You seem to forget that if they could they would and there's not a doubt in anyones mind. There was no one  sadly to stop the Europeans but here there is the UN this why you feel as though the israelis ""treat"" the Palestinians with ""kid gloves"". When in fact in public their politicans spout endless propaganda against the Palestinians including the made up notion that the ""the grand mufti"" of Palestine came up with the ""plans for the extermination of jews"" which ispure fabrication.

To be considered the player must have team success and individual success. With that said I think the real competition is:

Toyz 
Misaya
xPeke
Dade
Froggen
Bjergsen
Alex Ich
Hai

Toyz - best player in the world season 2. Did the same thing Faker did season 3 in carrying his team to a World Championship. Unfortunately, he hasn't played enough since to be considered the second best all time.

Misaya - the best Chinese mid laner of all time. Complete beast domestically and could rival anyone internationally. Unfortunately he hasn't played enough lately.

xPeke - won season 1 worlds, and made semis in two separate seasons. The leading man for Fnatic, his Kass was a must ban for years. Now the owner of OG and his recent ADC appearances shouldn't be held against him.

Dade - Perhaps the greatest team fighter of all time. Was a key reason that SSG Ozone underperformed in Season 3. Best player in the world for 2 splits in LCK leading up to worlds. Ran into SSW when they had the perfect meta (SSB would have won if meta favored late game comps) in S4. Turned China into retirement home and has seriously underperformed since.

Anivia - the leading figure from the infamous CLG.EU (does anyone know why CLG didn't try to import those guys back when a 5 man import squad was legal) Anivia's go to pick was Froggen. He was front and center in the arms race that took place between CLG.EU and M5. Consistently able to force opponent in lane he was able to dictate how his opponent played the map. His creation, Alliance, made world's the first year, and underperformed, while ushering in the super team era. Unfortunately his supporting cast has fallen flat the last two years hurting Anivia's legacy.

Bjergsen - the best mechanical western mid laner of the past few seasons. Was able to focus on his own game this past season while relinquishing his shot calling abilities which resulted in his best season ever. Can go toe to toe with any mid laner in the world. Solo killed Crown this year, and got solo killed back. Hurt by raw draws at World's (would have made semis/finals in S4 if on right side of bracket and quarters in any other group this year.) Still his international legacy holds him back.

Alex Ich - the last member of the EU mids triumverate, Alex Ich was one of the driving forces for M5/Gambit. He was an innovator and consistently challenged the meta. Hurt by the fact that Diamond was arguably more important to M5's success and that he destroyed Gambit only to consistently fail ever since.

Hai - the greatest shot caller of all time he took C9 to unprecedented heights. An innovator himself, Soraka mid anyone, Hai was copied on an international level. His mechanical abilities fell off after unfortunate injuries to both his wrist and lung, otherwise would likely be higher. Helped by C9's collapse and subsequent world's run in S5.

I might be missing some people sorry. Others I didn't include because they haven't had a sustained period of success. I would rank these players:

2. xPeke - as much as it pains me he always shows up on any stage and he created some of the most legendary plays of all time. I think he earned this.

3. Dade - one of Korea's greatest players of all time. He would be even higher if not for his lack of disappearing outside of the LCK (internationally and China).

4. Hai - his impact can't be understated and out of all the others his drop off is the most explainable.

5. Froggen - in seasons 2-4 one of the top 7 players in the world. Hurt by the fact that the 4 above him had more success last 3 seasons.

6. Toyz - dumpstered every mid he faced. Helped by that fact no one took SEA seriously before S2 so was able to surprise. Still best player in the world S2.

7. Misaya - best Chinese born mid laner of all time. Retired too soon from WE.

8. Alex Ich a great player in his own right just not as good as the others.

Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong &lt;3"

A conspiracy implies they are keeping it secret, but they actually do this shit quite openly, and by making it political they got the added benefit of making science a partisan issue. Therefore, people treat it like a political issue instead of a scientific one.

Plus, there's a lot of die-hard fundamentalist Christians in the US, moreso than other developed nations due to a long background with that type of Christianity (or nation was first colonized mostly by religious extremists who got booted out of Europe), and they believe that either A.) we aren't changing the climate because God is the only one who has that power or B.) even if we are changing the climate, God will step in a save us anyways.

Just to preface this, I'm the mod who called him a dickhead over Twitter. 

As I stated in my post where i announced that I'm stepping down, I haven't been active on this sub for months. At most, I come out of the woodworks whenever shit goes down and the hate comes out against my mod mates. This was one of those times. 

Ronin brought it to our attention, as I believe he has you followed on Twitter. This is the first introduction I got into the whole situation. I had nothing to do with your post removal, or temp ban. We discussed that the attack on Red was permaban-worthy, and for obvious reasons. If someone with 10 Twitter followers gets angry and tweets about us, that's one thing - but when someone who is obviously a large member of the community, such as yourself, tweets to 30,000 followers to ""give 'em hell,"" it becomes a step further. A few, actually. I get your point where you wanted to change to happen in terms of the rules, but at the time you must understand that *it did not look that way at all.* It appeared to be your typical ""go fuck with this guy,"" kind of post, which is a straight up witch hunt.

That pissed me off, and it pissed me off badly. To see Red do all the work that he does every day around there without so much as a complaint, then get shit on over and over again for complying with our rules and following them as a moderator is heartbreaking. That's what caused the late night middle finger from me to you. 

This part is more off-topic, but I stepped down as moderator soon after this, because I simply don't feel attached to this community anymore. I've always tried to do nice things and help orchestrate enjoyable things for the community, the most recent one being ReturnToLordran, because I loved and felt loved by this community. Now? Not so much. Not on /r/DarkSouls3, at least. Is this possibly my fault for not being more willing to change the rules or *try* to talk the other guys into changing them? Perhaps, but we also have our reasons for the things we do. We want to remain in good standing with those behind the game. Kimmundi, the EU Bandai Namco Community Manager, regularly drops by /r/DarkSouls3 for example. We've had several instances where FromSoft / BamCo have been watching the Subreddits and doing things with the community. I even had Kimmundi ask me personally if he had the moderator's support / help for a future Pvp project of his. 

I feel that if we as a moderator team allowed things such as glitches, exploits, cheat engine tutorials, and shitposting to manifest without removal, we wouldn't have those same connections to the people as we do (or maybe *did*, now) today. 

So then we have to make a decision on what is best for the community. Do we let everyone do those things and potentially lose the interest of those who *created the damn game,* OR do we simply put it in the rules to not do those things, the same rules we've had since /r/DemonsSouls, and retain those connections with those people? 

We chose the latter. This has obviously caused a huge number of problems - moreso on the Ds3 subreddit than any other subreddit in the past. 

Keep in mind, there's always other places to do those sort of things that we have rules against; SDS for clever / tasteful (they made me say that part) shitposting, and /r/DarkSoulsMods for things featuring cheat engine or modding. 

We aren't trying to snuff out the voices of people we don't like, or throw topics into the garbage bin that don't sit well with us, we're trying to make /r/DarkSouls3 a place where the entire community - the game dev's or publishers included, can all sit well with one another. That's hard to do whenever those higher ups wouldn't want to be around through all the shitposting and ""how to use CE 101,"" type of posts. 

If you feel we hate you and that's why x or y happened, then that's your opinion. That's not how things went down or why this or that happened, but that's an opinion nonetheless. I feel as if you had calmly approached Red and asked him why it was removed, he would understand. If not - you could've messaged the other mods (hell, even in a PM) to try and figure something out. Just because you're a huge member in the community doesn't mean you aren't allowed to do things like that and ask for some help understanding our actions. We make mistakes too, and it's absolutely okay to question what we do - just don't be a dick about it. That's more of a general rule, than a shout out at you, /u/DamnNoHTML. 

There've been many issues before this with people not being understanding of the fact that all it takes is a polite pm our way and things can possibly change. I include the word polite because the shit we usually get is nothing far from a ""why'd you remove our post you SJW autist faggots?? Lmfao fuck you"". 

So to recap: 

I didn't remove any posts, or contribute to the temp ban. I did however, advocate for the ban to be moved permanent after the Twitter thing against Red. Whenever I tweeted at you last night, I had decided that I would step down as moderator of /r/DarkSouls3, and then made the post today. 

I'm not going to recap the rules or why they're there, If you want to know that information then you'll have to actually read my wall of text that I've slowly typed out from my phone. 

Oh, and I'm not the person you need to talk about when it comes to the original removal of the post or the original temporary ban - that would be Red. Regardless of the fact that he removed the post / temp banned, I feel like you should extend an apology to him and relay the information of this post over to him yourself. It would likely mean more and help mend things if you apologize to him like you did the general public in your post here, and probably help the mending process, If there is one to be had.

I would also like to state that I appreciate you saying some of the things you've said here, as well. 

Have a good day, everyone. "

The Arab spring saw hundreds of thousands dead and many more displaced. The Muslim Brotherhood was responsible for the rounding up, just in Egypt, of thousands of Christians and non Muslims and the murder of them.

Looking at the Iraqi war those casualties aren't from bombing. Most are what happened after the war and a lot of it was caused by the rebel groups fighting. Let's not forget Saddam's former leaders decided to fight a failing civil war against the US and the elected government and would often target civilians and Infrastructure. Also the Iraqi Government has done a terrible job so far. There are two sides. Let's not forget the people fighting the US in Iraq were those who wanted to maintain and restore a brutal dictatorship that saw tens of thousands imprisoned and tortured, millions displaced, and hundreds of thousands killed. 

I am not saying the West or the US should be or get involved in the Middle East. Europe and the West should mostly stay out of the Middle East. However, Let's not pretend though that they're the sole reason for the issues. The main reason for the issues are Authoritarian figures who refuse to give up power, the rich and powerful who refuse to give up power, and all their various influence on the US and others through their power.

If the US and the West removed themselves Terrorists and others would simply find something else. These are people who crave power and who will use whatever they can to achieve it. They use propaganda to find recruits. We know if the US just left they would find something else, they did when the US mostly stayed out of it. Europe is still avoiding it. As it is now only Russia and the US seem to be seeking peace. Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia the major weapon and financial funders of the Civil war in Syria continue to create strife in the country as they all seek to secure a favorable outcome for themselves.

- They then go on to do 3-8 years of residency and fellowship at a salary of 45-60k per year
- These are overall high achieving people, so they are giving up 7-12 years of earnings (for example they do consulting or something and could have made 120K per year during that time)

It's not an economic power. Donald Trump won because the democrats lost the white working class and believed the industrial heartland would accept more globalization and immigration. Britain has never really been at ease with being a EU member. The Middle East is on fire from both economic instability, religious sectarianism, and the lack of a counterbalancing force.

Each of those  things has been the case since the 1990s. Why have they both suddenly come to a head in the same year? Why have Germany, France, and Italy all seen a resurgent far-right in *the same year*?

The Middle East is on fire because Russia is keeping it that way. Instead of attacking ISIS, they're *defending* Assad, which is a different thing. There were uprisings in a number of Middle East countries over the past five years or so, but none were as sustained as Syria. What do we see there more than we see elsewhere? Russian ties and Russian involvement.

&gt;Russia's influence in the west isn't that strong. It's just being used as punching bag for a failed establishment on both the left and right. We may be in the midst of our times answer to the French Revolution, an upending of the existing order that was based on a failed system that couldn't provide for enough people.

**On Islam's role:**

&gt; It is never the intention of Islam to force its beliefs on people, but Islam is not merely a set of beliefs. Islam aims to make mankind free from servitude to other people. Hence, it strives to abolish all systems and regimes that are based on the servitude of one person to another. When Islam has thus freed people from all political pressure and enlightened their minds with its message, it gives them complete freedom to choose the faith they wish.”

Sorry for being a bit loose with my language.  But you're arguing semantics.  Nothing you have said makes it any less problematic to hate Muslims.

&gt;  People aren't racist or islamopbobes for wanting to limit immigration

Please quote where I said this

&gt;  If you would have lived in Europe (dunno if you are), you would have seen how destructive it is on our cities (one example being Sweden). My opinion is that we should help people where they are. Now we are letting all the older and sick stay in the countries, while taking in young men. If you have a different opinion, that is okay. 

What does any of this have to do with anything that I said?

&gt; I didn't say people couldn't be left leaning, like you are implying though

I did not imply that you said this

&gt; I never in my post made the connection left = transphobia.

""Expecting all transpeople to be left leaning SJWs seems to be some sort of transphobia to me""

&gt; The language of SJW and so on is there because they are very intolerant of other peoples views. 

And as I said, we ought to be intolerant of things like Islamophobia

&gt; LGBT spaces want diversity, but the only sort of diversity you don't want is intellectual diversity or diversity of opinions.

Hatred of Muslims is not ""intellectual diversity"", nor is it some innocuous ""opinion"".  

&gt; Not everyone agrees with gender studies stuff, black lives matter (the ""organization"") or that fatphobia is a thing etc., and that is okay.

It is not okay for people to hate Muslims in LGBT spaces.

&gt; You should be able to discuss these things without having to call people islamophobes/homophobes/racist/misogynist etc. 

Calling an Islamophobe an Islamophobe and a misogynist a misogynist, etc, are really not cardinal sins.  And, as I said, it is really much more important that LBGT spaces be tolerant of Muslims than it is that they be tolerant of Islamophobes.

&gt; TL;DR: Diversity of opinion is great. If you are left-leaning, that is great. You do you! But don't label everyone who disagrees with a buzzword.

I did not do this.

Did you not take a history class? Did you forget about various large wars fought over an area being considered French vs. German. Do you not pay attention to modern European politics? Brexit alone brings your position into question.

The EU does not have open borders because the EU forms some sort of happy-to-be-unified super-culture. The EU has open borders in an attempt to *foster* the idea that all these different cultures are better off working together vs. maintaining their isolation. It is a weapon against xenophobia, being wielded in an attempt to alter cultural perceptions. I would say they have succeeded, since you seem to act as if the borders of the EU are fixed and a priori defined culturally, instead of a fluid and dynamic political discussion.

I mean, your position strongly implies that there should be border control between California and Texas, who talk about succession every other presidential election. Or between the Southern states and the rest of the country. This is a place that thought it was separate enough (culturally and economically) to fight a war over the issue.

We only stay unified because we choose to remain unified. Not because of some shared history going back to 1776.

Alternatively, if you think the EU is a good idea, shall we start annexing neighboring areas with similar cultures, even if it crosses an existing border? Perhaps locations with intertwined economic concerns, even if the spoken language is different, like the EU? The free flow of trade would serve both sides well. Maybe we leave the borders intact, but have some sort of agreement in place to remove barriers to trade. Oh look, we just invented NAFTA."

This is particularly true if I take advantage of a retirement visa such as Malaysia's retirement visa.

&gt;I am a little surprised that your brokers aren't cool with nonresident citizens. Most brokers ive dealt with are ok with non resident non citizens but these are in the EU

The reason why is that the regulatory burden the US government imposes on financial companies serving US citizens abroad is second to none. As such, many (most?) companies simply refuse to do business with them. It's why I posted a little further down this thread that I was a bit saddened I was born a US citizen since I do plan to move abroad. Basically, as an expat being a citizen of practically any other country on Earth would be better than being a US citizen from a financial and tax perspective due to these burdensome regulations imposed on companies doing business with US citizens.

Of course this kind of thing is constantly in flux and could changing drastically depending on the political situation."

&gt; Mr Hollande, faced with very low popularity ratings, has become the first sitting president in modern French history not to seek re-election.

&gt; One of the first reactions came from a former economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, who said the president had made a &amp;quot;Courageous decision&amp;quot;.

Que eu saiba os servios durante a guerra inteira só quiseram manter o que era deles (a jugoslavia). A ideia de que iam entrar em ofensiva contra outros paises neutros é ridicula.

Problems with that game: 

It takes a long time to install.
It has a subscription (although the first month is free when you buy the game).
It's very different from most modern MMOs so it takes a while to get used to, especially the UI.

Pros:

It has a healthy population at least in Asura it's most populated server and also home to the reddit community (it's nowhere like it used to and some zones look like ghost towns now but once you hit the main hubs it's packed). For comparison when I played on that exact same server you could search and max on the weekends there was like 4000-5000 people, now it's like 1000-1200 players at the same time (which is pretty good for a game that came out in 2002). It has around 90,000 subscribers atm I think, it's not amazing but for comparison a game like Archeage which I played 2 months after release for a year had less active players on EU's most populated server when I left (I was refering to the 1200 players at the same time figure)

The graphics are great considering the specs required to run it. (I'm not saying they are great, just that it's amazing that it could run on a PS2 while being an MMO haha, they look decent enough to me where I'm not thinking about it constantly at least)

It has a really good storyline, much much better than FFXIV's. It's like playing a main line final fantasy game (it's one as a matter of fact) with friends.

Leveling now is really really easy (it's normal compared to other games but FFXI used to take a 6 months to a year to get to max level). 

The community is THE best I've ever played in any game.

They introduced a lot of stuff that help you clear all of the content of the game and fast travel (normally I'm against it but this game really needed it, the world is freaking huge)  without the need of other players, for the most part. YOu might need some help for SOME max level stuff but there are plenty of players.

I'm moving to a different country with not a lot of money (I'm talking living off 150€ a month) to spare and a crappy laptop to play games and this was a great choice. The game is real fun playing alone (well leveling and doing story lines mainly, a lot of people to chat with and to help you if you need it) it must be 3x better with someone you personally know to do all that stuff together."

Anyway, I'm still happy to answer any questions you may have.

Please note there is no cookie cutter method for gearing.  The best advice is to just play the game and do stuff.  Gear drops from anywhere, including breakable items like pots.  So get out there and do Nephalem Rifts, Bounties, Greater Rifts, etc.!

Some general tips:

* Ultimately, you want to farm T10-T13 Rifts and Greater Rift equivalents (GR 50-60+), as well as use the Kanai Cube (for re-rolling specific items, or upgrading rare yellow items to legendary in hopes to yield a good non-ancient or preferably an ancient legendary) in order to obtain gear.  Just letting you know that so you have an idea of the general ""end game"" method for obtaining gear.

* For early gearing, doing any of the following will help you find some kind of gear: Bounties, lower level Nephalem Rifts, Crafting (both at the blacksmith and using Kanai's Cube), lower level Greater Rifts.  Bounties are really great for obtaining materials and legendaries.  A word of advice:  if you join a public bounty game (which is far quicker than doing them solo), never speak with Tyrael and turn in a bounty quest UNLESS the act you are in is the current BONUS act.  People get VERY salty when someone messes that up, because it causes everyone to lose half the mats they would have received otherwise.

* Completing Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the Season Journey will reward you with a 6pc set for ONE character (2pcs from each chapter).  This reward can only be earned once per season so choose a class carefully that you intend and hope to play.

* You can further bolster any ancient legendary gear you have using Kanai's Cube by augmenting items with Caldesann's Despair.  This process sacrifices a legendary gem (obtained from Greater Rifts or Vault runs) to add additional primary stats to your item.  Every level of the legendary gem adds 5 additional primary stats (e.g. a level 70 legendary gem will add 350 of your primary stat to an item).  Again, this can only be used on ancient legendary gear.

* If you find a Puzzle Ring or Bovine Bardiche, you can use just those items individually in Kanai's Cube to open portals to the Vault and The Cow Level, respectively.  Those are both great for obtaining some starter gold, as well as gear and mats.  The Vault is guaranteed 2 legendaries from the boss chest at the end, plus whatever the 2-3 goblins drop inside.

* If you participate in public games, let people know that you're gearing and looking for any loot they may not need.  Most groups I've been in have people that share loot by dropping it for other people that need it.  Being polite and friendly goes a long way!  Also, once you're geared, be sure to do the same for others in need!

That's about it for now, just wanted to provide a starter point for you.  Let me know if you have any specific questions.  Happy slaying!

However I find it strange, Europe is very multi-cultural many people in Europe are immigrants from Africa/Asia especially the past 2 decades. Italy, France, Spain has a huge population from the North African region you can see it in football(soccer). There is again a difference ethnically and culturally there but unlike the US won't say I'm from say Ivory Coast if they were born in France, they would just say they are French. They have cultural connections to their roots but it doesn't make someone descended from one place that nationality.

For me what I find odd is since moving to the US when I am introduced to someone they automatically assume I am Irish because I have an Irish sounding name, that's it (I have a english accent). However they continue to make connections between us being Irish. To me usually I'm thinking none of us are Irish here. As you pointed out in an earlier post the culture is not what people assume it will be, they have an idea of what they think it is and generally its not what they thought. For example people will make statements ""Ireland is ...."" yet they have never been or don't know anyone there.

&gt;NYC is huge. The Bronx is rough, as are parts of Brooklyn and Queens and a small bit of Manhattan. It's bigger than Virginia.
The government services end up attracting or keeping people here; we ended up with lots of homeless for similar reasons. DC is the same

Yeah no shit that was the point, cities are already over burdened a solution shouldn't include burdening them further. 

&gt;21% according to this. NYC is really split though. Super rich and super poor with few of us in the middle.
Urban areas nationally tend to have loser poverty rates than rural areas and, thanks to transit, better access to jobs. Ever known a poor guy in a rural area? He's fucked if his car dies. A poor guy in the Bronx could potentially bike to work, take a bus, or ride a subway train. He's got options.

I said at or below and you post the figure for below.  Even if we strictly use below it's still over 2m people in the city, once again proving my point that they're over-burdened. 

Urban areas do not use loser definitions of poverty stop making stuff up.  As far as transportation is concerned NYC has the best public transportation in the nation so using the aberration as an example is hardly an example at all.

&gt;Many of the Obama administration's were undertaken as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and many of those investments were specifically in clean energy. According to a report by Clean Edge: The Clean Tech Marketing Authority, the recovery act included more than $70 billion in tax credits and direct spending for programs involving clean energy and transportation.

Alot of that money was funneled towards solar technology and businesses. As to your second point I'm unsure of you're trolling here or not. Because the scientists say things will get bad if we keep doing what we're doing we should just double down and push for more fossil fuel use? If we had that motto with the other issues scientists were ""exaggerating""  over then we would be well on our way to having to wear sunscreen to walk outside for more than an hour and having to watch weather forecasts for corrosive rain. The point of science is for us to make informed decisions before it's too late. 

We can't just buckle down and ride out a 2 to 4C rise in temperature. I think that's the biggest point lost on a lot of people who don't really worry much about climate change affecting them. Sure some countries may get fucked by a 2m sea level rise and droughts, but we live in a rich country and I'm nowhere near an ocean. So we'll be fine right? The problem is that these issues don't occur in a vacuum and drought/famine/mass migration across the entire globe will cause worldwide destabilizing effects that we can't predict, but we (including the US military)  can pretty accurately predict that these effects will be a great rise in risk to national security over the coming decades. Syria was only about 5 million people and it nearly crippled Europe. Imagine a world with over 50 to a 100 million people desperate for a safe Haven away from war and drought. Here in the US we will feel those effects greatly and so will our children. 

But we can fix it. Obama made the first steps and we have a pretty new burgeoning solar industry. We can push for more nuclear power (new and extremely safe sophisticated plants which can be up in less than ten years)  as a stop gap while we pour money and tax credits into new energy research. We can go along with the paris accords and tax our own carbon use, effectively leveling the playing field for all 1st world economy. It's and being a global leader in the environmental crisis.

Russia isn't the instigator, its propaganda machine is simply tuned into to it. 

In any case, France's far right has been rising for years, ever since the new millennium started. While the Italian far right has largely been been in the shadows because Berlusconi was a center right, and at times far right, leader that was in charge/in the limelight for so long.  Germany's far right (if your talking about AfD, as the Neo-Nazi movement hasn't really seen a lot of growth), as well as the Austrian far right, have been growing in power for a while. The lasting cultural power of Heimat in Germanic Europe has left immigrants completely separated from their host countries cultures. Turken in Deutschland aren't considered to Deutsch, they are separate as their Heimat (which has no good English translation of the concept) isn't German. 

The resurgence of nationalism is Huntington's classic clash of civilizations argument. No group is truly questioning western democracy and the market economy, they are defining themselves in relation to their culture. Culture, Religion, and Race has reasserted itself as the defining fault lines of our time, as they were prior to the Second World War. Globalizations discontents are boiling over, and the post WWII order is breaking down as the relative decline of the west has reached a point where a multipolar world, centered around culture and religion is emerging. 

Russia isn't the great manipulator of western media as you seem to suggest. RT, and Sputnik, are largely obscure to the American populace. VOA, RFE, and Radio Martí and other US media are much more influential globally. Their attempts to influence elections isn't even new, they've attempted for years to do it, as have others. The only difference was this year that Clinton was so already prone to the leaking of information, in any other election between anyone else, the emails would be but a beltway scandal. People in the heartland didn't trust Clinton, the emails therefore simply magnified an underlying mistrust. "

Like I said: there has always been a right wing in Europe. It didn't go away after WWII, it just got pushed aside. And absent a Russian-funded microphone, it would remain *aside*.

To the extent that any of the broader changes you're talking about are real, it's because of Russian influence.

However he hasn't written 1,000 pages in order for his analysis to glance off the surface of society. He has objectives and sets out his table on why, for instance, the UK is better in Europe (I think his opinion changed before the referendum). His conception of English identity will run up against others. And so that's what I'm getting at when I say neutral isn't necessarily ideal.

I found this topic ironic after their ruling last week on non prosecution of rape/marriage offenders.

They have since considered releasing more hordes onto Europe cancelling any previous deal that was made. Much of this is rhetoric until whatever next term's diplomacy works out and the direction Syria takes.

If this topic isn't fake. 

In any understanding of why this has aired, after media and the judicial system have become reformed into greater state control is because A: they want extradition of who they named as responsible for the attempted coup, but it was denied by the current US government B: they are unhappy with Europe C: they are attempting to incite their population with satire by showing other powers decadence possibly that rallying card after they supposedly removed corruption for whatever actions they are uncertain about.

Funny when CNN tells us what politicians claim they believe as if it is fact and the actual motivations of these politicians.

No, they don't believe that. Iran's nuclear program was perfectly legal and started with US encouragement, with zero evidence of any weapons program


They and the Pro-Israeli lobby have been pushing for a war on Iran using the ""Iranian nukes"" pretext  for a *long* time now:
Example:
http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/war-and-peace/2008/06/iran-spam


This is not about nukes or WMDs, those are just excuses to impose regime change for the benefit of Israel. Iran's nuclear program  which started with US encouragement, was in fact always quite legal with no evidence of any weapons program there, ever.

http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Most-U-S-tips-fingering-Iran-false-envoys-2646358.php

Naturally Israel was not happy to see the US and Iran signing agreements instead.

Note that the Iranians had repeatedly been making BETTER compromise offers that the US rejected in favor of keeping the pretext for imposing regime-change alive 

Even the IAEA Director himself concluded the same:

&gt; I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [program] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers.  http://www.newsweek.com/elbaradei-iranians-are-not-fanatics-80021

The stereotype emerges from the 18th century Enlightenment discourse which sought to present the past as a period of unprecedented civilizational decline, especially by blaming the Church (when, in reality, the Church was the largest educational institution, as you point out.) Second of all, Europe was considerably less advanced by virtually every metric - it wasn't as backwards as we imagine, but there was a severe and demonstrable regression from Late Antiquity after Roman civilization began to recede, while the Middle East continued to advance (in fact, arguably advanced farther than ever before.)

&gt; Those quotes are not about a guy wanting a feminine, kind, sweet woman. Those quotes are about guys who literally want a servant around the house who's unable to leave.

I’m not saying that you don’t get tradcon extremists or people who troll, but those views do not reflect most men who prefer submissive women. For most it’s first and foremost a visceral attraction, together with the alluring promise of a peaceful co-existence.

On the other hand, a lot of men are appalled at the way in which men are sneered at, belittled and demonized by modern women in the West. They also resent being expected to capitulate to a gynocentric and feminist view of relationships. This sometimes radicalizes them into taking extreme measures that ensure women treat them nicely and with respect. That’s when you might see men travel to places like Thailand and Brazil to meet more agreeable women or order mail order brides. Similarly, you may see others seek to emulate more androcentric relationship models, such as occur in Continental Europe (where discrete mistresses are tolerated by wives), by dating women who depend on them more.

The fact is that the biological consequences of the competing mating strategies of men and women produce a tension that cannot easily be reconciled in intersexual relationships. Something has to give and sometimes that means men seeking relationships with women who depend on them more and give them more freedom outside of the confines of the gynocentric models.

I think there are so many things at play that these issues cannot be easily boxed in as either/or. The diversity of men who feel these tensions is broad, spanning from left to right, rich to poor, rural to urban, religious to atheist etc. To create a singular, monolithic explanation for any of this will not enlighten anyone.

Second:
I have a friend who does statistical investigations on various WoW things for fun because he's a huge math nerd, and it turns out most players do not get that far.

Getting level 885 gear requires either mythic kills on raids, Mythic +9 or +10 kills, or very good luck on legendaries/titanforged gear. There have been a bit over 10,000 groups that have killed Mythic Nythendra even once. That's not many. Multiply by 20 and that's 200,000 characters -- out of 1.5 million players -- that have killed Mythic Nythendra. Now, killing a mythic boss does not give you 885 level gear immediately and you care about people who can farm early mythics, not just who got a kill that one time. In other words, people likely to have 885 gear are the people who are around 4/7 Mythic and can farm the first half of Emerald Nightmare.

Now, who's at 4/7 Mythic? 4700 groups. That's well under 10% of the playerbase. Now you have to account for who has it on farm and farms regularly.

9/10 people do not have a very reliable source of high level gear from raids. So, 10% at absolute best, now add in some people who are somehow not raiding but still doing constant farms of high level mythics...let's be generous and tack on an extra 5%.

15%. That's it. Now decrease this by the number of people at any given moment who aren't doing something else, like raiding or dungeons or old content or just aren't even online.

And frankly, if you need 885+ in your group, unless you're doing double digit mythic+ for multiple chests and stuff, you're wrong, elitist, or wanting things to be overgeared so you don't have to try."

1) The US needs to stop calling itself a democracy then.

2) I oppose any undemocratic system. Making one persons vote count more than anothers is no better than denying votes at all.

&gt;Fantasies of going to a popular vote for the president will never happen. You also might want it that way now but in a few generations your ""team"" may not want it that way.

How could my ""team"" not want it that way when I will only ever vote for a party that supports democracy? Democracy also works amazingly well across Europe.

&gt;Everything is designed to balance the power that each state has over other states. You start changing that and all of a sudden 4 cities or so control the rest of the country and the rest of the country will back out of the union.

Everything is designed to make some peoples votes count more than others. If a state does not like democracy then they SHOULD back out."

Warum?

In der Form, wie Dobrindt sie den deutschen Autofahrern versprochen hat, mit einem Ausgleich durch Senkung der nur von Inländern zu bezahlenden Kfz-Steuer, ist die Pkw-Maut nicht mit der EU zu vereinbaren:

1\. [EU-Kommission verklagt Deutschland wegen Pkw-Maut](http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2016-09/eu-kommission-verklagt-deutschland-wegen-pkw-maut)

2\. Umgekehrt sind die ""Vorschläge"", die die EU-Kommission zur Behebung der Diskriminierung von EU-Ausländern gemacht hat, verglichen mit Dobrindts Plänen schlicht lachhaft, reines Verhandlungstheater ohne Substanz. 

[EU-Kommission geht auf Dobrindt zu](http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/pkw-maut-eu-kommission-geht-auf-dobrindt-zu-a-1085868.html)

&gt;Wie die ""Bild""-Zeitung berichtet, schlägt die Kommission vor, im Gegenzug zur geplanten Maut die Pendlerpauschale für Fahrten zur und von der Arbeit zu erhöhen oder die Spritsteuer zu senken. Durch diese Maßnahmen würden die Autofahrer entlastet, ohne ausländische Fahrer zu diskriminieren, hieß es weiter.

Die Erhöhung der Pendlerpauschale lässt allen nicht arbeitsplatz-bezogenen Verkehr außer Acht.  Und von einer gesenkten Benzinsteuer profitiert wiederum jeder, der in De tankt, nicht nur deutsche Autofahrer. 

Was bleibt am Ende?  Pkw-Maut ohne Ausgleich für die Kfz-Steuerzahler, die somit doppelt blechen dürfen.

Und wer nicht auf beiden Augen blind ist: das war das von Anfang an gewollte Ergebnis, mit der EU als bequemen Sündenbock, und dem Finanzamt als Profiteur.
