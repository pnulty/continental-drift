julius959,,,"Davis accuses Brussels of unrealistic demands. The European Union is demanding billions of pounds after Brexit for aid to Africa, loans to Ukraine and environmental projects across Europe including bridges for wildlife.

With Brexit talks becoming increasingly hostile, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said yesterday that Britain’s refusal to honour long-term spending commitments made before the referendum was damaging trust.

It “would not be fair” if the remaining 27 member states were forced to make up the shortfall left by Britain’s withdrawal from the seven-year EU budget round that ended in 2020, he said.

During a heated press conference, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, accused Brussels of claiming legal obligations from Britain that were not “real”. Appearing alongside Mr Davis in Brussels, Mr Barnier warned that there had not been “decisive progress” on crucial issues and that the two sides were “quite far away” from being able to start talks on a trade deal.

The biggest sticking point is the bill that Brussels says Britain should pay. Mr Barnier’s team says that the UK should honour all spending agreed as an EU member but British officials argue the claims have no legal basis.

In an attempt to pile on the pressure, Mr Barnier insisted that there were “joint obligations towards third countries”. These included long-term loans to Ukraine and development programmes in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries. He also singled out obligations towards environmentally friendly development. “We have jointly committed to support innovative enterprises and green infrastructure in European regions until 2020. These are not recognised by the UK as legal obligations. With such uncertainty, how can we build trust and start discussing a future relationship? We need to address together these issues seriously and rigorously,” Mr Barnier said.

Green infrastructure covers projects to defend urban areas from floods and to protect wildlife. In a document published by the European Commission, these include animal bridges, fish ladders to help species to move upstream, hedgerows and green roofs, which are covered in vegetation to absorb rainwater and create a wildlife habitat.

As an example of EU spending, it cites building bridges for wildlife to cross in the Alpine-Carpathian corridor between Austria and Slovakia. Over the 2014-20 spending round, the EU expects to put almost €6.4 billion into green infrastructure.

The EU also provides €15 billion in development aid, of which the British share is about €1 billion. Britain would still have to put up this money because of the government’s commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on aid each year. Any fee for access to the single market during a transition period would be in addition to the settling of existing commitments.

Mr Barnier’s demands were attacked by Eurosceptic backbenchers. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been mooted as a contender to succeed the prime minister, said: “Unless this is a straw man that the EU expects to negotiate away, it shows exceptional naivety to think that a British government could agree to this. Once we have left, the EU can waste money all by itself.”

Mr Davis said that Britain would meet its legal obligations “but these have to be real obligations”. He added: “We have a duty to our taxpayers to interrogate it rigorously. It’s fair to say across the piece we have a very different legal stance but . . . the settlement should be in accordance with EU law and in the spirit of the UK’s continuing partnership with the EU.”

The two sides had one breakthrough, agreeing that a million British expats in the EU would continue to have free healthcare including using a European health insurance card in all remaining 27 member states, although that fell short of the government’s desire for the scheme to continue for all Britons. Consensus was also reached on technical issues relating to the Irish border and confidentiality agreements.

The prospect of meeting an October deadline for “sufficient progress” on the withdrawal talks appears to be receding, however. Mr Barnier accused Britain of “nostalgia” for seeking to maintain the benefits of the single market. Mr Davis hit back: “I wouldn’t confuse a belief in the free market for nostalgia.” He urged Mr Barnier to be flexible and put “people above process”.

Hey! 

Madi first... I met Adrian Diaz in 2008, in a junior international event. We have a few facebook messages from after the first time we met, kids flirting. He was training in Europe, and the spark quickly fizzled. Fast forward 7 years, and in the 2014-15 season, it seemed like we were at every competition together. We reconnected for the first time at Skate Canada 2015, and immediately fell for each other! The move to Montreal, where he trains, made our relationship even closer. We live together, have our Pomsky puppy Nova, and plan to live our happily ever after! Skating is a small world, and it has given me many great friends, and also my amazing relationship!

cuethefanfare,,,"&gt;Sam Harris' work is perfectly respectable, which is why philosophers like Singer and Dennett have engaged with it.

I didn't say it wasn't respectable. The assertion here is that Harris is doing something interesting, novel, and/or rigorous at the level that an academic philosopher would be. I can't find anything in his work that is. Most of his positions are ideas that have been already put out there and critiqued. Since he doesn't bother to deal with most of those critiques, I'm not sure why his work should be taken seriously or be read by academics when they have a wealth of more rigorous work to contend with. 

That being said I am perfectly fine grouping him under the banner of ""pop philosophy."" Most people don't want to wade into academic philosophy and for them I think Harris might be a worthwhile read.  

Regarding academics engaging: would a psychologist engage with Malcolm Gladwell? Probably. But do they think they take his work as seriously as their peers? Of course not. Moreover, I can't think of any place where Singer has engaged with Harris's work on a more than superficial level. Dennett, if you've read his critique of Harris's FREE WILL, is actually pretty dismissive (I'd argue almost too dismissive) at one point calling the work a ""museum of mistakes.""

&gt;It's lightyears ahead of garbage like Derrida and Foucalt, who are highly respected by the gatekeepers. 

Who or what are these gatekeepers? I'm not familiar with Europe, but most of the analytical tradition popular in the U.S. is pretty hostile to post-modernist philosophy. Can you point me to a top philosophy department in the U.S. that has a post-modernist bent?

&gt;The claim that Harris' work is simplistic is just a post hoc way to discredit and ostracize him because he violates the mores of the left.

You keep saying this despite the link I provided to a post from u/wokeupabug showing this is not the case. His moral philosophy is dismissed as simplistic, because it is. In fact, I'd argue, it's the MO of THE MORAL LANDSCAPE to be simple enough to appeal to a general audience unfamiliar with philosophy.

Madi first... I met Adrian Diaz in 2008, in a junior international event. We have a few facebook messages from after the first time we met, kids flirting. He was training in Europe, and the spark quickly fizzled. Fast forward 7 years, and in the 2014-15 season, it seemed like we were at every competition together. We reconnected for the first time at Skate Canada 2015, and immediately fell for each other! The move to Montreal, where he trains, made our relationship even closer. We live together, have our Pomsky puppy Nova, and plan to live our happily ever after! Skating is a small world, and it has given me many great friends, and also my amazing relationship!

What are Western Christian values/culture? There's so many denominations, variance within denominations, and not to mention variance within history. What will you do when basic christian values are not agreeable to you? The bible suggests that women should be silent in church and that one man wanting to put his willy in another man is an abominable sin and lots and lots of christians agree with this, that men and women have different roles and that homosexuality is against God. Western liberal democracies however do not support these values. What happens when the basic values i.e. don't kill people and worship your God turn out to be the same as basically any other religion? 

Culture and values are constantly changing, absorbing influences, and updating for the new world and new generations.

You make other claims I want to address. For instance, you suggest Islam has been extremely unsuccessful. On the basis of the last few decades this claim might be reasonable but on the basis of the last 1500 years it is patently, deeply wrong. The islamic conquest was *enormously* successful. At their furthest extent, Timbuktu in Mali, the Pyrenhees mountains in southern Spain, Slovenia, India and Persia, even parts of Southern Sicily were under Muslim rule. They toppled the Byzantine Empire, their navies ruled the mediterranean.

Don't let the current state of the middle east confuse you. In 1550, Istanbul was the only city in the world with free healthcare and education, religious freedom and massive state investment in arts and culture which puts nearly all of medieval europe to shame comparatively, despite the Enlightenment. For instance, Jews were still banned from England at this time, one of the greatest shames of bigotry of a country with a lot to be ashamed of in its past.

Muslims were the world's best sailors, most advanced scientists and astronomers, and had one of the finest literary traditions. The Persian and Arabic art music and poetry was one of the world's finest. The arabic language was the most widely spoken in the world, and the beaureacracy of the Ottoman empire was the world's most efficient, the only state at that time capable of maintaining such a large empire. 

Muslims invented Algebra and the idea of raising numbers to a power. The University. Clocks. Drinking coffee. Some of the first decent surgical instruments. The first truly accurate navigational maps. These are all products of muslim culture we've been happy to add.

Really, it is only recently in the life of Islam that the arabic world has become backwards and ultra-conservative as a reaction to the collapse of the old muslim states and western encroachment.

Guncriminal,,,"&gt;Here is a nice article for you to read.

Emotions might describe *your* voting behaviour, but some of us actually have well thought-out priorities.

&gt;Now where on earth did Karl Marx write that wheat could be ""educated"" into yielding more under socialism? Nowhere.

That's good because no one said he did. Nonetheless, it was the natural progression of Marxist ideology. The same way that followers of Marx continue to deny the reality of sexual dimorphism and race.

&gt;And that's because such a view is idiotic, unscientific and 
idealistic. Ideas cannot change material reality.

That's precisely why they failed.

&gt; Maybe if he'd been an Objectivist agronomist the wheat would have yielded more.

And objectivist agronomist would probably agree ideas cannot change material reality and base their research of reason and logic, rather than denouncing, say, genetics as ""bourgeois science"".

&gt;You are an exception to the rule. Most people naturally love their family members. We are biologically predisposed to do so.

I guess I must be some sort of X-Man with the ability to alter my biology on the fly. I doubt it, though.

&gt; Hated of one's family members can be engendered through environmental conditions, but again, this is true only of a minority of people. For example, if you are abused by your family members you will feel negative emotions, and in associating those negative emotions with them, will have hateful thoughts about them. Thankfully biology predisposes people against this.

*Thankfully* biology predisposes people not to hate people who abuse them?

&gt;Your reason is clearly the slave of your passion for Ayn Rand. 

Don't drag me down to your level.

&gt;We choose all those things as we are predisposed to do by our emotions.

Your emotions don't predispose you to anything, as they're a product of your value system.

&gt;You have sex with a body, not a mind. You fall in love with a face, not a brain. Biology &gt; pseudo-philosophy.

Just because you behave mindlessly doesn't mean everyone else does. I suspect you pick your politics in a similar manner (see above).

&gt;Yes, they do. It's embarrassing you don't know this.

It's embarrassing that you didn't read what I wrote. A chemical does not have a sexual preference; it's not in a class of things that even possess sex, much less sexuality.

&gt;And again.

That link doesn't claim chemicals have sexual preferences either.

By the way, why do you keep posting links to pop science journals and blogs? Too scared to go for the hard stuff?

&gt;Das Kapital did not kill kulaks.

No one said it did. It was part of a causal link.

&gt;Karl Marx didn't give birth to Josef Stalin, nor did he destroy Rand's family.

No one said he did. Really, this evasiveness to the obvious causal effects of ideology is just making you look dumb. 

Stalin didn't just fall out of the sky.

&gt;A nuclear-armed, industrialised Russia, communist or not, would likely have been in competition with the USA anyway.

No, it would have been destroyed by the third reich, but that's another story.

&gt;Russia losing WWI which led to the collapse of the Russian Empire which led to the Russian Civil War which led to the victory of the Bolsheviks and the creation of the Soviet Union. Also WWII caused death and destruction across Europe due to Hitler's insatiable greed for land to enrich German capitalists leading to the uprising of communist partisans across Eastern Europe leading to the Iron Curtain.

(clap clap clap)

You've finally learned that ideas are the driving force behind history, not some random ""material forces"". Bonus points for naming yourself after the guy who came up with the great man theory.

&gt;Marx didn't cause all of that to happen. Capitalism did. Just like Marx predicted.

Make your mind up. Capitalism is an idea. Do *ideas* cause history or do *material conditions* cause history?

Capitalism caused Marxism to ""happen"", so it'd be a stupid argument anyway even if I was wrong.

&gt;The material reality was caused by Russia having a large population, a large amount of natural resources,

Sort of like Africa. But that never got anywhere.

&gt; good generals, good weaponry and a vast landmass which made it very difficult to invade. 

&gt;Marx wasn't responsible for any of those things.

Not quite, but he was responsible for communism and inspired the system that ruled it for seventy years.

&gt;See above. I dare you to provide me with a quote in which Marx said wheat can be re-educated to yield more under socialism.

You're being deliberately obtuse. I never said it did.

&gt;I'm not Ayn Rand.

I remain a little skeptical that everyone who chooses that path will necessarily be happy about it when they're 50.  Then again, many people who choose the more traditional path of ""mortgage, marriage, kids"" don't seem terribly happy at 50 either.

Og hvis han forsøger det der lort i Tyrkiet bliver han gennemtæsket af de lokale. Det tyrkiske folk har fået nok af syrere, og det er nået bristepunktet. Der skal ikke meget til, før det går virkeligt galt til dernede, og med galt mener jeg organiseret selvtægt i en meget omfattende grad, der kommer til at involvere uskyldige.

Det er efterhånden normalt at syriske drenge i Tyrkiet samles i grupper hvorefter de bruge aftenen/natten på at chikanere tyrkiske kvinder på gaden. Dog har de ikke nær så meget selvtillid som i Danmark, da der ikke skal meget til, før hele nabolaget løber ud på gaden på jagt efter dem. Der har også været mange sammenstød og mord, hævndrab osv. Ca. 450 tyrkere er blevet dræbt (primært stukket) af syriske ""flygtninge"" siden krigen startede. Typisk dræber de deres udlejer eller chef pga. penge. 

Selvfølgelig er de fleste ikke sådan, og dem jeg kender er meget civiliserede, men ligegyldigt antallet eller procentdelen af de rådne æbler, så sker det bare, at nogle af dem ikke kan opføre sig som mennesker. Og tyrkere er desværre ikke kendt for deres medmenneskelige tolerance eller tålmodighed overfor fremmede der opfører sig så svinsk, ulig Danmark og Sverige.

TheCarlyleanHero,Socialist2,"Perón, Chávez, Vargas and Kirchner","&gt;Emotions might describe your voting behaviour, but some of us actually have well thought-out priorities.

You haven't refuted anything. 

&gt;Nonetheless, it was the natural progression of Marxist ideology.

How does one go from ""the contradictions of capitalism will lead to its collapse and its replacement by socialism"" to ""Socialism means re-educating wheat to yield more"". It is a complete non-sequitur. Where is the ""natural progression of Marxist ideology"" in this? Where did Marx even *imply* this? Why are you so dense? Have you ever read Marx? Why do you think that pseudo-science is something inherent to Marxism? Has 1930s capitalist Germany not crossed your mind? Or all of 19th century capitalist Europe with its barmy theories on race?

&gt;And objectivist agronomist would probably agree ideas cannot change material reality and base their research of reason and logic, rather than denouncing, say, genetics as ""bourgeois science"".

[That's pretty funny, because Objectivists don't believe in science.](http://aynrandcontrahumannature.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/objectivism-and-descent-into.html?m=1)

&gt;The same way that followers of Marx continue to deny the reality of sexual dimorphism and race.

And yet they haven't had the slightest effect on the material reality of either of those things - their existence or non-existence being irrelevant. 

&gt;I guess I must be some sort of X-Man with the ability to alter my biology on the fly.

There's something called envionmental factors. I guess you're too dense to have heard of it.

&gt;Thankfully biology predisposes people not to hate people who abuse them?

It predisposes against the abuse in the first place. 

&gt;Your emotions don't predispose you to anything, as they're a product of your value system.

I sent you an article refuting this. You didn't read it and are repeating the same asinine nonsense again and again. When i make a point, have the intellectual honesty not to ignore it.

&gt;Just because you behave mindlessly doesn't mean everyone else does. 

The science is on my side. I win. Too bad Objectivists don't believe in science.

&gt;It's embarrassing that you didn't read what I wrote. A chemical does not have a sexual preference; it's not in a class of things that even possess sex, much less sexuality.

You know very much what I meant, but being an obtuse moron have deliberately decided to obfuscate the matter. 

&gt;By the way, why do you keep posting links to pop science journals and blogs? Too scared to go for the hard stuff?

[Not an argument.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy) I thought Objectivists knew how to argue with reason and logic.

&gt;No one said it did. It was part of a causal link.

Again, Das Kapital didn't cause the kulaks to be massacred. You are clearly implying it did whilst at the same time denying that that is what you are saying. Have some intellectual honesty.

&gt;No one said he did. Really, this evasiveness to the obvious causal effects of ideology is just making you look dumb.

You are a moron. Ideology is derived from material reality. Material reality is not caused by ideology.

&gt;Stalin didn't just fall out of the sky. 

Neither Marx nor his writings are responsible for producing Joseph Stalin. Stalin was forged in a country that was undergoing horrific turmoil and it left its mark on him, more than anything Marx could have said or done. Power-hungry individuals rising to power and using their power to cause suffering for millions is nothing inherent to Marxism. 

&gt;You've finally learned that ideas are the driving force behind history, not some random ""material forces"". 

That's not what I said you illiterate ignoramus.

&gt;Make your mind up. Capitalism is an idea. 

It is also a material reality in which we are living right at this very minute. Only an idiot would deny it.

&gt;Do ideas cause history or do material conditions cause history?

The latter. 

&gt;Capitalism caused Marxism to ""happen"", 

Yes, it did. Marx based his ideas on an observation of the material reality of capitalism. If there hadn't been a system called capitalism, there would have been no such thing as Marxism. 

&gt;Sort of like Africa. 

Russia is not Africa. It's a lot closer to the West. It has benefited historically from Western expertise in the form of military equipment, technology and immigrants. Peter the Great didn't build his army out of nothing.

&gt;Not quite, but he was responsible for communism and inspired the system that ruled it for seventy years.

He was responsible for describing what the material reality of communism would be like, but as it does not yet exist in material reality, he is not responsible for communism itself. And even if it did exist in material reality he still wouldn't because he was simply observing a historical process and not seeking to implement a pre-packaged ideal by forcing material reality to change in accordance with it. Russia was not communist for 70 years, it was state capitalist. 

&gt;You're being deliberately obtuse. I never said it did.

In linguistics and rhetoric, the historical present or historic present (also called dramatic present or narrative present) is the employment of the present tense when narrating past events. It is widely used in writing about history in Latin (where it is sometimes referred to by its Latin name, praesens historicum) and some modern European languages; in English it is used above all in historical chronicles (listing a series of events); it is also used in fiction, for ""hot news"" (as in headlines), and in everyday conversation (Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002: 129–131). In conversation, it is particularly common with ""verbs of communication"" such as tell, write, and say (and in colloquial uses, go) (Leech 2002: 7). ""Historic present"" is the form recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary, whereas ""historical present"" is the form in Merriam Webster.

DasSnaus,player twentyfour,Cahill,"&gt; There's no reason why we can't assemble a squad that can compete with the likes of Madrid. Their team is getting on and it will open up an opportunity for new teams to dominate in Europe and simply replacing outgoing players rather than strengthening a domestic title winning squad won't win you the champions league, as much as I loved our first 13 players last season. 

Hilarious for two reasons: The first, thinking there is a blueprint to winning the UCL that can be achieved by all. Madrid just repeated as winners for the first time in modern competition history. The second, that it's SOOO important we win in Europe...the Premier league is the most important competition we have, end of. If you build a good enough team there, you can take Europe as it comes. If you flip flop the priorities, you will fail on both accounts.

&gt; Conte banged on all summer about how he needs some marquee players for the CL as well as squad depth and we've barely done either.

asheraton,,,"Vaccines are most certainly one of the causes of autism, unless you wish to deny the following:

1. There are 114 independent studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals that link vaccines and autism.

2. Autism used to be listed as a side effect in the product leaflets issued by the manufacturers (until they faced class-action lawsuits and then they removed it). In order for a side-effect to be listed, it must have been found in pre-release safety testing.

3. Numerous European courts have ruled that a number of individuals with autism could be awarded damages after it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that their autism was caused by vaccines.

4. There are literally thousands of parents who report that their child became autistic within a week of a vaccine. I personally know three such families as I spent 8 years working with children with autism. 3 out of 9 of them had suffered convulsions, brain swelling and hospitalization within hours of the MMR. They subsequently lost language and cognitive abilities over the days that followed. Anyone who disregards this as mere coincidence needs to study statistical probabilities.

5. In 2014, a CDC scientist granted whistleblower status revealed that a CDC study found that those who received the MMR before age 3 were statistically more likely to get autism than those who didn't

6. The only studies that have found that vaccines don't cause autism have been funded by the manufacturers and are based on population probabilities. They have not conducted any proper rigorous scientific testing.

7. Numerous pediatricians have been brave enough to speak openly about their own observations of children becoming autistic after a vaccine.

8. There are thousands of cases of autism listed as a side effect from a vaccine in the VAERS database.
 
Vaccines are absolutely essential, BUT there is no doubt that the standards for safety testing are abysmal and many children are harmed by them. To blantantly disregard any parent or doctor who dares question their safety or who simply call for improvements in safety testing shows a complete lack of care for child welfare.

Whisper,none,Shoto-kan,"Now the conversation takes on the risk of becoming political. You European types do seem to be kind of weird about guns. 

So let's establish two things. 

1. Nothing I say to you, even if I completely convince you, is going to change what your rulers will and will not allow you to do. Thus political debate has limited impact on law. 

2. Nothing your rulers do, even if everyone in your country agrees, can change the laws of physics, or the facts of psychology or physiology. Thus law has limited impact on tactical realities. 

So I will continue to address this question from a purely tactical standpoint. 

So, first of all, as I said, there is nothing inherently wrong with deciding NOT to address a risk. Just be aware that is what you are doing. If you decide the risk of being attacked with a gun is small enough that you can ignore it, okay. 

&gt; That is also a reason why most criminals come up with a knife at max and even a lot of knives aren't allowed here. 

Okay, here we have what I consider a bit of a tactical misconception. Criminals, by definition, are those who that which is not ""allowed"". Allowing or disallowing a thing does not provide any physical force which actually stops that thing from happening. It only means that you punish someone when they do it, which is tactically irrelevant, because it happens much later than the immediate threat. 

Thus, one cannot rely on the *legal* environment to constrain *tactical* threats. 

&gt; While a knife is a mean weapon on its own and also a use of deadly force it is at least less serious than a firearm. 

No, not really. Not at all. 

There is a common perception that a knife is somehow ""less deadly"" than a gun. This makes no sense if you think about it. Either a weapon kills, or it does not. A weapon cannot be *less deadly*, because a person cannot be *only slightly dead*. Miracle Max is not on call, here. 

The main reason people think this is because the knife is a familiar household object, while many people, especially in non-free countries, have only seen guns in violent fictional television, and therefore have a Pavlovian association between guns and mayhem. 

Tactically, both the handgun and the knife are equally useful as an *assailant's* weapons, but the handgun is more useful as a *defender's* weapon. 

What does that mean? Well, remember that the assailant is the one who *initiates the conflict*. His goal is to cause harm. This means that he can choose the range at which the conflict occurs. If a knife lacks the range of a gun, then he can simply get closer before initiating his attack. The defender's goal isn't to cause harm, it's to avoid harm. Therefore, while the attacker wants to get close, the defender wishes to create distance. The handgun allows him to *project disabling power while retreating*. 

What's the point of all this hair-splitting? Well, what's important about all this is that weapon choice is predicated on what you will need to do. The necessary features for a defensive weapon are far greater than those for an offensive weapon. I cannot, for example, defend myself with a grenade, but I can sure as hell murder people with one. 

The weapon I carry is a semiautomatic pistol, chambered in 9mm Parabellum. This choice is not because it is ""the deadliest"" weapon. Hell, a truckload of fertilizer is far deadlier, and, as Europe has recently seen, so is the truck without the fertilizer. No, this choice is because it is the weapon most appropriate to a broad range of defensive situations... most especially including attack with another firearm. 

Now, tactically, if the choice of whether or not to carry a gun has been made for you by those who rule over you, and you choose to abide that, then the same redirect-draw-disable sequence would be doable with a knife... but not just any knife. It must be readily accessible to you, and openable in a fraction of second with just one hand via spring-assist. 

This will *never* be as fast as drawing a firearm, but it may be enough to save your life, *if* your assailant is close. If not, well... run, and hope you're not his first target.

&gt;Yes we are both Hominids, but we are clearly different sub-species



How so? Sub species by and large dont intebreed with each other. We've been doing that for thousand of years. Also, subspecies need to have features distinctive to them. Aside from a group of shades of skin colour, races have *extreme* variation.  Italians dont look like Swedes. Kenyans dont look like Mande. Filipinos dont look like Chinese. 




&gt; If we live together, we will always stratify above them in society,

Given that a black (mixed race) person was the president and one of the top 2 most powerful people on the planet for the last 8 years that seems to be up to scrutiny.

&gt; and they will always resent us for it, and believe that we stole it from them, not understand that an inequality of ability, mixed with an equality of opportunity, will inevitably lead to an inequality of outcome.



Except the question must be asked first, is there really equality of oppertunity?



&gt; Homogeneous societies who did beautiful and amazing things, 



The Maya are divided into ethnic groups, Akatek for example.


The Romans at their height extended down to North Africa and up to Britain, and into the Middle East. Even assuming mass integration wasnt happening a degree of admixture likely did happen. There were even 2 Roman Emperors of North African descent.




Prussia was homogenous on racial lines not ethnic ones.



&gt;then why are Blacks so anti-White? 


The growing amount of multiracial people in the U.S. seems to conflict with that. Furthermore, outside the U.S./Canada in the West, virtually *everybody* has some sort of multiracial descent. Also, how are all blacks anti white?  Do you have evidence for this? Do you have evidence for this outside of the U.S.?

Full_contact_chess,,,"Considering the slow economic spiral the Soviet Union had effectively been in since the mid 1960s unless they moved away from imposing state controls on their economy and moved toward a more capitalistic one like China has attempted they're likely to not be in the greatest of shape.  The hollowing out of their military that started back in the early 1980s continues with many units only operational on paper as parts shortages make much of the army ineffective.  As the Eastern Bloc members began to grow more and more restless due the continual shortages of basic necessities and the widening gap in the quality of life to western Europe there are more frequent outbreaks of protesting and rebelliousness among the citizens. By 2010, the Soviets will have a hard time suppressing them with their poorly trained, equipped, and low morale army units.  Since the Warsaw Pact countries were never quite as well provisioned as the Russian ones, the local units will not be dependable for suppressing uprisings and so Russia will find it necessary to involve themselves more directly in putting those outbreaks down with their own better equipped (but still poorly maintained) units. 
While the Soviet Union will still be called a ""Super Power"", it'll become increasingly apparent to the rest of the world that its a hollow title. Countries like Cuba will find that their ""aid packages"" will be less frequent and those that do still get handed out shrink as the USSR is forced to address its own economic needs. So those counties will still feel an economic impact just as they did in OTL after the Soviet Union collapsed and the handouts stopped coming.  
With an aging military the Soviets will become less of a world power and remain more regional in their operations. In OTL the Russians only have one aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov. This is in stark contrast to the 1980s when the Soviets operated as many as five fleet carriers at one point. Its possible that if the Soviet Union had continued to exist that they would still be operating some of those carriers that were sold off or scrapped in the 1990s simply due to the national prestige element surrounding fleet carriers. However, they likely be rarely deployed due to issues with their upkeep. Even the Kuznetsov is so prone to operational issues that it never goes anywhere without a ocean tug accompanying it in case its engines breakdown (again).

I found [this popsci article](http://www.medicaldaily.com/interracial-couples-may-make-taller-smarter-children-due-greater-genetic-diversity-341348) citing two studies that make several claims in favor of interracial mating.

&gt;The findings revealed four traits — height, lung capacity, general cognitive ability, and educational attainment — have increased significantly in correlation with genomes that possessed more genetic diversity.

The second study states:

&gt;when it comes to which groups are genetically diverse, European-American populations are found to be less so and have more potentially harmful genetic variations than African-American populations, according to a 2008 study published in the journal Nature.

Both of these claims seem to contradict much of what has been said in this thread, and basically conform to what is my layman's understanding of the benefits of diversity and exogamy, so naturally I'm suspicious. I'd like to make sure I'm not just seeking out sources that support my biases.

Dr_Richard_Kimble1,,,"&gt; I did read my own link. That's why I know the number of Syrians does not represent the majority of those seeking asylum.

It is the largest group amongst migrants. Do you dispute this?

&gt; Ohhhh so you're just very anti Assad and advocating for intervention for the fun of it.

I am against Assad because he is anti-Western, but I am not advocating removing him at this moment. I am advocating intervention to create a buffer for Europe. I care about the West primarily. Same reason why I think intervening in Yugoslavia was correct. It was not because of some personal vendetta against Milosevic but because it was in the West's interests. It is in the West's interest to intervene and facilitate and create conditions that will benefit the West.

&gt; Nationalism is cancer in Europe

Because it has nearly destroyed Europe twice in the last century. That bothers me. Also the current wave of nationalists in Europe are absolutely pathetic. People like Le Pen, Farage, etc. are clowns and have no vision for the future only nostalgia for the past. I am all about the future, not the past. Past is dead, it will never return, ever, so we should stop dreaming. 

&gt; Backwards thinking? I'm pretty sure Europeans have been intervening everywhere for the last few centuries. Interventionism is the norm and everyone seems to think it fucks everything up.

You are talking about colonialism and I am talking about interventionism, there is a difference. I will give you a few examples of successful interventions in the last 20-30 years. 1991 Gulf War intervention, Yugoslavia interventions. These were achieved with minimal death on the Allied side, and also far less death on the opposing side then would have otherwise been the case. 

&gt; But hey man, if we're going to intervene lets do it right. Complete colonial administration. These places will be provinces in our European empire. States set up as buffer zones to for the sole purpose of mother Europe from the hordes trying to leach off European welfare. These people have proven themselves incapable of governing their own nations, so colonial administration would be best.

No, I do not agree with colonialism, that would mean taking ownership of a place like Syria. I only wish to create and facilitate the conditions so that the local population can take ownership themselves, except free from the threat of potential mass slaughter.

Also your reference to ""these people"" is amusing. The Middle East is one of the cradles of civilization, and has been stable for a longer period of time then Europe has with its endless wars. Europe has only been peaceful for 60 years currently, and that is ONLY because of AMERICAN INTERVENTION. 

&gt; I honestly think all of Africa would be better off under colonial rule. So long as we are not letting them come here, and there is a net financial positive to us, I am on board with interventionism to a degree which would make you look like an isolationist. However, absent of the type of intervention these shitholes actually need to sort them out, we are just setting fire to money, and migrants being our chief concern, the most cost effective solution is bullets.

The issue is that the foreign administering is viewed as an irritant by the local population. Colonialism may have been somewhat better 200 years ago, but today it would not work. The best solution is to have just enough influence/presence to have a noticeable effect on the situation, while at the same time not directly administering the nation.

&gt; However, absent of the type of intervention these shitholes actually need to sort them out, we are just setting fire to money, and migrants being our chief concern, the most cost effective solution is bullets.

You know it is amazing that someone from Europe, which was NOT able to sort out its own problems (non-Europeans had to do it for you), who killed 50 million of their own within 5 years, can lecture Middle Easterners who have killed a fraction of that in the last century. Seems the caveman Hitler mentality has not been rooted out of Europeans yet, means we have work to do.

&gt; You keep saying this despite my only defense of him being that he's preferable to Islamic theocracy. Honestly, you've said it more than once as if gone on about how fabulous life was under Assad. Is it hard for you to believe I just don't care if middle eastern dictators are gassing people or killing rebels? To throw it back at you, you seem very, very anti Assad. 

No, it is not hard for me to believe you don't care, because I am aware of the reality that there are naive short-sighted people out there. A lot of Americans were also opposed to intervening in Europe in both World Wars. These type of people always exist, they are not able to view anything past their own house or bank account, so of course we would not expect them to care about things like that. That's why people like you should just focus on what you do care about, and leave the geo-politics to the people who know what they are doing and actually do care. 

&gt; Enough to make me think you have an ideological dog in this fight. Are you a Muslim from some rival sect. Are you Jewish? Both of those would explain your hard on for intervention.

I do have an ideological dog in this fight, it's called being a moral human being, and an advocate of the responsibility to protect. I see myself as a human first, citizen of my nation second. As to the second pathetic part of your statement, I am an atheist. Interesting your focus on me potentially being jewish though. 

&gt; European Empire, lets go. If you want intervention let's not fuck about. You want to solve the problem once and for all? Total mobilization. Steamroll these nations, massacre all who stand against us, subjugate the survivors, set up systems that bring civilisation to the savages. Like Caesar in Gaul. History will thank us for it.

I am not for steamrolling the nations because I do not think we should administer them, and also I believe there are more effective methods then ""steamrolling"" but it would first require political will to use force in certain areas. Europeans have tried the steamroll tactic before and been crushed by non Europeans. Same thing will happen again if Europe tries. The best is a combination of military force in certain areas, political maneuvering, conditioning foreign aid, etc. In an outright military struggle Europe would get crushed if it enters these areas in search of conquest. Conquest is an outdated tactic for outdated minds, which doesn't surprise me that you would be an advocate for it. 

Also I mentioned before these savages were civilized way before Europeans were and in the last century the Europeans have a much higher killcount against their own then people in the Middle East. 

In the last century approximately 100 million Europeans have been killed by other Europeans. Meanwhile in the last century not even half of that have been killed in Middle Eastern wars. Who is the savage?

Do you think that the emotional and mental state would be better served by a more open and adaptive culture around LGB elements? Or is it just simply more about accepting a more broad scope of gender as a whole, and dissociating gender from sexuality?

Phaethonas,,,"&gt; You talked about a shortage of scientists

The video mentioned that 50% of PhD candidates at the US are foreigners. There was no distinction made between scientists and engineers. 

Granted, engineers (more or less) were mentioned as an example, but that does not mean that the talk was focused just on them.

As a matter of fact, in the video there is an argument made, that the US education system can't produce scientists and engineers cause it produces idiots! 

So, you do the rest of the math.

&gt; Those jobs are getting filled by Asia and India. Not by Europe as you mentioned.

Not entirely. The fact that India and China were mentioned as examples does not mean that only those two are having their citizens doing their PhDs in the US.

After all at one point it is mentioned that the US attract scientists from all around the world.

&gt; Yet you are the one endorsing the idea of a Professor lecturing about laws and fake ids? Now I'm confused.

The professor has the right to lecture about laws and fake IDs, even if those laws are not present in the current Greek legal system, and regardless of my opinion whether such a law should exist or not.

I agree with how we handle things by the way.

Or in other words, I may disagree with the law you have, but the law should be upheld. And the professor has the right to lecture you for it.

Nowadays? Perhaps. But I was talking about mostly fantasy settings, where this sort of communication doesn't exist, or only available to a handful of population. Or about space operas, where they hop from planet to planet, which are usually pretty isolated. Universal translators kind of allow to handwave it, but actually I realized, I hate those too. They make no sense. For example, what do they do with thing as simple, as order of word in the sentence? It's all over the place on Earth itself, and I can't imagine what aliens might invent in that regard. And what about subtle, unspoken things, like context-dependent semantics? Achieving FTL would be easier, that creating a thing, that would provide instant translation. I only have two ideas how they might work - warping time to read sentence when it's finished or reading mind of the speaker. Both are too advanced for most of sci-fi settings anyway.

But returning to the point on hand, even China didn't provide truly unified language for its Empire. Chinese has tons of dialects, and it always had them. And some of them drifted so far away, some linguists talk about not one Chinese language, but a group of languages. Same with Latin language, which was divided into several dialects of vulgar Latin, even before the fall of Roman Empire.

If there is any form of isolation, limiting the population migration, languages will start to drift away from each other. Medieval people didn't travel this much, so in medieval period, many languages had tons of dialects. If you look at history of any literary language, in many cases, they just picked up current capital's dialect or even some popular writer's dialect as main form of language, when their tech level allowed them to spread this form of language fast enough (usually with a rise of printed media, such as books). Russian literary language is based on Karamzin and Pushkin's personal dialects. English owes a lot to Shakespeare in that regard. But that all happened at some advanced point of history. It shouldn't be the case in most fantasy settings, where languages must drift from each other. 

So languages should always drift from each other, and have tons of dialects. One unified language must be only possible as a limited language of educated population - like Latin was in Medieval Europe.

Yeah it is random. I didn't start the 150 years thing, but they did and I just went along with it.

&gt;Out of curiosity, though: Was the genocide of the Native American considered terrorism 

Yeah, it was terrorism.  In fact, most of human history is filled with that sort of barbarism and hardly anyone is innocent.  However, this isn't 1885 anymore and certain rules, laws, and organizations have been put into place to prevent this.  

&gt;If your definition of ""terrorism"" is about killing ""indiscriminately,"" then shouldn't that dude who ran into and killed that woman in Charlottesville be labeled a terrorist? How about Dylan Roof? He shot a whole bunch of people ""indiscriminately."" He didn't know them; he just thought they should be dead. What were his goals? A dude walks into a movie theatre and empties his gun into the audience. Is he, too, a terrorist? If so, what do we do about ""them""?

They are terrorists (and many such people have mental disorders, which says more about psychological treatment and the 2nd amendment than anything else) and there's not much we can really do about them since they're either dead, imprisoned, or on trial. 

Ok look pal, I never talked about banning immigrants, or expelling people.  I was only pointing out the fact that the immigrants to America in the 1860's (~150 years ago) did not commit acts of terror, however Europe is having that problem right now.  It's not even because of the immigrants, it's because of the sheer number of people who are going to Europe in such little time is bound to cause issues.  Banning them doesn't help because they'll leave feeling disgruntled and betrayed.

Wandrille,,,"Hi,

I think there is something that you point in you post that deserve to be clarified.
You write:

&gt; Other than the Ottomans conquering a part of the Silk Road

However, the Ottomans only really become a thing in XVth century, that is, at the very end of the medieval period.

This points to an important point: the medieval period spans many centuries, during which the situation changed.

If we look at sub-saharan Africa, we know that contacts were mostly indirect through most of the period. However Europeans knew about some sub-saharan kingdoms because of the trade they did with Northern African countries.

Indeed, their knowledge that the Mali kingdom was ripe with gold was one of the motivation behind the exploration of the western coast of Africa by the Portuguese in the XVth century (there was a precious metal crisis at the time in Europe, and finding new source of the stuff was vital for their economy). By the end of the XVth century, the Portuguese had established contact with several sub-saharan polities and actually when on to discover the southern maritime road toward India.

Europeans were also aware of the African christian kingdom of Ethiopia, although direct contact only seems to happen at the end of the medieval period.

You've surely heard about Marco Polo, a venetian merchant who went on live live in Kubilai Khan court. It is worth noting that while his particular destiny seems unique, he was not the only European to travel to the Far East thank to the ""pax Mongolica"" brought about by the Mongol conquest of the XIIIth century (Indeed, Marco Polo actually accompany his uncle who had already been there before) (If you look it up a little, you'll see there are plenty of account of long distance travelers, mainly merchants, for instance you can look-up Afanasij Nikitine, who originates from modern day Russia).

While on the subject of the mongol conquest, it is worth noting that there actually was, at some point, a diplomatic relationship between European rulers (the pope, various kings) and various mongol khans. 

You also mentioned trade being stopped because of Ottoman conquest, and I'm curious to know what you're referring to.
Trade between Europeans (northern Italians mainly) and the near East (this trade is mainly about spices) is very much alive during the medieval period, and that is also true in the XVth century (the ottoman conquest period).
Indeed in some places (like Alexandria) Italian currencies went on to be more represented than local coins.
At worst, the trade would have been slowed down a little because of Ottoman patronage of pirates in the Mediterranean, but not stopped.

Now, this does not really answer your question but gives you a few pointers on the ties between Europe and the rest of the world back then. This is not exhaustive and would benefit from more formal definitions (for instance, would one include Russia in medieval Europe?).

Knowing about these links, and the reasons behind these links gives us, in turn, ideas about how to further isolate your fictional equivalent of Europe, and it has to do with 2 main things : trade, politics.

For trade, if there is no major commodity that the ""European"" needs from the outside world (IRL this was silk, spices, precious metal) AND they have no commodity that the outside world really wants (IRL, tin and amber for instance), then trade with ""the outside"" should not be that profitable and thus not that important, especially if there are obstacles along the roads (mountains, deserts, bad sea, hostile and bandit-like polities).

About politics, the local rulers should not be tempted to seek alliance with anyone from the outside to gain advantage from their local adversaries. This one is harder to work out, and cultural differences and xenophobia won't prevent a temporary alliance against a common ennemy (indeed, if you look up the various and fluid alliances/wars between Europeans and ""tatars"" in eastern Europe and central Asia you'll see what I mean; XVth century Muscovy and Crimean Khanate could be a neat place to start).

[deleted],,,"&gt; I was born in this country. I have just as much right to live here and call it my mine as you do. If you try to remove me from my country solely for being Jewish I will resist. 

Look, I'm not even gonna get into the debate on who America belongs to (even though the founding fathers made it crystal clear who this country was intended for). But I think we can agree that Europeans should be the majority in Europe, yes? 

&gt; you will reach an impasse where you will have no choice but to resort to violence.

False. There are literally hundreds of methods of removing someone peacefully from a country. But I'm not that concerned about who stays in America as I am about who stays in Europe. And don't claim to be against violence when you support it. 

&gt; Huh, yet here you are spouting the same eugenics tropes that propelled the original National Socialists to power. 

Do you think that's how ideologies come to power? By ""spouting eugenics tropes""? Do you also realize eugenics are a good thing? How exactly is encouraging healthy individuals to procreate to better society a bad thing?

&gt; You're right that the fascism of today 

There is no fascist country that exists today and there will never be a fascist country that will exist in the future. Also fascism's core tenets never change, so I don't know where you get the idea that fascism can be ""different"". We are headed towards a globalist transhumanist society. Science and technology is reaching its peak. We have the technology to create babies with superior genes thanks to technology like CRISPR. Only a matter of time before biotech becomes mainstream. Besides, a white ethnostate conflicts with the interests of the powers that be. As much as I'd like to see a white-only Europe, it seems like a dream as of now. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. I'm not holding my breath though. 

&gt; To quote a white nationalist

Huh? I thought we were talking about national socialism and not white nationalism? I asked for national socialist policies that call for genocide or violence against others which you have yet to show me. 

&gt; Yes! Both of those are wrong. One's national identity is not determined by race.

So you're fine with destroying a group's culture and identity? Would you mind if we destroyed Japan by making native Japanese people a minority, race mixing with every Japanese person, and putting another race's culture there instead? How fucked up are you to believe this? Many people do not agree with you. Lots of people believe it is the people who make up the nation. Would Japan still be Japan without Japanese people? Would Israel still be Israel without Jews? Would Nigeria still be Nigeria without Nigerians?

&gt; What makes you think you're somehow more entitled to live here than I am, simply because I practice a different religion from you? What gives you more right to call this ""my country"" than I do?

Again I will not use America as the example. I will use Europe. Which I strongly believe belongs to the Europeans. 

&gt; No they don't. Gentiles live in Israel. White people live in Kenya. People of Asian descent live in South America.

Strawman. That's not what I meant. At all. Asians have Asia. Africans have Africa. Europeans have Europe. Jews have Israel. Etc.

loraxopolous,,,"**The Neuhammer Stuka disaster of 1939**

No Luftwaffe units were worked harder during Europe's final weeks of peace
than were the cherished groups of Ju.87 Stukas, which were being
remorselessly groomed for the leading role in the war Hitler was
determined to launch against Poland. One of the more experienced Stuka
outfits, Group I of the 76th Sturzkampfgeschwader, commanded by Captain
Walter Sigel, was sent up from its usual base in Austria to Cottbus, sixty
miles southeast of Berlin, as part of the Luftwaffe's general deployment
of its strike forces toward the east. It was Sigel's pride that his was
one of the early units to be so deployed, especially since I/St.G.76 had
been handpicked for a showpiece demonstration to be held for the benefit
of the senior Luftwaffe commanders, including Generals Hugo Sperrle, Bruno
Loerzer, and Wolfram von Richthofen. Sigel's outfit was equipped with the
lastest Ju.87B's, mounting new Jumo 211D engines rated at 1,200
horsepower, nearly twice as powerful as those used in Spain. Sigel hoped
to stun the onlooking air commodores with a mass formation diving attack
of the entire group, twenty-seven aircraft in all. He succeeded, but in a
way nobody could have dreamed of.

The demonstration was scheduled for the morning of August 15 [1939].
The hour chosen, six [a.m.], was undoubtedly selected for the dramatic
postsunrise effect it would offer. Just prior to the scheduled takeoff
time, a weather reconnaissance plane landed at Cottbus with a report on
conditions over the strike area, a wooded section of Silesia near
Neuhammer-am-Queis, thirty minutes' flight time away. Conditions were far
from ideal. The weather pilot told Captain Sigel that it was clear above
6000 feet, but below he would find seven-tenths cloud cover all the way
down to 2500 feet. Below that, however, visibility was good. This meant
that Sigel would have to trust finding a hole in the clouds over the
strike area, lead his group down through the murk, and and break into the
clear with about five seconds left to line up on the target, release
bombs, and pull out. As group commander, Sigel had three choices: to
request postponement of the strike until the weather was clear all the way
down, to ask that the exercise be scrubbed, or to carry on as planned.
Since Sigel was a German officer, and since a galaxy of fearsome Luftwaffe
generals were gathering to personally witness I/St.G.76's star turn, only
the last option was thinkable. Shortly after 5:30am, Sigel led his group
off the field at Cottbus.

Once Sigel left the ground, he was in constant radio communication with
the twenty-six other Stukas forming up in squadron strength behind him,
but there was no radio link between his airborne group and the strike area
at Neuhammer. Thus he could not know of the disaster in the making.
Between the time the weather plane had surveyed the area and returned to
Cottbus and the time Sigel's group neared the strike zone, early morning
ground fog formed into an opaque white blanket covering almost the entire
area, rising in places to merge with the fringes of cloud. No more
dangerous weather conditions for a dive-bombing attack could have been
created.

Sigel, with his Stukas arrayed behind him, approached Neuhammer at an
altitude of 12,000 feet, estimating his position by dead reckoning and
upon checkpoints which were in the clear on the flight out from Cottbus.
Above, a pale blue windowpane sky; below, a sea of rolling clouds tinged
with red. The generals were waiting. Sigel rolled the Stuka on its back
and shoved the stick forward. The altimeter needle began unwinding in a
futile race to keep up with the altitude that was being eaten away at the
rate of 375 feet per second. Sigel's bomber plunged into the dirty gray
wet muck at a dive angle of seventy degrees doing nearly 300 miles per
hour. Closed in by the white world about him, his eyes straining to see
past the mist being churned by the prop, Sigel felt time drag. By now,
the entire group, echeloned out on his wings, were hurtling through the
clouds with him. Where was the clear air promised by the weather pilot?
Any instant now...

Then the horrified Sigel saw not two thousand feet of clear space, but a
limitless canopy of trees rushing toward him. Already tensed to the
breaking point, his reactions were instantaneous. He screamed a warning
to the others and slammed the stick back. Through the blur of a grayout,
Sigel saw that he missed death by a matter of feet; the Stuka was zipping
through a firebreak below the treetops. His warning came too late for
the two dive-bombers riding his tail. They plunged into the earth, sirens
wailing, and exploded -- as did all nine Stukas of the second wave. The
high squadron's Ju.87's convulsively came out of their dives, but two of
them stalled out and smashed into the trees to join the eleven others.
Fragments of metal and flesh were scattered across a wide area, and fires
started in the summer-dry secondary undergrowth. Plumes of smoke, pyres
for the twenty-six airmen who had died before breakfast, rose lazily into
the air, blending with the fog that began to dissipate not long
afterwards.

The tragedy at Neuhammer, worst of its kind in the recorded history of
aviation, was kept secret for a long time afterward. OKL was notified
immediately, of course, as was the Fuhrer. One account has it that when
Hitler was given the news, he ""stared speechlessly out of the window for
ten minutes."" The reaction is believable; Hitler was a mystic, a believer
in astrology, and the wiping out of thirteen of his vaunted Stukas at one
stroke was surely an omen. His war against Poland, in which the Luftwaffe
was counted on to play a decisive role, was scheduled to begin sixteen
days later.",True,False,,0,1504248709,,False,0,dmey3ej,False,t3_6x9ivq,t1_dmevhid,1506394476,29,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,

I think another thing is that culturally, all of our countries are really different from each other, and Europe is also quite different to the US. They all have their little nuances you could only understand if you were a native of those countries. I don't think an American whose Scottish ancestry is further in the past than their grandparents could claim to be Scottish culturally because they probably wouldn't understand the way we think etc. I could go one step further and point out that there is one American who had a Scottish mother, and even their way of thinking and doing things are totally alien to native Scots.

I'm French, let's say I'm in a country that is neither US nor France, and someone tells me ""I am French!"" my immediate reaction is to start speaking French with this person, because in my mind, when someone says ""I am French"" she is saying ""I was born in France and/or I was raised in France"" so I imagine that I am talking to a compatriot who shares a national identity with me.

Many Americans, however, when saying ""I am Irish"" in a conversation between them, are actually saying ""I have Irish ancestors"" and that meaning is clear between Americans in a conversation between them, as it is something they usually do and most of times, at least that's what I think, they're not saying they're like the people born and /or raised in Ireland, but rather that they have some ancestors there, Americans, with the exception of natives, are all of relatively recent immigrant origins, so they wonder where their first ancestors who have set foot in the new world came from, and share those stories, I think, that most of the time it is just a conversation, just a topic of conversation, and that most people are aware that if they go to Ireland they will be seen as foreigners, and also in Germany, Italy, Sweden and so on.

Some particular cases however may cause irritation in some Europeans, for example people who actually believe that they share some kind of brotherhood with Europeans living on the continent today, people going to Ireland and speaking as if they were Irish, not Irish-American, but IRISH, this can cause conflict.

Another thing that happens to me and I think other Europeans also feel the same, I feel a little disturbed with Americans speaking in terms like ""full blooded"" or ""I'm proud of my x-blood"", the reason is that generally who employs these terms here, are racists, and in the case of France, it is a bit uncomfortable because this idea of ​​genetics as determinant in these aspects carries the connotation that some of our citizens are not French because their relatives come from Africa or the Middle East.

Other complicated cases include Americans of Irish ancestry expressing opinions on issues such as the period of troubles that may sound improper for the Irish and the English.

&gt;But this week the UK explained that these obligations will be limited to their last payment to the EU budget before departure.

&gt;Yet we have joint obligations towards third countries. For example:

&gt;We have guaranteed long-term loans to Ukraine, together.
    

&gt;We jointly support development in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries through the European Development Fund.

&gt; * TOKYO (Reuters) - British trade minister Liam Fox said on Friday Britain would not be blackmailed into agreeing on the cost of leaving the European Union and urged Brussels to move negotiations on to discuss Britains future relationship with the bloc.

&gt; * The third round of Brexit negotiations, focused on settling the terms of Britains exit from the EU, ended on Thursday with a warning from Brussels that more work needed to be done before they moved on to discuss future ties.

&gt; * The British government has been keen to shift talks to a new relationship, seeking to allay business concerns on trade and regulation, but Brussels has demanded progress first on central issues, including how much Britain should pay when it leaves.

&gt; * The Brexit bill is a contentious issue both domestically, where eurosceptics are keen to see as little money paid as possible, and with the EU, which is demanding Britain meets its existing commitments to the bloc.

Now sure, the UK and the EU can argue all sorts of positions based on all sorts of other things in the treaty or even things outside the treaty (money is owed, money isn't owed, whatever they want to argue) and some or all of those argued positions might or might not be valid and might or might not be accepted by the other side.

&amp;nbsp;   

In the past 20 years, the pharmaceutical clinical trials industry has shifted dramatically in terms of geography. Experiments that were once conducted ethically, in Western countries, have now been shipped overseas where pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations often operate lawlessly. During this time, the Clintons received millions of dollars from these corporations, and billions of tax dollars were siphoned off in the name of helping the countries build health care infrastructure. It’s all for exploitation.

### **AUG 19, 2007 | [Hillary on Health Care](http://archive.is/8hIw4) | THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY PROJECT**

**Hillary introduced legislation -- now enacted into law -- which ensures prescription drugs are safe for children:** **As First Lady and Senator, Clinton successfully introduced and helped pass legislation protecting kids from drugs that have not first been tested on children. In 2003, Clinton introduced the Pediatric Research Equity Act which gave the FDA authority to secure pediatric studies and labeling of drugs that are widely used for children.** This legislation was signed into law in December 2003. In 2007, she introduced the Pediatric Research Improvement Act to make ""make permanent the Food and Drug Administration's authority to ensure that drugs marketed for pediatric use are safe and effective for children."" [S.650, introduced 3/18/03, passed Senate by unanimous consent on 7/23/03, became P.L. 108-155 on 12/3/03. AP 11/19/03; Clinton release 3/27/07]

&amp;nbsp;  

**Hillary fought to ensure all children receive critical immunizations:** Clinton spearheaded the Administration's 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative and childhood immunizations rates are now at an historic high. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 90 percent or more of America's toddlers received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines in 1996, 1997, and again in 1998 -surpassing the Administration's 1993 goal. Since becoming a Senator in 2001, Clinton has introduced or cosponsored over 10 pieces of legislation to promote immunization awareness and provide for emergency vaccine supplies.

Kitzinger1,,,"I get most of what you say but... and this is a big but..

You talk about violent fascism.

I never saw that.  We had nut jobs on both sides who have done killings but those are singular people.  I call them the outliers.

Growing up I never saw large groups of Fascist beating people in the street, breaking windows, burning buildings.  About the most violent thing I've seen was when Geraldo got his nose broken on TV.

So, if people are going to say that Antifa is a reactionary movement against violent fascists then I would like to see it.  I would like to see Conservatives running down people in the street and beating them bloody.

I don't believe Antifa is a reactionary movement to violent fascist.  These are the people who are causing violence and property destruction.  I don't even consider the group anti-fascist because the methods they use and the ideology they want to bring to replace the US is very much fascist.  It's not like they are trying to hide what their long term intentions are either.  They are open about it.

Here is a chant they say:

No Trump. No Wall. No USA at all.

You don't get any blunter than that.

Let's talk about a couple of the signs though:

My Heroes Kill Cops.

and

Liberals get a bullet too.

Most people don't have time for bullshit.  They go to work, feed the kids, and go to sleep.  Most of the people living in this world are really really boring.  They are not going to rise up and try to overthrow anything.  Hell, they don't even give a shit about a war we should have won in 2002 but still at it 17 years later.  Nobody gave a shit about Libya and most people didn't give a shit about Iraq.  In fact most of the people are quite happy in their boring little lives.  They have work, they have food, and they have a really nice house.  Compared to most of the world they are sitting pretty.

Who are the outragers?  Young, idealistic people who want to make a difference.  Maybe they took the wrong classes in college, maybe they found out that looks do matter and if you show up for an interview with rings and tattoos that the work that is available for you is very very restricted.

Some of those truths can be downright brutal when you are young and just getting smacked around by it.  God help those kids whose parents always told them they were special, that they could be anything they want, and that who you are inside is what matters.

Those fucking lies don't do any child growing up any good.  Tell your child that there is going to be people smarter and dumber than them.  There is people who are going to be richer and there is going to be people that are poorer. 
 Have compassion for both.  That failure is a learning experience not something to be ashamed of.  Tell your kids that some jobs are way better than others.  Tell them that the job doesn't define who they are but is a way for them to pay for the hobbies they love.  That being a famous movie star comes about by winning the genetic lottery system and for every movie star there is a thousand others whose dreams were crushed into the dirt.

I'm not outraged at the rich...  Why should I?  My friends have good jobs, I live in a nice house, and I have two cars and a dog.  I do not need everyone to be getting the same wage to be happy.  I don't need everything to be perfect and fair because I've seen what that kind of thinking brings about and it is a horror that is simply unimaginable.  Best thing that ever happened to me was spending those three years in Europe travelling into the Eastern Bloc countries from 1993 into 1995.  Taught me more than anything I could get from a text book.  It was a fundamentally trans-formative experience.

I don't think outrage can be turned around and be used for good.  Outrage means a loss of rational thought.  It's an emotion.  Thinking doesn't even enter the picture.  You are just lashing out.  That is what three year old children do when they don't get their way.  They throw fits.

We are supposed to be adults and we should act like it.  If you don't like a law then work to change it.  If you think we are headed to extinction then join a research group and work to get the problem sufficient attention.  If you think the rich are jetting off with the riches then work to put laws that will barricade their flight path.

ArrachtasOfEire,,,"I think cheering for WestJet is a bleed-over from the early days when they really were the better option; they provided comparable product to AC at a better price while also having better service. These days, they're basically just a clone of Air Canada; WestJet is no longer consistently cheaper (it's more of a coin toss who's less expensive for a given trip), and if you really want a truly 'budget' trip, Air Canada Rouge will 9/10 times get you to your destination for less than WestJet will. 

I agree with another commenter on here who described all domestic services as basically a race to the bottom (outside of respective business classes); Air Canada mainline is marginally better than WestJet mainline (AC has better/comfier/roomier seats, still has seat-back TVs, usually cheaper to pre-select seating, etc.) but really neither is anything to write home about. I prefer Air Canada just because they really do go more places, and if you take Rouge, usually for less money than WestJet.

The EU wants to engineer the UK into a sort of itemised exit bill, which makes sense for them because it maximises the amount they can claim we owe. I.e. Euratom, okay that'll be £11.6million, involvement in ECJ that'll be £22.7millon... right now multiply that by 10 years that'll be... a lot etc. That approach doesn't really work for the UK though as the total bill isn't necessarily that important to us, we can pay almost any number they come up with even if we achieve it by printing money... what matters is **what the bill buys**... for example £100bn spread over 10 years if it buys full single market access might be a fantastic deal, whereas £25bn over 1 year that buys us nothing and only settles some questionable historical debt is actually a terrible deal.

When Davis talks about the EU being *'imaginative or flexible'* what he is referring to is them making clear where they would be prepared to accept money **in return** for British negotiating objectives. If they want money, we have money (within reason). What we want is a trading relationship that approximates what we have now without the EU having the sort of lawmaking ability it has over us now, and without the limitations on sovereign issues like immigration.

internetmap,,,"&gt;As her subtitle suggests, Nagle’s book places the alt-right within a broader context of the “online culture wars” of the 2000s and 2010s, from which a number of contemporary political currents emerged. 

&gt;Although the alt-right draws somewhat eclectically on European reactionary philosophy and the work of older white nationalists like Jared Taylor, it is, Nagle argues, in many ways a thorough product of the 21st century. 

&gt;Much of the movement’s sensibility, characterized by a taste for anonymous and often abusive pranksterism wrapped in dense layers of self-protective irony, originated in 4chan’s anarchic /pol/ and /b/ forums, while many of its characteristic ideas about gender — intense anti-feminism; a disillusioned view of sex; and a preoccupation with male sexual hierarchies — were ported over from “Manosphere” hangouts such as r/TheRedPill and Return of Kings, themselves offshoots of mid-2000s pick-up-artist culture. Nagle also distinguishes between the alt-right proper — open white-nationalists like Richard Spencer as well as mostly anonymous 4chan and Twitter users — and the “alt-light,” a rogue’s gallery of trolls and media manipulators such as Mike Cernovich and Milo Yiannopoulos, who act as the movement’s bridge to the mainstream while attempting, usually unconvincingly, to play down its hard edges.

Have you really convinced yourself that old people who don't go online and instead get their news from the print press (yes they actually buy newspapers from newsagents, which means they're not even exposed to the click-bait stuff that passes for online journalism these days) were magically influenced by a twitter account they didn't know existed and didn't read?

I bet even hard core twitter users didn't know that account existed, let alone read the tweets. But Remainers are convinced that 65-year-olds who don't go on twitter and don't know anyone else who goes on twitter, were influenced by the Kremlin's super magical powers where tweets are transmitted by osmosis through the ether to people who arn't even online? Seriously?

Honestly the bullshit that Remainers make up to try to convince themselves that somehow the referendum was stolen, is unbelievable. 

Hint: the referendum was lost in 1992 when Britain crashed out of the ERM, and a cohort of people have been waiting patiently but determindly to vote to leave ever since, and when the ref came along they took their chance. 

If you want to blame someone, blame the Germans - on that fateful day in 1992 the Germans refused to take John Major's calls even though he was Prime Minister and we were in a pooled currency sovereignty arrangement. That was what convinced Brits that if we had trouble the Europeans would never reciprocate and help us, no matter how much money we gave them and no matter how many world wars we rescued them from.

* It's not great if you're a driver, either, or a cyclist. Narrow streets and never-ending roadworks.
* IT job market is rather small and there isn't much variety, but you have options of working for big finance/insurance companies, public sector or start-ups. However getting in without UK-based experience will be hard.
* Brexit. No one really knows what's going to happen.
* Prices of properties for both renting and buying. Plus, difficulties with finding flats that are dry, clean and warm. Relatively poor standards of build (especially if compared with continental Europe).

CavemanJamess,,,"Here's my 2p.

Try and get used to Windows 10. Here's a couple of reasons:

- Apps downloaded through the store are completely containerised. That means when you right click -&gt; uninstall, they're completely gone. No junk is left on your machine. Recently, Microsoft have started allowing classic apps (the ones with the installer) in on the app store. Think apps like Spotify. These work exactly as their classic counterpart does (they're the exact same app with the same code, although the built in updating functionality from these apps are removed) except they can't leave junk behind if you uninstall them.

- The auto updating thing is a bit of a double edged sword. If you're happy with shutting down the computer when you're finished with it at the end of the day and don't mind it taking a little longer to shut down occasionally, then you probably won't even notice the updates. Microsoft are trying to improve this, and there is an option to instruct Windows to notify you when an update has been installed and is waiting for a system shutdown/reboot. 
If you're one of those who likes to put the machine to sleep at the end of the day, you might come across a time where Windows force reboots on you. The only thing I can say about that is that the key to updates is give Windows a small time out window to install updates when you're not using it.

- With the regular feature updates (think of them as the move from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and so on), you'll get new features as they're ready. These feature updates may also make changes under the hood to improve the security and reliability of Windows 10 even further.

- The telemetry you've heard about on Windows 10 has been fully explained, at least at the basic level, [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/windows-diagnostic-data). Microsoft has been under fire by the EU for this, and they now seem to be giving their approval of Microsoft's efforts to explain the use of Telemetry. I bring this up as we all know the EU are really big on privacy issues. Take it as you will.

To address your issues highlighted in the OP:

- You can change what Explorer opens to. Go to the View tab, then ""Options"", and there should be a drop down to change the default from ""Quick Access"" to ""Computer"".

- A lot of the settings previously found in Control Panel have been migrated to the new Settings app. Where functionality is not quite in the Settings app, it usually has a link to open the page in Control Panel.

- Try and get used to searching the start menu. You can still hit the start button and then start typing for whatever you want. I'll warn you though, the search algorithm isn't quite there so don't just hit Enter once you've finished typing.",True,False,,0,1504265942,,False,0,dmf4s4j,False,t3_6xawj3,t3_6xawj3,1506397812,1,False,windows,t5_2qh3k,

warmus01,,,"Trochę późno, natomiast widziałem bardzo ciekawy wykład podczas konferencji KPF dotyczący wzrostu Polskiego PKB. Wzrost PKB jest teraz napędzany przez konsumpcję na kredyt. Jeżeli inwestycje nie przyspieszą DRAMATYCZNIE i to stale przez następne dwa lata, to mamy zgotowany wariant grecki. To nie są domysły, nasza obecna ścieżka jest właściwie kopią modelu greckiego, i w dużym stopniu też portugalskiego. Oba te kraje teraz mają ogromny problem z doganianiem PKB czy innych wskaźników najbardziej rozwiniętych gospodarek europejskich, bo wymieniły model zrównoważonego rozwoju gospodarczego (napędzany inwestycjami) na szybki, ale krótkotrwały wzrost konsumpcją. Oczywiście wizja naszego Guru Morawieckiego jest taka, że wzrost konsumpcji z 500+ powoduje wzrost podaży, przez co wszystko się nakręca. Ale tu są dwa OGROMNE problemy.

1) 500+ nie idzie tylko na dobra produkowane w Polsce. Z 500zł miesięcznie, które nasz rząd bierze na kredyt żeby dać ludziom, bardzo znacząca część jest wydawana na importowane przez nas produkty. Zadłużanie się przy założeniu, że tylko część pieniędzy zostaje w Polsce już na oko wygląda jak zły pomysł, i tak też jest w rzeczywistości. 

2) Konsumpcja ma to do siebie, że potrafi się bardzo szybko zmienić/zahamować. Główną determinantą, przynajmniej za czasów moich studiów były przewidywania odnośnie sytuacji gospodarczej Polski w przyszłości. Te potrafią zmienić się bardzo drastycznie i jeżeli gospodarka nie jest oparta na inwestycjach, to sekwencja ""spadek popytu-&gt; spadek inwestycji"" może nas wkręcić w poważne problemy, tak jak na przykład wspomnianą Grecję czy Portugalię. 

Także o ile wynik 3.9% jest solidny, to nie ma on nic wspólnego ze zrównoważonym wzrostem gospodarczym, który stanowi jeden z głównych celów polityki fiskalnej Państwa. Wiem, że Morawiecki zdaje sobie z tego sprawę i przeraża mnie to, że jest gotów postawić wszystko na to, że konsumpcja będzie cały czas stabilnie rosnąć, napędzając tym samym inwestycje. Tak może być, ale na wystarczająco długiej osi czasu jest to praktycznie niemożliwe i wtedy wszyscy odczują to po portfelach.

knechtsunderstudy,,🕋,"&gt; He basically blamed you guys for it saying Serbs were oppressing everyone and trying to turn Yugoslavia into some sort of greater Serbia.

Well, he's half-right there. Serbia wasn't oppressing Croatia. However, Slobodan Milošević did (successfully) try to force a Serbian hegemony. Switching from a hardcore antinationalist Communist position to a hugely nationalist pro-Serb position, he reduced the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina through the so-called ""Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution"" (which I can't summarize here, but do look it up yourself). Representatives of Croatia condemned it, and then Slobo doubled down, and then Croatia doubled down and then Slobo... well, after the more extreme Serbs living in Croatia started a mini-rebellion afraid of the Croat military strengthening (which started in apprehension of Serbian military strengthening), Serbia did attack and shit went to hell.

&gt; Also alot of Serbs are calling Croats traitors because they joined Nazi Germany.

Again, a tad more complicated, inglorious gave you a good overview on that. I'll just chime in: one of Slobo's most successful rhetorical techniques was invoking history as an omnipotent, always-repeating force (think ""time is a flat circle"") with us people merely historically-constrained players in our national destinies. World War Two ended in 1945. Slobo named the Croats of late 1980s actual Nazis (since their ancestors did run an atrocious concentration camp and were complicit in Nazi rule of Europe). That sped up the breakup of Yugoslavia since you don't want to be in a (con)federation with Nazis.

&gt; What do you think they should have done instead?

""They"" is far too accusatory - there were Croats in the resistance. The Croats of today aren't necessarily the Croats of the Pavelić Ustaša regime. In principle, don't join the Nazis and don't exterminate people.

&gt; And my final question is would it be better if Yugoslavia still existed or is it better split like today?

Who knows? Yugoslavia, after all, was a communist state, which meant a suppressed press, no free elections, an oversized influence of the Party - and Serbia, even in a nominally democratic and free system, has inherited those problems. Still, those things are much better today than then. When people lament the good Yugoslav days, they lament the dissolution of the strong economy (which wasn't as strong as they remember, but which was much more beneficial to the average worker), of the political influence Yugoslavia wielded (which would be weaker today in a possible Yugoslavia since the Cold War is over, but would be much greater than the influence of one-eighth of that), and of the camaraderie among nations (which was eroding since the 1980s, with a few cases even before that). In any case, what was lost wasn't lost in the breakup, it was lost in the fact it was a **violent** breakup.

For example the New York metro area has as many people as all of Romania. In New York, if you go by the the news, the police choke and kill people on their whim. In reality, these are exceedingly rare.

As a dark skinned immigrant in the New York metro area, I can personally assure you that the police are far more respectful and courteous today than they were in the 90s. I have friends and family all over the US. Their experience is the same. 

I have a friend who is an Romanian immigrant. To compare the US even remotely with Ceausescu's dictatorship is outright ridiculous. Despite all the talk about dictatorship, Trumps powers are actually very limited. Trump cannot even prevent cities from ignoring immigration law. For example, in many cities, despite the federal law, they even have decided to let people go even after they find that they are illegal aliens.

Also Trump has nothing to do with policing in general. In the US the police report to locally elected mayors and state elected governors, and often, unlike Europe, the police chiefs are directly elected. This means they are very responsive to what the people want. In the past people were concerned about crime, so they were willing to allow the police crack down hard even small crimes.Now there is a generation that has forgotten about how bad crime used to be, and the prosecutors (who are elected by the people are even running on a platform not to [prosecute crimes such as vandalism](https://www.bkreader.com/2017/07/201707district-attorney-candidates-spar-over-rikers-broken-windows-and-police-brutality/).

8eeblebrox,,"A Stonking Brexit - Recruiter, New Model Hitler Army","Brexit: UK and EU concerned over slow progress 02:37

David Davis is UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.   

The opinions in this article belong to the author.

(CNN) It's more than two years since I last visited Washington DC. Since then, there has been tremendous political and economic change on both sides of the Atlantic. It is imperative that we now work together, as the closest of friends, to deliver a solution that works for both of our great continents.

The UK's decision to leave the European Union surprised much of the establishment. But it allows us an unprecedented chance to take control of the important issues that govern Britain's society and economy.  

From designing an immigration system that addresses the concerns of ordinary working people and fits the needs of business to ensuring we have regulation more tailored to the UK economy rather than the needs of 28 different economies, leaving the EU provides us with a large opportunity.  

For the first time in over 40 years, we'll have the freedom to strike our own trade deals and deepen key relationships with old allies, including our closest ally, the US.  

Brexit is not about Britain stepping back from the world, but jumping into the new opportunities it presents.
Outside of the EU, Britain will be nimbler, more open to innovation and technological change, at the same time as driving up global standards.  

Using our might as the world's fifth largest economy -- we can become a true champion of free trade.
That should be in the interests of our close neighbours in Europe, as well as more far-reaching parts of the world.  

From the very start of this process we've been clear that pursuing a new path will not come at the expense of our relationship with Europe. Our growth and prosperity will come alongside that of Europe, not instead of it.
Yesterday I completed the third round of negotiations to deliver a new partnership with the EU. It was constructive, but as I made clear, if we are to get the right deal we will need more flexibility.  

That deal is in both of our interests because after we've left, the UK will continue to buy Europe's goods and services, sell them ours, and our citizens will continue to travel, live and work across the continent.  

It will address the unique circumstances around the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland -- making sure there is no hard border, and the Belfast (""Good Friday"") Agreement is upheld in every way.
And it will also underline our continued cooperation with the EU on foreign affairs, and combating crime and terrorism.  

We also want a new free trade agreement with the EU that allows for the freest possible trade in European goods and services between Britain and the EU's member states.  

It should give companies operating in the UK the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within European markets -- and let European businesses do the same in Britain.  

This is a deal of global economic importance which is in the shared interests of the UK and the EU. In 2016, while the UK exported £241 billion worth of goods and services to the EU, the UK imported £312 billion worth of goods and services from the EU.  

The progress made this week at the formal negotiations means I'm hopeful we can start talking soon about a trade deal with the EU in the near future.  

A successful economic relationship in Europe is in the interests of the US as well.  

Britain and America have the closest defense relationship in the world, but it's often overlooked that we are each other's single largest foreign investors, supporting 2.2 million jobs.  

An example of this is UK company JCB Ltd -- which manufactures machinery in both Savannah, Georgia, and Derbyshire in England, and recently confirmed one of the biggest single orders in its 71-year-old history to the US Army.    

American corporations have invested nearly $600 billion in the UK, and there are many US subsidiaries in other EU member states doing business in Britain.  

As the world's largest economic power and the world's fifth, together we can drive domestic and global growth.  

In my speech today to business leaders at the US Chamber of Commerce, I'll outline how Brexit creates a huge opportunity for increasing liberalisation in services, improving standards around the world for workers and consumers, and through better harnessing technological developments.   

I make no apologies for being ambitious for Britain, and the role it can play in the world once we leave the EU.  

Because after we leave we can be a truly global Britain, competing on the world stage and a real champion for free trade.  

And if we embark on that path together, with our American friends, there could be a very exciting future for us all. ",True,False,,0,1504269973,,False,0,dmf7309,True,t3_6xe9pr,t3_6xe9pr,1506398957,1,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

Não precisa ser 'parar de beber'. Qualquer atitude que você tenha que seja diferente da norma, qualquer comportamento que você possua que seja diferente do padrão, vai afastar as pessoas que só se interessam superficialmente por você.

One concern I would have about Amsterdam is that it could attract a lot of ""new"" audiences who just go to LCS to get high/ visit the red light district and aren't actually that passionate about esports or bring other issues to the scene (people smoking weed on site for example which could in return repel some of the previous audience). People will make fun of this but there is actually a lot of tourism going on by people who just go there to get high and party.

Regarding Brussels, I could imagine that it would be too expensive to hold the EU LCS there, but if money wasn't an issue, then that would surely be a great location.

lordgorgeous,,,"If we're talking about Turkish people in Turkey, they are Caucasian. The Turks who left Mongolia and settled in Asia Minor married into the local Caucasian population, repeat this process for 600 years and you get a Turkic-speaking (North Asian language) but Caucasian ethnic group.

This phenomenon isn't discussed often, but generally groups of foreigners who settle in another country and marry into the local population, after a century or two, they end up looking like the locals. This happened to the Turks, and this also happened to the Roma who left Northern India and ended up in Europe. Now this would be interesting to see in the 21st century with rapid globalisation and air travel if this is still the case.

Topics on race and ethnicity are often controversial but it should be discussed since its an integral part on the history and development of nation-states. I find the current political climate is hostile towards the discussion of the relationship between race, ethnicity, and nationality for fear of offending people but we should be honest about it. For example, the French people as an ethnic group are descendants of the Franks, a collection of Germanic tribes, but that might be considered racist to say now because political correctness dictates that France is cosmopolitan and that there is no single French culture (Charlemagne would be rolling on his grave).

A friend of mine who has Asian heritage, speaks with the Franconian dialect and in general he is like your average Franconian expect for the fact the is Asian.

I would say that his identity is Franconian, Asian-German, since his racial background gives him probably a different experience than an European-German, since for some people racial background play a role, I talking about racism here. But his ethnicity is IMO definitely German-Franconian and so is his identity (with a small difference).

&gt;An ethnic group, or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, society, culture or nation.


The only thing that wouldn't make him an ethnically German is ancestry, whereas the only thing that would make him an ethnically Philippine is ancestry. Therefore he is an ethically German.

Having been formed in early 1980s, I'm sure as hell Hezbollah has nothing to do with it. 


&gt;Unlike the other two points which I would argue were more incomplete than incorrect, this one is wholly incorrect. Hezbollah's recruitment takes place all over the world, as a recent NY Times piece showed. They reach into Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen for recruitment. They have global operations recruiting in Latin America and working with drug cartels there to generate revenue. They recruit in Europe and have supply chains there. They recruit everywhere Sunnis do. The only thing that sets them apart is that they want to destroy Israel and ISIS alike before they try and ""expel US influence"" from the wider Middle East, while ISIS is less press-savvy, more anti-Western, and believes the West's influence should be expelled from other countries before attacking Israel. Obviously they differ in other crucial ways, like respect for minorities (other than Jews in the long run), but the crux of how they differentiate themselves is that they are quiet overseas, focused at home, and far more willing to play Western press like a fiddle than ISIS ever was.

ISIS is better than Hezbollah you're saying? This is new kind of pro-Israel propaganda on a so-called ""academic"" subreddit.

PortugalBot,,,"&gt; r/portugal *-* Mais veículos e construção geram maior retoma em quase 17 anos ([7 comentários](https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/6xeihw/))

## Retoma ganhou força no segundo trimestre. INE reviu crescimento em alta ligeira, para 2,9%. Meta anual do governo é 1,8%

As exportações estão com força, mas as importações abafam o seu contributo para a retoma. O que está, de facto, a acelerar a economia no segundo trimestre é o investimento, sobretudo em ""veículos de transporte"" e ""construção"", indicou ontem o Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE). O consumo privado, o maior agregado do produto interno bruto (PIB), abrandou, mas ainda assim deu uma ajuda.

Contas feitas, a economia cresceu mais no segundo trimestre do que o estimado inicialmente. O INE reviu em alta o crescimento homólogo (face à primeira estimativa, há 15 dias) para 2,9%, o ritmo mais elevado em quase 17 anos.

É preciso recuar até final de 2000 para encontrar um número superior (3,8%).

Na nota sobre as contas nacionais do segundo trimestre, o INE diz que ""a procura interna manteve um contributo positivo elevado, superior ao do trimestre precedente, em resultado da aceleração do investimento"".

Por um lado, a procura interna (apoiada no investimento, que acelerou para 9,3%) acabou por explicar 97% da expansão, com um contributo de 2,8 pontos percentuais (p.p.) para os tais 2,9%.

Já o contributo da procura externa líquida ""manteve-se ligeiramente positivo no segundo trimestre (0,1 p.p.)"", verificando-se ""uma desaceleração das exportações de bens e serviços de magnitude idêntica à observada nas importações"".

As vendas ao exterior abrandaram de 9,5% no primeiro trimestre para 8,2% no período de abril-junho. No entanto, as importações (que roubam valor ao PIB) acabaram por reequilibrar pois também perderam gás. Desaceleraram de 8,8% para 7,5% no período em análise. Ainda assim, um ritmo elevado em termos históricos.

**Mais investimento**

O forte impulso homólogo do investimento, o maior em dois anos, acontece por duas razões: houve mais dinheiro aplicado em veículos de transporte (como veículos ligeiros e pesados para transporte de mercadorias) e na construção, mas também há um efeito de base (o investimento estava a cair 2,2% há um ano a esta parte).

O INE diz que o investimento fixo (sem variação de existências, a chamada FBCF) em equipamento de transporte ""foi a componente que mais contribuiu para a aceleração da FBCF no segundo trimestre, registando um aumento homólogo de 33,1% (10,6% no trimestre anterior), influenciada em particular pelo comportamento da componente automóvel"".

Além disso, ""destaca-se também o crescimento mais intenso"" do investimento em construção, que acelerou de 8,6% no 1.º trimestre para 9,5% agora. E tudo indica que o investimento deve continuar a recuperar pois também esteve a cair no terceiro trimestre de 2016 (efeito de base será favorável este ano) e há uma série de atividades que ainda vão acontecer.

É o caso do megaevento Web Summit, em Lisboa, em novembro, que deve puxar por este indicador, pelo consumo e pelas exportações (faturação na hotelaria ou outros ramos ligados ao turismo, por exemplo). Além disso, os fundos europeus continuam a entrar, cada vez com mais força, ajudando a uma aceleração nas pequenas e médias obras públicas, sobretudo nesta altura - véspera das eleições autárquicas, marcadas para 1 de outubro.

**Famílias mais moderadas**

A nota menos favorável no que toca à dinâmica de crescimento acabou por vir do consumo privado, com as famílias a moderarem bastante a compra de bens duradouros (como carros, eletrodomésticos, artigos de eletrónica) e a acelerarem apenas ligeiramente nos gastos com bens não duradouros (como a alimentação). Tudo considerado, o consumo privado que estava a crescer 2,3% no início deste ano, abrandou para 2,1%.

Segundo o INE, ""as despesas em consumo final em bens duradouros das famílias residentes registaram um crescimento homólogo menos intenso, de 3,4%"", quando tinha chegado a ser de 5,9% no arranque deste ano. O instituto diz que foi ""devido à desaceleração da aquisição de automóveis"".

O INE destaca ainda uma contração mais profunda do consumo público. ""O consumo público apresentou uma taxa de variação homóloga de -0,9% (variação de -0,4% no trimestre anterior). Note-se que a evolução do consumo público a partir do 2.º semestre de 2016 foi influenciada pela alteração do período normal de trabalho na administração pública de 40 para 35 horas semanais, com o consequente aumento do deflator da componente de remunerações e efeito negativo em volume"", explica a mesma fonte.

**Acima da meta do governo**

Para este ano, o governo espera um crescimento económico de 1,8% (Programa de Estabilidade), sendo que o Orçamento do Estado está montado em cima de um cenário ainda mais humilde (1,5%).

Significa isto, que os 2,8% do primeiro trimestre e os 2,9% alcançados agora no período abril-junho estão largamente acima dessas metas, aproximando-se dos cerca de 3% já acenados pelo ministro das Finanças, Mário Centeno, ou dos 3,2% referindo *en passant* pelo Presidente da República, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, aqui há uns meses. Ontem, o Presidente da República pediu mais do que 2,9%: ""é preciso um pouco mais, tenho falado em 3% ou acima de 3%.""

A aceleração do crescimento ajuda a economia e isso reflete-se na execução orçamental, que está a correr de feição. A receita continua a subir acima do ritmo orçamentado; os gastos estão contidos. O desemprego está a descer, gerando menos despesa social.

Além de permitir alcançar a meta do défice deste ano (1,5% do PIB), também ajuda a diminuir a carga da dívida, para 127,7%, prometeu Centeno há dias.

Mofroman007,,,"One way to think about the development of what we now call music theory is to study the development of Polyphony, which might be a little easier to track through the ages, if a little less comprehensive than /u/DiminishedUnison's answer. While folk and popular music is difficult to track, in the realm of art music in Europe, polyphony began to develop in the late medieval period in the Motet structure, where one voice would be a slower Cantus Firmus, with a melody often based off an earlier monophonic chant, and then other voices layered over that, creating harmony. The legacy of this late medieval directly influenced western art music into the Renaissance and baroque, which then informed the harmonic developments of the classical period and beyond.

The two main complications that I always get hung up on are a.) It's difficult to define what we see as ""Modern music theory"" and any definition there will be arbitrary and subjective, and b.) This only covers art music  in western Europe, and only its influence on later art music in western Europe. Music in other parts of the world and popular/folk music all is its own complex, rich history intertwined with the art music of the time.

Vulpes1nculta,,,"I think it's the former, actually. If you look at how the average person's disposable income, tax burden, private debt and so forth have changed since the year 2000, it's actually quite bad. We've not only stagnated, we've declined.

This week I found an article about a government study in the Netherlands that showed that while the economy had grown by a total of 12% from 2000 to 2017, the average disposable income had actually dropped by 3% over the same period. I would be surprised if this was significantly different elsewhere in Europe, and I do think a lot of it is down to deliberate (if misinformed) political choices made from the 1990s until the 2010s.",True,False,,0,1504275502,,False,0,dmfbb1a,False,t3_6xdrnn,t1_dmf8r1b,1506401068,7,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

That's an absurd statement. Museums are cultural and close down due to lack of resources all the time. Western Europe has a huge history of satire and it seems to be mostly understood here whereas, in my experience, it's not as understood in America.

&gt;Also what is satirical about saying a toddler that drown would become an ""ass grabber""????? I would love to hear the explanation.

Simple. It's saying that people care about the plight of a child but not the adults. To them, all adult male migrants are some form of horrific rapist/ass grabber so surely this poor, innocent child everyone suddenly cared about would become the same by their sweeping generalisation and demonising of migrants.

Satire isn't necessarily intended to make people laugh. It can also be used effectively to make people think. It isn't just some trashy late night talk show host poking fun at a politician. In that case it's going for a shock value by putting these two opposing views of migrants together to make people re-evaluate their negative views.",True,False,,0,1504275656,,False,0,dmfbfqv,False,t3_6xb25n,t1_dmfazmu,1506401132,14,False,ShitAmericansSay,t5_2w57u,
Nicepix,,,"There is an interesting analysis of the Brexit Divorce Bill here: 
https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/brexit-explained/eu-divorce-bill 

If that is a true picture then the actual figure would be less than €30b given the UK's share of the €49.5b outstanding loans (€9b - €12b) plus maximum of two year's net membership to cover leaving period, pension contributions, less the UK share of EU assets. 

The loans are already paid and the EU wants the UK to stump up in case the Ukraine, Ireland, Portugal &amp; Hungary default. I personally cannot see a reason why the UK cannot agree to guarantor any default as they already have rather than pay money up front to the EU. That would knock €9b - €12b off the bill straight away. 

The article seems to believe that the UK Government has come to the conclusion that much of the demands are not legally enforceable anyway so may be willing to opt for a third party legal jurisdiction rather than agree to pay the contested aspects.

Coeliac,,,"The referendum was actually outlined in the Labour manifesto, which stated:

&gt; The Labour Government pledges that within twelve months of this election we will give the British people the final say, which will be binding on the Government - through the ballot box - on whether we accept the terms and stay in or reject the terms and come out.

It's not possible to show you that this vote was for the European Union as that wasn't created until 1992, however it is clear that we voted to stay, as a 67% of voters, as part of the current terms. As much as it wasn't legally defined as an entity until 2009, you'd be hard pressed to suggest we could vote on membership of the EU before it existed. Yes, it was on the EEC, however the European Union didn't exist then. We voted **towards** the creation of the European union, which certainly isn't **against** it.

&gt; Please read my comment. I know we had a referendum, and that referendum was about whether we should remain in the EEC, not the European Union.

So once again, we circle back to how the EU was formed. The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 was signed by the United Kingdom and I am still asking you if you believe parliamentary decisions are acknowledged by you as law, or if you only believe in direct democracy? **We voted** consecutive parliaments in that supported pro-European trade and political union movements, they then **represented us** and **signed agreements to roll us into the EU**.

CatherineAm,,,"In this case she's sort of right though. The K1 is a visa that's more open to abuse than others--not that it is abused more than others, just that the nature of the thing is a bit more vulnerable to abuse. Mostly the fact that the immigrant can cross the border without already being married; people could and sometimes do just get get the visa, come in to the US and disappear (working illegally etc. In the 90s, this was used by human traffickers bringing women in from Eastern Europe and having them work in strip clubs). Also, because you don't have to be married first, you've still got to prove a real relationship SOMEhow. 

Whenever romance scammers pull their stunts on Americans, and especially once the scammed American starts blowing up the phones at ICE and USCIS and probably even the embassy, that does highlight the need to make the process more strict in the future and real people in real relationships DO get denied because proving a real relationship can be difficult and when they set the bar higher because of romance scammers, it just gets harder. Now, it's usually people from the same countries as the scammers (there are a handful who, rightfully or not, are considered high fraud). But it is a thing.

I don't know what she's talking about for their denial-- for the K1 or his green card. I at first thought that she HAD to be talking about visit visas (B1/B2) because those get denied alllll the time but in context it did sound like she was talking about the K1/green card. I'd love to know if they were actually denied denied or if they were put into administrative processing (basically limbo hell on earth) or if the application was kicked back because they didn't include some key materials. 2 K1 denials would be very, very strange and would take a long time (6 months from application to interview for the first one, denial, 6 months to send back to USCIS for cancellation, same for the second, then 6 months to interview for the third, you're looking at 2.5 years. I don't think they even knew each other 2.5 years by the beginning of their season). 

Also, when she's talking about people like them making a stigma around the K1/green card process. I mean yes. TLC is largely to blame for the angle they've taken, too, but when you're really in love, have a real relationship and the show could be about this interesting/unusual process and international love story, instead you've got the ""are these shifty foreigners just in it for the green card. Let's wait and see"". Plus like half the country assumes that you're being used because their uncle's neighbor married a foreigner once and she was a lying scheming bitch who ran out on him the moment she got her papers.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database

With about 1000 people killed by police in 2016 and a total population of about 320,000,000, a citizen of the US has a  0.0003% chance of being killed by police in any one year. That's so low as to call it zero. And that's for someone who lives full time in the US. Let's say you went to the US for one month on vacation. Divide that already very low percentage by 12. It's just not going to happen.

Stepping away from the stats and giving my own personal experience, I grew up in the US and spent decades there, and have also lived in Europe for 10 years. For sure the police in the Europe are far less aggressive and don't have the kind of power trips the police in the US seem to have too often. In the US the best way to stop talking to a police officer is to make sure they know that you have respect for them and consider them the boss. It can feel shitty for someone who doesn't like authority figures. But if you can get over that, the chance of you getting killed by a police officer is really non-existent.

**Actual info: we're seeking some more members, especially Damage-dealers for our trial-events, min. 2 times per week! These are mostly the ""old"" trials on normal and non-HM veteran difficulty, but also we're up for normal Halls of Fabrication runs. We're not aiming to make our members overwhelmed, so joining our events is optional. Besides the combat-type events, we arrange non-combat (screenshot, exploration) kind of events, for rewards.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Our guild, the ""WEB"" (Wealth-Equality-Brotherhood)** is an international, English-speaking social (kind of) guild, founded in Spring 2015, now with more than 90 members, with 95% active in a a month, more than the half in 1-2 days. We aimed to create a fun community based on thievery, sadly there weren't any content-elements implemented which would have helped this, so we reformed ourselves as a general guild. In the last months we could finish lots of in-guild trial-runs (on normal difficulty), and still planning more, including veteran runs also (on Tuesdays and Thursdays, starting at 9.00pm CEST). We could clear vAA, vHRC and vSO, the next target is vMoL (one day, after more vSO completions..... :)).

&amp;nbsp;

We have players with characters from every class, race, role and playstyle, we have members from all of the alliances, while we are mainly PvE-oriented, so this won't carry any real importance. We have some basic rules, mostly about friendly behaviour, no-drama, no-rudeness, respect etc. **Our players are friendly, social, chatty and (mainly) mature guys (and girls :)), lots of us with family, job and pet, so our frequent playing hours are in the evening.**

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR We need more active players**, it is better if you're above CP160, but it's not a problem if you're below it, we've never told anything against those members, who were quite newbies. If you want to be our member you should be active in the evening hours, able and keen to do group content, shouldn't be arrogant and disrespectful, or childish (while we are not against good humour). 

Have no fear if you're basic in English, we won't force you to use any voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software (while we have Discord server); please just be quick in typing and reading :) The only exceptions are the trial runs: those need vocal coordination, so at least you have to be able to listen and follow.

The anti-Jewish violence in Poland from 1944 to 1946 refers to a series of violent incidents in Poland that immediately followed the end of World War II in Europe and influenced the postwar history of the Jews as well as Polish-Jewish relations. The exact number of Jewish victims is a subject of debate with 327 documented cases, and the range, estimated by different writers, from 1,000 to 2,000 (an undocumented minority view). Jews constituted between 2% and 3% of the total number of victims of postwar violence in the country, including the Polish Jews who managed to escape the Holocaust on territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The incidents ranged from individual attacks to pogroms.

They will be half Chinese and half non-Chinese rosters on both teams.   The Canadians, Americans and Europeans who make up the 'non-Chinese' part of the roster will be paid as ambassador's of the game of hockey and players.  

Each North American team will fly to China for 9-10 days landing on a Thursday and returning 10 days later on the Monday.   It is expected they will play 3 games vs each team.  Right now it would be FRI-SAT-SUN, they would get a rest day on Monday and Tuesday.   On Wednesday, they will have a combined practice and scrimmage vs a group of Chinese players who are not in either team but make up the Chinese National B team.   

Thursday will be a combined practice with a select group of Chinese players, then FRI-SAT-SUN they play another three games before heading home on Monday.

Each Chinese team will fly to North America twice and play for a 2-3 week stretch.

The second Chinese team was an option that the Chinese investors who are looking to get their ladies team up to speed in turn for the 2022 Winter Olympics.   China's goal is to get the team up to a level where they can realistically compete for a medal.  It is a tough ask, however the people behind this venture are absolutely determined to be successful.  When the first team was announced it was thought they would ice 10 Chinese and 5-6 imports and be successful.  When they did a realistic review of the plan, the need for a second team was seen.    The main team is the Kunlun Red Stars.  On the mens side, they also entered a team in the KHL, that is now coached by Mike Keenan.   The second team will be where the younger Chinese national players will be playing for, the Vanke Rays.

China looked at the NWHL and CWHL or a combination of both.   The reasons for choosing the CWHL are long and full of much speculation, disparaging commentary from all sides, debatable and some outright skullduggery.  The leagues don't really like or trust the other.

&gt;Even their siege warfare, while certainly effective, was usually a similar case of siege engines appropriated from previous conquests backed up by the hordes of cavalry archers basically ensuring that nobody got in or out, again, the bread and butter of the force being absolutely overwhelming numbers of horse archers.

I don't disagree here, I do know most of their prowess in siege warfare came from materiel and engineers from previously conquered territories. I guess I was under the impression that some of their conquests (particularly in China) focused much more on the siege warfare component, whereas others had more horse-archers-in-open-battle quality, like in Southwest Asia, Russia, or Europe.

Do you honestly find it hard to understand why people like you aren't respected in the public debate?

Then, I apparently missed the article about tents. You make it sound like the refugees just get a camping tent and plop it down wherever they want. Those tents are basically military grade with heating and other amenities, and they are supposed to be a temporary solution until proper housing can be built. They are definitely not what you are trying to convey.

About Milo, I never said anything about him being radical right wing. I just said that he is perhaps not the best source when it comes to these kinds of questions due to his track record. And what the hell does this even have to do with the so called ""alt-left""? I'll have you know I'm considered right wing in Sweden, and you somehow managed to conclude that I was a radical leftist from the fact that I questioned Milo as a source. That has to be one of the worst cases of straw man arguments I have ever seen (to not mention the namecalling you seem to despise so much).

&gt; The video itself is still proof, regardless of whatever little label you'd like to put on him.

You better clarify which video you are talking about, what it is supposed to mean, but mainly how it is supposed to back up any of your statements, because at this point you are basically just throwing shitty arguments at me from all over without ever properly responding to anything I say. None of the things you provide are facts, you just keep posting sources which are incredibly biased and have been debunked time and time again, and somehow you declare victory since you then try to throw another curveball at me without ever giving a proper answer.

About these no-go zones, they are complete and utter bullshit. I can jump on my bike, and in 10 minutes I can go to one of the ones that are classified as the most exposed in all of Sweden. I go through there regularly, during all times of the day, and I have never felt threatened. I see cops there patrolling all friendly, just to increase their presence and improve their image. Meanwhile, you hear stories over and over again about how people who accidentally end up in places like East St. Louis, Illinois or Gary, Indiana get pulled over by cops who tell them to hightail it out of there for their own safety. And that's not to mention the classic areas like Compton, or cities like Detroit and Chicago.

But if you want to compare, St. Louis has over 17 times the murder rate of Malmö, which has the highest in Sweden. Chicago has over 8 times as many murders per capita. As a matter of fact, Malmö doesn't even have the highest murder rate in northern Europe, if you head to Estonia and Tallinn you suddenly get 1,6 times as many murders as you do in Malmö [(Source)](https://www.hd.se/2017-02-20/rekord-i-mord-sa-farligt-ar-malmo). If you check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate), Malmö has about the murder rate of Seattle, and they list 65 cities in the US with a higher murder rate. Do you still think it's crazy dangerous there?

And how can the belief that native Swedes are becoming second hand citizens still survive? These people who come, with neither money nor education, they don't end up getting tons of free money.

BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] elite,"As talks in Brussels grind on, voters in the Surrey town of Staines-upon-Thames, part of the constituency of Spelthorne that backed leaving the EU by 60 to 40 last summer, are flummoxed about why the Brexit process has taken so long.

Sue Shaw, a school worker, said she had expected Brexit by last Christmas. “A lot of people I work with thought we would be out within a week, they thought that if we voted leave we would get on and leave,” she said as she walked her dog near the river Thames.

“It’s been very slow. Personally, I thought we would be out in six months.”

Dave Matthews, a retired accountant, echoed her view. “The government has been too slow and a bit too weak in the negotiations,” he said as he filled in a crossword on a bench.

He partly blamed David Cameron, the former prime minister, for failing to oversee any detailed preparations for Brexit in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum.
Now he is becoming alarmed about the idea of a “transition deal” for several years after March 2019.

That would involve continued freedom of movement and payments to the EU as well as potential oversight by the European Courts of Justice — while a trade deal is finalised with Brussels.

“I think if we are going to do this thing, then the sooner we go the better. Hanging on for years and years, I don’t see the benefit of that quite honestly,” he said.

Many Leave voters wanted to quit the EU because they thought excessive immigration had driven down wages and put pressure on public services, said Mr Matthews. “Carrying on with that is not acceptable.”

As David Davis, Brexit secretary, tries to pick his way through the complex negotiations, the patience of Leave voters appears to be wearing thin. Confusing messages emerging from the government have not helped.

Julie Oropallo, a retired hairdresser, admitted that the Brexit process had not been what many voters had expected when they voted Leave. “I voted to come out, but it seems to be taking a lot longer, I imagined it would be over in two years or so, but it’s turned out to be incredibly complex.”

Meeting the public’s expectations could also pose problems for the government, with interviewees in Staines puzzled over several details, including why Britain should pay a multibillion pound “divorce” settlement. Several people agreed with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who said the EU could “go whistle” if they expect a large payment.

“Boris was right, we shouldn’t pay a penny,” said Margaret Blythe, a retail worker. “Think how much we’ve given them over the years . . . they probably owe us don’t they?”

Anthony Wells, politics director at YouGov, believes the final figure for the divorce bill could trigger a backlash from angry voters.

According to a survey by ICM for The Guardian newspaper this week, only 11 per cent found the idea of Britain paying “up to £30bn” “acceptable” against 72 per cent who did not.

“People will think, ‘crikey’, that’s a huge amount, that’s outrageous, unless the popular media don’t express any outrage . . . which feels unlikely,” said Mr Wells.

“The thing is, issues such as trade deals, City passporting, customs and so on are incredibly complicated whereas the payment of £10bn, or whatever the final figure is, is incredibly straightforward.”

Mr Wells said that the figure could potentially be sold to the public if it was described as a fee for continued access rather than a fee for simply leaving the bloc.

But that had not happened yet. “I don’t think the government has even started to communicate a message on this. Instead, they are still letting it be talked about as an exit fee.”

The government has found it hard to communicate a clear message over Brexit and what kind of deal it can strike with the EU. Asked who was responsible for selling Britain’s Brexit strategy to the public, one aide replied: “The prime minister and cabinet.”

Sir Craig Oliver, former head of communications for Mr Cameron, said that any public backlash against the final deal, over issues such as immigration or the divorce bill, would depend on the reaction from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and their media allies.

“It all depends on what the Brexiters are willing to tolerate. If they say: ‘We’re OK with that’ then it’s harder to build up a narrative of betrayal or disaster,” he said. “If they say, ‘hold on, this is not what we were sold’, then it becomes more difficult for Number 10.”

“The government’s communication strategy seems to be based on a confidence that the Leave lobby won’t complain,” said Sir Craig. “If Brexiters don’t provide a megaphone to amplify dissent, it’s less likely there’ll be a public outcry.”

Chris Pratt, strategy director at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, said there was “no evidence” of a planned, deliberate communications strategy from ministers.

“The government only seem able to firefight,” he said. “There is a real risk that they will fail to manage public expectations following the rhetoric of the referendum campaign and business is left with continued uncertainty.”

Joey Jones, a former adviser to Mrs May, said voters seemed “pretty bored” by Brexit: but they could be “inflamed” at the drop of a hat.

“The key thing for the government to do is explain that any deal requires messy compromise and concessions on the UK side not just in Brussels,” said Mr Jones, now head of public affairs at Weber Shandwick.

“If ministers don’t get that across, then whatever eventual agreement is reached will be torn apart by true believers on one side or another denouncing it as a cave-in and capitulation.”

In fact look up how the war even started. Hitler invaded Poland for good reason, and was told by Britain and France that he could so without repercussions from them. My Great-Grandfather was in Western Poland at the time of the invasion. When the fight over Czechoslovakia started Polish citizens, militia, and farmers started slaughtering thousands of German citizens. They displaced 1.6 million Germans, making them refugees. Hitler didn't want an all out war, got permission from BOTH Britain and France to invade Poland, then set up a non-aggression pact with Stalin (even though he wanted to take out Russian Bolsheviks trying to bring communism into Europe). As soon as Hitler invaded, Britain declared war on Germany. If you study the occult history, you'll find out Hitler never wanted war with anyone except the communist. He tried to make peace offers constantly, and was always turned down or ignored. When he invaded Poland, my Great-Grandfather's family was captured in their business/home. His family was then burned in a group of others deemed unfit to work. Then was sent to a concentration camp for labor. Where he had to murder a solider while giving him a haircut to escape the camp in a truck of dead bodies. I was the last person to want to defend Hitler. Yet when you're faced with undeniable truths, facts, and evidences that suggest we've been lied to about all of this. One has to wonder why the fuck we're still taught this. Why do they want him to be evil. Because he was fighting the people who control everything, directly. He was filled with a passion to end the globalism that is spreading today.

This came after his long involvement and publicizing of the birther conspiracy.[0][1] You can see him fuming and glaring when the camera focuses on him.

Richard Branson also spoke of his nature:

Even before the starters arrived he began telling me about how he had asked a number of people for help after his latest bankruptcy and how five of them were unwilling to help. He told me he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying these five people.

Trump loves getting ""even"":

maksP1,CROA,Croatia,"&gt;The Arab transmission of the classics is a common and persistent myth that Arabic commentators such as Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd 'saved' the work of Aristotle and other Greek philosophers from destruction. According to the myth, these works would otherwise have perished in the long European dark age between fifth and the tenth centuries, had the Islamic philosophers not preserved them by translating them into Arabic, to be passed on to the Latin philosophers in the western world after the reconquest of Spain from the Muslims during the twelve and thirteenth centuries. This is incorrect. It was actually the Byzantines in the East who saved the ancient learning of the Greeks in the original language, and the first Latin texts to be used were translation from the Greek, in the 12th century, rather than, in most cases, the Arabic, which were only used in default of these.

&gt;It is nevertheless true, and no myth, that the work of the Arabic commentators, particularly Ibn Rushd, had a profound influence on the scholastic philosophers of the Latin West in the thirteenth century. Aristotle's Greek is terse and difficult to understand. The work of the Arabic commentators helped in explaining and clarifying Aristotle's dense and apparently obscure thought. Thus Western intellectual tradition owes a great debt to the Arabic scholars in terms of understanding Aristotle's thought.

Ja he tietenkin haluavat, että käydään nettomaksajan taskulla, otetaan sieltä rahaa ja jaetaan nettosaajille.

Sitten ansiosidonnainen (miksi hyväpalkkaiset ja hyvän tuottavuuden työn tekijät tarvitsevat jonkun ekstrakannustimen sohvalla makaamiseen?). Haittamaahanmuuton ja kaksikielisyyden rahat pois heti.

SSPanzer101,,,"Our modern economic situation is so much different from that of the Weimar Republic and 1990 to present day Zimbabwe that you can't really make any rational comparisons between them. In the US our government isn't ""just printing money &amp; handing it out"". Our currency is backed by debt. I'll make a very basic &amp; simplified explanation: the government wants to introduce new money into the economy. They request an amount from the Federal Reserve, let's just say $1b. The reserve *loans* this $1b to the government and requires $1.5b to be paid back in interest (these figures are purely fictional simply for my example). The government receives the money where it is then distributed to various banks across the nation. (Furthermore, old banknotes are destroyed which I'll mention in a moment.) So in order to repay this $500m interest, wealth must be generated. This results in economic growth, new production, new jobs, etc, therefore keeping inflation at a low percentage. People complain about ""the national debt"" but we *need* debt for economic growth! Debt generates wealth. Instead of being backed by gold, which limits our economic growth to how much gold the mines can produce &amp; gives privately owned mining companies ultimate power over our currency, our ""technically fiat"" currency is backed by debt. It's not just worthless paper as I hear many old conservatives bitching about. Saying ""We never should have left the gold standard!""  
   
In the case of Zimbabwe many factors occurred on top of printing money which resulted in their hyperinflation. Selfish &amp; corrupt leadership being the primary cause. It began around 1987 when Mugabe took power. He caused massive damage to the Zimbabwean economy &amp; destroyed any economic growth which would have occurred had he nor did the things he did. For example confiscating huge amounts of farmers then dividing it up amongst his cronies. He stole land from people who were educated in agriculture, who knew how to work the land &amp; grow food as well as export cash crops such as tobacco, and gave it to uneducated people who had *absolutely zero* knowledge of farming. This caused enormous losses in crop production, causing famine and monetary loss in cash crop exports. He and his buddies/cronies were making themselves rich of course. Not to bring up race but this is another important fact: The new Zimbabwean government was extremely racist toward white people (Rhodesia had a large white population), and it just so happened that most of the farmland was owned by white farmers. When the new government came to power &amp; began confiscating land/business from ""its enemies"" it left a large portion of the population with nothing. Therefore most of the educated populace of Zimbabwe fled to Europe, resulting in a national brain drain. Furthermore Mugabe was dipping his filthy hands into the Congo wars. With the depressed economy (a direct result of the Mugabe regime) he couldn't afford the expensive military equipment &amp; weapons he wanted to buy in order to interfere in these wars. When you need money what do you do? Print it! Print lots of it! We'll be trillionaires, richest men in the world, genius!! Mugabe starts having money printed to buy the things he wants  (military equipment), then he prints more, and more. When the current notes lose their value, he just prints higher denomination notes. Zimbabwe has their own government reserve bank too, which the Zimbabwean government IE: Mugabe &amp; friends have ultimate control over (unlike the US Government) so it doesn't exist as a regulating force like it does in the US economy. Mugabe had to print *fucking enormous* amounts of banknotes to cause the Zimbabwean hyperinflation. Like quadrillions of dollars, trillions of dollars every day being printed. As a comparison right now there is approximately  $1.56 trillion dollars in circulation right now. Zimbabwe had that in just single  $1 trillion dollar notes. Add political unrest &amp; further corruption in top of all this as pretty much everyone in the new Zimbabwean government was/is extremely corrupt, not just Mugabe.   
   
 Basic income doesn't mean the entire US population receives a stack of 10 freshly printed 100 dollar bills every month which they then stash under the mattress. And we won't be minting 175 trillion dollars every week like Zimbabwe. No, practically every penny will be introduced straight back into the economy. Furthermore this will result in more debt to the Federal Reserve. What does debt do? It generates wealth. How is the wealth generated? *Economic Growth!*   
  
Also, as much as boomers &amp; ultra conservatives want to ignore it, rapid advancement in robotics, productive machinery, and automation **WILL** eliminate so many jobs in the United States that there **will not** be enough jobs for every single citizen over age 18 to ""Work their 50hrs a week to earn their keep."" Not only is it going to happen, it **is happening right now.** Requiring everyone to either work 50 hours a week otherwise live on the street &amp; starve is not a sustainable policy, it will not last forever with advancements in automation. Either the 1% will live in ultimate luxury while the 99% starves OR the wealth shall be redistributed and the means of production will be owned by the 99% + everyone receives a basic income. These are the only two options for our future. Unfortunely the first option is what's currently implemented &amp; I personally believe in the future the 1% will live in private armed &amp; protected communities while the 99% fights each other and starves.

Garlsworth,,,"EDIT: As for items, Woeful belt gives +2 balance and Innocent cry gives +1 crit. These are currently the Best In Slot. The Dulla raid also introduced a ring set that gives balance.

Not sure if EU has it, but the current event in NA gives you a buff after you complete 5 battles that adds around 700 attack/m.attack, 5 speed, and 3 crit. That's 8 tech that gets added on.

There are also Ein Lacher battles you can try. Getting gold (not getting hit at all) on all the battles will give you extra stats. For example, completing all the Ein Lacher solo raids (Giant, Thor, Regina, etc.) should give you some base stats and +1 to balance and crit. There are other milestones on the way that give +1 balance too.

Redeemer battles like Neamhain also give some nice stats. However, you'd have to run it around 50+ times to get any of the good stat bonuses.

If you have a ton of AP and haven't maxed your character out yet, putting points into WIL (willpower) boosts crit. However, it's not a lot, but it can help. I don't have the exact calculation, but going from rank A WIL to whatever max was got me like 1 crit.

#GulfTensions
The Emiratis can intervene in the region's conflicts, install dictators, and arrange coups. They can apply maximum force. They will never, however, govern with consent

Future generations of historians will study the times we live in out of a particular, if morbid, curiosity.  

They will puzzle over why it was that we left intact the banking system that created that the crash of 2008, an event that was to repeat itself on a bigger scale.

They will examine the meltdown of social democracy and liberalism. They will ask themselves why Muslims were targeted in Europe and why terrorism was recast as a monopoly of Islam; they will study the speeches of ministers who saw Trojan horses where none existed.

 We know what has died - the theory of liberal interventionism, after the military fiascos of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, but what replaces it? 
A future Edward Gibbon, writing about the “Decline and Fall of the Western Empire,” will scrutinise other symptoms of malaise - the volatility of public opinion; the outbreak of identity politics, the application of incoherent tests of citizenship, the obsessive compulsive reliance on past heroics (Battle of Britain, Dunkirk); the anxiety about the future. 

They will ponder the US withdrawal from the Middle East and the shrinking of Britain. 

Much of this can be seen without the benefit of hindsight. To take just one line of inquiry, is there such a thing as British foreign policy? Can you define it? Do we even have a foreign minister?

John Kerr, former head of the diplomatic service and former ambassador to the US and Brussels, does not seem to think we have. In an excoriating demolition of the current government this week, he shredded Boris Johnson for saying and doing nothing. 

“Why are we silent while President Trump refuses to rule out military action against Venezuela? Or threatens trade measures against China? Or rages against the nuclear agreement with Iran which we helped to negotiate? Where do we stand on the Saudi/Qatari crisis? Are we still relaxed about the Saudis bombing cholera-struck Yemen?” Kerr wrote.

What indeed is the policy? We know what has died - the theory of liberal interventionism, after the military fiascos of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, but what replaces it? Does policy on Saudi Arabia merely consist of keeping tens of thousands of jobs going at BAE? 

Back to the future

In practice, much of the traffic and influence runs the other way. No longer does Britain scour the world for raw materials, as China does today. It does the reverse. Britain sells its raw material - land prices in London - to emerging markets and former colonies. That is what the London Borough of Haringey has just done with the biggest urban redevelopment in Europe

For centuries, national politics were manipulated openly by colonial powers from their embassies in vast tracts of the world. British colonial policy in the Gulf consisted of replacing difficult sheikhs with docile ones. Now, however, this relationship is being reversed. Their ambassadors lecture us in the same way our ambassadors used to lecture them.

To Russian eyes, the claims of US security establishment that Moscow interfered in the US presidential elections carries a heavy irony
To Russian eyes, the claims of the US security establishment that Moscow interfered in the US presidential elections carries a heavy irony. What was post-Soviet Russian politics about if not for a doomed American attempt to mould Boris Yeltsin’s Russia in its image? That went on for a decade under the veil of democracy promotion and state building. When it failed, Washington even asked itself the question of how it had “lost” Russia.

Sensing the inner decay in Washington similar to the one which doomed the Soviet Union, the master tactician Vladimir Putin has reversed the trend. Like it or not, Putin’s former Russian ambassador to Washington, the gregarious Sergei Kislyak, became a political player in Washington. 

Yousef Otaiba still is. Like Kislyak, Otaiba, as the UAE ambassador to the US, sees himself as a power player in his host nation. He can place uncritical encomiums to Mohammed bin Salman in the New York Times and the Washington Post. He can grab parts of Trump’s presidential schedule. He can arrange secret meetings with the president. He can poison the reputation of bin Salman’s rival cousin.

Otaiba sees the dimensions of his job as being very much bigger than merely representing a tiny Gulf state, the United Arab Emirates.

For one thing, he has spent most of his energy promoting a prince from another country, Mohammed bin Salman, the future Saudi king, whereas the Saudi embassy has been almost totally passive and out of the loop.

For another, Otaiba has huge ambition. It is to construct a plausible narrative in which his tiny state, through money and proxies, takes over the US role in the Middle East as America retreats to confront China in the Pacific.

Otaiba already thinks his master, Mohammed bin Zayed, has got control of Saudi Arabia with the rise of the young prince, the ideal ball of soft wax on which to imprint Emirati designs. That is being replicated in Yemen, where a split between the Houthis and the former dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh plays into Emirati hands.

They need this to happen in Libya, and they have already switched sides in Syria. The Arab world will soon be dominated by like-minded dictatorships.

The real threat

The words that Otaiba uses in his emails to cloak a future Emirati seaborne empire - the ports that stretch from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal - are pure sham. He talks of a Middle East dominated by secular governments. He said to PBS’s Charlie Rose: “What we would like to see is more secular, stable, prosperous, empowered, strong governments.”

In reality, the Gulf’s absolute monarchies use Islam and imams to endorse dictatorship even more than political Islamists do. Bin Salman picked a very important night in the Islamic calendar to receive allegiance as the new crown prince, and of course it happened in Mecca. It was the 27th night of Ramadan, Laylat al-Qadr, the night of power when prayers are magnified in importance a thousand times.

In reality, the Gulf’s absolute monarchies use Islam and imams to endorse dictatorship even more than political Islamists do
Rival preachers are cast as terrorists - but not because their interpretation of Islam is more extreme. It's their moderation the Saudi clerics fear.

One of the objects of Emirati (and Israeli) ire comes in the form of an eminent Muslim Brotherhood scholar, Yousef al-Qaradawi, who lives in Doha. Qaradawi is no social liberal. He is not about to embrace homosexuality or Western feminism. But it is not those qualities that have put him on the Saudi terror list.

In May 2008, Qaradawi issued a fatwa permitting the building of churches in Muslim countries. He said it is allowed in Islam and Muslims have to respect and protect them.

Qaradawi has been attacked ever since for betraying sharia texts. In May 2008, Sheikh Abdallah bin Mani’, a member of the Committee of Senior Scholars, wrote that the building of churches should be considered an act of collaboration in committing sin and aggression.

He wrote: “Our Messenger was explicit in saying that there shall not be two religions in the Arabian Peninsula."" He is quoted in the same narration as saying: “Remove them from the Arabian Peninsula ... There is no doubt that the states of the Arabian Peninsula are strong, well-placed and independent when it comes to internal affairs. Therefore, I consider allowing the existence of any temple that is not Islamic does indeed constitute a violation and a contradiction of the directive made by the Messenger of Allah peace be upon him.”

In March 2012, Abd al-Aziz Abdallah al-Sheikh, the chairman of the committee of senior scholars, and Saudi mufti took up the same theme. He was asked to rule on calls by the Kuwait’s parliament to demolish churches.

He replied: “Kuwait is part of the Arabian Peninsula where all churches should be demolished since approving the existence of those churches would amount to approving a religion other than Islam.""

This Saudi ruling continues to this day. From the website of Saudi Sheikh Salih bin Fawzan al-Fawzan: “As for the Arabian Peninsula, it is not permissible in it to keep any churches or other temples because it is the source of the mission, the source of Islam.”

Chasing legitimacy 

For how long will Washington swallow the argument that the Emiratis and Saudis are fighting terrorism? 

In 2004, George Tenet, former CIA director, told the 9/11 commission of the time when they had to call off a suspected air strike against Osama bin Laden, because in his words “you might have wiped out half the royal family in the UAE in the process"".

In Yemen, the UAE is continuing to use al-Qaeda proxies to undermine the Islah party in the besieged rebel stronghold of Taiz. A confidential UN report on Yemen by a panel of experts reporting to the UN Security Council highlighted the emergence of the Salafi anti-Houthi commander in Taiz, Sheikh Abu al-Abbas. 

The report read: ""Abu al-Abbas receives direct financial and material support from the UAE. His strategy in Taiz is to engage the Houthis as his primary target, whilst constraining al-Islah’s political and military influence. His direct engagement of the Houthis means that he has allowed the spread of AQAP [al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] elements within the city as a force multiplier.""

What makes Qaradawi a threat to the ruling elites has nothing to do with Islam. It is the fact he provides an alternative reading and that the Muslim Brotherhood continues to have democratic legitimacy.

I'm not saying complete 100% ban but ppl from those countries should be subjected to more rigorous vetting than a Japanese person because those societies are not equal in terms of potential danger. We should only admit those who share western values, want to be free, reject blasphemy laws and other such nonsense, are educated, understand our culture, yada yada. If they tick those boxes and speak the language, they're welcome regardless of where they're from.

This system already exists. European nations don't just let people in. Immigration to Europe is very difficult. The current problem in Europe is the lax asylum system, not the immigration system. Also weak EXTERNAL borders in Europe are contributing to the problem. Nationalistic movements in Europe are focusing on national borders, when national borders aren't the issue. The issue is the external European borders, they ned to be reinforced. 

Share western values? This would exclude India, China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, all of Africa, all of the Middle East, all of Southeast Asia. It would also exclude Russia, as Russia certainly can not claim to be ""Western"". People from these countries are already subjected to more vetting.

&gt; We should only admit those who share western values, want to be free, reject blasphemy laws and other such nonsense, are educated, understand our culture, yada yada. If they tick those boxes and speak the language, they're welcome regardless of where they're from.

The thing about this moral or cultural litmus test is that it makes no sense. These people could just lie. Best thing to do is to have strong laws that discourage religious law, etc. This includes by the way, native Christian religious groups. If you have strong laws against things like Sharia, Biblical law, Rabbinic law, they will melt away very quickly I guarantee you. If all they have to do is ""tick a box"" then it is not an effective control. You need effective internal laws an culture. From what I understand in places like Sweden we still have people who want MORE religious influence in the law and government.

&gt; After serving a sentence, yes.

Then we simply disagree. What you are advocating is an immigration/criminal system similar to what the UAE has. I simply disagree with this. 

&gt; I'd love to see some stats on that as well as sample size to determine if it's statistically significant (if you had 3 immigrants from Yemen and they didn't commit a crime, you can't extrapolate that to the whole population). I obviously painted with a broad brush and of course there are variations between countries, that goes without saying.

I am not extrapolating the whole population. For example in the USA certain Middle Easterners like Iranians, Indians, certain Asians (which you would probably consider 3rd world), have much higher education and income levels then average native white americans, and far lower levels of crime. You would be hard pressed to find an Iranian in jail in the USA. Yet it is FULL of blacks, hispanics, and whites in jail for rape, murder, drug dealing, robbery, you name it.

I don't necessarily disagree with what you are saying, but the way you present it clearly indicates some sort of prejudice. For every bad example of some group in Europe I can show you many more good ones.

spectemur,,,"Mr. Soros - and by ""Mr. Soros"" I refer to both George himself and the rest of his ilk; I use ""Mr. Soros"" as a catch all term for the ""Players of the Great Game"" - is a currency manipulator and chaos trader, primarily. These people make their money by constructing artificial economic bubbles then shorting all of their investment in those bubbles, causing economies to tumble in the process but ensuring a mighty war haul for themselves... as well as the opportunity to sweep in and gobble up the rubble they leave in their wake on the dirt cheap.

Now, imagine you were one of these people... would there be a more tantalizing and irresistible target than the Euro? A completely arbitrary  - read as; ripe for plunder - and unstable pan-national monetary union built of composite nations which are - by their nature, for thousands upon thousands of years - predisposed to ethno-nationalism, much as they might deny it. The Euro is a house of hay; it would require only the lightest huff-and-puff from a Big Bad Wolf to send the entire thing tumbling and resurrect dozens of new - and in their infancy *exploitable* - currencies from the wreckage. Why, if one were to know *exactly* when the Euro were going to collapse - because they *caused* it to collapse - and they had rather large investments *in* the Euro they could make TRILLIONS from manipulating that downfall to their ends, could they not?

THAT is the ""turning over of Europe."" George Soros does not aspire to white genocide or the ethnic displacement of native European peoples. He has no interest in such moral questions at all. The Arab and the African? They are nothing more than a huff-and-puff; a gust of wind cast against the house of hay. These opportunistic welfare leeches - who right now consider themselves conquerors - have been ferried into the world's largest trap. They've been sent to Europe EXPLICITLY to trigger their own genocide and have the European Union torn apart with their own slaughter; a sacrifice of tens of millions in the pursuit of profit. 

The Eurocrats? They go along with all of this in part because the Sorosites *own* them but also in part because they - foolishly - suspect the coming storm will be a pretext by which they can enforce martial law and solidify their own power... they are wrong. They are so blind in their technocratic, atomized arrogance that they do not realize that when the ""turning"" begins the vast bulk of their military will defect and march with the Far Right against the Arab and African. They too are walking into the biggest trap ever laid. 

TL;DR: Soros is not actually opposed to the Alt-Right... he *needs* them for his plan to fully come to fruition; he needs them to topple the Euro so that he can make bank on the emergence of dozens of new currencies. Soros *wants* the far right to win... but he wants them to win *dramatically*. He *wants* the Crusade and all the blood soaked, chaos-forged gold that comes with that. That is why - the *only* reason why - the Alt-Right is as censored as it is; it is an endeavor in bottling up rage to the point it becomes blind in its blood frenzy. I suspect that within six to twenty four months - when he feels he has enough ""kindling"" put in place by NGO boats - Soros will move on to the second phase of his plan; sparking the match. 

... actual TL;DR: George Soros is trying to incite an Ethno-Nationalist backlash that destroys the European Union but *specifically* destroys the Euro so that he can make massive, MASSIVE amounts of money by cashing all his chips just before he sets things off *and* by swooping down during the aftermath to feast upon virginal currencies that emerge in place of the Euro.

Heathens9,,,"&gt; You've proved jack shit other than the fact that you're a troll who just argues with people, which was already proven by going through your comment history.

Um, dude, you are guy who says he hasn't proved anything, despite yourself sticking to an argument consisting of, *""We don't know anything, it's all speculation, and too many different reports to come to conclusions,""* notions. 

&gt; So I'm not going to continue this debate when you're going to continue to be insulting, and not back up your claims with substantiated evidence.

Not backing up his claims with evidence? He's actually right. 

The Directors Guild of America allows only one director on a film. Unless this is the Coen brothers, or the Russo brothers directing Justice League, Whedon doesn't have the legal right to reshoot a substantial amount of the Justice League film. Like CookLove said, Whedon directing a practically whole new film is **being** the director of the movie since he is **directing** a large portion of it. The DGA wouldn't even allow this to happen in the first place, so it never took place anyway. Whedon film some scenes, probably some action scenes, and may have changed the ending. Heck, the last 15 minutes of the movie may be all Whedon. That's significant enough.

**But in no way has Whedon directed as much as you appear to believe, simply because the amount YOU believe, would be in direct violation of DGA rules concerning one director, one vision films.** 

And by the way, reshoots never take two or three months. That's just unheard of. Mamoa has been busy filming Aquaman in Australia, Ezra Miller has been busy filming Fantastic Beasts 2 in England, and Henry Cavill has been busy filming MI6 in Paris and other parts of Europe. 

Ok, those are very buys schedules. if Mark Hughes said that the reason reshoots took a long time was because certain actors weren't available, and it was mostly a waiting game until they were available, why is that so hard to believe??? It makes complete sense, and is completely logical. Maybe they had a scene they needed to shoot starring Batman and Flash, Ezra became available and shot that. But Aquaman makes an appearance in the scene and has lengthy dialogue, but Mamoa wouldn't be available for one week, so they cut, packed up, and took a week off until Jason became available so they can finish that said scene. I mean, it's not so hard to believe. 

These are all valid points, especially the one about the DGA rules and not allowing another director to direct a virtually whole new film that encompasses everything but action sequences. Heck, Tony Gilroy didn't even do that (making a virtually whole new film around the already shot actions scenes) during the extensive Rogue One reshoots. Most of Gareth Edward's dialogue and action scenes (sans a lot of the third act action scenes) remained intact. 

The DGA has upmost authority on **who** comes on to direct and how much. You break any of their rules, and the director(s) and studio face serious consequences. You honestly think Snyder, Whedon and Warner Brothers would actually take that risk? 

It's kind of like you are in denial here. This is evidence, but you seem to not want to accept it. ",True,False,,0,1504287914,,1504306580,0,dmfmlk0,False,t3_6wtgso,t1_dmf90cn,1506406562,1,False,DC_Cinematic,t5_2ykm6,
commentator9876,,,"So Ive been on vacation for a week and not redditing. Just as a short follow up, yes, the EU does some zero-tariff deals. Pretty much exclusively on raw materials that aren't available within the EU. Yes, a few lucky countries get ""All-but-Arms"" deals, but those countries are the sort that have barely-functional governments, much less an export industry.

The key thing here is *what* the EU will import. Take coffee beans. Kenco make much of how they source beans from sustainable farms in Colombia and Brazil, and how they fund programmes to keep kids out of gangs and teach them to grow coffee. Those beans are zero-rated into the EU because you can't grow coffee in any EU state.

Now that is very commendable, except you don't grow an economy on the back of raw materials or farming. The economy grows from the value-add.

The moment those beans look like they've been even slightly processed, they attract ~8% import duty to protect Nestle's European roasting facilities.

It would make much more sense to roast and process beans into instant coffee near the source - you're not shipping pulp and water across the Atlantic (reduced carbon/costs per kg of end product), labour is cheaper in Colombia than Europe, etc. But the EU makes damn sure that those countries are heavily dis-incentivised from developing actual industry.

It's a form of economic imperialism ""You provide raw materials - beans, food, metal ore. Us big boys over here will do the refining and manufacturing"".

If the EU gave a shit about developing Africa or developing nations, they wouldn't pump aid into those countries (which invariably comes back to the first world - buy a computer for a school - aid money just *transits* through the ""beneficiary"").

If the EU wanted to develop the Third World, they'd drop tariffs and nurture their economy and industry. *The only way to develop an economy is to buy their stuff* - aid does nothing.

But the EU won't do that, because the EU is not a beneficent organisation. It is a Customs Union by-and-for it's members.

They still got by when the US dollar dropped a few years back. In a case like that they were still in the same position in regards to trade with Europe or Asia (except for the increased competition from American companies who were now cheaper). The separate economies allowed Canada to weather the great recession far better than the US and much of Europe. 

To get Canada into an economic union with the US more so than NAFTA provides would require serious concessions by the US that they would never make.

bananarepubliccat,,,"No. Basically, they calculate how much everyone in the UK produced in the year and then look at what everyone in the UK consumed in the same year (i.e. food, clothes) and then work out the ratio. You can get numbers for debt and stuff (i.e. what is the value of all mortgages in the UK) but they can be hard to understand because, in today's economy, people buy and sell large amounts of financial assets across borders which may not reflect actual activity (for example, a bank in Europe might take advantage of a high 3m interest rate in the UK and move £50bn across and move it back in three months) so that is why people tend to look at the savings ratio, which is more stable and better reflects underlying fundamentals.

You are right though, the income of an individual can change rapidly from year to year but these are figures for the whole of the UK. So when you had a sudden expense, this was income for someone else (in most cases). These numbers can be very volatile but that is often due to volatility in business investment (which is driven by savings or the 1.5% in this ratio). Consumer spending patterns in aggregate (but not for individuals) is often relatively stable (people need fuel, they need clothes, they need food regardless).
