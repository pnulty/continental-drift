Now that I think about it, I can see another foil to Chloe: Meditation XVII by John Donne: 


&gt; No man is an island entire of itself; every man 

&gt; is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 

&gt; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 

&gt; is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 

&gt; well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 

&gt; own were; any man's death diminishes me, 

&gt; because I am involved in mankind. 

&gt; And therefore never send to know for whom 

&gt; the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 


And the reason why I bring this up (ignoring the obvious symbolism of Chloe accepting people again) is because the comparison between Donne's narrator and Prospero has been made before, by British writer Neil Gaiman in the final issue of The Sandman. 


At the start of the comic, Shakespeare and Morpheus had struck a bargain: in exchange for two plays, Morpheus would provide Shakespeare with the power to give men dreams that would live on after you were gone.' During this issue, Morpheus (The King of Stories) and William Shakespeare are toasting the end of Shakespeare's career. Shakespeare, wondering why such a creature as Morpheus would grant a mortal such as he this gift, and why Morpheus asked for the plays he did (A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest), asks his patron. Morpheus replies: 


&gt; 'I wanted a tale of graceful ends. I wanted a play about a king who drowns his books, and breaks his staff, and leaves his kingdom. About a magician who becomes a man. About a man who turns his back on magic.' (We'll get to that in a minute)

&gt; 'But why?' Shakespeare asks. 

&gt; 'That is not your concern, Will.'

&gt; 'Not my concern? I gave you twenty years. I wrote your plays... I have earned an answer to my question. Why?'

&gt; 'Because I will never leave my island.'

&gt; 'You live on an island?'

&gt; 'I am... In my fashion... An Island...'

&gt; 'But that can change. All men can change.'

&gt; 'I am not a man.'

&gt; 'But...'

&gt; 'And I do not change.' 


So, if we can think of Morpheus as giving us one interpretation on Prospero, then we can actually see some neat little similarities between him and Chloe. Like Prospero, Chloe is trapped in an idyllic location (the island for Prospero, Arcadia Bay for Chloe) against her will after a great tragedy (Prospero's brother's treachery and Chloe's father's death)with a small support system to support her/cast of characters. While these equivalencies aren't perfect, they do make a lot of sense. 


Playing the part of Ariel, we have the innocent and almost feminine Elliot. 

For Miranda, the family member trapped with our hero, we have Joyce. 

Playing the role of Caliban, the deformed creature who tried to rape Miranda, we have David Madsen. (Not that I'm accusing David of attempted rape, but from Chloe's POV I'd imagine any kind of penetration would be thought of as a kind of assault). 


But what of Prospero's magic? What's Chloe's magic? Her rage (which in BTS is expressed in her ability to backtalk) and her belief that she is the one who controls her own destiny. 


Okay, so we've got some equivalencies. So what? Well, what I'm edging towards is the idea that the central theme of Before the Storm (and possibly Life is Strange itself, from Chloe's point of view) is not so much Rachel and Chloe's relationship (although that's a big part of it) but rather Chloe, like Morpheus, looking for ways in which she can change and escape Arcadia Bay and learning that she is 'not an island' so to speak. 


Now, although I suspect this might start a flame war, I don't think it's Rachel that teaches Chloe this. Chloe is certainly older in Life is Strange, but between Awaken and Chrysalis she hadn't really grown as a person. But between Chrysalis and Dark Room we do see a lot of character growth: she gains empathy (for Kate Marsh), admits that she really loves her mom and doesn't want to see Arcadia Bay turned to glass, lets go of her rage, and is able to really articulate (possibly for the first time ever) how upset she was about her dad's death. By the end of the game, Chloe really has changed for the better. And it's only because of this change that Chloe can finally leave - whether that is with Max, loved and loving in turn, or through the veil of tears and into the kingdom of death. 


And for one final equivalency, just because it's so juicy: 

What heralds Prospero's growth? The sudden re-appearance of his brother, Antonio, after a storm. 

What heralds Chloe's growth? The sudden re-appearance of her best friend, Max, after a vision of a storm. 


Now, I have no idea if Rachel has any powers or not, but I really do like this idea, and it was **hella** fun brainstorming this. I just hope somebody reads it.

Kahing,,,"&gt; Are you sure you have read it?

Yes. That's talking about international *criminal* law. Go back to Kent's essay. As he explains, when it comes to international treaties, it's a long-standing principle that ex-post facto law does not apply unless specifically stated so. Therefore, the Fourth Geneva Convention and other treaties that did not specify an ex post facto clause did not apply retroactively as per CIL.

&gt;For the ratione temporis argument there is no difference between when a court assumes jurisdiction and when a newly created law is said to begin to apply. Citing myself:

Except that that's not how it works. The reason the Greeks had a right of return to Northern Cyprus was because international law mandating the right of return of refugees already existed in 1974. Refugees who became refugees before a right of return was recognized as a legal right don't count. Kent specifically argues that had such international laws mandating the right of return existed at the time, then yes, they would have been entitled to return, but because they didn't, later laws that were made today, even while there are still refugees, don't count. In other words, because the refugees were displaced at a time when no obligation to return them existed, that sticks, despite currently existing laws that mandate the return of refugees, which only apply to refugees after that had come into effect. That's Kent's interpretation, which he explicitly lays down at the conclusion, and i'll personally go with the interpretation of a Professor of Law at Fordham University Law School over yours, if that's alright with you. If we were to adopt your legal standard, we'd have descendants of refugees going back centuries claiming rights of return to various places.

&gt;And let me quote Julius Stone:

See [this](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/articles/retroactive/2.shtml) and [this](http://guide-humanitarian-law.org/content/article/3/non-retroactivity/) and [this](https://www.revistas.usp.br/rfdusp/article/viewFile/66677/69287), which openly says that those believing in retroactivity are outnumbered by those who believe it's illegal, and that arguments for retroactivity are not favored by most jurists. As you can see, the principle of non-retroactivity is even **mentioned in the Geneva Conventions**. To sum it up, retroactivity is a minority viewpoint. And Stone is talking about criminal law anyway, not treaties. 

Oh, and as a side note, Julius Stone was one of the premier legal scholars who argued that Israeli settlements are perfectly legal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. As in, *all* Israeli settlers are there legally, not just the ones  exercising a hypothetical right of return to original homes.

&gt;It wasn't the allied powers that drew up the 4thGC, it was human rights lawyers from the Red Cross. They then wrote a 1000 page long book detailing exactly how they thought that the convention should be interpreted.

You mean human rights lawyers *and* government experts, and the fact that it had to be approved in a diplomatic conference in Geneva by 63 governments. ([Source](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/360?OpenDocument)). And the fact that the Allied powers all signed and ratified them. There's no way they would have done so had they believed they were reversing their own policies.

&gt;If it wasn't well established, how do you explain the outrage from the international community against the expulsion of the Palestinians? Rampant Antisemitism?

What outrage are you talking about? You mean how aside from some half-hearted pressure the whole issue was mostly dropped? I've never read of any widespread international outrage aside from that in the Arab and Muslim world. Some pressure, sure, but nothing too serious. The world was actually undergoing quite a few mass population movements at the time, it was actually peanuts in comparison to what had just happened in Europe and East Asia and what was going on on the Indian subcontinent.

&gt;That was in 1922, which was before many important developments in human rights had occurred.

Exactly. Thanks for proving my point. So you admit that right of return was not an international legal principle throughout the past centuries?

&gt;Because he represents CAMERA and is not a scholar.

So a Harvard PhD who was a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University, an instructor at Harvard, and someone whose published articles in multiple academic journals, lectured widely, and testified before the US Congress is not a scholar? Good to know.

&gt;And my reply:

Go back. Did you even read what I wrote? I already showed how Kent outlined how the Hague Conventions did not apply to the 1948 war. It began as a civil war (IE the Hague Conventions didn't apply), and since almost all of the Palestinian refugees either fled in advance of or were displaced during active combat operations and takeovers, before pre-state Yishuv forces or Israeli forces had solidified the occupation of their home, territory, as well as the fact that they were not occupying territory from a hostile state, the Hague Conventions did not apply to them. As a British officer he cited said, it was specifically designed to deal with events *after* military occupation of the territory of a hostile state had been solidified. To quote Kent: *""Any refugees who were expelled during the
period of combat, or before combat began, are not protected by the
Hague rules on belligerent occupation. The great majority of
Palestinian refugees appear to have fled prior to or during combat
operations, not after the establishment of control by the Yishuv’s
armed units.""*",True,False,,0,1504224283,,1504246730,0,dmehx26,True,t3_6wqfua,t1_dmecwwb,1504556750,1,False,IsraelPalestine,t5_2sgz7,
magic-moose,,,"The residential schools have been called a form of ""cultural genocide"" (i.e. forced assimilation), which is *not* the same thing as ""genocide"".  Unfortunately, a lot of people (including CBC) casually accuse MacDonald of ""genocide"", which is inaccurate.  

The case can be made that MacDonald was a willing architect of forced cultural assimilation.  He did not view natives as sub-human and even had native friends.  However, he did view traditional native culture as something preventing them from successfully integrating with the rest of Canadian society.  In MacDonald's era, natives raised as traditional hunter-gatherers had insufficient territory to be self-supporting and had to be supported by the state. Natives who integrated with European culture were a lot more likely to be productive citizens *by European standards*.  We now consider this culturally insensitive attitude to be deeply wrong, but it's not the same thing as believing race made natives inferior and then deliberately setting out to kill them all.  

If you care one whit about accuracy, you can call John A Macdonald a proponent of *cultural* genocide.  If you care two whits or more, you'll probably use the term ""forced assimilation"" instead, because it's a lot less likely to be contracted to something that's outright false by those who don't care about accuracy.   

Edit: It is worth noting that genocide has happened on Canadian soil.  e.g. The Thule wiped out the Dorset, quite literally, [without any genetic remnants to indicate interbreeding or assimilation](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/dorset-dna-genes-trace-tale-arctics-long-gone-hobbits-n191156).  Sadly, genocide has not been an infrequent occurrence in history.  It has happened everywhere, and it's likely that the ancestors of any living population wiped out some other population at some point in the past.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Anatolia_Region

&gt;Starting from 1880 the name Armenia was forbidden to be used in official Ottoman documents. The government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II replaced the name Armenia with such terms as ""Kurdistan"" or ""Anatolia"". The Sublime Porte was trying to cover up the Armenian Question; if there was no Armenia, then there was no Armenian Question. The process of “nationalization” of toponyms was continued by the Kemalists, who were the ideological successors of the Young Turks, and gained momentum during the Republican period. Starting from 1923 the entire territory of Western Armenia was officially renamed “Eastern Anatolia” (literally The Eastern East). In the 17th century when the Armenian Question was not as yet included into the international diplomacy agenda, the terms ""Anatolia"" or ""Eastern Anatolia"" were never used to indicate Armenia. Furthermore, the ""Islamic World Map"" of the 16th century and other Ottoman maps of the 18th and 19th centuries have clearly indicated Armenia (Ermenistan) on a specific territory as well as its cities. Armenia, together with its boundaries, was unequivocally mentioned in the works of earlier Ottoman historians and chroniclers until the end of the 19th century. Kâtip Çelebi, a famous Ottoman chronicler of the 17th century, had a special chapter titled “About the Country Called Armenia” in his book Jihan Numa. When, however, this book was republished in 1957, its modern Turkish editor H. Selen changed this title into “Eastern Anatolia”. Osman Nuri, a historian of the second half of the 19th century, mentions Armenia repeatedly in his three-volume Abdul Hamid and the Period of His Reign. The word Anatolia means “sunrise” or “east” in Greek. This name was given to the Asia Minor peninsula approximately in the 5th or 4th centuries B.C. During the Ottoman era, the term Anadolou included the north-eastern vilayets of Asia Minor with Kyotahia as its center. The numerous European, Ottoman, Armenian, Russian, Persian, Arabic and other primary sources did not confuse the term Armenia with Anatolia. This testifies, inter alia, to the fact that even after the loss of its statehood the Armenian nation still constituted a majority in its homeland, which was recognized by Ottoman occupiers as well.[3]",True,False,,0,1504225514,,False,0,dmeiw58,True,t3_6x9k62,t1_dmeibc0,1504557224,8,False,MapPorn,t5_2si92,

I've traveled a lot within South America, and lived there for a bit. IMO, these are the main contributing factors:

* Infrastructure (my Colombians friends fly rather than drive because 200KM in Colombia can mean 6-8 hours)
* LATAM's Monopoly on inter-South America travel (this is more of an issue outside of Colombia and Brazil which have very liberalized airline markets)
* Ignorance; people at least in Canada and the United States still have this idea that they're going to be kidnapped by drug gangs or get eaten by a snake or something when countries like Chile, Uruguay and Argentina are generally as developed as Eastern European ones
* Cost of flights to South America. Chicago to Buenos Aires is basically the same distance as Chicago to Athens but it's often cheaper to fly to Europe
* Visa policies: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia (and formerly Chile) generally imposed either visa requirements or ""Reciprocity (aka Retaliation) Fees""

The good news is a lot of this is changing, except for infrastructure. Argentina is getting a number of Low Cost Carriers in the coming years, Brazil dumped visas for the Olympics which enticed many Americans, Argentina has stopped collecting the rep. fee from Americans, Chile has joined VWP and Uruguay and Argentina are on track to as well, and even Low Cost South American carriers have begun flights to the United States such as VivaColombia and Avianca Brasil, and Avianca Brasil is also expanding it's presence in South America outside of Brazil too.

To the best of my knowledge Bernie has **never** proposed any kind of health-care reform that eliminated profit from healthcare (not even HR 676, commonly described as a 'Medicare for all' proposal, proposes that, though it does eliminate profit from investor-owned health-care providers which is itself a significant step beyond the simple change to a single-payer system that 'Medicare for all' is commonly characterized as).

But even if Bernie is only proposing a single change to a single-payer system that should still reduce the health-care premiums of anyone currently using private insurance (i.e., now under Obamacare) by around 20%, that being the difference between the overall overhead of single-payer and that of private insurance.

That is, of course, an average net saving for the country - exactly how it is distributed across the population (and what additional revenues or revectoring of existing revenues in the form of subsidies might be raised to make that distribution more progressive) sounds more like what you're talking about, and we could certainly debate just how important reducing rates for people in the $100K-ish income group is (I tend to consider it far less important than keeping far less fortunate people alive but still a worthwhile endeavor given how radically unequal our current income distribution is, though even there one could debate whether that radical skew would be better addressed by re-introducing far more progressivity into our tax system than by the more circuitous, though perhaps more politically feasible, route of manipulating it indirectly through health-insurance policies).

Just to use the figures you claimed above, you should note that the 20% reduction in overall cost achieved by merely moving to a single-payer system gets us more than half way to the 2/3 cost per capita that you cited for European countries, so it's a definitely worthwhile step and relatively independent of just how those savings (and possible other revenues) are spread around.

olddoc,Belgium,Belgium,"If I can chip in here. I noticed in your other /askeurope thread a few days ago you mentioned you're in favour of state's rights. Well, here you can see how the EU is like state's rights on steroids. Even people in the EU don't realize how little power ""Brussels"" has, and it's incomparable to the power the federal government in Washington D.C. has. Just one example: the yearly entire budget of the EU for everything it does and infrastructure it subsidizes is 140B/year for 500 million citizens. For contrast: the yearly Belgian federal budget is 220B per year for 11 million Belgians. The EU is puny, and the vast spending power still lies with the member states, who all have a final say over everything the EU does in the European Council where each country has one vote, a bit like a senate.          
       
That's why I can only chuckle if some people claim Brussels is like the new USSR. The Commission doesn't even have the spending power of a small country like Belgium, let alone larger countries like the UK (€900B/year), France (€1 Trillion/y) or Germany (€1.5T/y).      
      
The EU is a collection of sovereign states, and you notice how if you think state's rights to its logical conclusion, that means having separate armies, and the Dutch person you're talking with follows that line of thought.

Annaeus,hatnorthmap,,"Obviously the correct answer will depend on what you value most. Hanoi has terrible pollution, terrible traffic, endemic corruption, poor food standards, and a questionable education system. But the UK is absurdly expensive, increasingly racist (Vietnam is too, but primarily against other Asians), bureaucratically obstructionist (Vietnam is too, but this is where the corruption actually works in your favour as you can pay to smooth things over), and is in the process of economically self-immolating.

I live with my wife in Hanoi, and we have a son. We will not be moving to the UK and I wouldn't seriously consider it for the following reasons:

We're wealthy here. I earn, in absolute terms, about the same as you do now. We live in a nice apartment, can afford vacations and small luxuries, and for the first time in my life I am actually able to save a significant amount of money. I would need to earn two or three times as much in the UK to be able to accomplish that. I actually looked at the statistics for income levels, and although we may not be in the top 1% of earners, we are in the top 5%.

Immigration is much simpler, faster, and cheaper than in the UK. We still complain about the paperwork, but processing is measured in days or weeks rather than in months or years like in the UK.

Our son has dual nationality (well, triple actually) and is growing up bilingual.

My wife is comfortable here and has extensive support from her family and friends. I can't overemphasize how important this is to her, and to us, even though I don't think she really appreciates how significant it is as she has never lived without it. And when she is comfortable and happy, so am I.

Life is simply so much more relaxed and stress-free. People notice the frenetic pace of life here, but that's only because the pace of life is overt, not hidden like in the UK. People rush around on the roads but if you're late paying a bill there's nobody sending letters that threaten to destroy your financial future. If your paperwork gets lost in the system, you just do it again and maybe pass someone a small amount of money to process it quickly - you don't get an automated letter ordering you to leave the country because someone forgot to check a box on their computer screen.

Amazon Prime is making a big deal about being able to deliver some items to some places the same day when you order online. In Vietnam that's simply the norm - place an order through Facebook chat and you can have someone delivering within the hour, cash on delivery.

My wife has said that she doesn't want our son growing up in Vietnam because she thinks the education system is bad. We may not quite have enough money to take advantage of private schools here, so she may have a point. But if we do move it won't be to the UK. I used to be a teacher in British schools and although they still have a better reputation they are less and less deserving of it every year and Vietnam is progressing rapidly on virtually every front. They have a long way to go because they started so far behind, but unlike many countries they are getting there fast.

You may want to consider moving to Vietnam for a few years and seeing how it works out for you. You always have the option of moving back to the UK. This would allow you to test out whether it works for you since your wife already has an idea of how well living in the UK works for her, get out of your job which it sounds like you hate and possibly fear as well, and avoid being in the UK when it sets itself on fire by leaving the EU under the direction of a bunch of unprepared incompetent ideologues. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always move back - possibly with a significant amount of money already saved up. Never underestimate how much stress and worry having a comfortable financial cushion immediately available relieves you of.

Oh, and you can get a CELTA in Vietnam - it will probably be cheaper too.

Basically, growing up in the UK you had a lot of privileges that people in Vietnam don't. I know that 'privilege' is a bad word, and you're supposed to check it on a regular basis, but the 'privileges' of a respected university degree (I'm assuming you have one because otherwise the calculus for everything else changes) and English as a native language are not something you can actually get rid of at this point, so you may as well take advantage of them.

syhbyz,,,"Han skal ikke sendes ""tilbage""(?) til Tyrkiet, han kan få en engangsbillet til Al-Bab i bedste tilfælde. Ellers må han flytte tilbage til sin resterende familie i Syrien. 

Og hvis han forsøger det der lort i Tyrkiet bliver han gennemtæsket af de lokale. Det tyrkiske folk har fået nok af syrere, og det er nået bristepunktet. Der skal ikke meget til, før det går virkeligt galt til dernede, og med galt mener jeg organiseret selvtægt i en meget omfattende grad, der kommer til at involvere uskyldige.

Det er efterhånden normalt at syriske drenge i Tyrkiet samles i grupper hvorefter de bruge aftenen/natten på at chikanere tyrkiske kvinder på gaden. Dog har de ikke nær så meget selvtillid som i Danmark, da der ikke skal meget til, før hele nabolaget løber ud på gaden på jagt efter dem. Der har også været mange sammenstød og mord, hævndrab osv. Ca. 450 tyrkere er blevet dræbt (primært stukket) af syriske ""flygtninge"" siden krigen startede. Typisk dræber de deres udlejer eller chef pga. penge. 

Selvfølgelig er de fleste ikke sådan, og dem jeg kender er meget civiliserede, men ligegyldigt antallet eller procentdelen af de rådne æbler, så sker det bare, at nogle af dem ikke kan opføre sig som mennesker. Og tyrkere er desværre ikke kendt for deres medmenneskelige tolerance eller tålmodighed overfor fremmede der opfører sig så svinsk, ulig Danmark og Sverige. 

Det er vel hvad man kan forvente når en vis idiot tager imod 3 millioner af dem, og holder dem i landet imod deres vilje, da EU har ondt i røven over at skulle dele byrden. Ret sikker på, at ""fængsle"" folk i sit land på den måde går imod et virvar af internationale love, men det siger vi vel ikke højt. /rant

To the best of my knowledge Bernie has **never** proposed any kind of health-care reform that eliminated profit from healthcare (not even HR 676, commonly described as a 'Medicare for all' proposal, proposes that, though it does eliminate profit from investor-owned health-care providers which is itself a significant step beyond the simple change to a single-payer system that 'Medicare for all' is commonly characterized as).

But even if Bernie is only proposing a single change to a single-payer system that should still reduce the health-care premiums of anyone currently using private insurance (i.e., now under Obamacare) by around 20%, that being the difference between the overall overhead of single-payer and that of private insurance.

That is, of course, an average net saving for the country - exactly how it is distributed across the population (and what additional revenues or revectoring of existing revenues in the form of subsidies might be raised to make that distribution more progressive) sounds more like what you're talking about, and we could certainly debate just how important reducing rates for people in the $100K-ish income group is (I tend to consider it far less important than keeping far less fortunate people alive but still a worthwhile endeavor given how radically unequal our current income distribution is, though even there one could debate whether that radical skew would be better addressed by re-introducing far more progressivity into our tax system than by the more circuitous, though perhaps more politically feasible, route of manipulating it indirectly through health-insurance policies).

Just to use the figures you claimed above, you should note that the 20% reduction in overall cost achieved by merely moving to a single-payer system gets us more than half way to the 2/3 cost per capita that you cited for European countries, so it's a definitely worthwhile step and relatively independent of just how those savings (and possible other revenues) are spread around.

TheCarlyleanHero,Socialist2,"Perón, Chávez, Vargas and Kirchner","&gt;Emotions might describe your voting behaviour, but some of us actually have well thought-out priorities.

You haven't refuted anything. 

&gt;Nonetheless, it was the natural progression of Marxist ideology.

How does one go from ""the contradictions of capitalism will lead to its collapse and its replacement by socialism"" to ""Socialism means re-educating wheat to yield more"". It is a complete non-sequitur. Where is the ""natural progression of Marxist ideology"" in this? Where did Marx even *imply* this? Why are you so dense? Have you ever read Marx? Why do you think that pseudo-science is something inherent to Marxism? Has 1930s capitalist Germany not crossed your mind? Or all of 19th century capitalist Europe with its barmy theories on race?

&gt;And objectivist agronomist would probably agree ideas cannot change material reality and base their research of reason and logic, rather than denouncing, say, genetics as ""bourgeois science"".

[That's pretty funny, because Objectivists don't believe in science.](http://aynrandcontrahumannature.blogspot.co.uk/2007/11/objectivism-and-descent-into.html?m=1)

&gt;The same way that followers of Marx continue to deny the reality of sexual dimorphism and race.

And yet they haven't had the slightest effect on the material reality of either of those things - their existence or non-existence being irrelevant. 

&gt;I guess I must be some sort of X-Man with the ability to alter my biology on the fly.

There's something called envionmental factors. I guess you're too dense to have heard of it.

&gt;Thankfully biology predisposes people not to hate people who abuse them?

It predisposes against the abuse in the first place. 

&gt;Your emotions don't predispose you to anything, as they're a product of your value system.

I sent you an article refuting this. You didn't read it and are repeating the same asinine nonsense again and again. When i make a point, have the intellectual honesty not to ignore it.

&gt;Just because you behave mindlessly doesn't mean everyone else does. 

The science is on my side. I win. Too bad Objectivists don't believe in science.

&gt;It's embarrassing that you didn't read what I wrote. A chemical does not have a sexual preference; it's not in a class of things that even possess sex, much less sexuality.

You know very much what I meant, but being an obtuse moron have deliberately decided to obfuscate the matter. 

&gt;By the way, why do you keep posting links to pop science journals and blogs? Too scared to go for the hard stuff?

[Not an argument.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy) I thought Objectivists knew how to argue with reason and logic.

&gt;No one said it did. It was part of a causal link.

Again, Das Kapital didn't cause the kulaks to be massacred. You are clearly implying it did whilst at the same time denying that that is what you are saying. Have some intellectual honesty.

&gt;No one said he did. Really, this evasiveness to the obvious causal effects of ideology is just making you look dumb.

You are a moron. Ideology is derived from material reality. Material reality is not caused by ideology.

&gt;Stalin didn't just fall out of the sky. 

Neither Marx nor his writings are responsible for producing Joseph Stalin. Stalin was forged in a country that was undergoing horrific turmoil and it left its mark on him, more than anything Marx could have said or done. Power-hungry individuals rising to power and using their power to cause suffering for millions is nothing inherent to Marxism. 

&gt;You've finally learned that ideas are the driving force behind history, not some random ""material forces"". 

That's not what I said you illiterate ignoramus.

&gt;Make your mind up. Capitalism is an idea. 

It is also a material reality in which we are living right at this very minute. Only an idiot would deny it.

&gt;Do ideas cause history or do material conditions cause history?

The latter. 

&gt;Capitalism caused Marxism to ""happen"", 

Yes, it did. Marx based his ideas on an observation of the material reality of capitalism. If there hadn't been a system called capitalism, there would have been no such thing as Marxism. 

&gt;Sort of like Africa. 

Russia is not Africa. It's a lot closer to the West. It has benefited historically from Western expertise in the form of military equipment, technology and immigrants. Peter the Great didn't build his army out of nothing.

&gt;Not quite, but he was responsible for communism and inspired the system that ruled it for seventy years.

He was responsible for describing what the material reality of communism would be like, but as it does not yet exist in material reality, he is not responsible for communism itself. And even if it did exist in material reality he still wouldn't because he was simply observing a historical process and not seeking to implement a pre-packaged ideal by forcing material reality to change in accordance with it. Russia was not communist for 70 years, it was state capitalist. 

&gt;You're being deliberately obtuse. I never said it did.

You're the one being obtuse.

thinkingdoing,,,"&gt;You're still one of those people that believe if the wind isn't blowing in Vic it's blowing in NSW. This simply isn't the case.

Quick google of the weather at this moment...

Brisbane sunny, wind 10km/h

Sydney partly cloudy, wind 6km/h

Melbourne mostly sunny, wind 21km/h

Adelaide partly cloudy, wind 18km/h

Your point is ""what if the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing across the entire continent"". Despite that being a near impossible situation, and the fact that solar panels work in cloudy weather, this is why you install more capacity than you need (which is still cheaper than nuclear) and install storage to pick up the slack (which is still cheaper than nuclear).

&gt; it means they're investing in an unproven technology but that's ok because everything was unproven at some stage. 

Investing in an unproven technology? Like how Finland invested in the latest generation of nuclear reactors provided by the supposed world experts in France and Germany.

[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant)

&gt;In February 2005, the Finnish cabinet gave its permission to TVO to construct a new nuclear reactor, making Finland the first Western European country in 15 years to order one. The construction of the unit began in 2005. The start of commercial operation was planned for 2010, but has been pushed back several times. As of August 2017, the estimate for start of production is December 2018.

Yes, you read that right. 8 YEARS LATE.

Not only that, it's already 3 TIMES OVER BUDGET.

&gt;In December 2012, Areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor will be about €8.5 billion, or almost three times the delivery price of €3 billion.

Keep in mind, that was 5 years ago. With the new delays that price would have jumped again.

Anyone who believes Australia could build a nuclear fission industry from scratch without encountering similar problems and delays is reckless and should not be anywhere near the tax payer chequebook.",True,False,,0,1504227799,,False,0,dmekqr6,True,t3_6x83o3,t1_dmej5mw,1506387949,2,False,australia,t5_2qh8e,

In linguistics and rhetoric, the historical present or historic present (also called dramatic present or narrative present) is the employment of the present tense when narrating past events. It is widely used in writing about history in Latin (where it is sometimes referred to by its Latin name, praesens historicum) and some modern European languages; in English it is used above all in historical chronicles (listing a series of events); it is also used in fiction, for ""hot news"" (as in headlines), and in everyday conversation (Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002: 129–131). In conversation, it is particularly common with ""verbs of communication"" such as tell, write, and say (and in colloquial uses, go) (Leech 2002: 7). ""Historic present"" is the form recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary, whereas ""historical present"" is the form in Merriam Webster.

So you have to be back at midnight. Last bus leaves for the ship at 11. Which is across town, so you gotta leave where you are at 1030. Not much time.

Also no visitors on the ship.

You either turn that extra management/wifi off, or buy your own router and DMZ/bridge the connection.

That said, you get what you pay for. Telus has native ipv6, Shaw does not, and anyone reselling/using Shaw's last mile, like Teksavvy who has ipv6, can't use ipv6 over Shaw. You can test it with http://ipv6-test.com/ 

You don't currently gain that much with ipv6 though you get some faster transit paths to California (eg Apple, Google) and Europe if ipv6 is available. So if you can get Fiber from Telus, there is little incentive to switch off it until Shaw rolls out ipv6, or someone else comes along and offers Fiber at half the cost. If you're stuck with xDSL on Telus/Primus/Teksavvy/etc the only incentive to stay on it is due to non-bonded channels have marginally better latency for MMO games, and that's not a huge selling point to sit on smaller bandwidth packages.

The catch with bridging the router is that many home routers don't support IPv6 either. Some of the Tomato-firmware routers do, but they crash if multicast is used (eg Telus Optik TV) which again goes back to you get what you pay for.

matsuriotoko,,,"&gt; More on topic, I don't see this being a boost for domestic soccer. 

Qualified for WC is not about J-League teams not being competitive and popular enough, or average wages being low. Just look at the impressive roster of this Japanese National Team. Most of them are playing at the internationally well-known clubs in Europe, and all of them (arguably except Honda) are home grown. And compared that with how shitty the Chinese National Team is doing at the WC Qualification right now, or any other international level matches.

Chinese tycoon brats are spending so much money importing well-known European or South American players and couches with more than their values, but Super League and Chinese Football Association seem to be so disassociated and don't even have a decent roadmap that they had completely failed to develop the international level players. 

J-League was founded only 25 years ago and it's worthy to be recognized that can develop high-level athletes. J-League may not be so popular and each player might not be payed well, but at least Japan is not wasting financial and human resources like China does. 

Champions League? Seriously. J-League teams are simply focusing more on the domestic competition and exhausting efforts by risking injuries at the no-so-prioritized CL is probably the least concern for Japanese clubs and players. I just don't see how J-League popularity would be raised up any better by winning CL.

Annaðhvort sat Gazeta á upplýsinginunum, eða þær tvær greinar sem þeir gáfu út í Janúar voru allt sem var hægt að mjólka úr efninu sem vestrænir fjölmiðlar voru ekki þegar búnir að fara í gegnum.
&gt; Ef þú ferð eftir tímalínuni á Wikipedia hvað varðar þennan leka þá gefur hún upp falska mynd. Viðtalið sem þeir segja að sé frá "" In late November, Assange stated,"" er frá 11 Nov. Hann var þá væntanlega að tala um lekana sem áttu eftir að koma út 22. nóv.
&gt; Þetta er fyrir mér þú að gera þér upp of miklar væntingar fyrir því hvað átti að koma fram í lekanum. Wikileaks gaf út efni sem varpaði ljósi á spillinguna og hvað þeim sem eru nákomnir Rússlandi finnst um Rússland. Eða átti efnið að knésetja ríkisstjórnina?

Þú ert þarna að gera það sem þú ásakar aðra um, kemur með tilgátur um hvernig hlutirnir séu, sem stenst ekki skoðun. 

[Wiki um diplómatasamskiptin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contents_of_the_United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak_(Europe\) ). Þessi leki var allt saman samskipti bandarískra diplómata við utanríkisráðuneytið, og því allt saman á ensku. Að það hafi þurft rússneska túlka er eitthvað sem er bara ímyndun í þér. Þeir virðast hafa fjallað um það innihald samskiptanna sem sneri að Rússlandi. Þar stendur líka að öll gögnin hafi verið gefin út í september, 2011. 

Nú, ef þú vilt halda því fram að wikipedia sé að misskilja, eða að wikipedia sé einn af þeim miðlum sem vildi Hillary í forsetann og sé því ómarktækur, þá ættu [eigin orð Novaya](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-southkorea-media-threat-idUSKCN1BB2J0) að taka af vafann um þetta. ""“The American diplomatic cables were just a small part of the whole WikiLeaks dossier,” Novaya Gazeta said on its website."" 

Þetta er greinilega ekki sami leki sem verið er að ræða, þó þú viljir lesa það úr þessu. 
Þetta breytir því heldur ekki að þú hélst því fram að Wikileaks hefði birt gögn sem sönnuðu einhverja skollaleiki, en þau gögn virðast annaðhvort ekki mikilvæg (sem gjaldfellir þá þau rök að sá leki sanni að WL séu eitthvað sérstaklega óvinveittir rússnesku ríkisstjórninni, ef gögnin voru það ómerkileg að öllum var sama), þau gögn hafa ekki verið birt ennþá, eða þá að WikiLeaks ýktu um innihaldið til að fá meiri athygli. 

&gt; Húsbóndatryggð þessa miðla sannast ekki á aðför þeirra að Assange heldur aðför þeirra að svo mörgum öðrum málum sem tengdust kosninguni. Ef þú telur að þessir miðlar voru ekki að ýta áfram Hillary sem frambjóðanda þá getum við skilið þann ágreining eftir hér. Það velti enginn því fyrir sér hverjir vinir Assange voru þegar hann gaf upplýsingar um Palin nema stuðningsmenn McCain. Ég sé þetta Hillary mál bara sem speglun af því

Orðið dálítið hvimleitt að svara einum punkt sem þú kemur með, en svo bakkarðu með hann í næsta svari og skilgreinir eitthvað nýtt. Kallast ""moving the goalposts"" og er almennt ekki talið góð rökræðuhefð, ég hef hringt á lögregluna undir eins. 
Þú varst að tala um að Wikileaks hefði ekki verið rætt í neikvæðu ljósi fyrr en það kom í ljós hve anti-Clinton þeir væru. Ég bendi þér á að það er fullt af umræðu um WL, góðri og slæmri, á undan því, og þá færirðu þig yfir í að þessir miðlar hafi verið að ýta Hillary fram sem frambjóðanda. 

Þú getur fundið fullt af neikvæðum og/eða gagnrýnum greinum um Hillary t.d. á [foreignpolicy](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/03/there-is-an-international-disease-which-is-hillary-clinton/ ) , en það er almennt talið conservative miðill. Það þarf heldur ekki að þýða að það sé einhver ""húsbóndatryggð"" í gangi eins og þú ásakar alla um, þó að einhverjum miðli finnist einn kostur af mörgum skástur.

&gt; Þú studdir þitt mál um Wikileaks sem pro-trump áróðursíðu með tveim megin punktum:

Þú ákveður að einblína á þessa tvo punkta sem greinin sem ég linkaði tiltekur og telur þig hafa afsannað þá, en virðist vera með einhverja gríðarlega valblindu á tweets og öll samskipti frá WikiLeaks, sem eru ekki hlutlaus birting á hlutdrægum gögnum.

[seldu Wikileaks bol sem gerði grín að Clinton](https://twitter.com/WikiLeaksShop/status/786618818919411712) og voru að tweeta um ýmsar samsæriskenningar tengdum þeim hjónum, en það var minna þannig um Trump á meðan kosningabaráttunni stóð. 

&gt; Fyrir mér þá er það að fara með þessa punkta sem sanna rangt. Eina ástæðan sem ég sé að þú telur þá sanna er einhliða upplýsingaflæðið sem þú reyðir þig á frá síðum eins og Salon og FP. 

Ég er reyndar búinn að benda á önnur rök og aðrar síður líka, en þú heldur áfram að kalla hlutina einhliða. Ef maður er búinn að sýna þér heimildir sem eru með mismunandi pólitískar skoðanir, vinstri og hægri, viðtöl og pósta frá **honum sjálfum** sem eru hálf óskýrir/hlutdrægir, af hverju heldurðu því einatt fram að maður sé einhliða? Þú hljómar eins og rispuð plata, fastur í sama ""Þetta er allt einhliða, Hillary-hlýðnir fjölmiðlar!"" farinu. 

Þessi viðtöl og tweets t.d. frá WL og Assange eru oft mjög loðin/óskýr í fyrstu, og virðast alltaf þurfa útskýringu eftir á. 
Ef maður þarf alltaf að útskýra hvað maður meinti og bakka með hlutina, og fyrsta statement-ið lítur hlutdrægt út, er þá óeðlilegt að fólk komi með tilgátur um hvað geti valdið?

&gt; Ég er að segja að þessi trú byggist ekki á staðreyndum heldur tilgátum sem byggja á tilgátum.

Ég var aldrei að fullyrða að það sé heilög staðreynd að Wikileaks séu pro Trump. Það er það sem ""margt bendir til"" þýðir. Að það séu ýmsir hlutir sem gefa grunsemdir um eitthvað, en svo geta samt alveg verið einhverjir aðrir hlutir sem benda til þess gagnstæða. Tilgátur byggðar á hegðun/orðum/gögnum - blanda af staðreyndum og getgátur til að fylla upp í eyðurnar. 

Sleppum í bili þeim punktum og pælingum sem hafa komið í greinunum hér að ofan. Þegar þú skoðar twitter feedið hjá Wikileaks í kringum kosningarnar þá eru þar tweet sem virðast vera í þeim eina tilgangi að koma með túlkun WL á innihaldinu, eða þá kynda undir einhverskonar samsæriskenningar. T.d. [hér](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/790713289311387648) er vakin sérstaklega athygli á samskiptum Cheryl Sandberg og Podesta, en lítið í póstunum gefur samsæri í skyn. Eða t.d. það að WL ákváðu að selja anti-Clinton boli í miðjum kosningum. Það neyddi þá enginn til þess að taka þannig beina afstöðu með/móti öðrum frambjóðandanum. 

Veit ekki alveg hvað er svo erfitt við að ímynda sér að sumir sjá þetta og hugsa ""Hmm, þetta er nú ansi anti-Clinton/pro Trump"".

Athugaðu, að ég er **ekki** að segja að WikiLeaks séu fake news. Lekarnir þeirra eru allir sannir og gott að fá að sjá hvað er í rauninni að gerast bakvið tjöldin.

Punkturinn minn í upphafi var einfaldlega sá, að það lítur oft út eins og lekarnir séu fleiri og komi sér verr fyrir Clinton og demókrata, en Trump og repúblikana, sem og að hegðun Wikileaks og orð beinast oft á harðskeittari hátt að Clinton og demókrötum, en að Trump og félögum. 
Ég held við séum ekkert að fara komast lengra á einhverjum hártogunum, svo ég ætla að kalla þetta gott.

**Boost to Make in India: Hyundai plans to shift production of Verna from Korea to India** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: The new souped-up Verna is going to be more than just another car for India and the local unit of Hyundai Motor. The South Korean company is shifting the production of the mid-size sedan entirely from its home base to India.In what could further boost the 'Make in India' initiative, Hyundai will use its manufacturing facility near Chennai to supply the Verna to almost all its global markets starting January.It shows the growing confidence of the company in making bigger and more premium cars for exports in a country which has for long been known as a manufacturing base for small passenger vehicles.The company is targetting annual production of about 1.3 lakh units of the Verna in India over the next couple of years and export 60-70% of that, Hyundai Motor India managing director YK Koo told ET.In fact, Hyundai has already boosted the profile of its Indian hub from being a base for manufacturing small cars to larger vehicles. Last year, it shipped about 45,000 units of the Creta SUV to overseas markets from India.Other foreign automakers are also realising the benefits of the low-cost manufacturing opportunities that India offers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recently started producing the Jeep Compass at a factory in Maharashtra from where it plans to export the SUV to all right-hand-drive markets.Volkswagen ships the Vento sedan from India to Latin American markets while Ford Motor is set to export the EcoSport compact SUV to its home market US.Hyundai's plan underlines the growing importance of India at its global headquarters in Seoul. The share of India in Hyundai's overall production has risen to 13% in 2016 from 12% the year before. In terms of profit contribution, India is second only to Czech among the Korean firm's overseas manufacturing bases, ahead of other key markets including the US and Brazil.Koo said the company is looking to produce about 50,000 units of the Verna for the domestic market and another 80,000 for exports. ""Initially we will export 60,000 units and eventually scale it up to 80,000. The model is very important for Hyundai Motor India from exports perspective,"" he added. It will continue to make the Verna in China and Russia for the local markets there.People in the know of the company's plans said while its capacity has remained at 6.7-7.0 lakh units a year in India, production volume, revenue and profit are moving up because of higher exports of vehicles like the Creta.The Verna is expected to reinforce this further ""The contribution of the Indian arm has already shot up to 14.2% (in terms of volume) at the end of June from 13% at the end of the last year — so clearly this rise is extremely noticeable at the HQ,"" said a person associated with Hyundai India.Hyundai India is set to export the new generation Verna to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and several Asian countries. The company hopes this to help it achieve near-100% capacity utilisation, adding to the bottom line. Its factory currently operates at 95-98% of capacity.With the Creta, too, witnessing strong demand in both domestic and overseas markets, Hyundai India is likely to increase local capacity to 7-7.2 lakh units through improved efficiency on the production lines, people in the know said.The new-generation Verna is built on the same platform on which the bigger and costlier Elantra premium sedan is based on, and is high on safety and connectivity features. This is expected to allow Hyundai to compete better in the mid-size sedan space where the Honda City and Maruti Suzuki Ciaz are fighting neck and neck.Low cost of manufacturing and economies of scale from catering to both Indian and overseas markets allow vehicle makers to utilise their capacities more effectively and reach a quicker breakeven on India projects, said Gaurav Vangaal, the senior analyst for forecasting at IHS Markit.While passenger vehicle makers are more visible in using India as a manufacturing base for exports, those from other segments are also increasingly utilising the potential. In the two-wheeler space, Bajaj Auto's Chakan plant on the outskirts of Pune is the sole base for exporting low-displacement KTM bikes to the US and Europe.Volvo Buses has decided to source buses from India — an India-made Volvo bus won an award for the best bus in Spain last year. Daimler is exporting Mercedes-Benz badged trucks to Southeast Asian markets.The growing export of upmarket cars would add to India's brand value as a hub for complex manufacturing. Moving ahead, we need improved physical and social infrastructure to better coagulate resources and efficiently deliver the goods at globally competitive costs. As automotive making becomes more knowledge and technology intensive, we do need to policy design a thriving ecosystem here for cutting-edge innovation.

vokegaf,UNSA,United States of America,"I have to say that while I'm no expert in the situation, some of these don't make much sense to me.

Going item by item:

* Cut capital gains tax.

This should effectively transfer money from the state to people who purchased a lot of real estate.

In the US, the federal government does not charge capital gains tax on someone's primary residence.  Sweden apparently [charges 22% of the buy/sell price](https://www.thelocal.se/20081022/15150) difference, with a weird quirk thrown in: you are able to postpone paying tax until you sell your last house, at which time you apparently pay all your decades of back taxes on capital gains.

Apparently Sweden also charges 0.5% interest on postponed capital gains tax *if* you buy a property in Sweden but not elsewhere in the EU.

That's a weird set of incentives.

I can imagine that there are people living in a shack somewhere in Sweden with postponed capital gains taxes and interest that vastly exceeds their net worth, so they can't sell out and go to a hospice or something.  But the ""postponement"" thing would, I'd think, permit someone who didn't care about running up debt to the government to downsize without problems.  If anything, you'd expect a huge market for cheap shacks, to just keep the capital gains taxes at bay.

* Deregulate rentals.

I'm not sure what they mean, but it *could* mean Sweden's use of rent controls, which are apparently significant.  Rent controls will indeed normally produce an undersupply of rental housing: as long as nobody moves, they have housing subsidized by the landlord, but anyone moving into the area has to pay a much higher price.  They are not normally considered a good idea, though the public often likes them (and the longer they are in place, the more disruptive it is when they come off).  This could definitely explain high market rental prices: few people want to invest money into rent-controlled housing, and the small amount of rental housing that actually goes on the market is purchased by whoever is wealthy enough to elbow everyone else away.

* More social housing.

This is really doesn't solve the issue of high market price directly, though it might offset some of the problems caused by other policies that produce high housing Costa, since more people can?t afford market rate.

I'd favor bringing the market price down, which will promptly pull people out of social housing and reduce demand for it anyway.  While there may be a role for more social housing, it is not a fix for ""market prices are high"", but tried to ameliorate some of the symptoms.

* Eliminate home mortgage interest deductions.

Broadly speaking, I would agree thar this is a good idea.  However, I'm not convinced that it makes housing less affordable.

If you can deduct mortgage interest from your income before taxes, then you're being encouraged to take out more debt: the government says ""take out more debt, and I will pay some of it"".  This will presumably increase the amount that people borrow, and thus drive up home prices.  However it also increases everyone's buying power in terms of ability to borrow, so I'm not sure that it makes housing less affordable.

It sends more of society's wealth to those who lend to homeowners and to those who take a percentage cut of home sales (like realtors).

There seems no real justification for this that I can see.  I don't really care that people borrow more: if more money in real estate has positive externalities, then I should subsidize it, not borrowing more for it.

Wikipedia says that [Sweden is one of the few countries to do this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_mortgage_interest_deduction).  The US also does it, and Wikipedia says more extensively than Sweden: Sweden only permits part of the interest to be deducted.

I'm fine with reducing the mortgage income deduction, but I don't see why it really improves housing affordability.

So in sum:

* Reduce capital gains.  Sweden's current postponement structure looks insane to me, and that looks like something that should die.  No idea whether the actual level is that critical.  Would give a lot of money from the government to people deep into real estate.

* Deregulate rentals.  If this means kill rent control, yes, absolutely, great move.  Will reduce market rent prices and improve worker mobility: rent control is a terrible idea.  Will not reduce housing purchase prices other than insofar as some people might substitute a more affordable rental for a purchase.

* More social housing.  Nothing intrinsically wrong with it, but it doesn't bring down high housing prices.

* Eliminate mortgage income deduction.  Sure, seems reasonable, and will cut house prices.  However, I'm not sure if it will actually make housing more affordable.",True,False,,0,1504232557,,1504281302,0,dmeok00,True,t3_6xbhxz,t1_dmenl5w,1506389815,3,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

Whisper,none,Shoto-kan,"Now the conversation takes on the risk of becoming political. You European types do seem to be kind of weird about guns. 

So let's establish two things. 

1. Nothing I say to you, even if I completely convince you, is going to change what your rulers will and will not allow you to do. Thus political debate has limited impact on law. 

2. Nothing your rulers do, even if everyone in your country agrees, can change the laws of physics, or the facts of psychology or physiology. Thus law has limited impact on tactical realities. 

So I will continue to address this question from a purely tactical standpoint. 

So, first of all, as I said, there is nothing inherently wrong with deciding NOT to address a risk. Just be aware that is what you are doing. If you decide the risk of being attacked with a gun is small enough that you can ignore it, okay. 

&gt; That is also a reason why most criminals come up with a knife at max and even a lot of knives aren't allowed here. 

Okay, here we have what I consider a bit of a tactical misconception. Criminals, by definition, are those who that which is not ""allowed"". Allowing or disallowing a thing does not provide any physical force which actually stops that thing from happening. It only means that you punish someone when they do it, which is tactically irrelevant, because it happens much later than the immediate threat. 

Thus, one cannot rely on the *legal* environment to constrain *tactical* threats. 

&gt; While a knife is a mean weapon on its own and also a use of deadly force it is at least less serious than a firearm. 

No, not really. Not at all. 

There is a common perception that a knife is somehow ""less deadly"" than a gun. This makes no sense if you think about it. Either a weapon kills, or it does not. A weapon cannot be *less deadly*, because a person cannot be *only slightly dead*. Miracle Max is not on call, here. 

The main reason people think this is because the knife is a familiar household object, while many people, especially in non-free countries, have only seen guns in violent fictional television, and therefore have a Pavlovian association between guns and mayhem. 

Tactically, both the handgun and the knife are equally useful as an *assailant's* weapons, but the handgun is more useful as a *defender's* weapon. 

What does that mean? Well, remember that the assailant is the one who *initiates the conflict*. His goal is to cause harm. This means that he can choose the range at which the conflict occurs. If a knife lacks the range of a gun, then he can simply get closer before initiating his attack. The defender's goal isn't to cause harm, it's to avoid harm. Therefore, while the attacker wants to get close, the defender wishes to create distance. The handgun allows him to *project disabling power while retreating*. 

What's the point of all this hair-splitting? Well, what's important about all this is that weapon choice is predicated on what you will need to do. The necessary features for a defensive weapon are far greater than those for an offensive weapon. I cannot, for example, defend myself with a grenade, but I can sure as hell murder people with one. 

The weapon I carry is a semiautomatic pistol, chambered in 9mm Parabellum. This choice is not because it is ""the deadliest"" weapon. Hell, a truckload of fertilizer is far deadlier, and, as Europe has recently seen, so is the truck without the fertilizer. No, this choice is because it is the weapon most appropriate to a broad range of defensive situations... most especially including attack with another firearm. 

Now, tactically, if the choice of whether or not to carry a gun has been made for you by those who rule over you, and you choose to abide that, then the same redirect-draw-disable sequence would be doable with a knife... but not just any knife. It must be readily accessible to you, and openable in a fraction of second with just one hand via spring-assist. 

This will *never* be as fast as drawing a firearm, but it may be enough to save your life, *if* your assailant is close. If not, well... run, and hope you're not his first target.

FembotsJubblies,,,"&gt;KHI are the makers of Japan’s legendary bullet train, or shinkansen, one of the world’s fastest, safest, and most efficient high-speed trains. KHI signed a technology transfer contract with CSR Sifang, builders of China’s impressive HSR network, with the agreement that China’s use of the blueprints to develop high-speed railway cars would be limited to domestic applications only. “We didn’t think it was not risky,” KHI’s Harada Takuma, who worked on the Chinese collaboration, said. “But we took on the project because terms and conditions under the tech transfer should have been binding. We had a legal agreement; we felt safe,” Takuma added. But the deal seemed to have backfired on KHI in the worst possible way, as now China is currently poised to make a profit out of the technology. KHI maintains that not only did China copy the technology – they have recently patented remarkably similar high-speed-rail (HSR) tech – CSR Sifang now wants to sell their new trains to the world – claiming it as Chinese.

[Source](http://japandailypress.com/japans-kawasaki-says-china-copied-bullet-train-technology-1527012/).

CRS Sifang stole KHI technology, put a cherry on the top and called it Chinese technology which they had the bare faced cheek to patent. They copied KHI's designs so did not have to amortize the initial R&amp;D costs, and could undercut the Japanese and European HSR manufacturers.

It's nothing short of piracy, and demonstrates the complete lack of ethics of Chinese business, and should serve as a warning to all other enterprises. Enter into a technology agreement with these thieving bastards and it will destroy your business, they are totally untrustworthy.

The Soviets in the far east were mostly a land force with tactical aviation in a phase of the war dominated by strategic aviation and Naval power, with the key to committing land power being a functional amphibious doctrine and equipment base.

The US omitted Manchuria and Korea from downfall because the cost in terms of damage done to the Japanese Empire was not proportional to the cost in lives and treasure committed to either of those objectives.  Destroying the Japanese in China or Korea would not do anything to realistically change the situation in terms of assaulting Japan proper.

For contrast, Formosa and China mainland landings were considered in terms of forward basing, but ultimately rejected (Formosa because it was seen as too much to bite off while dealing with existing objectives, China because of poor performance of Chinese troops and the resulting required heavy commitment of land forces). 

The US government was fully committed to unconditional surrender on the part of the Japanese.  The differences in opinion mostly resolved around how much of the military to demobilize or what war production should be suspended in light of the defeat of Germany.  

You're also wrong on Japanese beliefs on Soviet neutrality.  It wasn't because of building US-USSR tension, it was because the Soviets and Japanese had a long lasting neutrality agreement.  The Japanese in some regards believes that by not attacking the USSR with Germany they had bought some goodwill too, and that the USSR didn't really have a dog in the fight in regards to Asia.

Arguably Japan's war was an exercise in futility by the point of the Battle of of the Philippines sea in which the last effective Japanese ""strategic"" forces were destroyed in the military sense.  There was no realistic way the Japanese were going to ""win"" against the US, and it was apparent that with the nuclear bombings that the US could destroy anything, anywhere, with apparently minimal effort.

Snapshot52,moderator,Moderator | Native American Studies | Colonialism,"/u/CoolNiceMike makes an excellent observation regarding your professor's claim if they were indeed referring to Hispaniola alone. However, as also noted at the end of /u/CoolNiceMike's comment, this claim gains more accuracy if we change the perspective of which we view depopulation in the Americas.

First, let's note something about disease. It is true that diseases played a very major role in the depopulation of the Americas. Unfortunately, many people today put way too much emphasis on this notion that disease did most of the legwork, giving rise to several myths, such as the ""bloodless conquest"" myth, in where colonizers moved into areas that were already depopulated and they didn't do much conquering at all. Another myth is the ""virgin soil"" hypothesis, the theory that the Americas were some sort of disease free paradise in where the Indigenous peoples had no immunity to European diseases and that these diseases spread so fast because of this, Indigenous groups were practically wiped out before Europeans even got their area. These myths have led a lot of people to concluding very wrong information about diseases, pathology, and the historical record of what exactly happened in the depopulating of the Americas at the time of Columbus. Diseases are even used as a scapegoat to this effect, which I speak about [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6kywre/monday_methods_american_indian_genocide_denial/)

One of the most recent and up-to-date works about these deadly pathogens is *Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America* (2015). This work is a compilation of essays by various experts who work to debunk the above myths and reveal the reality of what happened.

&gt;For decades some scholars had acknowledged that certain pathogens actually spread slowly. Crosby (1972:46), for instance, noted in *The Columbian Exchange* that there was no smallpox in the Caribbean in the first twenty-five years after Columbus. Livi-Bacci (2003:38), who looked closely at records from Hispaniola, has shown that this was not limited to smallpox: ""[B]efore 1518 there is no trace of major epidemics"" (p. 26).

Now, of course, this does not mean diseases didn't have an impact. As further commented on:

&gt;This, in turn, demonstrates another key point, one that has also been carefully documented over the past decade: epidemics were but one of many factors that combined to generate the substantial morality that most groups did experience. As Livi-Bacci (2011:164) observed, ""the long-term impact of the new diseases was increasingly severe the more 'damaged' the demographic system and the more crippled its ability to rebound after a shock."" Specific case studies have made this case in considerable detail. Livi-Bacci's work on Hispaniola demonstrates this well. Spaniards confiscated Taino labor, disrupted subsistence activities, displaced populations, and undermined living conditions. . ."" (p. 28).

So what we have here is a narrative that demonstrates, through evidence, that diseases alone cannot be pinpointed as the sole cause for depopulation, as if it was an incubator of an inevitable downfall. Rather, we must observe other explanations. The most glaring one would be the other major change that occurred in 1492 and the coming years: colonization.

Columbus's ""discoveries"" put the Americas on the map for the Europeans. It was Columbus who began and even instituted the many practices that helped depopulation the Americas, namely grotesque slavery and wanton killing in the name of subjugation. Perhaps your professor was referring to this - that Columbus gave the signal and set the precedent for how the Indigenous people were to be treated by incoming Europeans. On this, David E. Stannard, author of *American Holocaust* (1992) examines this.

&gt;Columbus finished his letter, describing what he had seen on his voyage, on March 4th of 1493. A printed version of it was published in Barcelona and was widely circulated less than a month later. A month after that a translated edition was circulating in Rome. A month after that a version that set the letter to verse appeared. Others followed in Antwerp, Basel, Paris, Florence, Strassburg, Valladolid, and elsewhere, most of them going back for a second and third and fourth printings . . . Before long, reports were circulating that Satan himself resided on one of those islands in the Caribbean Sea . . . It was only a matter of time before that stereotype of barbarically hostile natives had metamorphosed once again. As best described by its most famous proponent, the eminent Spanish scholar Juan Gines de Sepulveda, the next representation of the New World's Indian was as creatues of a subhuman, Caliban-like nature who were intended by God ""to be placed under the authority of civilized and virtuous princes or nations, so that they may learn, from the might, wisdom, and law of their conquerors, to practice better morals, worthier customs, and a more civilized way of life"" (p. 64).

This sets the stage for understanding how Columbus and his men, including many future colonizers, were to view the Native inhabitants. After his first voyage, Columbus and his men brought with them from island to island a new proclamation: *the requerimiento.* This was a statement that was to be read to any encountered Indigenous person that basically demanded they give into Christianity and swear allegiance to the Pope and Spanish Crown. If not, it made it quite clear what was to happen:

&gt;[I certify to you that, with the help of God, we shall powerfully enter into your country and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we can, and shall subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of Their Highness. We shall take you and your wives and your children, and shall make slaves of them, and as such shall sell and dispose of them as Their Highnesses may command. And we shall take your goods, and shall do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as to vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord and resist and contract him.""](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/amerbegin/contact/text7/requirement.pdf)

Recordings from Columbus's men show the numbers of Indians they were dealing with. Michele de Cuneo writes:

&gt;When our caravels in which I wished to go home had to leave for Spain, we gathered together in our settlement 1600 people male and female of those Indians, of whom, among the best males and females, we embarked on our varavels on 17 Februrary 1495, 550 souls.

By the time of Columbus's second voyage, disease was breaking out among the islands that he landed on. Yet, that didn't stop him or his men from continuing to add to the devastation:

&gt;Wherever the marauding, diseased, and heavily armed Spanish forces went out on patrol, accompanied by ferocious armored dogs that had been trained to kill and disembowel, they preyed on the local communities - already plagued-enfeebled - forcing them to supply food and women and slaves, and whatever else the soldiers might desire. At virtually every previous landing on this trip Columbus's troops had gone ashore and killed indiscriminately, as though for sport, whatever animals and birds and natives they encountered, ""looting and destroying all they found,"" as the Admiral's son Fernando blithely put it . . . More than 50,000 natives were reported dead from these encounters by the time the Admiral had recovered from his sickness. And when at last his health and strength had been restored, Columbus's response to his men's unorganized depredations was to organize them. In March of 1495 he massed together several hundred armored troops, cavalry, and a score or more of trained attack dogs. They set forth across the countryside, tearing into assembled masses of sick and unarmed native people, slaughtering them by the thousands"" (p. 70).

Spanish missionary Bartolome de Las Casas records the following himself:

&gt;It was a general rule among Spaniards to be cruel; not just cruel, but extraordinarily cruel so that harsh and bitter treatment would prevent Indians from daring to think of themselves as human beings or having a minute to think at all"" (p. 70).

Bartolome de Las Casas would later put the death toll at the hands of the Spanish, not disease, at over 20,000, during this voyage. And it was this type of attitude that set in motion how Indians of the New World were to be treated. Countless decrees, Papal Bulls, and sensational writings coming out of Europe repeatedly declared Natives as being non-human, worthy of subjugation and slavery. And that is what happened. Unfortunately, we may never know true numbers. As pointed out, 8 million was a favorite figure for a long time, but isn't necessarily supported now. Yet, if we take into account the surrounding areas, what Columbus and his men did - in addition to their own killing - was set a precedent for future invaders who would definitely reach a death toll ranging in the millions, deaths that happened far outside the impacts of diseases alone. However, this would have occurred over a longer time span than 2-3 years if we talk about deaths by the sword alone.

 &gt;Cereals remained the most important staple during the early Middle Ages as rice was a late introduction to Europe, and the potato was only introduced in 1536, with a much later date for widespread consumption. Barley, oat and rye among the poor, and wheat for the governing classes, were eaten as bread, porridge, gruel and pasta by all of society's members. Fava beans and vegetables were important supplements to the cereal-based diet of the lower orders.

-

&gt;Meat was more expensive and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or salted they made their way far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.

-

&gt;The centrality of bread in religious rituals such as the Eucharist meant that it enjoyed an especially high prestige among foodstuffs. Only (olive) oil and wine had a comparable value, but both remained quite exclusive outside the warmer grape- and olive-growing regions.

-

&gt;The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches and their calendars had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden for a full third of the year for most Christians, and all animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast…While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of ""fish"" was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins and even beavers.

-

&gt;…for most people, the diet tended to be high-carbohydrate, with most of the budget spent on, and the majority of calories provided by, cereals and alcohol (such as beer). Even though meat was highly valued by all, lower classes often could not afford it, nor were they allowed by the church to consume it every day. In England in the 13th century, meat contributed a negligible portion of calories to a typical harvest worker's diet; however, its share increased after the Black Death and, by the 15th century, it provided about 20% of the total.

-

&gt;In Europe there were typically two meals a day: dinner at mid-day and a lighter supper in the evening.

-

&gt;One of the most common constituents of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries.

-

Brauny74,,,"&gt; i have no trouble believing a single language could be spoken through out the western world if people wanted it to

Nowadays? Perhaps. But I was talking about mostly fantasy settings, where this sort of communication doesn't exist, or only available to a handful of population. Or about space operas, where they hop from planet to planet, which are usually pretty isolated. Universal translators kind of allow to handwave it, but actually I realized, I hate those too. They make no sense. For example, what do they do with thing as simple, as order of word in the sentence? It's all over the place on Earth itself, and I can't imagine what aliens might invent in that regard. And what about subtle, unspoken things, like context-dependent semantics? Achieving FTL would be easier, that creating a thing, that would provide instant translation. I only have two ideas how they might work - warping time to read sentence when it's finished or reading mind of the speaker. Both are too advanced for most of sci-fi settings anyway.

But returning to the point on hand, even China didn't provide truly unified language for its Empire. Chinese has tons of dialects, and it always had them. And some of them drifted so far away, some linguists talk about not one Chinese language, but a group of languages. Same with Latin language, which was divided into several dialects of vulgar Latin, even before the fall of Roman Empire.

If there is any form of isolation, limiting the population migration, languages will start to drift away from each other. Medieval people didn't travel this much, so in medieval period, many languages had tons of dialects. If you look at history of any literary language, in many cases, they just picked up current capital's dialect or even some popular writer's dialect as main form of language, when their tech level allowed them to spread this form of language fast enough (usually with a rise of printed media, such as books). Russian literary language is based on Karamzin and Pushkin's personal dialects. English owes a lot to Shakespeare in that regard. But that all happened at some advanced point of history. It shouldn't be the case in most fantasy settings, where languages must drift from each other. 

So languages should always drift from each other, and have tons of dialects. One unified language must be only possible as a limited language of educated population - like Latin was in Medieval Europe. But even that way, heroes shouldn't be able to just walk into random store and be able to buy whatever they want using this language.",True,False,,0,1504241497,,False,0,dmeummc,False,t3_6wwpig,t1_dmdwg06,1506392788,1,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,

So yes, the EU  will add up some things and tell the uk what they think they're owed, and the uk negotiators will make a similar calculation on how much the uk owes the eu.

The uk will have to pay something, that's certain. If you bothered to read what I posted you might have realized that. For example, the simplest no brainer is the cost of pensions, at the very least the cost of British EU workers.

The EU doesn't save up funds to pay out pensions later on (they are paid through the EU budget as they are paid out). This is an obvious example of a future cost the UK agreed to pay for when they joined. I think you would agree that current British EU staffers of MEPs for example deserve to get the pension they worked for, no? So probably the UK will argue it only wants to pay for their own citizens, while the EU will probably argue that the UK needs the pay a part of the future pensions of *all* current eu employees.

akindofuser,,,"&gt; I agree with how we handle things by the way.

Yes you've stated routinely that you like Greek's specific system the most. Very good. Back to the point.

&gt; The professor has the right

He does have the right if the service is private. Consumers then also have a right to seek education elsewhere. This is a stickier matter when the education is socially funded and globally mandated. The professor does not have the right to teach whatever he wants willynilly. That includes pet legal annoyances. Once the public funds you ideally your time is spent performing whatever task the public believes is appropriate. We draw more attention as to how the State actor invests his time. The school is no longer a platform for personal feelings and interests. That would be abusing the public system and social resources. I'm surprised your defending this. 

Besides, neither one of us would need to spend much time in finding a more pressing issue. There are far larger issues in both of our countries he could have chosen to waste time on. Especially with regard to health, safety, and laws. Last I heard underage drinking was not at the top of the list of problems Greece is currently facing. If this was a particular systemic problem with that specific university maybe so. Or if this was a country wide issue sure. No one has presented that argument though.

&gt; And this is why your education system sucks and produces idiots

I guess I am trying to understand what your argument is. Sounds like you are saying, Greece great, America dumb! You then site a youtube video as your evidence but there is no mention of Greece and the discussion is not about scientists.

Fortunately in the realm of education there is a long list of studies comparing all the countries. These numbers are based on various open standards or standardized testing.

In general Greece has scored below the US and in some cases far below. I understand you like how things are done in Greece, that is great, but irrelevant to what I think your point is. 

If the US produces idiots what does that say about Greece?
[2015 PISA Ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment#Research_on_possible_causes_of_PISA_disparities_in_different_countries)

You can cross reference these with [different studies](http://www.master-and-more.eu/en/news-detail/news/top-40-education-systems-in-the-world/) that paint similar pictures with regard to Greece vs the ""idiots"", as you call them, in the US. (Thanks for the insult!)

I know you think the US ""system"" is bad but I don't think you know what the US system is and how it differs from your own. You might be surprised to learn of a great deal of similarities between the two. We also have socialized primary and secondary education. We have partially socialized higher education. Additional the US's sheer size encompasses the entire continent of Europe. We have poor areas and rich areas to. A more accurate comparison would be comparing all of Europe, both poor and rich, to the US. Although that wouldn't work in your favor since Europe's average rating would drop(Simply take all EU states in the PISA listing and average them out).

An interesting note on IQ ranking. Idiots in the US no?

visforv,,,"&gt; 90% were already gone because of diseade

It's now believed that the extent and ""single-factor"" of disease has been overstated in the decline of Native Americans. For one, we don't and probably will never know how many Natives were in the Americas prior to Landing. Two, there were a mixture of nomadic and sedentary societies and it's a lot harder for disease to overtake a nomadic society. Three, even sedentary societies figured out ways to counteract plagues. They weren't always effective, but measles showing up was not the death sentence for the entire village that people think it is. There's actually very little empirical evidence to point to disease killing off ""90% of the Native population"", and what we do have is either extremely localized (to the post-conquest Aztecs which included deaths from slavery and wounds and childbirth and is iirc the prime source of the 90% claim) or pretty much musings. Like disease had some part, but the whole ""capturing vast swathes and working them to death in cramped conditions which contribute to disease spreading"" probably had more to do with it.

Going ""90% of all Natives were already dead from disease"" is a nice and clean way of washing off the blood of conquest because it implies that a few Europeans managed to spread a few bugs which multiplied exponentially without any help from the Europeans.

&gt; you will reach an impasse where you will have no choice but to resort to violence.

False. There are literally hundreds of methods of removing someone peacefully from a country. But I'm not that concerned about who stays in America as I am about who stays in Europe. And don't claim to be against violence when you support it. 

&gt; Huh, yet here you are spouting the same eugenics tropes that propelled the original National Socialists to power. 

Do you think that's how ideologies come to power? By ""spouting eugenics tropes""? Do you also realize eugenics are a good thing? How exactly is encouraging healthy individuals to procreate to better society a bad thing?

&gt; You're right that the fascism of today 

There is no fascist country that exists today and there will never be a fascist country that will exist in the future. Also fascism's core tenets never change, so I don't know where you get the idea that fascism can be ""different"". We are headed towards a globalist transhumanist society. Science and technology is reaching its peak. We have the technology to create babies with superior genes thanks to technology like CRISPR. Only a matter of time before biotech becomes mainstream. Besides, a white ethnostate conflicts with the interests of the powers that be. As much as I'd like to see a white-only Europe, it seems like a dream as of now. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. I'm not holding my breath though. 

&gt; To quote a white nationalist

Huh? I thought we were talking about national socialism and not white nationalism? I asked for national socialist policies that call for genocide or violence against others which you have yet to show me. 

&gt; Yes! Both of those are wrong. One's national identity is not determined by race.

So you're fine with destroying a group's culture and identity? Would you mind if we destroyed Japan by making native Japanese people a minority, race mixing with every Japanese person, and putting another race's culture there instead? How fucked up are you to believe this? Many people do not agree with you. Lots of people believe it is the people who make up the nation. Would Japan still be Japan without Japanese people? Would Israel still be Israel without Jews? Would Nigeria still be Nigeria without Nigerians?

&gt; What makes you think you're somehow more entitled to live here than I am, simply because I practice a different religion from you? What gives you more right to call this ""my country"" than I do?

Again I will not use America as the example. I will use Europe. Which I strongly believe belongs to the Europeans. 

&gt; No they don't. Gentiles live in Israel. White people live in Kenya. People of Asian descent live in South America.

gnikivar2,,,"Don't know what this comment is in response to,but I suspect that new world resources were secondary. However, the intensification of the global slave trade did have a massive impact on African slave trading. For example, the Kingdom of the Kongo was a major empire which ate itself alive trying to supply the Portuguese with slaves. Many of the most brutal colonial regimes such as the Congo Free State built themselves up by redirecting the slave capturing and trading networks to serve European purposes.

That said, I would be careful about exaggerating the wealth of Mansa Musa and other African Kings. The Kingdoms of Ghana, Mali and Songhay maintained firm control over the cities, the salt mines and gold mines and slave trade. Yet bureacratic control (though real) was limited in many places. While vast amluntss of land are controlled by Songhay according to a map, it's hard to say what that meant in reality. Moreover, advanced agricultural technologies we're well known, but used sparingly,eanimg little surplus to field large permanent armies. 

By the time of the colonial invasions, standards of living and technology we're much lower than in France and England. In terms of guns, and financial organization these states were no match. But even more important, was that many of these states were more than happy to come to an arranged with the British. The Sokoto Caliphate, the success state to the great empires of Mali and Songhay, put up only a limited fight and the British kept much of the old system. In fact, the aristocracy actually saw it's power increased. Many elites saw cooperation as easier than confrontation to a superior force throughout Africa.

huppie,,,"Laat ik beginnen met het 'beste' antwoord dat ik op je vraag heb: *Ik weet het niet en het is simpelweg onmogelijk om nu te voorspellen wat over vijftien jaar voor mij de beste optie is. Belastingregimes wijzigen nu eenmaal om de zoveel jaar dus wat nu een goede oplossing lijkt is hoogstwaarschijnlijk tegen die tijd achterhaald.*  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Je haalt bijv. de huidige tarieven aan voor vermogensbelasting, hierover is in de politiek al veel gezegd, de meesten zien het als een overgangsregeling naar 30% van het daadwerkelijke rendement. Hoe *dat* gaat werken in de toekomst is niet duidelijk... krijgen we hier ook de zin/onzin van tax-loss- en tax-gain-harvesting? Zou het tarief ook hier verschillen op basis van de Box1 schijf waarin je zit? We hebben simpelweg geen flauw idee dus zullen moeten wachten tot de regels toegepast worden (en tot die tijd eventueel lobbyen voor bepaalde regels.)  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Dat gezegd hebbend zijn we *wel* mogelijkheden om je belastingdruk tijdens de opbouwfase te verlagen. Hier een selectie uit de mogelijkheden:  
  
**Pensioensparen**  
  
Of pensioenbeleggen... of vergelijkbare producten die gebruik maken van de jaar/rekenruimte.  
  
Vermogen dat je hierin opbouwt is gedurende de opbouwfase 'veilig'. Dit kan flink schelen in belastingen. In ruil hiervoor betaal je een iets hoger belastingtarief (standaard box 1) wanneer je het geld eruit haalt.  
  
Een nadeel is dat je geen vrije beschikbaarheid meer hebt over het vermogen en dat je verplicht bent er een lijfrente mee aan te kopen voor zover ik weet.  
  
**Vermogensopbouw in primair woning**  
  
Een andere populaire optie is vermogen opbouwen in je primaire woning. Je koopt bijv. over vijf jaar een huis dat een ruime ton duurder is dan dat je je oude huis voor verkocht hebt en hebt weer een ton spelingsruimte. Je gokt er dan uiteindelijk op dat het rendement hiervan op zijn minst gelijk is aan wat je op de beurs kan behalen minus VRH.  
  
De nadelen hiervan zijn dat je vermogen 'vast' zit en het geld kost (makelaarskosten e.d.) om het er uit te krijgen. Het levert daarnaast niet echt cashflow op en het is nog maar de vraag of het verschil in rendement op lange termijn de moeite waard ie. Een ander nadeel (waar mensen zich vaak op verkijken) is dat je je kans op lifestyle inflatie vergroot.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

Where Barnier seemed more frustrated (or perhaps impatient, to use his description) was when it came to the idea that Britain wanted to carve its own niche position as members of the single market (minus FoM) and within the customs union while still able to negotiate trade deals as an individual country. The EU always has insisted that membership is either in or out, so I can certainly see the frustration (or impatience) there.

In reality the EU has less to worry about than the UK. If the UK leaves the EU we lose the regulatory framework surrounding everything from electronics, medical equipment, to fruit. We lose the right for planes to fly from the UK to European countries.

Les 40 principaux groupes cotés à la Bourse de Paris (CAC 40) ont engrangé 51,6 milliards d’euros de bénéfice en six mois. Soit 25 % de plus qu’un an auparavant. Mais la suite s’annonce plus compliquée.

Tout avait si bien commencé. Des ventes en forte hausse, des bénéfices plantureux. Les uns après les autres, les groupes du CAC 40 n’annonçaient, depuis le début de l’été, que des bonnes nouvelles, ou presque. Autant dire que les comptes du premier semestre publiés mercredi 30 août au soir par Carrefour ont jeté un froid. Là où les investisseurs attendaient au moins 25 % de hausse du bénéfice net, le deuxième distributeur mondial a fait au contraire état d’une chute de 40 %, et prévenu que ses profits de l’année seraient eux aussi inférieurs aux prévisions. La sanction n’a pas tardé : en Bourse, l’action Carrefour a dévissé jeudi de 13 %.

L’épisode donne bien la tonalité particulière de la saison des résultats qui s’achève. Globalement, les champions de l’économie française affichent de très solides profits. Mais les doutes se multiplient quant à la poursuite de cette amélioration, entre la guerre des prix dans l’alimentaire, l’appréciation de l’euro et le risque d’une rechute de l’économie mondiale. Si bien que l’euphorie n’est pas à l’ordre du jour.

Au total, les 40 membres de l’indice vedette de la Bourse de Paris ont engrangé en six mois 51,6 milliards d’euros de bénéfices nets. C’est 25 % de plus qu’un an auparavant. Une embellie bien partagée : trente des quarante poids lourds de la cote ont vu leurs résultats s’améliorer. Le numéro un mondial de l’acier ArcelorMittal et le champion du béton LafargeHolcim, qui avaient beaucoup souffert auparavant, ont connu des retours à meilleure fortune spectaculaires. Total a, lui, été porté par la hausse du pétrole, tandis que les spécialistes du luxe LVMH et Kering bénéficiaient d’un marché toujours dynamique, de même que les industriels de l’automobile. Les banques ont elles aussi retrouvé la forme.

A l’inverse, un seul membre du CAC perd encore de l’argent : le Finlandais Nokia, acquéreur d’Alcatel en 2015. En raison de ses médiocres performances, Nokia risque d’ailleurs d’être écarté du CAC et remplacé par Hermès lors de la prochaine révision de la composition de l’indice, d’ici au 15 septembre.

## Ecart entre groupes américains et européens

« Les grandes entreprises ont beaucoup serré leurs coûts pendant la crise, explique François Breton, gérant chez Edmond de Rothschild. En conséquence, la moindre augmentation de leurs ventes a un effet démultiplié sur les résultats. » C’est ce qui s’est produit au premier semestre, où les champions du CAC ont profité d’une croissance mondiale assez vive : elle devrait atteindre 3,5 % en 2017, selon les dernières prévisions du Fonds monétaire international. Leur chiffre d’affaires global a ainsi progressé d’environ 6 %, mais leurs coûts sont restés sous contrôle, compte tenu de la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt, des cours modérés des matières premières et de hausses de salaires accordées au compte-gouttes. Leurs profits se sont ainsi envolés quatre fois plus vite.

Sur l’ensemble de l’année, le bénéfice global du club des 40 pourrait s’établir entre 90 et 100 milliards d’euros, estiment les analystes. Sanofi, Total et les autres s’approcheraient ainsi collectivement de leurs résultats records des années 2006-2007, juste avant que la banque américaine Lehman Brothers ne fasse faillite et que le capitalisme mondial ne subisse sa plus grave crise depuis 1929.

C’est en quelque sorte le grand retour des « superprofits ». De quoi alimenter la polémique politique, au moment où Emmanuel Macron et son gouvernement demandent des efforts financiers aux Français.

« Oui, cela va bien, très bien même, pour les groupes du CAC », constate Pascal Quiry, professeur à HEC et coauteur du Vernimmen, un ouvrage de finance qui fait référence. « Mais que les 40 meilleurs élèves de la classe aient de bons résultats n’a rien d’étonnant », nuance-t-il. Plus frappant, à ses yeux, est l’écart entre les groupes américains et leurs rivaux européens. Tandis que les multinationales françaises et européennes n’ont pas encore renoué avec leurs niveaux de profits de 2007, leurs rivales américaines ont, elles, effacé la crise depuis longtemps et gagnent plus d’argent que jamais. En moyenne, elles affichent un bénéfice par action supérieur de 40 % à ce qu’il était dix ans auparavant.

## Pas d’optimisme démesuré

« Le décalage entre les deux côtés de l’Atlantique est net, confirme Marie-Jeanne Missoffe, gérante chez Mandarine Gestion. Est-on déjà en haut de cycle ? Aux Etats-Unis, c’est la grande question. En France et en Europe, on peut espérer que la reprise se prolonge encore un peu : nous sortons à peine d’une période difficile, et la croissance n’est pas encore très forte… »

Plusieurs facteurs, cependant, interdisent un optimisme démesuré. « Certains secteurs, comme l’automobile, se trouvent peut-être déjà au sommet du cycle économique », estime par exemple Hortense Lacroix, d’Edmond de Rothschild. D’autres souffrent toujours d’une baisse des prix, à l’image de celle qui pénalise Carrefour en France. D’autres entreprises encore, comme Publicis, doivent faire face aux effets de la révolution numérique. Et en cas de chute de la Bourse américaine, difficile d’imaginer que les champions tricolores resteront indemnes.

Pour beaucoup, surtout, l’appréciation de l’euro par rapport au dollar constitue d’ores et déjà un vrai sujet de préoccupation. Elle réduit, en effet, la compétitivité des exportateurs européens comme LVMH. En moyenne, « une hausse de 10 % de l’euro ampute de 5 % à 7 % les profits des grands groupes de la zone euro », évalue-t-on chez Edmond de Rothschild.

No that's not what I'm saying at all.  I'm talking about state apparatuses for control, you're talking about a religion.  There's no equivalency whatsoever.

Look pal, I'm not out to hurt your feelings, but the fact of the matter is, the military isn't out there selling cookies and mowing old ladies' lawns.  They have a particular role to play in a capitalist society alongside the police - which again, I reiterate, are the more horrid and reactionary of the two - namely, they form what's called the repressive state apparatuses.

The negative tendencies that come with being primarily concerned with applying force and coercion are heightened in all 'professional' military's.  I get the reasons for why people might join up, and I understand them.  But let's not make out the military to be something it ain't.

esskaypee,s1 398 team-398 country-deu,Dynamo Dresden,"A QUARTER of a century after it began, the English Premier League is unrecognisable. Just 13 foreigners appeared on its opening weekend in August 1992; the clubs’ collective revenue in its first season was €300m ($356m). By contrast, in the 2015-16 season players from some 65 countries were represented and earnings passed €4.8bn. The Premier League has amassed more than a billion fans, along with enormous sponsorship and broadcasting deals, which provide five-sixths of the income. It is by far the most lucrative product in the world’s most popular sport. Germany’s Bundesliga, in second place, earns barely half as much.

Yet the richest division is surprisingly mediocre. Though English clubs ruled the Champions League a decade ago, none has reached the final of Europe’s most prestigious knockout tournament since 2012. The beautiful game’s finest artists now earn their keep on the continent. A Premier League star last made the top five in the Ballon d’Or, an award for the world’s best player, in 2011.

Why have the teams weakened as their coffers have overflowed? Mostly because of healthy competition. Premier League clubs divide up their television booty more equally than do teams in other leagues, which prevents a monopoly from emerging: there have been four different winners in the past five seasons. Real Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich take a greater share of their leagues’ profits—indeed, each Spanish team negotiated its own television deal until 2015—allowing them keep up with England's richest sides and maintain their boringly dominant positions. In 2016 the German, French and Italian leagues endured a fourth consecutive year with the same champion, while lowly Leicester lifted the title in England.

The Premier League’s roulette makes for great entertainment, but risky transfers. A star player that moves to Barcelona or Paris Saint-Germain is more likely to win trophies than at Chelsea or Manchester City, and can earn as much. Spain’s two titans have raided English clubs at will: Real Madrid pinched both of its Ballon d’Or winners, Michael Owen from Liverpool and Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United. Attempts to lure Barcelona’s Lionel Messi in the opposite direction have proved futile. And an increasing dependency on second-rate imports has meant that English sides have neglected home-grown players, who were instrumental in past Champions League triumphs.

Illegal immigrants are very vulnerable and criminal groups will victimise them if they get the chance.

The worst instance i heard of was direct from one of the victims herself. She told me her child had got some sort of lung infection, probably whooping cough based on the description, and died. That child was taken off her and given to another beggar to use for one more day as a prop. This means another woman was on the streets begging with her dead infant. Now she could have been lying, but frankly I have no reason to doubt it.

* Higher debt means that a larger part of GDP goes to interest payments. This will lead to lower investments and thus lower GDP growth.
* Because of the the higher risk for government default, interest rates will be higher for a country with higher debt. This higher interest rate also applies for private sector, making the country less attractive for foreign investments. This eventually leads to lower GDP growth.
* Private sector will get less access to loans because all private savings are spend on public debt. This eventually leads to lower GDP growth.
* Population will assume that high government debt will lead to higher taxes in the future. Private sector will invest less out of fear for the impact of unplanned higher taxes. This again leads to lower GDP growth.

Finally, he has been using the referendum result to advocate that people supported his plan. It is true that people supported and trusted him (up to that point at least) but the referendum was at best confusing. The actual question posed for the people to answer was:

Should the plan be accepted, which European commission, European central bank and International Monetary Fund submitted to Eurogroup on 25.06.2015 and consists of two parts, which together form their full proposal?
The first document is titled ""Reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond"" and the second is titled ""Preliminary debt sustainability analysis"".


This was the question, that the median Greek (around 41 years old) in ONE WEEK had to come with an answer. in addition, Tsipras was promising that a No vote would simultaneously give us leverage versus the Europeans as well as keeping us in the EU.

&gt;If overthrowing democratically elected governments isn't classified as bullying, then destroying their own satellite in space sure as hell isn't.

Okay, so your argument is that destroying your own satellite in space isn't bullying because overthrowing a democratic government isn't bullying?

There's two things you need so show then.

1) The line of reasoning that shows that given overthrowing a democratic government isn't bullying therefore blowing up your own satellite isn't bullying.

2) That overthrowing a democratic government isn't bullying.

You haven't done either.

No, to show that I made a clear attempt to mislead.

&gt; I have done it AFTER seeing your poor arguments, clearly biased arguments.

This is where you're wrong. You have many dots to connect. The basis of your arguments so far is    
1) putting lives at risk and science more expensive when you're not getting your way with international diplomacy is ""inconsiderate"" but not ""bullying"".

This is a total redefinition of the terms.

and

2) other countries are bullying so China isn't

This doesn't follow.

&amp;nbsp;   

In the past 20 years, the pharmaceutical clinical trials industry has shifted dramatically in terms of geography. Experiments that were once conducted ethically, in Western countries, have now been shipped overseas where pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations often operate lawlessly. During this time, the Clintons received millions of dollars from these corporations, and billions of tax dollars were siphoned off in the name of helping the countries build health care infrastructure. It’s all for exploitation.

### **AUG 19, 2007 | [Hillary on Health Care](http://archive.is/8hIw4) | THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY PROJECT**

**Hillary introduced legislation -- now enacted into law -- which ensures prescription drugs are safe for children:** **As First Lady and Senator, Clinton successfully introduced and helped pass legislation protecting kids from drugs that have not first been tested on children. In 2003, Clinton introduced the Pediatric Research Equity Act which gave the FDA authority to secure pediatric studies and labeling of drugs that are widely used for children.** This legislation was signed into law in December 2003. In 2007, she introduced the Pediatric Research Improvement Act to make ""make permanent the Food and Drug Administration's authority to ensure that drugs marketed for pediatric use are safe and effective for children."" [S.650, introduced 3/18/03, passed Senate by unanimous consent on 7/23/03, became P.L. 108-155 on 12/3/03. AP 11/19/03; Clinton release 3/27/07]

&amp;nbsp;  

**Hillary fought to ensure all children receive critical immunizations:** Clinton spearheaded the Administration's 1993 Childhood Immunization Initiative and childhood immunizations rates are now at an historic high. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 90 percent or more of America's toddlers received the most critical doses of each of the routinely recommended vaccines in 1996, 1997, and again in 1998 -surpassing the Administration's 1993 goal. Since becoming a Senator in 2001, Clinton has introduced or cosponsored over 10 pieces of legislation to promote immunization awareness and provide for emergency vaccine supplies.

Kitzinger1,,,"I get most of what you say but... and this is a big but..

You talk about violent fascism.

I never saw that.  We had nut jobs on both sides who have done killings but those are singular people.  I call them the outliers.

Growing up I never saw large groups of Fascist beating people in the street, breaking windows, burning buildings.  About the most violent thing I've seen was when Geraldo got his nose broken on TV.

So, if people are going to say that Antifa is a reactionary movement against violent fascists then I would like to see it.  I would like to see Conservatives running down people in the street and beating them bloody.

I don't believe Antifa is a reactionary movement to violent fascist.  These are the people who are causing violence and property destruction.  I don't even consider the group anti-fascist because the methods they use and the ideology they want to bring to replace the US is very much fascist.  It's not like they are trying to hide what their long term intentions are either.  They are open about it.

Here is a chant they say:

No Trump. No Wall. No USA at all.

You don't get any blunter than that.

Let's talk about a couple of the signs though:

My Heroes Kill Cops.

and

Liberals get a bullet too.

Most people don't have time for bullshit.  They go to work, feed the kids, and go to sleep.  Most of the people living in this world are really really boring.  They are not going to rise up and try to overthrow anything.  Hell, they don't even give a shit about a war we should have won in 2002 but still at it 17 years later.  Nobody gave a shit about Libya and most people didn't give a shit about Iraq.  In fact most of the people are quite happy in their boring little lives.  They have work, they have food, and they have a really nice house.  Compared to most of the world they are sitting pretty.

Who are the outragers?  Young, idealistic people who want to make a difference.  Maybe they took the wrong classes in college, maybe they found out that looks do matter and if you show up for an interview with rings and tattoos that the work that is available for you is very very restricted.

Some of those truths can be downright brutal when you are young and just getting smacked around by it.  God help those kids whose parents always told them they were special, that they could be anything they want, and that who you are inside is what matters.

Those fucking lies don't do any child growing up any good.  Tell your child that there is going to be people smarter and dumber than them.  There is people who are going to be richer and there is going to be people that are poorer. 
 Have compassion for both.  That failure is a learning experience not something to be ashamed of.  Tell your kids that some jobs are way better than others.  Tell them that the job doesn't define who they are but is a way for them to pay for the hobbies they love.  That being a famous movie star comes about by winning the genetic lottery system and for every movie star there is a thousand others whose dreams were crushed into the dirt.

I'm not outraged at the rich...  Why should I?  My friends have good jobs, I live in a nice house, and I have two cars and a dog.  I do not need everyone to be getting the same wage to be happy.  I don't need everything to be perfect and fair because I've seen what that kind of thinking brings about and it is a horror that is simply unimaginable.  Best thing that ever happened to me was spending those three years in Europe travelling into the Eastern Bloc countries from 1993 into 1995.  Taught me more than anything I could get from a text book.  It was a fundamentally trans-formative experience.

I don't think outrage can be turned around and be used for good.  Outrage means a loss of rational thought.  It's an emotion.  Thinking doesn't even enter the picture.  You are just lashing out.  That is what three year old children do when they don't get their way.  They throw fits.

We are supposed to be adults and we should act like it.  If you don't like a law then work to change it.  If you think we are headed to extinction then join a research group and work to get the problem sufficient attention.  If you think the rich are jetting off with the riches then work to put laws that will barricade their flight path.

---

&gt;* The legal persecution of Catalan language and culture in this era began in Northern Catalonia because France wanted the population living in their new territories to speak French.

&gt;* In the other Catalan-speaking territories the widespread persecution of the Catalan language and culture began in 1716 with the enactment of the so-called Nueva Planta Decrees, a package of laws passed by Philip V after he succeeded the Spanish Imperial throne following a battle known as the Siege of Barcelona.

&gt;* In 1896, the General Directory of Post Offices and Telegraphs in Spain issued a circular banning the use of the Catalan language in telephone calls.

&gt;* According to UNESCO, today Catalan is the most widely used regional or minority language in Europe, with between seven and 10 million speakers in Spain, France and Sardinia.

&gt;* Given the situation, the Catalan regional government decided to disobey the court's decision, as they stressed the necessity for Catalonia's bid for independence to come to a democratic conclusion.

Lugonn,,,"&gt; Except for the SoO where Alliance and Horde worked in tandem and came to a peaceful resolution together. And WoD where the Horde and Alliance manage to kill Archimonde (again).

You know it's sad when you have to cherrypick examples when the Horde didn't stab their allies in the back.

&gt;The hell did Vol'jin do? The hell did Sylvanas do?

Ashran happened on Vol'jin's watch. The Alliance was looking for artifacts to defeat the Iron Horde. The Horde noticed and projected ""hang on, if we were doing that without the Alliance's help we would use those artifacts to attack the Alliance instead! THAT MUST BE WHAT THEY'RE DOING!"" and attacked.

Sylvanas immediately used Dalaran as a staging point to attack Odyn, jeopardising the entire planet for her selfish needs.

&gt;No, they didn't. Some operatives linked to Garrosh committed an act of war against the Alliance using Dalaran as the means. This means, what, that every Sunreaver is guilty of treason or breaking neutrality? It was Jaina's idea to house the Divine Bell in an Alliance city in the first place. Want a breach of neutrality? Start there.

Dalaran isn't HURR NUTRAL. They're a sovereign nation that can do whatever they want. If Dalaran's head of state wishes to use its portal network to assist the Alliance they are allowed to do so. What happened here is that the Horde committed an act of war against Dalaran. Not some overzealous captain, this was an order from the highest, and *only*, authority in the Horde. As such Horde representatives in Dalaran were first exiled, and when they refused arrested. Those who resisted arrest were killed, that's the way it goes. These were not the prison camps for Japanese in WW2, any elf that wasn't stupid enough to demand the right to represent the Horde was fine.

&gt;Why does this add up?

They didn't wear the wrong bloody tabard they were an active political faction. Guess what happened to the Japanese ambassadors after Pearl Harbor? They were arrested and deported. Had they violently resisted arrest they would've been killed.

&gt;The Forsaken were bound to no ruler following their release from the Lich King. With Terenas dead, Arthas forsaking his claim to the throne and Calia gone, there was no ruling aristocracy. If the military didn't have the strength to deny another military from taking what they had, they didn't deserve to have it to begin with. Besides, not only was Garithos a tremendously incompetent racist, he was a colossal failure that would've done more harm than good for the continued interests of the Alliance in the eastern kingdoms if he was still alive today.

With Arthas an exiled traitor and Lordaeron in shambles the country is under martial law. Garithos, being the ranking military officer, was the interim head of state until a proper successor could be found and crowned.

lmao all of those graphs are using cherrypicked UAH or RSS data (ie the only 2 outliers in the entire data, both of which are outliers due to diurnal drift of the satellites fucking up the readings). Also Al Gore isn't a scientist, Greenland temperatures are not global and the graph stops in 1950 (present is 1950 for climate science), no increase in tornadoes or drought in the US doesn't disprove anything, in fact extreme weather events GLOBALLY have been increasing as a result of GLOBAL warming.

These are the standard denier arguments. Cherrypick data from UAH and RSS, cherrypick local temperatures or weather charts (Greenland ice core for example), show irrelevant data (such as CO2 warming less as it increases as though this matters when it starts at the relatively low 280ppm pre industrial or the fact that man made emissions are a small amount of total CO2, even though this amount throws off the equilibrium). Deniers have no arguments, they only have blog posts and cherrypicking

OliverSparrow,  reward1,,"The study doesn't really show that: it shows that people affiliate with others who share their world view. Not stated but implied, this is stronger in the US than the other three nations. Political parties are a crude proxy for general affiliation. 

Parties are brands, like Coca Cola or Nike. They try to bundle up all of the diversity of a nation into two or three packages. This, despite the fact that education policy and attitudes to defence and security have nothing to do with each other, and have no correlation in populations when measured. So parties are constructs, and they are constructed to maximise differences and try to fence the population into two corrals. 

US political parties are way off screen for most of the other developed countries, which have a centre of weight that is quite different. Below, I post a text that I wrote about the different meaning of the word 'liberal' in Europe and the US; and what the Europeans see as antithetical to ""liberal"". The implication is either that the US population is globally atypical, or that its political parties are. :)

--------------

'Liberal' outside of America has two quite unrelated meanings. An economic liberal likes free trade, markets, clear regulation. A social liberal wants to extend tacit and formal rules of conduct, but nevertheless agrees with the notion of rules and boundaries, merely believing that they should be wider.

Economic liberals are different from economic statists and economic conservatives. Statists distrust market mechanisms and invisible hands, and want explicit management of everything and anything on which their minds alight: jobs, welfare, healthcare, education, housing, energy policy and so on and on. The manager they have in mind is the state, so long as it agrees with their values. Economic conservatives also distrust market mechanisms, but do so because these generate uncomfortable change. They tend to see an economy as a family's finances writ large.

Social liberals are opposed by two groups. There are the social conservatives, who hold to established of 'golden age' values, to a supposed absolute and unimprovable rule set particular to their  the society, to their particular religious dispensation. They respect authority even when they know it to be factually mistaken, and often repress facts when these are uncomfortable.

Second, there are the authoritarian collectivists, whose favourite phrase is ""we must"" and who are for ever emitting demands as to how other people should behave. Many are young, look radical but are in fact normative, repressive and generally nitpicking ideologues.

There is an unhappy conjunction in this. Authoritarian collectivists are natural economic statists. Many state services are permeated with these people, from schools through health to other social services, as is journalism, religion and politics. A century ago they would have been the religious. Now, that path is unsatisfactory as people are disinclined to obey fiat rules and so they seek other soap boxes from which to shout directions at the rest of us.

_Enferian_,,,"There are 2 parts when it comes to luck:

1. Rift fishing (pure luck)

2. Game knowledge (making your own luck)

________________________________

Rift fishing is in short the process of opening a rift seeing the map and mobs it has and deciding if you want to run it or leave game and try a new one.

This is inevitable after your gear is nearing maximum optimisation. By that I mean having all items ancient (expect rings/amulet that are harder to get), having the proper stats (e.g. hitting the desired cdr without missing more than 1 crit roll). 

Before that point there is generally some room for improvement on gear that can give you a few GR lvls.

The highest clears in the LBs at the end of a season are done in the ""dream rift"". A rift that not only has good mob types, tilesets and an ""easy"" rift guardian, but also spawn the right pylons at a favorable order or at favorable spots (e.g. conduit pylon in an open map so you can get lots of progress and power pylon before the boss spawns so you can down it faster).

Keep in mind that ""dream rifts"" are super rare. If you want to fish for one then you have to be confident in your ability to clear it. You can't affort to make any mistakes when attempting one and therefore you need to practice and inevitably fail several rifts before you get to the point where you should fish for rifts. This doesn't mean that if you are 5 mins behind the timer you should still complete a bad rift, but you should start it anyway and try to recognise what is giving you the most trouble and if there is something you can do about it. 

___________________________________

Game knowledge on the other hand affects your split second decisions and overall gameplay. Some decisions are easy (e.g. skipping juggernaut elites when you play blood lance necro) and some are harder (e.g. deciding if a pack of X-type of mobs is worth killing or not and if its best to kite it to another pack further ahead or just skip it).

Game knowledge comes with time, simple as that. You can read about several things but experiencing them in game is required. For example even though maps are random they follow some rules. Once you get a feel of those rules you 'll minimise the times that you hit a dead end and have to backtrack. You 'll start to recognise the spots at which pylons can spawn in each map and you may run ahead a bit to see if there is one that you can take advantage of.

If the build you are playing is a slow RG killer, you may even have to decide if you want to leave a mob pack near a power pylon that you found in the 1st floor so you can come back to it, kill it and spawn the RG there so you can kill it faster with the help of the pylon.

Take a look at [this](http://warpath.eu/index.html) to know how much progression each monster type gives. Its old but I cant rememebr of anything that has changed. There is also a tier list in the FAQ. Maybe /u/silec (the main creator of the site [(relevant reddit post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/49f9kj/project_finished_complete_list_of_monster/)) or /u/wudijo (co-creator of the tier list and probably more) can tell you if the info is still accurate.

You also need to learn how many hits you can take from different mob types. No matter how good you are, you will get hit. Knowing how many hits you can withstand lets you know how many mobs you can afford to herd together and if you can skip a floor level or a pack without dying.
_________________________
Conclusion:

When you can't progress due to gear you need to progress thanks to a combination of skill and luck

Settler colonial ideologies paint Indigenous and First Nations peoples as ""primitive"" as a means to dehumanise them and legitimise their dispossession. 

Similarly, the ideas that Indigenous Australians lacked agricultural practices and architecture are not only products of colonial ideology, seeking to delegitimize Indigenous connection to Country, but also factually incorrect. 
Author Bruce Pascoe's research into early colonial explorer journals has found a lot of evidence supporting claims that pre-colonization communities engaged in practices which plainly fit European definitions of agriculture. One highlight is an early explorer recording riding through fields of grain which reached the flanks of his horse, stooked together in bundles for harvest like he had seen in England. 
Interestingly, he also explores the ways in which these colonialists tried to later misrepresent what they had seen, to legitimize the seizure of land in accordance with British laws.

Similarly, recent archaeological research in Western Victoria has provided amazing evidence for Indigenous engineering and domestic housing on a large scale, in association with sophisticated aquaculture farming system, capable of providing reliable and abundant resources.

Nesta última notícia eu retiro a seguinte citação:

&gt; **REFLORESTAÇÃO NO PAÚL NÃO DEIXA ARDER**
&gt;
&gt; A Associação de Produtores Florestais do Paúl (APFP) é um bom exemplo na protecção da floresta e prevenção dos fogos florestais, pelo que **o seu presidente desafia o ministro da Administração Interna, António Costa, a conhecer no terreno o trabalho desenvolvido.**
&gt;
&gt;A APFP é responsável por 50 mil hectares de floresta e na última década reflorestou mais de três mil hectares de terrenos nas freguesias do Sul do concelho da Covilhã onde o fogo não chegava há mais de dois anos. Este ano, o incêndio que em Julho assolou a zona de Seia e alastrou ao concelho da Covilhã, destruiu 100 hectares na freguesia de Casegas, **mas “o trabalho desenvolvido pela associação durante o Inverno na abertura de caminhos e limpeza da mata impediu que o fogo alastrasse para o interior da floresta”, disse António Covita, presidente da APFP.**
&gt;
&gt; Nos três mil hectares reflorestados há pinheiros e outras árvores resinosas acompanhadas, à beira dos caminhos, de várias fileiras de árvores folhosas, como cerejeiras bravas e carvalhos. Contas feitas, foram plantados dois milhões de pinheiros e um milhão de outras espécies. O ordenamento aposta na diversidade de espécies que “é a única salvação para a floresta”, defende António Covita.
&gt;
&gt; “Não é apenas com a abertura de aceiros que se resolve o problema dos fogos florestais”, salienta o responsável, que acrescenta: **“Se o fogo aparecer nestes terrenos terá mais dificuldade em progredir e o combate será mais rápido e eficaz, como ficou comprovado no incêndio em Casegas”. A mancha verde está compartimentada e limpa, tem uma ampla rede viária, fruto de um trabalho feito em parceria com os proprietários.**

Portanto, a solução para todo este problema já foi alertada directamente ao António Costa, enquanto ministro da administração interna do governo PS de Sócrates, há mais de 10 anos.  Ainda assim, além de ele ter tomado a iniciativa de fazer rigorosamente zero sobre o problema e assim ser responsável directo pelo agravamento do problema, ele ainda fez promessas sobre o combate que são simultaneamente fúteis e por cumprir.

* The weather here is rather disappointing, but the lack of sun is what hurts me most. And the wind, always cold and chilling.
* The city becomes a joke during the festivals — very hard to move around and expensive if you want to go out (it's expensive anyway :) One way is to avoid the centre but that can't always be done.
* It's not great if you're a driver, either, or a cyclist. Narrow streets and never-ending roadworks.
* IT job market is rather small and there isn't much variety, but you have options of working for big finance/insurance companies, public sector or start-ups. However getting in without UK-based experience will be hard.
* Brexit. No one really knows what's going to happen.
* Prices of properties for both renting and buying. Plus, difficulties with finding flats that are dry, clean and warm. Relatively poor standards of build (especially if compared with continental Europe).

Edinburgh is beautiful and it appears quite livable at first, but if you want more than mainstream culture and typical shopping options, you'd become disappointed after a while. I still love it in some unexplained way when the sun is out but travelled quite a lot I can say that both from the professional perspective (I am a service designer/UX person) and quality of life/price ratio Edinburgh isn't very high on my list anymore.

Sorry to break it to you, but no-one gives a shit about European football in England outside of ""What is happening that affects my club?"" But by all means, no doubt you have ample evidence of that... like the huge match threads for Monaco matches in which people rave about him, or the frequent and accessible coverage given to Ligue 1 in the UK, or the associated [mentions in the press?](https://imgur.com/v3lNlUx.png)

&gt;You can try justify however you want but when players take pay cuts just to leave, and you can't sign anyone after the season starts...

Which are things you believe because Twitter told you. Who are all these players Arsenal were trying to sign after the season started? Because I'm pretty sure Wenger told everyone that Monaco refused to sell Lemar weeks ago. So aside from that:

1. Lemar.
2. ???

&gt;Is keeping a player who doesn't want to play for you

Again, which is something you've learnt from the media, not the player. [Here's what it looks like when a player actually wants to leave a club...](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4787112/DIEGO-COSTA-INTERVIEW-Chelsea-striker-talks-Sportsmail.html)

knechtsunderstudy,,🕋,"&gt; He basically blamed you guys for it saying Serbs were oppressing everyone and trying to turn Yugoslavia into some sort of greater Serbia.

Well, he's half-right there. Serbia wasn't oppressing Croatia. However, Slobodan Milošević did (successfully) try to force a Serbian hegemony. Switching from a hardcore antinationalist Communist position to a hugely nationalist pro-Serb position, he reduced the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina through the so-called ""Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution"" (which I can't summarize here, but do look it up yourself). Representatives of Croatia condemned it, and then Slobo doubled down, and then Croatia doubled down and then Slobo... well, after the more extreme Serbs living in Croatia started a mini-rebellion afraid of the Croat military strengthening (which started in apprehension of Serbian military strengthening), Serbia did attack and shit went to hell.

&gt; Also alot of Serbs are calling Croats traitors because they joined Nazi Germany.

Again, a tad more complicated, inglorious gave you a good overview on that. I'll just chime in: one of Slobo's most successful rhetorical techniques was invoking history as an omnipotent, always-repeating force (think ""time is a flat circle"") with us people merely historically-constrained players in our national destinies. World War Two ended in 1945. Slobo named the Croats of late 1980s actual Nazis (since their ancestors did run an atrocious concentration camp and were complicit in Nazi rule of Europe). That sped up the breakup of Yugoslavia since you don't want to be in a (con)federation with Nazis.

&gt; What do you think they should have done instead?

""They"" is far too accusatory - there were Croats in the resistance. The Croats of today aren't necessarily the Croats of the Pavelić Ustaša regime. In principle, don't join the Nazis and don't exterminate people.

&gt; And my final question is would it be better if Yugoslavia still existed or is it better split like today?

Who knows? Yugoslavia, after all, was a communist state, which meant a suppressed press, no free elections, an oversized influence of the Party - and Serbia, even in a nominally democratic and free system, has inherited those problems. Still, those things are much better today than then. When people lament the good Yugoslav days, they lament the dissolution of the strong economy (which wasn't as strong as they remember, but which was much more beneficial to the average worker), of the political influence Yugoslavia wielded (which would be weaker today in a possible Yugoslavia since the Cold War is over, but would be much greater than the influence of one-eighth of that), and of the camaraderie among nations (which was eroding since the 1980s, with a few cases even before that). In any case, what was lost wasn't lost in the breakup, it was lost in the fact it was a **violent** breakup.

**Whatttt is up my fellow keeb lovers!!**


With its classic beige tones and stylish splash of colour, the 9009 colourway designed by Reuters in the 90's has sure made an impression on this community. So much in fact, that the set is going for insane amounts of money on mechmarket. This really pains me everytime I see it since I absolutely adore simple sets like this and I know I'm not the only one not able to splash the cash on it.

There was a PBT GB on KeyClack some time ago but frankly, it really didn't look the same :(. So I decided to spend some times on getting things set up for another round of 9009. I am in talks with vendors for both the EU and the US, Dixiemech.com and mykeyboard.eu respectively, both of which are great guys and have been super helpful in this process. David from Mykeyboard will also be supplying matching keyboard sleeves and cables on both his site and on Dixiemech, both of which are handmade in Belgium  :).

I have already put in a quote about a week ago, and am waiting for a response. Don't worry, you won't be paying $180 for a GMK set here folks! The price range I'm trying to aim at is $140-150, this might not seem super low but please keep in mind that the USD-EUR is going down again and that we will be paying all necessary tax, something that doesn't seem to happen much in this community. This can make a 21% revenue difference  :p Either way, all is depended on GMK's quote. Let's hope they pleasantly surprise us :D

eremal,Bergen ,Bergen,"&gt;Du kan godt begynne å snakke om innvandring fra Tyskland og Nederland til Bergen. Jeg snakker om etnisk mangfold, noe jeg trodde i mitt forvirrede hode var samtaletemaet her.

Det er antagelig den største innvandringen vi har hatt til Norge før nå. I prosent var den også betydelig. Kulturelt stod vi også langt fjernere fra hverandre enn det vi gjør idag. 

&gt;Virkelig? Prøver du å fortelle meg at et gjennomsnittlig helsvart nabolag er mer velfungerende enn et nabolag som er 98% hvitt og 2% svart? Tar du i det hele tatt deg selv seriøst?

Nei men tilfellet er slik for nabolagene som hadde lavest tillit var 80% hvite og resten minoriteter. Dette iflg en follow-up studie med samme materiale.

&gt;Aha, du bærer på en psykotisk virkelighetsoppfatning der det er like sannsynlig at arabere og afrikanere blir som europeere i samme grad som europeere blir like andre europeere. Okidoki.

Spar meg. Du er gått tom for argumenter, og kaller meg psykotisk. Noe jeg av og til er. Uansett. På det tidspunktet en afrikaner eller en araber får ett europeisk statsborgerskap så er de per definisjon europeisk. Det på samme måte som dersom en tysker får norsk statsborgerskap så er vedkommende altså norsk.

&gt;Det er opp til innvandrere å delta i utdanningsløpet. Det er ingen som eksluderer dem.

Ja men du kritiserer jo på at de ikke lar seg integrere lett, når disse tallene har direkte sammenheng med utdanning og antall år i norge. Hent fram de samme tallene for 2. gen innvandrere, så skal vi heller snakke sammen. Hvis du snakker om at de kan gå på skole i hjemlandet så er jo tilfellet at de faktisk ikke kan det. 

&gt;Hvis du undersøker statistikker for vold- og voldtektskriminalitet i Oslo, vil du raskt finne ut at personer med norsk landbakgrunn utgjør en minoritet av gjerningspersonene. Personer med norsk landbakgrunn utjør ikke en minoritet av Oslos befolkning.

ConnardDechaine,lys,Fleur de lys,"« Pousse-toi de là que je m’y mette »

Quelques portefeuilles plus tard (emploi, affaires européennes, enseignement supérieur), il s’est mis à dos presque tous ses collègues du gouvernement. « Opportuniste », « arriviste », « ambitieux »… M. Wauquiez empile les qualificatifs et finit par se fracasser sur Nicolas Sarkozy, un autre spécialiste de la communication moderne.

Le 1er février 2012, en pleine campagne présidentielle, il fonce devant les caméras pour annoncer la reprise de l’usine Lejaby, coupant l’herbe sous le pied du président de la République. Un coup de téléphone et une colère plus tard, son bannissement de la Sarkozie est acté. Une mise à l’écart renforcée à l’automne après son ralliement à François Fillon.

A entendre certains de ses proches, le président de la région Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes aurait appris de ses erreurs de jeunesse. « Oui, il a eu un côté “Pousse-toi de là que je m’y mette.” Mais lui déteste très peu de personnes. En se replaçant dans le sillage de Nicolas Sarkozy, il a pu prendre le temps de parler avec les élus », explique un membre de son équipe.

En 2014, M. Wauquiez soutient le retour de M. Sarkozy, gagne sa région en s’alliant avec les centristes et tente patiemment de rattraper son retard. Tous les trimestres, il invite des élus à écouter des personnalités telles que Michèle Tribalat, une démographe dont les travaux sont appréciés de l’extrême droite, François-Xavier Bellamy, un professeur de philosophie proche de La Manif pour tous, mais aussi l’historien Marcel Gauchet.

Maladroit

Toutes les deux semaines, il réunit aussi sa garde rapprochée d’élus, une quinzaine de personnes dont les députés européens Brice Hortefeux (par ailleurs vice-président du conseil régional d’Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes) et Philippe Juvin, et les anciens députés du Rhône, battus en juin, Philippe Meunier et Philippe Cochet. Ses soutiens affichés récemment, tels les députés Eric Ciotti (Alpes-Maritimes) et Guillaume Larrivé (Yonne), sont eux aussi issus du sarkozysme et de l’aile droitière.

Pour enrichir son réseau toujours restreint, Laurent Wauquiez a passé son été à charmer les grands élus au téléphone, mais a aussi menacé des jeunes délégués de les exclure s’il ne le soutenait pas. « Il essaye de fédérer mais il le fait de façon parfois très maladroite. Il soutient un mec contre un autre pour une investiture puis envoie un texto aux deux pour dire qu’il s’est battu pour eux. Les deux ressortent fâchés », témoigne un cadre du parti.

« Il consulte, il écoute, il fait beaucoup de progrès », rétorque Brice Hortefeux, qui l’a rapproché de Nicolas Sarkozy : « Ceux qui lui étaient hostiles sont maintenant réservés.

nipsen,,,"..det mest problematiske med hvordan politikken fremstilles her (som i media normalt sett) er at man blander sammen arbeidsinnvandring, naturalisering som statsborger, og flyktningepolitikk.

Det er utrolig komplisert å bli statsborger i Norge for folk med begrensede midler, eller som ikke har en jobb i utgangspunktet. Siden lenge før 2000, har det egentlig vært nøyaktig det samme - du blir ikke Norsk statsborger utenom ved giftemål, ellers er det så godt som spesielle forhold inne i bildet. 

Samtidig har vi til en hver tid en relativt stor mengde med arbeidsinnvandrere med midlertidig opphold inne. De får også fornyet midlertidig opphold, og har også rett på velferdstilbud. Men man blir ikke statsborger, og kan potensielt bli kastet ut på relativt kort sikt. Dette er et stille, men økende problem i forhold til svart arbeid, dårlige kontrakter, osv. Og stadig like fantasifulle løsninger blir satt i verk for å bøte på dette - da typisk i videre uthuling av arbeidsmiljølov og vern for fagorganiserte. Som selvsagt ikke er en løsning. Og som resulterer helt spesifikt i en økende permanent økonomisk underklasse i Norge. Det samme gjelder mulighet for studenter å ta fag med minimal støtte og godkjenning i Norge, i en periode. Folk blir stadig kastet ut midt i et studieløp, avhengig av departementstrikseri med definisjoner. Dette diskuteres veldig sjeldent.

Til motsetning diskuteres flyktningepolitikk veldig ofte. Her er det snakk om en forsvinnende liten del, som igjen er gitt midlertidig beskyttelsesbehov i en periode. Av flyktninger som naturaliseres, så dreier det seg om en enda mindre del enn de som naturaliseres etter arbeidsinnvandring - og faktum er at dette kommer av at flyktninger ikke faktisk har rett til å jobbe mens de mottar stønader. Det finnes mange eksempler på at flyktninger ikke kan ansettes i en jobb de blir tilbudt, fordi de ikke har opphold og derfor ikke kan få en kontrakt lovlig. Eller som må dokumentere jobb før de kan få papirer som gjør at jobb er mulig, osv. Dette løses innimellom på den måten at folk tildeles permanent opphold i en periode - de fullfører så utdannelse, får en jobb, og tjener penger, betaler skatt, osv. Men mister så statsborgerskap og opphold om dette faller fra hverandre en periode. Om folk kommer inn og driver en bedrift med egne midler er det ca. samme konklusjon - dette må foregå i så mange år før en kan bli statsborger at det ikke egentlig er et alternativ. Så ender alt for mange i å bli presset ut av kostnader for leie, eller annet, til at de ender på NAV. Så mister de muligheten for å trekke med seg familie, og har følgende valg: leve på NAV i ti år og bli Norsk, eller dra igjen.

For andre stiller situasjonen seg slik: en kommer med ingenting, tilbyr ingenting, og forbitrer seg ned i en tragisk situasjon gjennom statlige ordninger i årevis, før en ender opp i en tross alt bedre situasjon enn i hjemlandet. 

Denne delen av flyktningepolitikken er et problem, i at den på en side er for streng og hindrer integrering. Mens den på den andre siden er for ""liberal"", i at den oppfordrer til å ikke gjøre noe som helst. Jeg kjenner opp til flere studenter, flinke arbeidere, og solid utdannede som har endt opp permanent på NAV, før de reiser til et annet land igjen. De som er tilfreds med å NAVe blir. 

Åpenbart ønsker vi ikke dette - men det dreier seg altså om en knøttliten del av de som faktisk kommer inn. Og at politikken som eksisterer faktisk rensker ut folk som vil tilby noe. Ikke bare i flyktningepolitikken, men også i arbeidsinnvandringspolitikken - slik at vi velger oss ut bevisst å importere hyggelige små negerbarn vi kan stake på håret, som aldri vokser opp og blir store og farlige, osv.

Men vær klar over følgende: arbeidslivet er veldig avhengig av østeuropeere og diverse som kan komme å jobbe. Politikken vi fører i arbeidslivet har en tendens til å oppfordre til å presse lønningene i lavtlønnede yrker ned (mens man skyver mellomstore lønninger opp med minimale enkeltbeløp, på bekostning av lavere sjikter), og det er en dårlig utvikling fra et rent arbeidspolitisk ståsted.

Mens at ideen om hvordan kulturmessige motsetninger kommer inn og finansieres gjennom velferdsbudsjettet er fullstendig gal: det dreier seg om et forsvinnende lite antall av folk med midlertidige oppholdstillatelser som utgår når opprinnelseslandets sikkerhetssituasjon forbedres (og også før dette skjer, takket være triksing i UNE/UDI). Dette er en nasjonal krise for Norge, og er et internasjonalt lodd om beinet på norske diplomater, at vi offisielt har gått bort fra FN-pakten i spørsmål rundt flyktninger over populistisk høyrepolitikk.

Samtidig: Norge er besatt over tid av innvandrere. Veldig få i Norge kan, til deres eget hell, skilte med bønder i forfedre fra samme gård helt tilbake til 1700. Før og etter dette dreier det seg om inn- og utvandring i masse og flokk, som dominerer alt i fra handelstand til akademikere, selv om de selv opptrer og kaller seg norske. Slik har det for å være helt ærlig vært siden Snorre, og det bør vi være fornøyde med: at ikke samtlige som bor i Norge er gjenværende vikinger som ikke gadd å reise ut, men var fornøyde med å karre i jorda på gården sin.

På samme måten: England, Wales, Irland, osv. er overrepresentert når en går flere ledd tilbake. Etter krigen snakker vi om nordiske land hovedsaklig. 

Men det er fremdeles den samme tendensen som etter 1900 og unionsoppløsningen: et nytt blad i historien blir skrevet, og det kommer an på hvordan vi forholder oss til det som land, om ""innvandrere"" blir sidestilt til en underklasse av subb, av at tradisjonell fremmedfrykt paralyserer oss for en gangs skyld. Eller om vi integrerer de som ønsker å komme hit for å tilby noe på lang sikt, slik som Norge alltid har gjort tidligere, til ufattelig vellykkethet.

Motsetningen i den forstand ser ut til å bunne i at alt er forandret, og at vi skal kaste omlag 2000 år tradisjon på havet, når folk plutselig ser for brune ut i huden. Og jeg er nok litt skuffet over det. Ikke minst som en person som kan mye om norsk historie, og som kan Snorre ut og inn, så er det vanskelig å fatte at folk oppriktig mener at vi snakker om en apokalyptisk, irreversibel tendens mot ruin - om Norge forholder seg nøkternt til internasjonale traktater av den typen som vitterlig gjør at Norge eksisterer som en uavhengig internasjonal stat. 

Det blir for enkelt. Så selv om det eksisterer problemer med innvandrere - å mene oppriktig at vi skal bedrive en slags proteksjonistisk, fremmedfiendtlig politikk på kort sikt for å bevare Norge... det er et feilslag av dimensjoner. Det er unorsk på så mange plan, og en så stor trussel mot det som faktisk er Norge slik det har vært i lang tid, at denne holdningen i seg selv - om at vi ""kun"" kan ta inn fremmede elementer om de gifter seg med en Nordmann, som kan underholde dem økonomisk - er ødeleggende for det Norge faktisk er og har vært historisk sett.

Det samme gjelder politisk engasjement: om du tror, oppriktig, at ""kulturen"" må (eller kan) forsvares via lovendringer og statlig styring, da har vi tapt på et så fundamentalt plan at Norge har opphørt å eksistere allerede.

Så ja, du har blitt lurt. Islam er en grei religion som går kristne pietister en høy gang, Arabere på gaten i Homs har mer kunnskap om demokrati enn den jevne Nordmannen, Kinesere er høflige, hardt arbeidende, intelligente, og gir deferens til alle. Og Østeuropeere jobber hardt som faen. 

Så det gjelder å være bevisst noe annet enn forholdene den ""offentlige, statlige inngripen"" kan kontrollere, og å ta del i det lokalt. Og samtidig ikke avstå fra dette på grunn av fordommer, som nordmann fra Norge eller andre steder, mens man stemmer på partier som vil forsure det arbeidet så mye som mulig med fåfengte forbud og vedtak sentralt. 

For dette - kontroll fra og ukritisk deferens for sentralisert makt - det har Norge aldri vært før. Og gjør vi Norge til dette, da opphører Norge å eksistere for alltid. Og vi får til slutt det som står i CIA's factbook om Norge: et oljerikt kongevelde med en modell for statlig distribusjon av statlige inntekter som kommer innbyggerne til gode noen prosetpoeng over det andre oljerike kongedømmer har.",True,False,,1,1504269013,,False,0,dmf6h4g,False,t3_6xarn0,t3_6xarn0,1506398659,0,False,norge,t5_2qh94,

I argue all the time that the commonly accepted definition is wrong and that anatolia is more a part of the european continent than the asian continent. But I also think it's a silly distinction to begin with, as Europe and Asia are on the same plate. 

The real definitions of the continents (limiting to the ones relevant to this conversation) should be Eurasia, Africa, Arabia, and India. But since Eurasia is impractically large, it makes pragmatic sense to split it in half. The Urals are an obvious boundary to pick, as are the Caucuses, and then it's just a question of whether that line should go from the Caucuses down to Adana or go through the Bosphorus.

I mean, I don't really care at all, I just make that argument.

233C,,,"&gt; I'm not sure this is a reasonable request.  

My point is that intermittent renewable actually rely heavily on back up capacity to complete production (mostly coal like in green champion Denmark, mostly  gas, from fracking, in todays renewable). Looking at the installed capacity is mislead because it ignores what is used when not 100% or above is produced. If we want to replace a plant with a capacity factor of 90%, you should show where all your power will come from, 90% of the time, not few hours of record production per years, like the media likes to talk about.  

Indeed, intermittence should be resolved with extra capacity, until reaching a point where, at any time, something is being produced somewhere, to provide to the entire grid. This is what I was hoping for until I saw the previous graph on wind power across all Europe: even considering a huge 65GW capacity network from Spain to Denmark, there is no network compensation effect, it is either every body produce (y a rough average of 10GW) or nobody. And the variability is deadly to the grid, that is why when renewable reach about 20%, it becomes imperative to pay some producers to not produce. Nukes cannot quickly follow such variations, that is why fossils love renewable : once 20-30% is reached, the rest is free lunch for cheap gas. The environmentalists just destroy the main fossil competition, in exchange for a tiny share of the market; and the media keep the story about record capacity and ""days of more than 100% of its needs"" headlines. Also, because how grid works, gas plants end up being the steadily ""insurance"" : they get paid just to stand by, in case they are needed. Golden goose for any investor.  

The power not produced must come from somewhere, the extra power produced must go somewhere. So if networks capacity doesn't help, we need storage. You are right that batteries are not the end of all storage. I was just pointing out that the best estimate in 2040 are actually depressingly ridicule compared to what would be needed.  
Let's imagine storing during the day what would be needed for the night. Say a 1GW plant running for a 8h night, thats 8e9Wh, even at [300](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery) Wh/kg or 700Wh/l, that's 26,700 tons! or 11,400m3 of batteries!  
As for pumping, 8e9Wh equals 3e13J, say you want to store water at [828m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings), given [m x g x h = E](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/gpot.html), you would need about 3 millions tons (or m3) of water, or a cube of 150m in side. This is to replace a single plant (coal, nukes, whatever); and this energy must be produced during the day while at the same time providing for the daily needs (and assuming 100% storage efficiency). 


Again, look at Denmark and ask yourself :why this uber green country isn't 100% wind since decades ago? Did they spend all their money on subsidies for nuclear too? 

&gt; If we really retire tons of old nuclear, then renewables will be much more than 40%


Are you talking about shutting them down and simply not replace them? This is also a dangerous  wishful thinking. Hoping for something, and setting oneself for a disappointment when the economical effects of cutting a third of our energy out; and the good will electorate applaud at the quick and dirty solution found at the last minute.  

If we can ""shut and not replace"" a plant, shouldn't we do it with coal first?

Aquilo que falam, ""quer saber quem são seus amigos de verdade? pare de beber."" é verdade. Você para de beber e, de repente, as pessoas começam e te olhar de uma maneira diferente.

Não precisa ser 'parar de beber'. Qualquer atitude que você tenha que seja diferente da norma, qualquer comportamento que você possua que seja diferente do padrão, vai afastar as pessoas que só se interessam superficialmente por você.

É o típico relacionamento baseado em interesses. Enquanto você provê o que esses ""amigos"" acham interessante, eles estão ao seu lado. No momento que você para, eles dispersam.

É natural. Eu costumava me questionar porque meu pai tinha tão poucos amigos, porque os pais dos meus amigos pareciam ter poucos amigos, enquanto eu tinha tantos.

A resposta é que, ao longo da vida, você vai separando o joio do trigo e deixando ao seu lado só as pessoas que importam e que se importam realmente com você.

One concern I would have about Amsterdam is that it could attract a lot of ""new"" audiences who just go to LCS to get high/ visit the red light district and aren't actually that passionate about esports or bring other issues to the scene (people smoking weed on site for example which could in return repel some of the previous audience). People will make fun of this but there is actually a lot of tourism going on by people who just go there to get high and party.

Regarding Brussels, I could imagine that it would be too expensive to hold the EU LCS there, but if money wasn't an issue, then that would surely be a great location.

**Check my profile, there you will see my mechmarket post and pick which keyboard you want!!**

Update!!!! FINAL UPDATE HERE!!!
post on /r/mechmarket after 3 hours at 10pm at London time!!!!!!!

Update: Hi guys! So a lot of you started to write- pm me, inform about the prices, can I have dibs on those 2 things etc... so I won't let my greedy little kid start commanding who gets what and start changing prices according my greedy thoughts. I will post an update today. After 5 hours I will post, on r/mechmarket. I will also pm everyone who asked me (don't be sad if I don't answer you, I'm still cleaning those keebs and testing). The first who get the pick - is the owner (pm only for reservations) of it. BUT understand that shipping is NOT included and the reservation stands only for 1 week (7days). 

I will definitely pm everyone 3minutes exactly before I post on mechmarket. 

AND I will also pick a winner for free (only need to pay for shipping cause I'm cheap bastard) IBM model M (don't know which one). I will post an update post where and how you can win it. Why I'm doing this is cause I believe in grace and this community has given me a lot of it and I want to give t back to you. And what the heck- I got them like 20 :D

See ya soon! :)

Edit 2: cleaning, pricing etc took too much time. Will post after an hour or 2 after I take a break and make myself some good old food ;D I will still pm everyone who will ask me in any in of my 3 latest posts!!! ;)

Edit3: Sorry guys... I'm too tired and exausted of everything. Can't post anything right now. Will keep you all updated on everything BUT I can't do it right now (I do have a private life too). As for models etc- I have all of them stacked up. Prices range from 40eur (cheapest) to 70eur for other keyboards (in first sale)


BUT here is the whole sheet of what kind of keyboards I do have. I might not sell some cause I want to give it a present for a friend + giveaway so be sharp! Probably going to post and PM everyone tommorow. Probably going to have exact date/time when I will pm everyone. (people who asked about pm will have heads up about the sale)

Shipping is from Latvia (europe). For my US friends the price will range up to 35 eur (but can be depend cause our postage system just sucks) and for my european friends it will be around 25 eur but again- I can be wrong BUT will inform you when I have exact prices.

1 - Even in the palaeolithic societies where they ate the lowest amount of meat, this still reached [at least 20% of their food from animal sources](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-half-baked-how-hunter-gatherer-really-eat/). This was the **lower bound**, in most cases it was 60-70% - [""in the bones we dig up from Africa from two million years ago, and from Neanderthals in Europe, and Homo erectus in Asia, there's not a single exception.

2 - Humans literally cannot survive without [b12](http://www.nomeatathlete.com/b12-for-vegans/). This is not a coincidence. As such, given the hazardous natuer of getting enough food as a hunter gatherer, neglecting animal food sources would have been critically risky.

Not in the slightest.

People moved nations all the time, even 50 years ago, even 100 years ago. Freedom of movement has been catastrophical for many communities.

Free movement is great if you're rich upper class, but they always had freedom of movement anyways. They just have less paperwork to deal with. For the rest of society it leads to social dumping.

Crime ocorreu por volta das 5h, em Padre Miguel. Ninguém foi preso.

RIO - Bandidos armados com pistolas e um fuzil fizeram um arrastão em Padre Miguel, no fim da madrugada deste quinta-feira, e roubaram celulares e documentos de um grupo que aguardava numa fila para se candidatar a uma vaga de emprego. O crime ocorreu por volta das 5h, na Estrada General Americano Freire, e havia aproximadamente 70 pessoas no local. Os criminosos, que estavam em um carro, fugiram rapidamente do local.

A maioria das vítimas está desempregada e buscava uma oportunidade de trabalho no comércio. De acordo com um morador de Nova Iguaçu que estava na fila, e prefere não ser identificado, os bandidos deixaram todo mundo em pânico:

— Usar fuzil AR-15 para roubar celular de desempregado é um absurdo. Os três homens estavam em um carro branco. Quando chegaram perto de nós, diminuíram a velocidade e passaram a observar quem estava com o celular nas mãos. No fim da fila, pararam o veículo e dois homens desceram. Eles levaram os celulares, entre outros pertences. Foi muita covardia roubar quem está sem dinheiro e em busca de um emprego.

Segundo testemunhas, 15 pessoas foram roubadas. Outros candidatos à vaga de emprego, assim como o morador de Nova Iguaçu, conseguiram correr:

— Cheguei às 23h50m (de quarta-feira) e peguei o terceiro lugar na fila. Como estava na frente, consegui correr. Mas foi muito perigoso. O bandido que estava com a pistola chegou a mandar o outro, que carregava o fuzil, descarregar a munição. Ainda bem que ele não cumpriu a ordem — disse o homem, que, mesmo após toda a confusão, conseguiu ser atendido e preencher a ficha para concorrer a uma vaga.

Na página Padre Miguel News, no Facebook, muitas pessoas postaram relatos demonstrando revolta com o ocorrido. Algumas das publicações eram de desempregados que buscavam uma oportunidade na fila e foram surpreendidos pelos bandidos: “Eu estava lá. Horrível, presenciei tudo. Eu consegui correr deles. Estou apavorada. A gente não tem nem sossego pra procurar emprego”.

Uma das vítimas relatou que se machucou ao fugir dos bandidos: “Eu estava lá, maior desespero. Estou toda ralada, machucada. Infelizmente, esse é o país em que vivemos”. Num desabafo, outra internauta chamou os ladrões de covardes: “A pessoa já não tem nada e ainda tiram dela o pouco que resta. Covardes!”

Segundo testemunhas, policiais do 14º BPM (Bangu) fizeram buscas na região, mas ninguém foi preso. Apesar de uma das fotos postadas em rede social mostrar uma carro do batalhão no local, o comando da unidade informou, em nota, que não foi chamado. Procurada, a 34ª DP (Bangu) não se manifestou sobre o caso.",True,False,,0,1504275942,,False,0,dmfbokw,False,t3_6xc1b9,t1_dmf7u6p,1506401251,7,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,

Xeque-mate,,,"Por acaso, compreendo o que dizes e subscrevo a apreciação que fazes do Adrien. Acho que vai ser um ""ou vai ou racha"" para o Sporting. 

No final da época passada estivemos a ""discutir"" a importância do Adrien em face do campeonato efectuado e os números fizeram-me ver que a minha percepção imediata do jogador me estava a ocultar um bocado a sua importância no colectivo.

Na análise individual do jogador, há pontos em que eu concordo com o /u/MCbadboy. Efectivamente, o Adrien não tem aquele talento inato de ""craque da bola"". Não tem criatividade e não é imprevisível. É a antítese do Paím e é isso que faz dele um jogador extraordinário. Em primeiro lugar, o Adrien dura o jogo o todo. Apresenta o mesmo rendimento do início ao fim do jogo. Enquanto jogadores mais criativos como o William, o Gelson e até o Bruno Fernandes têm momentos em que ""desaparecem"" do jogo (apesar de quando aparecerem fazerem muitas vezes a diferença), o Adrien parece uma máquina sempre a carburar. Para além da componente física, tem uma consistência defensiva enorme. A capacidade de recuperar a bola sem fazer falta e virar o sentido do jogo é uma mais-valia incrível em qualquer equipa. Ainda na segunda mão com o Steua vimos um grande passe do Bruno Fernandes, mas uma ainda maior recuperação do Adrien.

Com a chegada do Jesus, o Adrien conseguiu evoluir bastante tecnicamente e apesar de não conseguir ter o toque de bola e o passe do William, tem outros meios, menos bonitos é certo, que são igualmente eficazes. É como teres uma empresa com um bom encarregado. O Adrien é esse gajo.

No entanto, o futebol tem destas coisas maravilhosas em que um bom jogador pode ser muito mais preponderante do que um craque. A consistência que o Adrien dá e o equilíbrio que proporciona tem sido nas últimas épocas (assim como já na corrente) o ""segredo"" do Sporting. A forma do Adrien reflecte-se na forma do colectivo e basta ver esta época. No jogo com o Aves, o Adrien esteve a ""meio gás"" e a equipa jogou a ""meio gás"". Contra Setúbal e Steua, esteve em recuperação de forma e fez cerca de 1h de jogo sofrível. Contra o Guimarães, esteve já ao seu nível e teve uma assistência e um golo (lá está, no final do jogo ainda ainda tinha pilhas). Na segunda mão contra o Steua, o meio-campo foi todo dele e , para mim, foi o melhor em campo. Contra o Estoril, vimos uma cópia do que aconteceu a época passada. Sem Adrien, o Sporting não dura o jogo todo. A juntar a isso, quando metes o Alan Ruiz então a stamina da equipa deve cair para metade.

No reverso da medalha, este ano há outros jogadores e outras soluções. Se seria melhor sair William ou Adrien, acho que só o tempo o dirá e temos de ver a agora o que vai fazer o Battaglia (jogador que até considero tecnicamente melhor do que o Adrien), que já está a ser cartilhado como violento e que prevejo que vá começar a levar cartões jogo sim, jogo sim.

Agora que estou muito divido entre preferir perder o William ao Adrien, neste momento estou. A questão de olharmos para o talento de Adrien e William e acharmos que à partida é mais fácil encontrar um jogador à imagem do Adrien do que do William, é porque só estamos a olhar para os jogadores e estamos a negligenciar o aspecto colectivo. Neste momento olho para a questão de outra forma: o Sporting precisa mais de William ou de Adrien? O passado recente e a crueza dos números têm-nos dito que precisamos mais do Adrien.

danjvelker,roach,Team Roach,"Really? Actually, it's not any errors that make me think that. Native English speakers have a system of colloquialisms and slang vocabulary that naturally bleeds into their writing. In short, we're lazy. Look at any of the professional authors that pop their heads in on r/fantasy and while their words may be precise, they still have a sort of slang to them. I had a lot of friends in high school who were foreign exchange from Korea, and an internet friend who was from a small northern European country (can't recall which at the moment), and they all had a certain way that they spoke and wrote. It was very precise, but it was also very stiff. Almost like they had learned English from a dictionary, rather than a person. (I was homeschooled, so I DID learn a lot of English from the dictionary. High school actually dumbed me down in that regard.) You happen to have the same stiff pattern of writing, devoid of many colloquialisms and laziness that made me think English is a second language to you.

Concerning parenting, let me put it this way. I was abused as a child, and it helped me to grow up very quickly. I developed a lot of maturity before my peers, and as a result I like to think that I'm a very intellectual and rational person. Thanks to abuse. Now, I'm going to fight every day of my life to make sure my kids avoid abuse, right? Childhood is already filled with trials that pass them through fire. There certainly is an age where things are and are not appropriate. Just because you experience something that was age inappropriate and turned out all right doesn't mean that others should have to go through it, or will turn out fine just because you did. There's plenty of abuse survivors who aren't doing all right, I'm just glad that I'm one of the exceptions. Banning books is always silly, but having kids read books before their brains are developed enough to take in the context and nuance and critical thinking required to analyze it is almost as silly.

Unanimous agreement of every single decision would result in nothing getting done ever. Nothing is forced on anyone as ultimately they always have the option to leave if they don't like it.

CWSwapigans,,,"&gt; Most gambling sites use btc just fine and are provably fair with btc alone .

So, two things here.

1) I'm thinking more about sports betting (a *much* larger market than casino betting). The huge issue is someone else holding your money. This is why gambling is such an interesting application to me because *the* biggest obstacle for American gamblers is trusting someone to hold your money fairly and to pay you when you win. If someone can fix those problems there's $100s of billions a year in gambling revenue out there in the US alone.

Right now btc sportsbooks and casinos are nowhere near ""just fine"". They are not safe to use for large volumes. I'm pretty sure the biggest is nitrogensports.eu and they can, have, and will stiff you on your wins. Even if they hadn't, there's no assurance they wouldn't.

Your technical knowledge seems clearly beyond mine, but if smart contracts can allow a wager without me trusting someone else to hold my money then that's a clear example of efficiency to me. You still need to trust the wager to be graded, but I'm confident there are solutions that are at least better than letting the person holding your money grade the wagers.

The current MFF runs up until 2020, we agreed to the things in it, we'd signed up to our commitment, so there's an argument that we should pay through until 2020, especially as some of those things could still be benefiting us.

There's a counter-argument that 'well we're taking our ball and going home', but that's what negotiation is about.

Screenshots of how bad their headlines are: https://www.google.com/search?q=breitbart+headline&amp;tbm=isch

How Steve Bannon targets what he calls ""rootless white males"" to ""radicalize"":

&gt;to the power of what he called “rootless white males” who spend all their time online. And five years later when Bannon wound up at Breitbart, he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be radicalized in a kind of populist, nationalist way.
&gt;
&gt;And the way that Bannon did that, the bridge between the angry abusive gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was Milo Yiannopoulous, who Bannon discovered and hired to be Breitbart’s tech editor.
&gt;
&gt;From the time I met him in 2011, he’s had exactly the same politics. The same stuff you heard from Trump, you saw on the campaign trail. What he was looking for was a vessel because nobody in Republican Washington believed in these kinds of ideas. Very big into the idea of populism and Palin had emerged from the 2008 election as kind of the populist Tea Party champion. So originally, Palin went to Bannon and said, “Hey, you’re a filmmaker, you’re a conservative guy. Would you shoot some commercials for me, some kind of videos?” And Bannon, as he is prone to do, got whipped into a frenzy. Wound up spending about $1 million of his own money to produce this elaborate Palin documentary called “The Undefeated,” which he thought was going to be Palin’s vehicle to run for the presidency. In fact, the first time I ever traveled with Bannon and Palin was to Pella, Iowa to debut that film. Everybody in the national media was there. Andrew Breitbart was there. Sarah Palin was there because we all thought this was the wink wink launch of the “Sarah Palin for President” campaign in 2012, but when that thing kind of crashed on the launchpad, Bannon moved on to other people and eventually wound up with Trump.

The billionaire behind Breitbart and Steve Bannon:

&gt;They own part of the data mining company Cambridge Analytica, which played a role in Trump's victory last year. That has given both Mercers a strong foothold in the Trump White House, and last year Politico called Rebekah Mercer ""The Most Powerful Woman in GOP Politics."" Mercer's influence hasn't been confined to the United States: He was a key supporter of Leave.eu, which spearheaded last summer's successful Brexit campaign.
&gt;
&gt;Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans, according to Magerman.
&gt;
&gt;... that climate change is not happening. It's not for real, and if it is happening, it's going to be good for the planet.
&gt;
&gt;... that nuclear war is really not such a big deal. And they've actually argued that outside of the immediate blast zone in Japan during World War II - outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - that the radiation was actually good for the Japanese. So they see a kind of a silver lining in nuclear war and nuclear accidents. Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.

Another billionaire connected with Breitbart for the Alt-Right's coordinated manipulation of Reddit:

[Palmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump’s Meme Machine](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html)

&gt;“We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.
&gt;
&gt;Palmer Luckey—founder of Oculus—is funding a Trump group that circulates dirty memes about Hillary Clinton.
&gt;
&gt;“I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.”
&gt;
&gt;But in another post written under Luckey’s Reddit pseudonym, there are echoes of a similar tech billionaire, Peter Thiel [[""Notorious tech billionaire Peter Thiel, a key Trump transition advisor""](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-has-made-peter-thiel-immensely-powerful) [""express doubts over whether it was a good idea to give women the right to vote""](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/who-is-peter-thiel-rnc-2016-trump/492380/)]
&gt;
&gt;Before becoming directly involved in the process, Luckey met the man who would serve as the liaison for the nascent political action group, and provide legitimacy to a Reddit audience for later donations without having to reveal Luckey’s identity: **Breitbart tech editor and Trump booster Milo Yiannopoulos**. The bleached-blonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from Twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress Leslie Jones.
&gt;
&gt;Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos’s bank account.

DracoOccisor,,,"It's propaganda when your point of view is quite literally the result of brainwashing that has been pervasive in our culture since the 30s regarding economic policies that do not mesh with our own. 

Further, your argument doesn't follow. You make the claim that Socialism fails spectacularly every time it's implemented. (you could have meant ""communism"" when you said ""it"", but considering that communism has factually ever been implemented, this would be bunk be default.) And yet there are Socialist governments today performing just fine, if not better, than most capitalist countries. So which is it - does it fail or not? (If your response is to say that the Northern European countries are actually a mixed market economy, then I'll need you to learn basic Socialist theory before we continue that discussion)

Again, for the third time, you need to educate yourself. The USSR was not a spectacular failure. This is apparent to anyone who knows it's history. It made huge strides in the well being of its people. It was one of the first countries to implement paid maternal leave, universal health care, universal higher education, free laboratories for scientists, mandatory vacation. They also had nearly full literacy, were the first to put a man in space, and were probably the single biggest cause of the Allies winning WW2. 

Not only that, but you also have to consider how *fast* Socialism sped up development. The USSR quite literally went from a loose association of agrarian states to an industrial superpower in a matter of decades. By the time Sputnik I was orbiting earth, it had only been 40 years since people were using carriages in Tsarist Russia. 

Most of the disastrous parts of its history stem from American and European intervention, a person taking power who had no business making the calls (on his deathbed, Lenin wrote a letter in which he urged the Politburo to not let Stalin take his place in the provisional government), and De-Stalinization. And on top of that, many of the death numbers reported by America and the U.K. have been exposed to be inflated for political purposes. The USSR was just like here in most ways. Some people had it bad. But by and large most people were doing tenfold better than they would have under the Tsar. 

There's a reason why there's still a huge movement in Russia today to go back to their Communist roots. There's a reason they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain Lenin's body. There's a reason why the US spent so much money trying to spread anti-collectivist propaganda. 

Please. Think for yourself. Do your own reading. Educate yourself. Don't trust headlines without researching them. With that information, really reflect on it and derive your own conclusions. If you still think what you think afterwards, that's fine. But at least the next time you have this discussion you won't be saying things that are blatantly and factually incorrect.

Recursi,s1 4 team-4 country-eng,Chelsea,"You are referring to a Player Contract with the club.  Pre-contract is an agreement that is separate and apart from the Player Contract. The player can be still under contract with Arsenal, for example, and sign another contract (but not another Player Contract) with Manchester City agreeing to sign with that club in the future. [See](https://www.blakemorgan.co.uk/training-knowledge/features-and-articles/enforceability-pre-contracts-football/):

&gt;Pre-contracts come in many different forms but generally speaking, it is an agreement providing for the player to join the club on a future date.

[See also](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:61993CJ0415):

&gt;In April 1991, FIFA adopted new Regulations governing the Status and Transfer of Football Players. That document, as amended in December 1991 and December 1993, provides that a player may enter into a contract with a new club where the contract between him and his club has expired, has been rescinded or is to expire within six months.

There are enforceable pre-contracts and non-enforceable pre-contracts, the latter being similar to a letter-of-intent or a memorandum-of-understanding.  If the parties intend for a pre-contract to be enforceable, it is matter of making that clear.  [See](https://www.blakemorgan.co.uk/training-knowledge/features-and-articles/enforceability-pre-contracts-football/):

&gt;The enforceability of a pre-contract will depend on the specific terms of the agreement. Pre-contracts are generally not binding under English law as they are usually marked ‘Subject to Contract’ and are simply a commitment by the parties to enter into a later contract. 

 \***
&gt;However, if a pre-contract contains all the essential terms that have been agreed, then the pre-contract is effectively a final contract and is likely to be binding.

So, if the parties intend to enter into an enforceable pre-contract, the parties can also put in provisions in there saying something like: ""Player hereby agrees that it will not agree to any loan to any club without the prior written consent of Club.""

Now, there may be an argument that this provision could tortiously interfere with the existing Arsenal Player Contract, but that can only be analyzed after reviewing the Arsenal contract. ",True,False,,0,1504281990,,False,0,dmfh5d3,False,t3_6xaikf,t1_dmf7cra,1506403919,1,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,

Due to Trump, the bs with NAFTA and their own need for resources China has shown a great deal of interest in investing in Canadian refining capacity and infrastructure.

&gt; In the 1980s Switzerland was affected by the hike in oil prices which resulted in a decrease of energy consumption until 1982, when the economy contracted by 1.3%. From 1983 on both GDP and energy consumption grew[citation needed].

&gt; Switzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the weakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a 3-year-recession from 1991 to 1993 when the economy contracted by 2%. The contraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and export growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase (only 0.6% annually) in gross domestic product (GDP).

My Swiss colleagues are telling me that the effects of the 3 year recession was felt way more than just the 3 years. One guy said that his folks lost all his business (he was a SME in manufacturing) and that he didn't get a hold of his finances again until the early 2000s.

BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] elite,"As talks in Brussels grind on, voters in the Surrey town of Staines-upon-Thames, part of the constituency of Spelthorne that backed leaving the EU by 60 to 40 last summer, are flummoxed about why the Brexit process has taken so long.

Sue Shaw, a school worker, said she had expected Brexit by last Christmas. “A lot of people I work with thought we would be out within a week, they thought that if we voted leave we would get on and leave,” she said as she walked her dog near the river Thames.

“It’s been very slow. Personally, I thought we would be out in six months.”

Dave Matthews, a retired accountant, echoed her view. “The government has been too slow and a bit too weak in the negotiations,” he said as he filled in a crossword on a bench.

He partly blamed David Cameron, the former prime minister, for failing to oversee any detailed preparations for Brexit in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum.
Now he is becoming alarmed about the idea of a “transition deal” for several years after March 2019.

That would involve continued freedom of movement and payments to the EU as well as potential oversight by the European Courts of Justice — while a trade deal is finalised with Brussels.

“I think if we are going to do this thing, then the sooner we go the better. Hanging on for years and years, I don’t see the benefit of that quite honestly,” he said.

Many Leave voters wanted to quit the EU because they thought excessive immigration had driven down wages and put pressure on public services, said Mr Matthews. “Carrying on with that is not acceptable.”

As David Davis, Brexit secretary, tries to pick his way through the complex negotiations, the patience of Leave voters appears to be wearing thin. Confusing messages emerging from the government have not helped.

Julie Oropallo, a retired hairdresser, admitted that the Brexit process had not been what many voters had expected when they voted Leave. “I voted to come out, but it seems to be taking a lot longer, I imagined it would be over in two years or so, but it’s turned out to be incredibly complex.”

Meeting the public’s expectations could also pose problems for the government, with interviewees in Staines puzzled over several details, including why Britain should pay a multibillion pound “divorce” settlement. Several people agreed with Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who said the EU could “go whistle” if they expect a large payment.

“Boris was right, we shouldn’t pay a penny,” said Margaret Blythe, a retail worker. “Think how much we’ve given them over the years . . . they probably owe us don’t they?”

Anthony Wells, politics director at YouGov, believes the final figure for the divorce bill could trigger a backlash from angry voters.

According to a survey by ICM for The Guardian newspaper this week, only 11 per cent found the idea of Britain paying “up to £30bn” “acceptable” against 72 per cent who did not.

“People will think, ‘crikey’, that’s a huge amount, that’s outrageous, unless the popular media don’t express any outrage . . . which feels unlikely,” said Mr Wells.

“The thing is, issues such as trade deals, City passporting, customs and so on are incredibly complicated whereas the payment of £10bn, or whatever the final figure is, is incredibly straightforward.”

Mr Wells said that the figure could potentially be sold to the public if it was described as a fee for continued access rather than a fee for simply leaving the bloc.

But that had not happened yet. “I don’t think the government has even started to communicate a message on this. Instead, they are still letting it be talked about as an exit fee.”

The government has found it hard to communicate a clear message over Brexit and what kind of deal it can strike with the EU. Asked who was responsible for selling Britain’s Brexit strategy to the public, one aide replied: “The prime minister and cabinet.”

Sir Craig Oliver, former head of communications for Mr Cameron, said that any public backlash against the final deal, over issues such as immigration or the divorce bill, would depend on the reaction from Eurosceptic Tory MPs and their media allies.

“It all depends on what the Brexiters are willing to tolerate. If they say: ‘We’re OK with that’ then it’s harder to build up a narrative of betrayal or disaster,” he said. “If they say, ‘hold on, this is not what we were sold’, then it becomes more difficult for Number 10.”

“The government’s communication strategy seems to be based on a confidence that the Leave lobby won’t complain,” said Sir Craig. “If Brexiters don’t provide a megaphone to amplify dissent, it’s less likely there’ll be a public outcry.”

Chris Pratt, strategy director at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, said there was “no evidence” of a planned, deliberate communications strategy from ministers.

“The government only seem able to firefight,” he said. “There is a real risk that they will fail to manage public expectations following the rhetoric of the referendum campaign and business is left with continued uncertainty.”

Joey Jones, a former adviser to Mrs May, said voters seemed “pretty bored” by Brexit: but they could be “inflamed” at the drop of a hat.

**Bofors case to be reopened? SC agrees to hear appeal filed by BJP leader in October**

Bofors case: File photo of Supreme Court. Bofors case: File photo of Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal of BJP leader Ajay K Agarwal challenging a Delhi High Court order that acquitted the accused in the Bofors pay-off case. The apex court will hear the matter in October. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said that it would list the appeal for hearing in the week commencing October 30 this year.

The CBI, which investigated the scam case, had not filed any appeal in the top court against the quashing of charges against certain accused within the stipulated 90-day period.

Agarwal had challenged the Delhi High Court’s May 31, 2005 judgment that quashed all charges against the Europe-based Hinduja brothers in the case. On October 18, 2005 the Supreme Court had admitted Agarwal’s petition which was filed after the CBI failed to approach the top court with the appeal within the 90-day deadline following the High Court verdict. It also allowed Agrawal to file an appeal against the high court verdict in the absence of any appeal by CBI.

Who is Ajay Agarwal, BJP leader who challenged HC’s verdict in Bofors case

The hearing assumes significance in the wake of a demand in Parliament by ruling BJP MPs for reopening of the probe into the Bofors kickback scandal after the media reports quoting Swedish chief investigator Sten Lindstrom’s suggested the alleged bribery at the top level.

What is the Bofors scam case, why is it in the news now?

The Rs 1,437-crore deal between India and the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors for the supply of 400 155mm Howitzer guns for the Indian Army was sealed on March 24, 1986. The Swedish Radio had on April 16, 1987 claimed that the company had paid bribes to top Indian politicians and defence personnel.

Even before the starters arrived he began telling me about how he had asked a number of people for help after his latest bankruptcy and how five of them were unwilling to help. He told me he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying these five people.

almareado,,Maestro,"&gt;Sim, um jovem já conhecido mundialmente como o provavel futuro melhor GR do mundo. O Benfica não é o real Madrid. Não temos dinheiro para competir com eles. Tu aumentas o salário, o City paga o triplo á mesma. Achas que o Ederson se está a cagar? A questão não é haver mercado para o ano. A questão é aguentar com ele este ano. E isso não é possivel. Nenhum clube portugues pode recusar 40 milhões por um jogador. Muito menos um Guarda Redes. Achas que o Ederson prefere continuar a jogar em Portugal ou ir para Inglaterra? Qual é que achas que é o sonho de todos os jogadores de futebol? Jogar na liga nos? lol

De rir é tu achares que o Benfica por não pagar o mesmo que o City, tinha de obrigatoriamente vendê-lo, porque senão para o ano ele fazia birra. Uma coisa é quando se paga a cláusula e aí não há volta a dar. Outra coisa é impedir o jogador de sair e mantê-lo a receber amendoins. Felizmente há um meio termo, que se chama gestão de expectativas e obrigações contratuais. 

&gt;O seferovic marca muitos golos. O seferovic é bom substituto para o Mitro. É um bom complemento para o Jimenez. Queres falar em jogos decisivos, Jimenez é o mestre. Preferes vender um gajo relativamente jovem, com bom potencial e bom futuro que não se importa de estar no banco desde que entre em campo por 35 milhões do que vender um gajo com quase 30, que não se vai satisfazer no banco por 27,5? Quando tens o seferovic que claramente agarrou a titularidade? Discordo muito disso.

O Jimenez é um excelente jogador que já nos safou várias vezes. Mas nos 2 anos que cá esteve, nunca foi melhor que o Mitroglou. Mais, o Mitroglou saiu por €15M por 50% e com poucas hipóteses de ser vendido por valores elevados, ou seja o Benfica no máximo verá €3-5M mais e até pode não receber mais nada. Nem sequer estamos a falar de 10% da facturação em jogadores nos últimos 12 meses. Foi o melhor marcador da equipa na época transacta. É titular indiscutível na sua selecção. Tem 29 anos? Que idade tinha o Jonas quando chegou? A relação entre o que se perde desportivamente e o que se ganha economicamente só pode ser considerada negativa. O Seferovic quando marcar golos aos rivais que viram campeonatos, terá o respeito que tenho pelo Mitro. Para já, é um prospect.

&gt;Passivo é divida. Divida paga juro. Se o passivo não aumenta, é porque o juro foi pago. Se o juro foi pago, é porque uma parte do passivo (os juros incluem-se no passivo) foi paga. Nem todos os juros são cortados através de rollback de créditos, derivados ou seja o que for. Uma parte (relativamente grande) é paga, como qualquer outra divida.

Estás muito confuso. Eu explico:

Passivo é dívida? Certo.

Divida paga juro? Não necessariamente. Por alguma razão é que parte do passivo do Benfica tem mais de uma década, sem onerações ou prazos fixos. É o chamado passivo não-elegível. E pode existir por uma miríade de razões.

O que paga juro e do bom são os empréstimos bancários e os empréstimos obrigacionistas. A menos que o teu padrinho seja o Ricciardi ou o Sobrinho, tens 2 maneiras de renegociar os juros:

* Restruturação da dívida bancária, com um processo de intervenção e após assumir a incapacidade de cumprir com as obrigações, com todas as consequências negativas que daí advêm. 

* Pedir mais dinheiro para poder pagar a dívida por inteiro (rollback), num empréstimo que dê condições financeiras mais favoráveis do que a operação que acabou de ser liquidada. Ou seja, se devo 10 a 2%, peço 10 a 1%, pago o primeiro e fico a pagar 1%, poupando nos juros.

O que também não entendes é que os empréstimos obrigacionistas não são amortizados da mesma maneira dos empréstimos bancários. No banco, podes ir amortizando a dívida ao longo do tempo. Podes pedir 100 a pagar a 10 anos e todos os meses amortizas dívida e pagas parte do juro. Nas obrigações, o Benfica paga tudo no final do prazo (2 anos). Ou seja, amortiza contabilisticamente dentro do clube e gere a tesouraria mas sabe que no prazo das obrigações, tem que pagar a totalidade do montante angariado + juros. O que acontece é que o Benfica tem vindo a repetir esta fórmula para poupar custos e agora para abater o passivo financeiro terá que pagar um dos empréstimos obrigacionistas com capitais próprios, ao invés de fazer uma nova emissão de dívida.

O juro é apenas o custo de financiamento. Ou seja, os juros fazem parte do capítulo da despesa, tal como os pequenos almoços ou o combustível do Vermelhão. E como é óbvio, tudo o que é despesa, se não for coberto por receita, transforma-se em dívida. O passivo aumenta se houver aumento da dívida no final do exercício.  

E o problema dos juros não tem a ver com o passivo, mas com o peso na conta-corrente que faz com que se gaste dinheiro para ter liquidez, em vez de gastar mais dinheiro em vencimentos. O que tem sido, aliás, feito por absoluta necessidade e daí a urgência em pôr fim a esses custos.

Quanto a derivados, assumo que na tentativa de fazer parecer que percebes da poda, espetaste para aí um termo do economês que achaste que ficava bem e dava lustro à frase. Porque não tem sentido nenhum falar de derivados quando se está a discutir a gestão financeira do Benfica, já que o Benfica não se financia usando produtos financeiros desse tipo.",True,False,,0,1504284209,,False,0,dmfj6os,False,t3_6xd5ed,t1_dmfczvi,1506404908,2,False,benfica,t5_2sb3a,

Milquest,,,"&gt;Wow. Having a system where the government has to provide extra subsidies in addition to the employer's contribution just so it would bring them up to a livable standard is wrong on so many levels.
&gt;In my country - and I don't have to bring up the living standards differential because it's self-evident - I wouldn't even dream of having such practices.
&gt;There must be some pretty huge inequality going on over there (or at least wage disparity in some sectors) for the government to need to do that.

All countries use various mechanisms to subsidise the pay of those on low wages, whether it be financial transfers via a nationalised health system, benefits, or whatever else.  I do agree that the UK should go further towards having a 'living wage' standard but that is neither here nor there for the present discussion (nor is the fact that the UK minimum wage is one of the highest in the EU and that in work benefits are a major thing in other countries too).

&gt;So basically everyone can be a drain to the system; which makes it broken. Instead of reforming it, you think that reducing the access to benefits that immigrants have (or outright limiting immigration) is going to fix it. Great idea...

Everyone can be a drain on the system in any context.  You can't, on the one hand, hold up the right to throw EU citizens out if they are a drain on the system in one way as an example of the EU working well, and then sigh and say 'your system is broken' when the same principle is applied in another area.

In the US our government isn't ""just printing money &amp; handing it out"". Our currency is backed by debt. I'll make a very basic &amp; simplified explanation: the government wants to introduce new money into the economy. They request an amount from the Federal Reserve, let's just say $1b. The reserve *loans* this $1b to the government and requires $1.5b to be paid back in interest (these figures are purely fictional simply for my example). The government receives the money where it is then distributed to various banks across the nation. (Furthermore, old banknotes are destroyed which I'll mention in a moment.) So in order to repay this $500m interest, wealth must be generated. This results in economic growth, new production, new jobs, etc, therefore keeping inflation at a low percentage. People complain about ""the national debt"" but we *need* debt for economic growth! Debt generates wealth. Instead of being backed by gold, which limits our economic growth to how much gold the mines can produce &amp; gives privately owned mining companies ultimate power over our currency, our ""technically fiat"" currency is backed by debt. It's not just worthless paper as I hear many old conservatives bitching about. Saying ""We never should have left the gold standard!""  
   
In the case of Zimbabwe many factors occurred on top of printing money which resulted in their hyperinflation. Selfish &amp; corrupt leadership being the primary cause. It began around 1987 when Mugabe took power. He caused massive damage to the Zimbabwean economy &amp; destroyed any economic growth which would have occurred had he nor did the things he did. For example confiscating huge amounts of farmers then dividing it up amongst his cronies. He stole land from people who were educated in agriculture, who knew how to work the land &amp; grow food as well as export cash crops such as tobacco, and gave it to uneducated people who had *absolutely zero* knowledge of farming. This caused enormous losses in crop production, causing famine and monetary loss in cash crop exports. He and his buddies/cronies were making themselves rich of course. Not to bring up race but this is another important fact: The new Zimbabwean government was extremely racist toward white people (Rhodesia had a large white population), and it just so happened that most of the farmland was owned by white farmers. When the new government came to power &amp; began confiscating land/business from ""its enemies"" it left a large portion of the population with nothing. Therefore most of the educated populace of Zimbabwe fled to Europe, resulting in a national brain drain. Furthermore Mugabe was dipping his filthy hands into the Congo wars. With the depressed economy (a direct result of the Mugabe regime) he couldn't afford the expensive military equipment &amp; weapons he wanted to buy in order to interfere in these wars. When you need money what do you do? Print it! Print lots of it! We'll be trillionaires, richest men in the world, genius!! Mugabe starts having money printed to buy the things he wants  (military equipment), then he prints more, and more. When the current notes lose their value, he just prints higher denomination notes. Zimbabwe has their own government reserve bank too, which the Zimbabwean government IE: Mugabe &amp; friends have ultimate control over (unlike the US Government) so it doesn't exist as a regulating force like it does in the US economy. Mugabe had to print *fucking enormous* amounts of banknotes to cause the Zimbabwean hyperinflation. Like quadrillions of dollars, trillions of dollars every day being printed. As a comparison right now there is approximately  $1.56 trillion dollars in circulation right now. Zimbabwe had that in just single  $1 trillion dollar notes. Add political unrest &amp; further corruption in top of all this as pretty much everyone in the new Zimbabwean government was/is extremely corrupt, not just Mugabe.   
   
 Basic income doesn't mean the entire US population receives a stack of 10 freshly printed 100 dollar bills every month which they then stash under the mattress. And we won't be minting 175 trillion dollars every week like Zimbabwe. No, practically every penny will be introduced straight back into the economy. Furthermore this will result in more debt to the Federal Reserve. What does debt do? It generates wealth. How is the wealth generated? *Economic Growth!*   
  
Also, as much as boomers &amp; ultra conservatives want to ignore it, rapid advancement in robotics, productive machinery, and automation **WILL** eliminate so many jobs in the United States that there **will not** be enough jobs for every single citizen over age 18 to ""Work their 50hrs a week to earn their keep."" Not only is it going to happen, it **is happening right now.** Requiring everyone to either work 50 hours a week otherwise live on the street &amp; starve is not a sustainable policy, it will not last forever with advancements in automation. Either the 1% will live in ultimate luxury while the 99% starves OR the wealth shall be redistributed and the means of production will be owned by the 99% + everyone receives a basic income. These are the only two options for our future. Unfortunely the first option is what's currently implemented &amp; I personally believe in the future the 1% will live in private armed &amp; protected communities while the 99% fights each other and starves.

Redeemer battles like Neamhain also give some nice stats. However, you'd have to run it around 50+ times to get any of the good stat bonuses.

Helix pomatia, common names the Roman snail, Burgundy snail, edible snail or escargot, is a species of large, edible, air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Helicidae. It is a European species. In the English language it is called by the French name escargot when used in cooking (escargot simply means 'snail'). Although this species is highly prized as a food it is difficult to cultivate and rarely farmed commercially.

&gt; So I'm not going to continue this debate when you're going to continue to be insulting, and not back up your claims with substantiated evidence.

Not backing up his claims with evidence? He's actually right. 

The Directors Guild of America allows only one director on a film. Unless this is the Coen brothers, or the Russo brothers directing Justice League, Whedon doesn't have the legal right to reshoot a substantial amount of the Justice League film. Like CookLove said, Whedon directing a practically whole new film is **being** the director of the movie since he is **directing** a large portion of it. The DGA wouldn't even allow this to happen in the first place, so it never took place anyway. Whedon film some scenes, probably some action scenes, and may have changed the ending. Heck, the last 15 minutes of the movie may be all Whedon. That's significant enough.

**But in no way has Whedon directed as much as you appear to believe, simply because the amount YOU believe, would be in direct violation of DGA rules concerning one director, one vision films.** 

And by the way, reshoots never take two or three months. That's just unheard of. Mamoa has been busy filming Aquaman in Australia, Ezra Miller has been busy filming Fantastic Beasts 2 in England, and Henry Cavill has been busy filming MI6 in Paris and other parts of Europe. 

Ok, those are very buys schedules. if Mark Hughes said that the reason reshoots took a long time was because certain actors weren't available, and it was mostly a waiting game until they were available, why is that so hard to believe??? It makes complete sense, and is completely logical. Maybe they had a scene they needed to shoot starring Batman and Flash, Ezra became available and shot that. But Aquaman makes an appearance in the scene and has lengthy dialogue, but Mamoa wouldn't be available for one week, so they cut, packed up, and took a week off until Jason became available so they can finish that said scene. I mean, it's not so hard to believe. 

These are all valid points, especially the one about the DGA rules and not allowing another director to direct a virtually whole new film that encompasses everything but action sequences. Heck, Tony Gilroy didn't even do that (making a virtually whole new film around the already shot actions scenes) during the extensive Rogue One reshoots. Most of Gareth Edward's dialogue and action scenes (sans a lot of the third act action scenes) remained intact. 

The DGA has upmost authority on **who** comes on to direct and how much. You break any of their rules, and the director(s) and studio face serious consequences. You honestly think Snyder, Whedon and Warner Brothers would actually take that risk?

On average, many more Muslims reject free speech compared to Danes but there are Muslims who are in favor of free speech. Yes, those aren't western countries. But if a person from India rejects caste system and thinks all humans are equal, wants free speech, etc, etc, he's eligible. If he thinks people who slaughter cows should be put to death, he can fuck off. I don't care if he's Muslim or Indian, I care what's in his head.

&gt;If all they have to do is ""tick a box"" then it is not an effective control.

These things are usually in depth interviews, checking out their internet communication, social media, associations they had, etc. Obviously it's not fool proof but it's better than Angela Merkel strategy.

&gt;Then we simply disagree. What you are advocating is an immigration/criminal system similar to what the UAE has. I simply disagree with this. 

I don't care who has it, I care about arguments. If you come to my house and shit on my carpet, I want you out. Nobody has a right to live in Sweden unless they have Swedish citizenship (and EU as well but I'm fine with EU right being revoked for violent criminals). You kill one of them and they should have a right to throw you out after a prison sentence (I don't think countries should just export criminals with no punishment).

&gt;For example in the USA certain Middle Easterners like Iranians, Indians, certain Asians (which you would probably consider 3rd world), have much higher education and income levels then average native white americans, and far lower levels of crime. 

I'm afraid you're making my case for me. That's not because Iranians are better on average than Americans, it's because American vetting system picked the best and the brightest to come. That's what Europe should do as well. You pick those who are at least as good if not better than your average citizen.

&gt;I don't necessarily disagree with what you are saying, but the way you present it clearly indicates some sort of prejudice. 

You're a mind reader, got it. It's very popular these days to aim your mind reading capabilities against someone who disagrees with mass immigration.

Depends on who you ask. The reason why she made her statement was that asylum seekers in Hungary rioted while demanding to be let through to Austria and Germany. 

It becomes quite hard to argue that Merkel caused the refugee crisis and brought all the asylum seekers to Hungary if Keleti station was a refugee camp more than two months before her statement. 

But I agree. Instead of allowing Syrians to enter, Germany should have helped Austria securing the Austrian-Hungarian border. Then the 400,000 asylum seekers that were registered in Hungary before they completed their fence wouldn't be our problem. 

And we probably would have a working relocation scheme by now. In the first proposal of the EU refugee relocation scheme the three countries which could send refugees to other EU members were Italy, Greece and Hungary.

The situation seems to have changed since that - technically US census data points that in 2016, US had [1.8%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/184904/vacancy-rates-for-us-homeowner-units-since-2005/) of homes and [~7%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/186392/vacancy-rates-for-rental-units-by-us-region-since-2000/) rental properties that were vacant.

Across the world in developed countries I've been reading similiar statistics about shortages of housing in major cities while overall significant housing surplus country wide - Europe, Canada, Japan, same situations in developed countries.

Also somewhat distorting the statistics is that almost a [fifth](http://www.businessinsider.com/housing-supply-crisis-is-looming-2016-3) of housing sales is done for investment or flipping...

But still, there is in fact a surplus of housing and I don't see a reason why it should disappear - so if population starts stampeding across the country in search of cheaper places to live on a guaranteed stipend, the settling point should still be in general in favor of renters vs property owners. Yes as each town becomes a known popular destination there will be swells in local pricing - but there will also be growth in local economy when new people arrive and start spending money on living necessities.

It should eventually find a country wide equilibrium that respects the 'more homes than people' factor.

4152510,,,"It can all be traced back to shitty urban planning.

In Europe, Asia, etc...cars are viewed as a luxury and not a necessity. You can live a full, prosperous life using only public transit, cycling, and walking if you need to.

But here things are different.

In the pre-war era, America had robust privately-owned electric rail service in basically every major city, and the vast majority of urban dwellers lived in central, walkable districts, served by this rail service.

Then, during the Second World War we were the Allies' factory nation. We mobilized a huge proportion of our civilian population to manufacture tanks, aircraft, ships, and ammunition in massive factories across the whole country.

When the war ended, these factories were often repurposed into auto manufacturing plants. The cost of a car plummeted. Then, when the GIs came home, the government initiated a massive home-buyer subsidy program, creating a huge artificial demand for single-family, detached homes. Then, on top of that, Eisenhower created the interstate highway network, one of the biggest infrastructure initiatives in history.

Add this all together, and you have a formula for massive suburbanization and a new era of car dependency.

This made the privately-held rail services unprofitable and they folded, being bought up by auto companies and either converted to bus service or scrapped altogether.

As a result, huge proportions of the American population live in areas where the only viable means of transportation is a private car.

This is bad enough if you're a senior citizen, or blind, or a minor, or otherwise incapable of driving a car. You are dependent upon others to transport you basically 100% of the time in those situations. But another result is that the government feels like it somehow owes it to its population to allow them the ""freedom"" of driving a car, and is therefore hesitant to enact strict standards for that privilege, because not driving in an area like that means you can't go anywhere.

As a result, driving tests are a joke compared to Europe, and courts often even give lenient sentences for major driving infractions like DUIs, etc...because they take the person's ""quality of life"" into account.

If I could go back in time and wave a magic want, I'd have:

- Bought up the rail services on behalf of the government and kept them running.

- Applied the homeowner mortgage subsidy to urban multi-family apartments and townhomes, not just detached suburban homes, and matched it with a renter subsidy program as well.

- Matched the interstate highway project funding with an equivalent rail modernization project, bringing high-speed intercity rail to places like the Great Lakes region, the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast Corridor, Florida, and California",True,False,,0,1504289960,,False,0,dmfogv9,False,t3_6xehmw,t1_dmfc34w,1506407478,17,False,Roadcam,t5_2u6os,

&gt;My shower thought this morning: we've seen many warnings over the years from central banks around the world about cryptocurrencies, and in particular BTC.  They general warn off banks, citizens, and others from getting involved with or investing in crypto.

&gt;I sifted through coindesk and found articles that highlight such warnings, and then correlated those against the price of BTC. Here is the graph: 

&gt; [http://imgur.com/a/1VGPX](http://imgur.com/a/1VGPX) 

&gt;Note that there is a big bunching of a relatively high number of warnings in the first half of 2014.  This makes sense as it plays into the fears of the Mt. Gox collapse.  Then there are a few scattered warnings over the next few years.  

&gt;What is striking to me is this: had the central banks instead possessed any kind of enlightened understanding and selfless disposition, they would have been **&lt;em&gt;encouraging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; citizens to acquire small amounts of crypto investments.  Had they done this, rather than warning them off, their countries and its citizens would have been far better off.  Instead, the central banks are actually prolonging the impoverished state of many throughout the world.

&gt;Here is a list of the articles mentioning the warnings.  Note how the warnings are heavily weighted from developing impoverished nations.  Someone should really be attempting to correct the wrongheaded approach that some central banks from these developing countries are taking with respect to cryptocurrencies.  They are ultimately only hurting themselves and their nations.

not_a_persona,guam-flag,Guam,"I didn't say the EU was a superpower, I said I agree with the argument that says we now live in a multi-polar world. The other option that you state, that there is only one superpower, means that we live in a unipolar world, and that theory has evidence against it. The number of countries with a nuclear triad and global reach is enough to argue that the world is not unipolar.

&gt;It is not even a military alliance.

There is a military alliance in the EU, and the mutual defense clause was used after the Paris attacks. The terms of the alliance are still being negotiated, and will need further ratification, but integration  is currently happening in multiple areas, and there are multiple joint commands and combined operations.

Article 42 was added in Lisbon 8 years ago:

&gt;[Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union provides for substantial military integration within the institutional framework of the union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union)

There is a [Common Foreign and Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy) and a [Common Security and Defence Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy). 

The Mutual Defense Clause makes the EU itself a nuclear power, and the combined armed forces have the world's second highest military budget. The EU acts as a [single legal entity](http://eu-un.europa.eu/about-the-eu-at-the-un/) at the UN, and thus it's reach is global and by law is equal to one State:

&gt;The Lisbon Treaty (2009), which gave the European Union a single legal personality and led to the formation of the External Action Service, the EU’s diplomatic service, also paved the way for the EU to be part of an international convention or be an observer (most cases) or member of an international organisation where the statutes allow this, such as the FAO in Rome.

&gt;In 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution A/65/276 upgrading the observer status of the EU’s participation in the UN to allow it to present common positions, make interventions, present proposals and participate in the general debate each September.

The EU has global reach both in soft power and hard power, and so does China. Actually, the world's largest trading relationship is between China and the EU, and world's largest transportation, construction, and trade building project is currently [further solidifying the links](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/04/all-aboard-chinas-new-silk-road-express-yiwu-to-london-train-geopolitics-one-belt-one-road/) between the EU and China, and the Belt and Road initiative is also connecting the EU to Southeast Asia. 

If it's a unipolar world, how is it that the world's only superpower barely rates a seat at the table for a massive construction project linking the world's largest trading corridor? 

China is also the largest trading partner of the African continent and a majority of African countries, and One Belt One Road is going to increase that over the next few years. China is building [massive infrastructure projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa%E2%80%93China_relations#Economic) across the continent, and has manufacturing facilities in many countries. China and the EU both have military ties and operations in Africa, but their power is exerted by soft power more than hard power, although both are militarily capable of using armed force across Africa. 

It's likely that the US has more hegemonic control of the Middle East than the EU or China, but the rest of Eurasia, and Africa, are increasingly under the control of the EU and China, and with the fat, orange blowhard in the Oval Office shouting about protectionism, tariffs, and America First, the reach and power of both the EU and China is expanding.

The EU is currently ratifying a sprawling free trade agreement with Canada, and in talks with Mexico, and will be there to pick up the pieces if Trump walks from NAFTA. Canada and Mexico are also both in free trade talks with China, and there has been discussion of the other TPP countries re-negotiating the deal with China replacing the US.

missusellis,,,"You're not understanding what I'm saying, dude.  Remember, we are talking about HOW Duterte talks and acts.  He may be talking in English but the manner in which he speaks is culturally Bisaya.  THAT's what I'm talking about.  How Bisaya speak is completely different from how Tagalogs speak (and even very different from how Europeans speak) which is a by-product of their culture.

People think he's rude.  He's not.  He's Bisaya.  Kumusta is not Hi.  Kumusta - same in Tagalog - expects a response.  Po is not Kuya and Ateh.  Po is a word added to a sentence as a form of respect.  Bisaya don't need to tack on those words to their sentences.  The respect is implied by their actions.  They can say the exact same sentence either respectfully or insultingly with a smile even.  You will know if he was being respectful or being sarcastic by how he acts.

Free funding is not discipline.  Free funding is tribal.  We take care of our own.  We can live with our parents until death.  Discipline is when the kid talks back to the parents and get smacked across the face.  That's discipline.  Discipline - Duterte style - is when a kid asks why he has to sit down for dinner, the mother responds, because if you don't you'll get appendicitis.  Or why we have to be home for dinner - because the bad spirits will kidnap you.  It sounds stupid when taken literally.  That's why Europeans think Duterte is stupid.  The Bisaya don't.  We laugh because we relate to it and understand what he means.  So when you don't come home for dinner, you get smacked with that big wooden spoon hanging on the dining room wall.  What, you think that's just for decoration?  ;)  That's why we love Duterte.

There's only 1 Cebu.  And I'm not painting Bisaya as aggressive nutsacks.  Quite the opposite.  I'm telling you we are very friendly, happy, loving people.  But we are also very tribal.  You don't mess with the tribe because you will be killed.  I'm simply pointing out to you that Duterte's manner of speaking is pure Bisaya - joking, hyperbolic, sarcastic, with a very harsh discipline when necessary.  The Bisaya may be very easy going, but like I said, don't mess with a Bisaya clan.  Especially don't fool around with their daughters! You could get in very big trouble.  Well, unless you marry her and take her to Europe.  Ask every Bisaya at IT Park.  Go ask every Bisaya at Ayala.  Heck, ask your seatmate at the jeepney.  Oh, and tell them you want the real answer... not the ""answer we give to foreigners"".

And you are telling ME - A Bisaya who lives in Cebu, who is born and raised in Cebu, whose family lives in Cebu from the time of Lapu-lapu to ""Come see for yourself"".

And no, don't call us ""soft and non-combative"".  The fact that you haven't experienced this shows that you are a good person.  And no, skin whitening is not Swedish-style (although we have a healthy attitude towards homosexuality - have you ever been to Miss Gay Mandaue?  Happens every May).  Skin whitening, etc., is a by-product of colonial mentality.  Remember, we were under Spain for 3 centuries followed by the Americans.  For all those centuries the Filipino was subjected to Western oppression.  It became a cultural response to put ourselves in a hierarchy of whiteness to escape oppression.  That colonial mentality is still present in today's Philippines.  The Bisaya is kind, hardworking, friendly, loving, AND AGGRESSIVE when the need arises.  And when some drug dealer comes after our kids, or a terrorist shoots up a town, that calls for aggression.  And the Bisaya will always side with Duterte in going after these guys by any means necessary.  Yes, ask your Bisaya buddies.

Many women trafficked are under 16 and sometimes they are made to become prostitutes as well.

**Wikileaks claims it's an organization to hold those with power accountable and promote transparency but they haven't produced any leaks of Russia. Assange says they don't cover Russia for two reasons; no one there speaks Russian, and because Russia has such a free and empowered critical press**: 
https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview

Except press freedom has plummeted in the 16 years Putin including 10x the number of journalists murdered compared to other countries, and almost always those critical to the Kremlin:
http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2016/jan/04/does-vladimir-putin-kill-journalists/

The lack of Russian-speaking staff sounds kinda plausible though until you find out that early on in the history of wikileaks, Assange denied a US focus and said they would be targetting Russia and China as well:
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/julian-assange-wikileaks-china-russia

In fact, Assange personally claimed to have a bombshell release on Russia:
http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1026/WikiLeaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-Russia.-But-will-Russians-get-to-read-about-it

However, we'll never know what that was because it was never released after Russia obliquely threatened Assange:
http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/11/01/russias-fsb-to-wikileaks-we-could-destroy-you/

**Whatever ultimately happened, the two sides must have made up fast because they've been they've been working together ever since. In fact, Assange was literally hosting a show on the Russian state propaganda channel the following year:** https://www.rt.com/tags/the-julian-assange-show/

Wikileaks unexplained friendliness continued with other authoritarian allies of Russia:
http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-31/wikileaks-meets-assad-in-syria/5180036

Information they published was even used to target dissidents in Russia's autocratic satellite Belarus:
http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/79749/wikitargeted

**More recently Wikileaks was again known to have possession of leaked information incriminating Russia, but again they omitted it from their site. When the source pointed out the documents related to Russia were excluded they threatened him. Wikileaks has a pattern of only liking whistleblowers when they're working against the West:**

Snowden's increasing criticism of Putin coincides with Wikileaks bipolar approach:
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-09-08/snowden-is-turning-into-a-liability-for-putin

You might ask why wikileaks was even criticising a leak from whistleblowers and journalists in the first place? Obviously in to stay in lockstep with Kremlin propaganda defending  Putin who was personally implicated while also attacking the US:

**When Wikileaks started posting documents from Democratic groups at the start of the general election a lot of people were wondering if they were related to recent hack on Democratic targets. Wikileaks stood by their policy and were adamant they don't comment on sources:**

ErdoganIsAC-nt,,,"You know what I find fascinating? You quote a source, but you apparently haven't read it. I'll excerpt a lil' bit you left out.

To clarify, before anyone begins reading: the NSB, the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging, was Hitler's wing in the Netherlands. The article discusses Wilders' deep Indonesian roots.

&gt; It is notable how often Indisch Dutch have participated in the formation of political parties based on conservative-nationalist (neo)colonial principles, compared to their involvement in progressive parties. The focus of this involvement typically lay in the protection and surveillance of boundaries and on the inclusion or exclusion of population groups. **In the thirties, in the Netherlands Indies, many Indos joined the NSB (National Socialist Movement) (forming 70% of its membership). This was because of the ultranationalist Dutch character of the party but also because of the great fear of the growing Indonesian nationalism.**

&gt; **In the colony, the NSB had a different character and a different place in society than in the Netherlands. The party offered Indos the possibility to present themselves to each other and society at large as wanting to be ‘more Dutch than the Dutch’ and that they completely identified with Dutch cultural heritage and that they venerated the royal House of Orange. It should not be forgotten that, at the time, the colonial elite was almost exclusively white. Because the NSB favoured an authoritarian rule, together with the maintenance of the colony forever by the Netherlands, many Dutch people in the Indies saw the party as the means to stand up to the threat posed by the revolutionary, Islamic natives. During his successful visit to the Netherlands Indies in 1935, Anton Mussert (founder and leader of the Dutch NSB and later Nazi collaborator) was officially received twice by the governor general, De Jonge.**

&gt; **Even before the NSB had begun recruiting members, the first meeting of the Nederlandsch-Indisch Fascisten Organisatie (Netherlands-Indies Fascist Organisation) had held its first meeting in Batavia (nowadays Jakarta)** chaired by retired Indo KNIL major Rhemrev. He also emphasised the importance of reducing the native influence on the government and the restoration of a leading role for Dutch people in the colony, but he had garnered less support.

&gt; If in the immediate aftermath of the war discussion continued to turn on the question of maintaining the unity of the empire (holding on to Netherlands Indies, and later New Guinea), **after the assimilation of Indisch Dutch into the Netherlands many conservative politicians and activists with Indisch Dutch backgrounds focused on themes of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration. For instance, one of the first well known politicians who expressed himself against migration policy and the ideal of a multicultural society was prominent VVD member, Frits Bolkestein, who had an Indisch mother.** He came to prominence because in his day he was the only EU commissioner who argued strenuously against the admission of Turkey to EU membership. As well, according to the KRO television program, Reporter, in his capacity as state secretary for Overseas Trade he torpedoed trade relations with Indonesia, something for which he had already been criticised when he was still working for Shell. **Wilders made his entry into parliament in 1998 with the support of Bolkestein, after having been his speech writer for years as a party worker.**

&gt; **The rise of the Indies NSB in the thirties was caused not only by Netherlands Indisch patriotism and the fear of Indonesian nationalism. The economic crisis had had a serious impact in the Netherlands Indies and it was also for this reason that there was growing support for authoritarian and decisive government.**

&gt;The results showed that men who ate greater amounts of fruits and vegetables with higher levels of pesticide residue—more than 1.5 servings per day—had 49% lower sperm count and 32% lower percentage of normal sperm than men who ate the least amounts (less than 0.5 serving per day). They also had a lower sperm count, lower ejaculate volume, and lower percentage of normal sperm.

&gt;Three long-term birth cohort studies suggest that pesticides are harming children’s brains. In these studies, researchers found that women’s exposure to pesticides during pregnancy, measured through urine samples, was associated with negative impacts on their children’s IQ and neurobehavioral development, as well as with ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] diagnoses. Also, one of the studies looked at structural brain growth using magnetic resonance imaging and found that the gray matter was thinner in children the higher their mothers’ exposure to organophosphates, which are used widely in pesticides. I think that’s quite scary.

solidh2o,,,"There's a term called ""population replacement rate"" that gets used a lot.  In case your'e not aware of it, it's the amount of children that would need to maintain the current population when looking at the birth/death rate.  That number is  roughly 2.1 in developed countries.

given that, here's a sample of the [Fertility Rates by Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rate):

* EU 1.5
* USA 1.9
* China 1.6
* India 2.4

On the other end of the spectrum:

* Niger 7.6
* Zambia 5.4
* Iraq 4.6


There's two interesting bits of info to be gathered from the data:  First, Japan seems to be a microcosm of what's happening to the rest of the world.  They were a couple decades ahead of everyone because of some incredibly strict immigration policies and high density population areas.  

The other is that it seems to be 70ish year  ( 3 - 4 generation) gap between conquering infant mortality and declining birth rates.  So much of the panic was around the expectation that population trends in developed countries continuing on the 5- - 10 births per family, even after we no longer needed that to ensure survival of the species.  Yes, there will always bee people who choose to have more kids, but in aggregate the trend seems to be 1-2 children per family.  

So where did the panic go?  There's still some worry, but 15 years ago there was theories of water wars in the 2040's.  The biggest issue we have today is lack of water for the general population ( both food production and drinking) of the world.  Desalination pretty much eliminates that, but it's been until recently prohibitively expensive.  It's still expensive, but not so much that it's a net loss to get fresh water.  More abundance of energy production will continue to drive down the costs over time.

The big issue in expectations is time scale.  People expect changes to happen in year, or even month long times.  The reality is that policy changes on a national and international timeline rarely occur in scales less than a decade.  Are we home free? No, not by a long shot.  But there's been several slow moving waves of change that have a much more positive outlook on resource sustainability.

There was a specific reason for that, and it wasn't because Google was too popular. People seem to just throw around ""evidence"" without really understanding what's going on.

So what that means is you can't setup a search engine to falsely redirect people to YOUR services only. So if someone searches Email, and Google deliberately blanks out Hotmail, Yahoo Mail, etc and shows you 52 pages of Gmail links, then yes that's questionable.

Reading further, you see a picture showing the Google Shopping links and a further explanation:

&gt;The Commission said that Google acted illegally by giving priority placement in search results to its own shopping service, while relegating results from rivals to areas where potential buyers were much less likely to click.

Yoga heritage: Don't even think about stealing it, says Indian government

**By Guy Verhofstadt, Chief Brexit Negotiator of the European Parliament**

Writing in the Telegraph this week, former Conservative leader William Hague accused the EU of giving David Davis and his team the “runaround” and showing entrenched inflexibility with regards to British membership of the EU, David Cameron’s renegotiation and the current Brexit talks. In Brussels this week, Mr Davis doubled down on these calls for more flexibility. But the facts do not support this mantra.

Since the UK joined the EU, it has enjoyed a bespoke form of membership that is unique. An opt-out from the euro, but banker to the Eurozone. An opt-out from Schengen, but access to the security databases linked to it. A blanket opt-out from Justice and Home Affairs, with the possibility to opt back into the most effective crime-fighting measures. The list goes on.

Lord Hague implied that the EU forced the UK out by refusing to agree to every one of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation requests. But I was in the room at the time of the renegotiation and substantial additional exceptions were offered – a new special status of EU membership, with an opt-out from the core principle of “ever closer union” and an emergency brake on benefits for EU workers. I even offered to work with the UK to develop a new form of associate EU membership, but UK ministers rejected it, as they argued that it would mean losing the UK’s seat at the top table. If this is not showing flexibility, I do not know what is.¨

After the referendum, we return full circle, only this time UK ministers seem to want to devise a new customs union and seek to recreate all of the EU’s structures, in order to continue to benefit from the best elements of the EU, without it being called the EU. This is not serious, fair or even possible given the negotiating time remaining – now significantly limited by the UK’s own decision to call a general election after the triggering of Article 50. The UK has informed us it is leaving, which we regret – but all we have ever asked for is that this disruptive decision is implemented in an orderly fashion and that we first agree to the divorce before planning a new future together.

Lord Hague quoted Yanis Varoufakis – an unlikely guru – and used the example of Greece to suggest EU institutions are treating the UK in a comparable manner. The British Government was adamant that no UK money be used to help Greece and I do not recall the UK challenging the position of EU finance ministers towards Mr Varoufakis at that time.

The EU can be bureaucratic but, from day one, the EU-27, the European Commission and the Parliament have been fully transparent about their negotiating positions and mandates. It is as if we are now told we are too efficient. It is in the interests of the EU for us to secure a close relationship, but we must first agree a methodology for the settling of accounts, secure the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and have a frank discussion about the Irish border. This is not a ploy to derail talks, but an inevitable consequence of the Brexit decision. It’s time for UK politicians to be more honest about the complexities Brexit creates and for them to recognise that other governments also have obligations to their own taxpayers.

The discussion papers rolled out by the UK over the summer are helpful and welcome, but only a more serious engagement with the financial consequences of Brexit and the other divorce issues will unlock discussions about the future relationship, which I hope will be a close one. Given the current pace of talks there is a real danger that sufficient progress will not be made by October. It would be a very risky strategy to burn negotiating time now in the hope that individual EU leaders will ride to the rescue; it was EU governments who defined Michel Barnier’s negotiating mandate.

As the costs of Brexit become clearer, I have no doubt the hardliners who promised the British people utopia will once again seek to blame Brussels for a lack of progress in the talks. But is a further poisoning of the atmosphere really in Britain’s interest? Our continued relationship is too important for our citizens and our firms to be jeopardised by dramatic political gestures.

There is an actual valid discussion here and there are no clear answers. It is clear that Germany and France and Italy and England don't need massive militaries *because* the U.S. does. The basic argument would be that you have a whole lot of 200lb chimps or a 800lb gorilla. (Yes, that is just an illustration. I don't remember how big they are. It might well be that gorillas are peaceful because they are large and chimps are violent because they are equal sized but I'm not actually talking biology.)

&gt;We enjoy some of the worlds best natural barriers from any country that could have the resources to harm us and yet we still require a military budget that out totals the next several highest countries budgets.

It became pretty clear over 70 years ago that the ocean is not actually a good barrier to violence. Just like we are able to project force there, others could project force here. 

&gt;yet we still require a military budget that out totals the next several highest countries budgets.

Now you are repeating the original claim. It is clear to me that it is *because* we have that massive military that they can afford to have a tiny one. Pax America has actually been a relatively peaceful time for the world and amazingly peaceful for Europe, the area they were concerned about.


Again, I think there are very good arguments for a significant, even massive, reduction in military spending. But this is not one of them.

None of this will change, there is a certain group of (((people who shall remain nameless))) who pull the strings from various positions at these Media corporations.

Whether is is Fox News, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, the BBC, The Guardian, The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal I think you will find them 'well represented'

It doesn't matter, the grand narrative remains mostly unchallenged no matter where you go and debate is only allowed within a narrow spectrum of opinion.

One of their major projects, is building support for the displacement of Whites as the majority population in the USA and Western Europe. It's been a wild success! It took 50 years but that project begun by (((Senator Celler))) is almost near completion.

There's not a one clear universal way to define 'deserve' so the meaning of the word depends somewhat on how the person who used the word has defined it. One can think that UCL's purpose is to find out the best team in Europe that season so the winner should be the best team at the moment then saying that Barca deserved it isn't that wrong since they were widely considered as the top shit during those years. Other might define it that way that 'the team with the most will to win it' deserves to win it. Some may speak about a team deserving to win UCL if the players are decent people outside the field - so not necessarily being 'the most' anything or denying that some other team has deserved to win it too. I don't know, at least in Finland it's common that when talking about who deserves to win something, people list more than one contender. That's why I don't think there's necessarily controversy between Xavi's statement and that Chelsea and Inter deserved to win the UCL.

So the point of that wall of text and my earlier comment is that a lot of judgement towards this statement are based on everyone's own interpretation of the meaning of word 'deserve' on this context which is not necessarily the way Xavi has meant it giving the statement.

&gt; Russia did not annex Crimea in the sense you are using it in. Russia had a referendum and used military to make sure it goes without intervention

That was all against international law. Only Ukraine had the right to hold a referendum in Crimea, and the Russian military had no right to leave specially designated areas. The so-called ""referendum"" didn't even give the Crimeans an option to stay with Ukraine (a vote is supposed to have alternative options). Furthermore, as the [Kremlin's Human Rights Council said, the Crimea ""referendum's"" numbers were entirely fabricated](http://www.businessinsider.com/did-vladimir-putins-human-rights-council-just-publish-2014-5). Or did you think that Russia actually cared about democracy? Take a look at the actual scientific polls - [there was no majority support for Russia's land grab](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed-md/public/2014/03/17/poll3.png).

Russia's usual cabal of Nazis, fascists, and communists, who were there to rubber-stamp whatever result Russia announces.

&gt; What anti German sentiment?

I was imprecise I agree. Mainly the right wing parties of European states push an anti Germany agenda. At least in countries like Poland and Greece; Germany is hated. Calling Germans Nazis. Creating images of your politicians in Nazi uniforms. The whole 9 yards you surely know what I am talking about.

&gt; Oppressing is to harsh word buy this progress benefits Germany at the cost of others.

That is your personal opinion. I don't think it is the case but neither you nor I do have proper sources so lets just agree to disagree.

&gt; Greece, Poland? Both countries have no chances as they are being strangled, all rules are skewed in Germany's favor. Germany is doing well because cheap labor, market owning and subservience of half of EU.

Thats not how international trade works. Salaries are lower in Poland and Greece but Germany imports and hires companies from all over the place.

ThatFeministGirl,whitenat,White Nationalist,"&gt; True, deaths outpace births. However it is fallacious to assume that this will continue indefinitely.

No, it isn't. Because it's easy to understand why this is going on.

&gt; Do you mind elaborating? Generally the fall in white fertility is accounted for by the Income vs fertility relationship, since whites typically earn more than non-whites their fertility is lower.

No, this is somewhere between misleading and blatant propaganda. The fact is that some of the largest baby booms throughout history have been during times of prosperity. The baby boom, the pax romana, and European colonialism all saw a lot of wealthy and middle class people having white babies. It happens to be the case today that wealthier people aren't breeding, but that's because white people are very future looking when it comes to kids. The media's trying to push shit like this to make childfree look like a status symbol. 

You can't just go to a low time preference group like whites, tax the shit out of them, fill their schools with people they don't trust, and expect them to breed. It doesn't work that way. You can't just try to make whites feel guilty for existing and then expect more existence from them. It doesn't work that way. I think it's intentional, but even if you think it's an accident, you need to understand how genocidal  this is. We're not brown people with high time preference who are used to living like shit and will have five kids they can't afford. We meticulously plan out every detail, and if ends don't meet, tend not to breed irresponsibly. 

&gt; Mind providing an example? I always about there being propaganda but I never actually see any. Sure there's stuff on the net and TV that is blatantly SJW shit but private organisations can say what they want.

[Govt sponsored propaganda.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb55teb1gJ0) [Articles like this.](http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2013/1307/360_cover_0812.jpg) [Entertainment glorification of race mixing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPI-mRFEIH0) I could probably list thousands of these examples, but those ones got a lot of publicity recently on the alt right. To some extent, you need to just look around. What color is every woman on every abortion billboard you've ever seen? Why are media figures like Jorge Ramos cheered on for celebrating a ""demographic revolution""? It's all over the place. Even things like Southpark that aren't meant to be catering to Katy Perry tier audiences are pushing the idea that in the future, there won't be white people. [And you know how sensitive white people are to shit like this.](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/children-carbon-footprint-climate-change-damage-having-kids-research-a7837961.html) White people care SO much about the environment. And it's interesting how the ""Have fewer children"" rhetoric is (a) not applied to Africa, where the influx population is an environmental disaster, and (b) how then they say that opens the door for mass migration. [The UN even calls it ""replacement migration.""](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/migration/migration.htm) My point in pointing out that they call it ""replacement migration"" isn't to suggest that they somehow stupidly forgot not to tip their hand, but to show that it clearly occupies that realm in their mind. Even if they have the best intention, they understand that they're replacing us. 

&gt; I'm not comfortable with any race disappearing naturally or otherwise. I just don't think that the changing demographics in the west is the result of a deliberate conspiracy, but rather one born of economic pressures.


Didn't you start this conversation by saying that we're more powerful and prosperous than ever and it's because of diversity, or was that someone else? 


And even if it's not intentional, even if it's just a genocidal accident, shouldn't you be fighting white genocide then? Why is it more important to you to frame our genocide as some sort of accident than to stop it from occurring? Is your ideal future for us all to be forgotten, but for there to be some footnote that says: ""But this one guy on reddit at least thought it was an accident!"" ?


&gt; It's a perspective thing; the west sees an oligarchic expansionist state trying to regain some of it's Soviet glory and the Russians see themselves as surrounded and looted by the west after the fall of the Soviet Union. I agree that the West needs to let up on Russia but at the same time Russia needs to stop invading it's neighbours.


No, the West doesn't see that. The West sees a convenient group to Other and try to make out as our enemy. They understand that Americans don't know many Russians, see Russians as scary, and that Boomers hate Russians. Russians are also white so they can do it without being called racist. That's all the West sees. It's opportunism. This Russia shit is propaganda, which is why in the 2012 election, Obama was making fun of Romney for it - it wasn't useful back then.

China can and does get tech from Europe and Russia anyways. It's not like China doesn't have GPS technology. Chinese technology has been rapidly improving the past few decades.

&gt;Why woul you want to give up control of the most advanced navigation systems ever created? Do you suggest we just start giving north Korea access to all the features of GPS to pit on their missiles?

That second question is ridiculous. You don't need to ask ridiculous questions to make you're point. Anyways, I don't see why any space cooperation with China would equate to giving them access to literally all of our technology. We already work with other nations. How come those countries don't have our technology? Joint cooperation on the International Space Station wouldn't entail any sharing of military tech.

&gt;Say you learn some sort of martial arts to protect yourself from bullies who physically bully you. Now say the bully has a friend. That friend might not bully you right now, but they bully your friends for being friends with you. Now martial arts can actually keep a person healthier. So it has good things to it too,and after all, the world is a better place with more healthy people. Are you going to teach that bully martial arts? Sure you could teach that person to be healthier, but you're stupid as fuck for teaching the friends of you bullies how to more efficiently bully you.

Assuming that China even wants to attack America in the first place. They're so overly focused on their economy and there's already enough issues in Asia already. Since space technology is ""dual-use,"" as you've stated, it's hard to know what China's intentions are unless we work with them in some fashion.

&gt;Do we just go ""hey Russia. You're tampering with our elections, bullying our closest friends, and taking over parts of countries with military force, that's bad. But in the name of science here is billions of dollars and decades of research to show you how to efficiently modernize your nuclear arsenal.""?

Again, that's totally ridiculous and is not the position of anyone who supports space cooperation. I'm not sure how it could possibly be in America's interest to modernize Russia's nuclear arsenal. Sharing satellite position information and nuclear weapons research are two totally different things.

&gt;Why should we give countries that are hostile to our intersts the same military and economic tech that we have? You can be as altruistic as you want, but the real world is a lot different.

Unless America wants to conquer all of space, I don't see how China is doing anything that can be considered detrimental to US interests. In fact, China is doing nothing in space that is abnormal.

You can straight fuck off with that narrative. We never cherry picked, we agreed on plenty of things that aren't really in our own interests and for our additional sovereignty we had to sacrifice political influence/rights in the EU. 

&gt;  It's not my fault 

I know the treaty of Rome, and I never said that it's your fault that so many EU citizens are poorly informed on it.

No thank you, I like my democratic rights and value them highly. Moreover I believe an Union that is being build from down up (from the people to the elites) instead of up down has a much better, more stable and longer future. Joining the EU is a very crucial decision, and should be made by the people (which would also guarantee a much wider and stronger acceptance of the EU by its citizens).

We never had full access to the single market. We also don't want to get rid of the free movement of people, but modify it slightly such that we can solve an apparent issue. Only if that is not possible, the issue continues and cannot be solved by other means, we would have to cancel the treaties (I really hope it doesn't come to this point, but the more times passes the more likely it becomes). Which would be a real shame, because it would be absolutely no problem and require little change and effort to solve the problem (oh how I dream of this, not only because it would solve the actual issue, but also because it would completely take the wind out of our national-conservatives sails - this topic is literally the only reason why they had success in the recent past).

I will gladly pay for it in my taxes as long as it is strictly limited to those who qualify.

SJtheFox,,1∆,"&gt;You're right that we're young. But even so- when looking around American cities, you're lucky if you see 1 historical monument, and it seems like it's always to the Confederate Dead or some general from the Civil War. There are disproportionately few monuments to the dead of the Revolutionary war, war of 1812, Spanish-American War, any of the Indian Wars, the Mexican-American war, WW1, WW2, Korean War, Vietnam, etc. And that's just war-related monuments! Where are the monuments commemorating escaped slaves, great entrepreneurs, inspiring preachers, challenging artists, and any other notable individuals?  While Europeans seem to put up plaques, monuments, statues, arches, etc, everywhere, where are America's?

I find this comment curious. I suspect we're both basing our perspectives on anecdotal evidence (I know I am), but I haven't found your statement to be true at all in my own experience. As someone who has lived in multiple states and many very different cities, I've been surprised by how easy it is to find historical/cultural places even in tiny towns. I used to live in a town of 8,000 - a poor, blue collar, struggling community - there were historical markers and monuments all over town. We're talking dozens of monuments that I just stumbled upon in a town you could drive all the way through in &lt;2 min, and they were mostly unrelated to war/battles at all. The bigger cities I've lived in have had even more historical and cultural attractions. When I lived in the South, yes, there were plenty of Confederate monuments, etc., but those were FAR from dominant. My point is that - as it's currently presented - it sounds like you might be indulging in some confirmation bias when you compare European cities to US cities. How are you concluding that US cities have so few monuments? Are you making an educated guess based on what you remember seeing or are you actively looking for all the historical places in any given city? I imagine it also depends on where you live and travel.

So you didn't agree with some of the terms and you had to make a compromise. So you can fuck off with your victim complex. It's not as if the EU blindly didn't give you access for a partisan reason. It did so because it has no interest in fragmenting the single market further. You knew from the start what the situation is, you signed it; it's there in black and white.

It's not wise to put such a wide ranging issue as a binary question. I understand that your tradition lies in direct democracy, but there are some decisions that are best made through your democratic representatives.

The reason, again, in case you chose to ignore it: referendums on the EU are rarely about the EU in practice. People couldn't give a fuck, they just see them as a way to shaft it to the government; that is to say, in simple terms, choose the exact opposite of what the government of the day is proposing.

It is European based - but other countries had been adopting it - it is a very useful way to eliminate the pure national splits in levels and create a framework based on skills (so A2 means the same in your French and German studies where the old style of ""beginner"" could be a very different level between two different languages and sometimes different programs for the same language). Some languages (Chinese and Japanese being the best known ones) have their own systems as well but there are mappings available on where the levels fall between the framework. That newish framework is very useful in standardizing the terms across languages - and lately it seems to be widely adopted by language-materials makers.

Usually you need to pay for an exam. However - there are some free old exams floating around (check for your specific languages - I do not speak French so no clue where those will be hiding) and then there is a checklist that someone posted a link to awhile back: https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/6lwynm/selfassessment_checklist/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link that is pretty accurate and very detailed.

Open baffle designs while simple to build in terms of woodworking have issues in bass and midrange due to interactions from the rear wave of the driver. Bass is reduced due to the rear wave being out of phase while the midrange will have a 3db peak due to the rear wave being in phase.

anarchyx34,,2016 Ford Fiesta 1.0 Ecoboost,"I have one, but with the 1.0 3-cyl Ecoboost engine. I'm very satisfied with it so far. I've only got 5k miles but I haven't had any problems with it aside from a software issue with climate control which was resolved in the first week of ownership. Other than that it's been pretty solid. No squeaks or rattles. I only paid $14k for it after deep Ford discounts and some additional dealer haggling. 

Favorite things about it:

* Excellent ride quality. Handles NYC roads better than a lot of the higher-end cars I've owned.
* Tossible handling. It's actually a lot of fun. 
* Decent level of equipment. I've got heated seats, automatic climate control, heated mirrors, trip computer, etc. Nothing else could have come close for the price.
* Fuel economy. Granted I have the high MPG engine option but I've gotten as much as 52MPG average on highway trips. I'm not a hypermiler either.
* The A/C is ridiculous. It's surprised me on some of the humid 100F days we've had. 
* If you want to mod it you have a bevy of options since the ST is a tuner's delight. Granted you're limited to suspension/cosmetics but there's plenty out there. 

What I don't like:

* The base Sync audio system. To be fair it doesn't actually sound bad for this class of car, but my gripe is more to do with the user interface/software. It's incredibly confusing to use, and tries to force you to use voice activation, which doesn't work right half of the time. It's livable but it should be better. Aftermarket options are available but you're limited to Single-DIN. Opt for Sync 3 if you can as it's a completely different system. 
* Pedal spacing makes heel-toe downshifting quite difficult. There's aftermarket solutions available for this but I haven't bothered yet. 
* Tight rear seat, at least compared to it's competitors
* Some interior materials feel/look a little cheap. 

Honestly it's a great little car. These things are like the #1 selling car in Europe for a reason. As far why it's so cheap? Well, for one it's not a Honda. That and the automatic transmission versions are plagued with issues, so it kinda killed the resale value.

If we joined the union recently it doesn't make us a lesser voice than any in the west; specially not from a country that's not even part of the Union its trying to change - that's how you antagonize people and get further divisions with your arrogant and entitled attitude.

You are absolutely correct in that assessment. Though we cannot come to reddit, publish a comment and expect universal approval, whatever the subject matter. People will both agree and disagree and isn't that free speech in action? Though given the topic, very few are prepared to support you by actually publishing their opinion, probably out of fear of unjustified labels being applied. For example, although you have no obligation whatsoever to make the following statement, for some reason people are sometimes expected to apologise for their opinions. 
&gt;...it's not because I'm homophobic.


And the apology doesn't really make any difference, people will still judge you. 


I am far from convinced that the survey results will come back with a overwhelming yes vote. Perhaps that sentence will come back to haunt me. Out there in the general public I am hearing many people who support a yes vote and in saying that there are many who are remaining silent. No doubt people keep their voting intentions to themselves, as they have the right to do so. But I also believe many are remaining quiet for reasons of judgement being passed upon them. 


Polling in Britain prior to brexit indicated the majority wanted to remain a part of the European Union, though the truth was a very different thing. People feared being labeled racist if they spoke out publicly about voting to leave the Union. I think that is what is happening here. For that we can place the blame squarely on the shoulders of the righteous dogooders of the world. They oppose anyone who does not support their views and will very quickly apply judgemental labels, racist, homophobe, nazi sympathizer, and so on and so forth depending on the topic at hand.

It wasn't until I was in NYC earlier this year and decided to check out some boutiques just for fun and to try on those ""oversized"" watches that I found that there were still a number of models that surprisingly fit my tiny wrists, specifically those at or under 39 mm. That weekend, I acquired my first watch - an IWC Portofino Automatic 37 mm, a rather spontaneous and emotionally-driven purchase that lacked a bit of research, but that's not this watch.

39mm seemed to be the magic number for me, which greatly ruled out a lot of watches, including Panerai. Panerais have a reputation for being big watches and, correct me if I'm wrong, was one of the drivers in the size increase in case diameter over the years, so I never really gave it any serious consideration. I was vacationing in Spain this summer when I stumbled upon a Panerai boutique in Madrid, and while I've liked the looks and ruggedness of Panerais, I believed that they were far too large for my wrists, with the smallest being the 40 mm. Surprisingly, when I tried it on, bracing to be disappointed by a clownishly large watch on my wrist, it...wasn't bad at all! And looking at the watch on my wrist in the mirror made it seem even smaller than looking at it straight down too (well, as small as Panerais can look). I was given a 10% discount and complimentary rubber strap (it came with a brown alligator strap that I felt was too hot for the weather) for it being my first Panerai (though I don't see any more Panerais on my grail list right now haha) and the fact that Spain had a 15% or 15.7% tax refund for spending 5000 euros or more (the highest I've seen in Europe!) made the decision a fairly easy one.

That system ended in the 2000, with the financial crisis in which we are still kind of in,  first with Parma and Lazio, where the owners did a proper and full bankrupt, and then came the others. Football became a global monster and they couldn't keep up. Even Juve made a big transition, and we were low profile with the transfer for a long time, and even now, it's not like we overspend. About Inter and Milan, those were kind of different stories. With Inter, for the Moratti's family the team was like the ""toy"" that was given to Massimo, the youngest one, but after the treble I think patience was over, and so they went on to sell the team. Speaking of Milan, Berlusconi had to pay a massive fine, in the order of 700mil, for the acquisition of the major publish company in Italy, Mondadori, and that, added with the ruins of his political carrier, put the last nail in the coffin of one of the most successful team in the history of European football.

Sorry I'm an ardent remainer but these points raised are silly.

&gt;An opt-out from the euro, but banker to the Eurozone

Why wouldn't we be, not all countries are in the Euro, why should it be one size fits all?

From what I know and I don't know a lot the euro is traded outside of the EU too and us not trading it would cause significant damage either side.

&gt;An opt-out from Schengen, but access to the security databases linked to it. A blanket opt-out from Justice and Home Affairs, with the possibility to opt back into the most effective crime-fighting measures.

We are an island and just like FoM it doesn't make sense to have 0 border controls, it's just not practical yet we still have FoM.

Clearly we'd be fucking stupid to, we're not the only country with a populace against the EU accepting massive amounts of refugees on our behalf. Also look at what the EU get in return for these.

More reasonable till we get to this:
&gt;The British Government was adamant that no UK money be used to help Greece and I do not recall the UK challenging the position of EU finance ministers towards Mr Varoufakis at that time.

So what? We can disagree with how the EU handled the Greek situation without being forced to help, we refused to join the Euro because it's a bad idea, why should we be forced to help? This is specifically a major part of the optout.

&gt;I do not recall the UK challenging the position of EU finance ministers towards Mr Varoufakis at that time.

thebiggreengun,SWIT,Switzerland,"&gt; So you didn't agree with some of the terms and you had to make a compromise

And how the fuck is that ""cherry picking""?! It's not. 

&gt; You knew from the start what the situation is

Did I at any point complain about the treaties we signed? I'm still happy we signed them. I complained about the stubbornness, the ignorance and arrogance of the EU in regards of an unpredictable issue that has become apparent over the past decade. 

&gt; Unfortunately it appears that the days of cooperation and good governance are over

Our will for cooperation is still as strong as it has always been, nothing has changed in that regard. 

&gt; What is said is fuck referendums on the EU.

Especially the fundamental decision of joining the EU or not should be made by the people. 

&gt; some decisions that are best made through your democratic representatives

Most decisions in Switzerland are being made by our democratic representatives. It's the very fundamental questions, the questions on which the parliament just couldn't find a compromise that's supported by a majority or 2/3 majority (so in the end it's the people who make the final decisions), questions on which the people feel misrepresented by the parliament (thus they can gather enough signatures and enforce a referendum) and all changes to the constitution proposed by the parliament that are being decided via a public vote. In the end that makes up for a very small percentage of all decisions. Nonetheless it's a very important and great democratic tool, guaranteeing that the people remain the true sovereign. 

&gt; I doubt that every single individual voting on a referendum to join the EU would sit and scrutinize all advantages and disadvantages of joining to make it an informed decision.


I think this is your biggest issue: You have little trust in your own people. Even though ""my side"" is often losing the public votes (but such is democracy) I generally have great trust in my people, and they have proven to deserve that trust more often enough. But most of all: I highly appreciate the democratic rights and trust I've been given, I learned to understand how important it is, that people cannot blame anyone but themselves if a decision turns out bad, and I love how people who have the arrogance to speak for the whole society even though their views are only being shared by a small minority have to face reality when a public votes reveals the ""true will of the people"".

&gt; that is to say, in simple terms, choose the exact opposite of what the government of the day is proposing.

To be honest I cannot relate to that. Most of our public votes end with what the government and the majority of the parliament have recommended.

&gt; so you would be closer to the EU than you're now.

Indeed. This issue has been feeding the anti EU forces for way too long already and unfortunately the behavior of the EU did fit perfectly into their narrative.  

&gt; But it's a question of how to make your point, and I don't think you're doing it to well

The EU well understands that it will be far easier for the UK government to get public backing for a huge divorce bill if they can sell it as part of a nice exit package. Thus, getting a nice fat exit fee from the UK is actually a pretty small priority for the EU. Perhaps they know that it's not possible for there to be any kind of post-Brexit agreement the UK public will like and thus they would rather push for getting the money first before the stark nature of the exit is plain for all to see (and therefore even less of a political will to pay a big exit fee).

Regardless, the point still stands. If the EU was interested in maximizing the size of the exit fee they would humour the UK with talks on other issues as well, or even (heaven forbid) be willing to compromise on free movement, etc.

BlandNameAndThoughts,,,"&gt;Is ""alt-right"" a misnomer?

Yes.

It is a ""misunderstanding"" and/or ""mistranslation"" of European labels applied to various **socialist** groups in Europe and the UK that advocate for the typical array of socialist programs, but usually include a nationalistic or anti-immigrant position as well.

In the European and UK perspective, Democrats in the US are ""the right"" as they are not socialist enough for the vast majority of parties in the EU and UK.

In terms of US politics, the ""Alt-Right"" are socialists and advocate for a wide array of socialist ideals and ideas with a nationalistic or anti-immigrant position; they are not conservatives or ""right wing"" at all.

National-socialists is a general term that could be employed to describe the ""Alt-Right"" in a more accurate manner... but this would mean the media would have to disclose that they are socialists... which would hurt the ""Burnie"" and ""Warren"" sides of the Democrat party.

Kross_B,,,"At the same time though, the number of customs declarations will increase considerably due to the UK leaving the customs union.

The risk is what happens if the UK crashes out without a deal, and they don't have the new IT systems and other vital customs infrastructure in place for that scenario. This is especially critical when it comes to European supply chains, such as the lorries going through the Chunnel, as they are a different beast altogether from importing non-EU goods.

https://www.farminguk.com/news/Lack-of-Brexit-border-controls-risks-disruption-to-UK-supply-chains-mainly-food_47303.html

&gt; The lack of Brexit border controls is risking disruption of UK supply chains, according to a new report released by the British Retail Consortium.

&gt; The group said there needs to be wider recognition of the ""complexity and scale"" of the challenge pertaining to future customs controls.

&gt; **It said there needs to be significant investment required in the UK’s ports, roads and infrastructure to get ""systems ready"" for Brexit, and a suite of new agreements supplementing customs necessary to side-step additional red tape at ports and docks and prevent delays to goods.**

&gt; European supply chains are a key part of delivering the goods that UK consumers buy every day. **The majority of those goods are ones that need to be transported quickly, particularly food.**

&gt; The BRC said this means the UK needs a system of controls after Brexit which ensures that products can continue to be imported without delays, disruption or additional costs, which would affect availability on the shelves, increase waste and push prices up.
 
&gt; The BRC said it is essential to ensure UK consumers are able to buy the products they want after Brexit.

&gt; **With annual customs declarations in the UK estimated to rise from 55 million to 255 million from March 2019, a no deal Brexit could mean new delays at ports of up to two to three days, the group warns.**

&gt; Helen Dickinson OBE, Chief Executive of the BRC said: “A strong deal on customs is absolutely essential to deliver a fair Brexit for consumers. Whilst the Government has acknowledged the need to avoid a cliff-edge after Brexit day, a customs union in itself won’t solve the problem of delays at ports.

&gt; **“So to ensure supply chains are not disrupted and goods continue to reach the shelves, agreements on security, transit, haulage, drivers, VAT and other checks will be required to get systems ready for March 2019.**

&gt; “We want to work with the Government to develop a system which works for consumers, so that there’s no difference in terms of the availability of affordable, quality products when they make purchases or visit stores post-Brexit.”

And when Khruschev tried to get smart and say ""I only agree to these terms if you give up your military bases in Europe and Asia,"" 
 Kennedy told him that the US government was in danger of being overthrown by a military coup, and if Khruschev didn't agree to Kennedy's terms immediately, there *would* be nuclear war. At which point Khruschev took his nukes and fucked right off.

Kennedy did literally the exact opposite of what you're advocating. He took Khruschev to the brink and never backed down. Why? Because he understood that no one remotely sane wants nuclear war.

V4Kompany,PAFR,,"Maybe this will drive home what im trying to say

""Fortunately, racism isn't part of human nature. The best evidence or this assertion is the fact that racism has not always existed.

Racism is a particular form of oppression. It stems from discrimination against a group of people based on the idea that some inherited characteristic, such as skin color, makes them inferior to their oppressors. Yet the concepts of ""race"" and ""racism"" are modern inventions. They arose and became part of the dominant ideology of society in the context of the African slave trade at the dawn of capitalism in the 1500s and 1600s.

Although it is a commonplace for academics and opponents of socialism to claim that Karl Marx ignored racism, Marx in fact described the processes that created modern racism. His explanation of the rise of capitalism placed the African slave trade, the European extermination of indigenous people in the Americas and colonialism at its heart. In Capital, Marx writes:

The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the indigenous population of the continent, the beginnings of the conquest and plunder of India, and the conversion of Africa into a preserve for the commercial hunting of black skins are all things that characterize the dawn of the era of capitalist production.

Marx connected his explanation of the role of the slave trade in the rise of capitalism to the social relations that produced racism against Africans. In Wage Labor and Capital, written 12 years before the American Civil War, he explains:

What is a Negro slave? A man of the black race. The one explanation is as good as the other.

A Negro is a Negro. He only becomes a slave in certain relations. A cotton spinning jenny is a machine for spinning cotton. It only becomes capital in certain relations. Torn away from these conditions, it is as little capital as gold by itself is money, or as sugar is the price of sugar.

In this passage, Marx shows no prejudice to Blacks (""a man of the black race,"" ""a Negro is a Negro""), but he mocks society's equation of ""Black"" and ""slave"" (""one explanation is as good as another""). He shows how the economic and social relations of emerging capitalism thrust Blacks into slavery (""he only becomes a slave in certain relations""), which produce the dominant ideology that equates being African with being a slave.

These fragments of Marx's writing give us a good start in understanding the Marxist explanation of the origins of racism. As the Trinidadian historian of slavery Eric Williams put it: ""Slavery was not born of racism: rather, racism was the consequence of slavery."" And, one should add, the consequence of modern slavery at the dawn of capitalism. While slavery existed as an economic system for thousands of years before the conquest of America, racism as we understand it today did not exist.""

I joined this sub because when I hear people talking about a ""white ethnostate"" I always genuinely wonder ""if that came to be, where do people like me and my family fit in?"" I would like to engage in a civil conversation, so if there are concrete ways I can reword either this question or later comments, I am open to suggestions.

So long as you are curious and intellectually honest, I won't be hostile toward you. But you have to understand we are trying to oppose anti-white propaganda (which you have likely internalized), and the most common form of anti-white propaganda is to undermine and deconstruct the notion of ""whiteness"" itself, by trying to analyze where whiteness ends and begins. It's simply the application of [Sorites' Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox) to justify the genocide of European peoples.

&gt;To reply to the first part of your comment, what practical ways would you like to see the country reaffirm the white majority?

I focus on immediate, short-term goals, because I don't really know what the future will bring. Those immediate goals include:

1) Normalizing white self-advocacy. Meaning whites can advocate for their survival and in their interests (as all other races do) without being publicly harassed, fired, disowned, and generally crucified as a ""racist.""

2) Shutting down illegal immigration and deporting existing illegals. ""Build The Wall.""

3) Having a serious policy discussion about restricting legal non-white immigration. Trump's visa changes are a step in this direction, and opens the door for us.

4) Ending forced integration of white communities through HUD housing projects, cross-city school busing, and the like.

5) Scaling back dysgenic social programs (eg. welfare).

Thane97,michigan,MI,"&gt;That's not even remotely true. Read many of the letters including those by Jefferson. Many of them talk about how slavery can't go on and it must be dissolved but there would've have been no US without it.

Yes but they did not consider the blacks to be on the same level of whites. 

&gt;skin color was never part of the founding hence ""all men are created equal""

Yet they still only let white property owning men of good standing vote. Either they were referring to whites and didn't assume this applied to blacks which would make sense since many of them were slave owners.

&gt;The other point is, if people from other countries want freedom and liberty and small government they can be white black or yellow, don't give a shit

Then they should have done it elsewhere. Homogeneity is important within a society and without it you get endless racial struggles as groups are forced to share land and law.

&gt;And neither should you. At this point white Europeans brining socialism and communism are becoming worse and worse than good natured Christian Mexicans who want liberty (many want welfare I admit).


Whites vote overwhelmingly for the republican party, Mexicans vote 70% for the democrats. Even if you were to only take the ones with conservative viewpoints they would vote along racial lines as do many groups. Regardless even if they ""love freedom"" they are still of an alien culture and will create enclaves for themselves which will result in defacto segregation and social issues.

Mundas,eu fnc,,"EULCS moves broadcasts to be Sat/Sun at EU primetime (RIP NA viewers).
 
EUCS gets heavily pushed and gets full broadcasts on Thurs/Fri. 

EUCS expanded to accommodate 10 teams (equal to EULCS).

EUCS spots are auctioned off to highest organizational bidders so that the cost raises and falls based off of risk speculation.

Circuit points expanded to award points for all teams including the bottom. 

Relegation removed from Spring split but expanded to 3 teams. 

Bottom 3 teams of point totals after Spring+Summer are placed in the promotion tournament. 

Top 3 CS teams of Summer are placed in the promotion tournament.

Promotion tournament takes place prior to regional gauntlet.

CS teams that qualify for the next year’s EULCS are given lowest seed of the regional gauntlet (potentially expanding the gauntlet by 3 and ensuring beastly CS super teams have an opportunity at the big stage once per calendar year).

EULCS teams that are relegated are guaranteed EUCS spots for the following year at no cost.

All remaining EUCS teams that did not promote must rebid for their CS spot (ensuring only competitive organizations with intentions to compete occupy these spots).

EUCS teams that competed in the previous calendar year are NOT guaranteed their spots for the next year, they MUST be among the highest bidders.

This ensures that: 

a.) EULCS remains the premier event 

b.) removes some of the relegation anxiety 

c.) retains relegation as a system 

d.) pushes the visibility and competitive viability of EUCS 

e.) gives EUCS organizations an opportunity to profit from their year-long investment if they can run the regional gauntlet and 

f.) ensures that bottomfeeder organizations can’t monopolize the CS spots while at the same time ensuring prospective new organizations are as competitive as possible (as they don’t want to have to bid for entry next calendar year and thus want to promote).

Obviously this requires significant investment by Riot and upends the current EULCS ecosystem, but I think that this covers the majority of the bases for organizations, fans, and Riot themselves.

Wikipedia cites two studies done in the UK and France:

&gt;Two studies of the background of Muslim terrorists in Europe—one of the UK and one of France—found little connection between religious piety and terrorism. According to a ""restricted"" report of hundreds of case studies by the UK domestic counter-intelligence agency MI5,

&gt;&gt;[f]ar from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation.[55]

&gt;A 2015 ""general portrait"" by Olivier Roy (see above) of ""the conditions and circumstances"" under which people living in France become ""Islamic radicals"" (terrorists or would-be terrorists) found radicalisation was not an ""uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts"".[56] Or as another observer described it:

&gt;&gt;the large majority of French jihadists are second-generation Muslims who, unlike their parents, speak French, grew up with little to no contact with mosques or Muslim organizations, and before their conversions drank, took drugs, and had girlfriends. They are estranged from their parents and don't know where to fit in. Or they are recent converts, largely from rural areas and many from divorced families. Why is that, Roy asks? If Islam or social conditions are essentially to blame for breeding terrorism, why do such structural problems affect only this very narrowly defined group? Why does it not attract first- or third-generation French Muslims, or those whose Islamic culture is the deepest? And why does its appeal extend to children of the successful middle class? His answer: jihadism is a nihilistic generational revolt, not a religiously inspired utopianism.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Renaissance**

The Renaissance (UK: , US: ) was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""Man is the measure of all things."" This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.

[deleted],,,"&gt; popular European and American culture and looks, but see there, are they even ""white"" culture and looks or is that just how they come across because of who controls them, who buys them (even Asian owned companies).

That's a really tough question, which I think can only be answered by the people who consume the product. What do they think they are consuming?

&gt; In a different example, I feel like your proposition is like saying a straight Asian man that is a fitness buff is trying to be less Asian and more white, but only because here, it's more generally perceived the norm for white men to be muscular than it is for Asian men.

[deleted],,,"The only kink I can think of that the realisation of it was like a slap in the face is Cuckolding. 

I was dating a girl in college who I was in an open relationship with. We both had sex with other people, but the only stipulation was that condoms were to be used and we could only do it in our bed if the other wouldn't be in the house during it. 

One day I arrive home way earlier then usual, and as I enter the apartment I hear the unmistakable sound of my ex in pleasure. It was obviously a great fuck, because she was absolutely howling. I was going to sneak out but something kept me from it. Something made me want to steal a look. This guy was obviously good. I was fighting an inner battle between should I look or shouldn't I when I was compelled towards the former when I heard a second male voice come from our bedroom. I had to look now. 

There were two ways into the bedroom; one from the hall, and the other through the bathroom. I would go through the bathroom because it opens outwards and the doorway is obscured by the wall. 

Anyway, I look in and behold a glorious sight; my ex is on her back and there's a very large black guy holding her legs up and plowing the fuck out of her. And an equally large black guy is squatting over her face, and I can see her little pink tongue buried between his cheeks. She's devouring his ass. As I watch he moves down so his balls are over her mouth before ordering her to suck his balls. They then switch to oral. 

I sat and watched this glorious sight I was conflicted; for one, it was the single most emasculating thing I've ever endured. Here was my beloved girlfriend getting fucked by two guys on the bed we slept. She was howling in ways I've never heard. Both of these guys were fucking studs, taller, more muscular, and more well-endowed then me. And then again, I was really turned on. I wanted to stay and watch, and I definitely wanted her to fuck more men. 

I mean, here was my quiet, nerdy girlfriend. Looking at her you wouldn't say she was out of the ordinary; she was a short, petite, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl who still had a slight Eastern European accent. She was the picture of innocence with her pink fluffy sweaters and love of cartoons. And yet her she was in front of me eating some guys ass and roaring in Hungarian to ''go deeper''.

To cut a long story short, I waited until the guys left a couple of hours later and went in and told her I saw her. She looked a little worried and instantly told me she was sorry, but I probably shocked her when I told her I loved seeing it and wanted to see it again. We agreed to end the open relationship and she would Cuck me.

Those two guys were her regular Bulls. They both fucked her at least five times a week while I was in college before she Cucked me. On Wednesdays they'd all three be off so they'd have a threesome. Now she fucked one of them everyday, with a threesome twice a week now. It was probably the best time I ever had and really opened my eyes to my love for being Cuckolded.

fourbet,,,"TL;DR: Within a fringe group within a fringe group of Racists, the idea that there are 'pure Aryans' in India is a thing, but it's not really common and it's sort of become exaggerated over time as a result of focus on a few of the more whackier Nazi personalities and probably some allied WW2 propaganda.

It's really complicated to completely flesh out. But around the same time that people were starting to figure out Evolution and 'Scientific Racism' (note: I don't mean this necessarily in the modern day definition) people also began to prove the relationship of Indo-European languages.

More specifically, scholars realized that the languages of Northern India and Persia were directly related to most languages in Europe.

This led to the theory of the existence of a [Proto-Indo-European](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/IE_expansion.png) people, or basically the original tribe/culture that started the language all these other languages are derived from. 

Fast forward to WW2 and some Nazis and [their fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitri_Devi) became interested in the idea of pre-Christian European Paganism. A few kinda fringe academics suspected that the original Indo-Europeans were sort of a 'master race', and that they had diluted their gene pool when they expanded to other regions. Still, many held that there may be 'pure Aryans' in Persia/India citing the very light skin and eyes sometimes found in Punjabis and Persians (it was thought that the original Indo-Europeans migrated to India first than eastward back into Europe). 

This led to the concept of returning to 'Aryan' genetics, which although is frequently referenced in relation to WW2 wasn't exactly as mainstream a thing as most people make it out to be.

China, Russia freight train delivers success, 17,000 tons of cargo

2017-08-28

With a long whistle, a freight train coded X8426 and loaded with electronic products, garment and machinery left southern China's city of Guangzhou Saturday morning, heading for Vorsino, Kaluzhskaya Oblast in Russia.

The Guangzhou-Russia freight train was inaugurated a year ago.

Over the past year, a total of 43 trains have run on the route, delivering more than 17,000 tonnes of products, worth 236 million U.S. dollars, from Guangzhou to Russia.

It takes the train 15 to 18 days to reach Vorsino, about 10 days less than the sea-rail transport service, and 25 days less than a ship. The costs are just one-third of air transportation.

""Our train runs once per week and were fully loaded from March this year, one of the highest loading rates among all China-Europe routes,"" said Huang Zhongxi, general manager of Guangzhou Dashunfa Logistics, the train operator.

Kong Zhi, from Guangzhou customs, said they had set up a window for China-Europe trains and had significantly raised the clearance efficiency.

More than 20 Chinese cities now run trains to central Asia and Europe.

Welcome to our twenty-ninth developers update for Call to Arms! We will use these updates to keep you posted on the progress of the development and features.Admittedly, you haven’t heard from us in a while. This has a reason though, we were entirely focusing on improving the game and readying it up for release. That being said, we will launch the biggest and last major update in a couple of weeks and after that we will put all our resources in bug fixing and listening to feedback from our community.So yes, you heard right, the game will leave Early Access in just a few months!In-game UIThe next update will finally feature the new in-game menu. It’s a much cleaner version of the one you have learned to know for so long. The improved interface only shows you what you currently need to see and helps to reduce clutter on your screen. We are excited to hear you opinion about it, once we released it in the next update!GraphicsWe almost completed the re-work of the in-game graphics to make them fit the demands of the new first-person view. In the same regard we also worked on several ways to optimize the current game performance so that everyone can enjoy it in a much smoother way. This also includes new lag free multiplayer controls.Of course, you will also get entirely new human skins for US Forces and much more! ːcta_emo10ːAIWe did several optimizations to the AI to address one of the biggest concerns players have. Especially vehicle pathing has been vastly improved, which is a pretty big game changer!First PersonFirst person also got another significant overhaul. Now ironsights come without artificial cursors and ACOG scopes and similar use proper sights instead of just plain crosshairs! Furthermore, we added a friend and foe detection in direct control. After aiming at an enemy unit for a while, you will get a visual confirmation that you are dealing with opposing forces. This feedback is also provided if you get hit by enemies. New factionsAfte release, you will get access to new factions, these include the UAF (arab government forces), Eastern European Rebels, German Army and Russian Army. Have a look at our new screenshots to get a taste of what you can expect! Can you tell us which tanks you see?BugfixesWe have done tons of bugfixes and gameplay improvements. Way too many to list them. Still there are plenty of improvements to be done and we are eager to listen to your experience with the new version soon.So thank you for your patience, we really think the waiting was worth it and Call to Arms is shaping up very nicely for a release later this year! ːcta_emo7ː

&gt;One thing I’ve observed with Google over the years is that it is institutionally so used to its ‘customers’ actually being its products that when it gets into businesses where it actually has customers it really has little sense of how to deal with them.

This, I think, will be what eventually unravels Google: they will try to censor themselves using only automated systems and gut their own userbase. This might not even be their own decision (see the EU's courts forcing them into increasingly restrictive censorship because there is no free speech over there) but regardless it'll still cause websites to either turn to a different ad service, change their funding model (say to donations of subscriptions), or just die.

Hitler also won not necessarily *in spite* of asshole antifa-esque communists but *because* of what the communists did.

The people who get to go to private health care is usually at the top of the food chain. It is difficult for me to give percentages, since they vary country to country and not all countries have the same systems -Switzerland being a curious example- but the majority of people get junk healthcare all while they have been brainwashed since their childhood to believe it is the best healthcare in the world. As they usually say, unlike what happens in those ""evil USA"" where you can die of cancer if you don't have health insurance. The latter is, of course, a lie, but it is a lie the propagandists who manage these systems use to keep their people in check. This is so extreme that socialized medicine is not questioned by any political party in these countries. Even the ""right wing"" parties in Canada or Western Europe are for socialized medicine because otherwise they wouldn't be able to win elections there. 

In the United States, before Obamacare, the middle class -even the poor in some cases via Medicare- and the rich went to exactly the same medical centers. That's not what happens in Canada or Western Europe. Remember that in the Soviet Union, those who were at the top of the Communist Party hierarchy also lived infinitely better lives than the average citizens. These average citizens were also brainwashed to believe that they had the better deal because, unlike those evil people in the ""free world"" they would never have to worry about becomin unemployed.

Because I have lived in the United States, Germany, France and Australia with most time spent in Germany and Australia. In short: The health care in Germany, France and Australia (all what you would call ""socialist"") is very good.
In Germany I could have opted out of the ""socialist"" health care because my income was above a certain level. (If you're in IT it usually is.) People who do it do it for the lower premiums, not because they will get different/better care. I chose not to, as sticking with the system will mean you're covered even when you're poor or broke. BTW even dental is included.
In France the health care is so good that the biggest problem is doctors over-delivering, meaning they are prone to provide more consultations, medicine, therapies etc. than you really need for whatever thing is that you have.
In Australia there is some degree of co-payment if you're employed but I think they waive it if you're unemployed.

Opération Licorne (French for Unicorn) was the name of the French Armed Forces's peacekeeping operation in support of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire. The French forces (la force Licorne) have been stationed in the country since shortly after the outbreak of the Ivorian Civil War. The troops' main mission was to support the United Nations peacekeeping mission and to ensure the security of French and foreign nationals.

Licorne was replaced on 1 January 2015 by the French forces in Ivory Coast.

European Union Force Chad/CAR, also EUFOR Tchad/RCA after the French, was the European Union mission in Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR), authorised in late 2007. EUFOR Chad/CAR was authorised under the same United Nations Security Council resolution that mandated MINURCAT, a UN force tasked with training police and improving judicial infrastructure.

The European Union Force's mandate included ""to take all necessary measures, within its capabilities and its area of operation in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic""  to protect civilians, facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid and ensure the safety of UN personnel. The military operation was approved by the Council of the European Union on 15 October 2007.

Wonderful.

Medical care is a commodity, like bread.  And the fact is, that there is a finite amount of bread in this world; and the only way to ration bread in the same way to everyone is to use a market.  The same is true for medical care.  There is a finite supply of doctors, meaning that we have to ration doctors somehow.  Again, we use a market.

Let's compare a market to alternatives.  We could ration care via waiting lists (like in much of Europe) where everyone has to wait four months to get an elective surgery (compared to about two weeks in the US).  

Our other option is to reduce the quality of care each citizen receives.  This of course would be unacceptable to most people.

AnonymousEngineer_,,,"&gt; Nobody is going to do that to the people who made the ad.

No, but there are a lot of people who will do everything within their power to ruin the lives and livelihoods of these people, and to an extent, the people who work for them.

As for your points:

1. Ultimately, SSM is a social issue, and to a certain extent, a religious one - marriage being a social/religious construct to begin with. While there are strong merits to the argument that SSM should be allowed due to a lack of equity between the way heterosexual and homosexual couples are currently viewed, the characterisation of this as a human rights issue is problematic, since it is not at all certain that this is the case (especially given the precedent case in the European Court of Human Rights which refuted that assertion). The equity issue could be solved, as it has in other countries, by devolving marriage to a purely religious construct, with the non-religious equivalent required for any marriage or partnership to be recognised by the Government being termed as a ""civil union"" or ""civil partnership""). As long as the advertisements do not contain threatening or intimidatory language (at which point they can be dealt with via the legal system), the people behind them have the right to campaign and express their views without having their physical or economic wellbeing threatened by those who do not agree with them.

2. The reason why those statements are mandatory, is so that the pecuniary interests of the people authorising the campaign are known. This is a check and balance in the interests of probity, and a safeguard against corruption. It was never the intent for the disclosure statements to be used to identify opponents for the purposes of meting out retribution. This is a recent phenomenon that is largely driven through social media, and which we have unfortunately copied from the United States.

3. I note that you're holding the people opposing SSM to a higher standard to St. Peter, to whom you are referring as ""the worst kind of Christian and the worst kind of hypocrite"". Most people short of the insane or fanatics have a hard-wired tendency towards self preservation. Again, I put forward the assertion that the only reason you want to identify these people is so you can whip up a social media firestorm and attempt to destroy their livelihoods.

Doroleux,,,"&gt;American main battle tanks in the European Theater of World War II were technologically inferior to their German counterparts


So one sentence in and he's already lying. That's a great start. The M4 Sherman was fundamentally not a tank the Germans could replicate. Americans could have built panthers or tigers or anything else the Germans fielded, but they elected not to nor did they borrow and design choices for their own tanks. The entire idea of building a cast hull was impossible for the Germans, and even in terms of steel quality and welding methods the Germans were behind. In light of this it is rather telling that the Germans went out of their way to slow production with unnecessary manufacturing steps.   


If you want to get more technical, the US 75mm gun was superior to most German guns when it was first developed and the 76mm was more than adequate in comparison to the fetishistized 75mm guns the Germans used. American tanks had gyroscopic stabilized guns, Germans did not. 
American engines were more effective than German engines, more reliable, their tanks were designed to ease servicing of the engines and even when they drank themselves under the table and made something like the Chrysler Multi-bank, which was a complicated monstrosity of an engine, it was still more reliable than what the Germans would slap together. 


&gt;Crews in the M4 Sherman tank thus suffered extreme casualtiesin the fight to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi Germany


M4 Sherman crews even during the African Campaign and Italy did not suffer casualty rates in excess of what German, Soviet, or British crews had to contend with.


&gt;This thesis contends that the U.S. Army had another tank available by the fall of 1944 that could have saved the lives of many American soldiers and might have also ended the war sooner than May 1945.


The Pershing was fundamentally not ready; where the Germans were more than happy to press untested, established designs and vehicles into service the Americans were understandably not. The greatest flaw for American tank designs was that while they could design engines that were powerful and reliable, they were also *big*. A major reason behind the T1/M6 heavy tank looking like a goddamn barn is because the engine for it was large. Pershing tanks had the same problem. They could put a powerful engine in it that could motor that weight, or they could put an engine in it that gave it a reasonable height profile, but they could not do both.


Plus, did they not teach him not to lead a sentence with, 'this thesis contends?' What's the fucking point of your thesis if you have to club the thrust of it's argument over the head of the reader one paragraph in? 


&gt;The Germans in particular are especially well known for their accomplishments in tank design, but this is not true for the Americans, who suffered horrible losses in armored forces because of their inferior tank designs. 


American tanks from WW2 stayed in service for decades after the war. German tanks cannot boast the same feat. The things that make German tanks impressive are not the kinds of things that are to their credit.


&gt;The United States did not make the correct decision in producing tanks in quantity rather than quality in World War II, and it both cost many lives and a delay in the end of the European Campaign. 


If I had a shot for every time he makes an unsubstantiated claim without citation of any sort of source I'd be under the table at this point designing Multi-banks. 


&gt;Developed throughout the years 1942 to the end of 1943, the Pershing improved on the Sherman in nearly every way:  it had a more powerful main cannon; it had more armor that was also better constructed; it had a better suspension system and wider tracks, allowing superior mobility, particularly in difficult terrain such as mud; it had a better interior design that prevented the fire problem present in the Sherman.


At least he didn't claim it was because American tanks used gasoline. There's two big problems with the Pershing though: it was slower, and it had reliability issues stemming from the suspension and power train (IIRC). And no, unless I'm missing something the same refinements for munitions storage in the M26 were present in late model M4 Shermans. Wet jackets were not terribly difficult to install, nor was taking away read racks and other storage in the turret. Of course on the other end of this, the Germans never actually changed ammo storage in any of their tanks that I am aware of. From the earliest Panzer 4 to the final models rolling off factory floors ammo positions never changed, nor did it in the Tiger or the Panther.


&gt;This tank, the Panzer V, would be designated the “Panther” and become a menace to Allied tanks until the war’s end.


Stug III's were less expensive, easier to move around, easier to conceal, more useful in defensive operations, were still a perfectly credible threat to Allied armor, and above all else were not prone to bursting into fire on the train car.


&gt;Belton Cooper’s book Death Traps: The Survival of an American Armored Division in World War II is built around this question.

robobob9000,,,"Glossika uses the grammar translation method. They take about 3000 of the most commonly used sentence structures in English and directly translate all of them into your target language. The vocabulary content is mostly geared towards travel and business.

This is fine for learning European languages that are close to English, because the 3000 most common English sentences are very similar to the 3000 most common Spanish sentences.

However, like all grammar-translation methodologies, Glossika is pretty useless when it comes to learning languages that are grammatically distant from English. Because the 3000 most common sentence structures in English are going to be totally different from the 3000 most common sentences in something like Japanese. Many times there will be information expressed in the English that can be expressed in many different ways in Japanese, and also vice-versua. 

So I would recommend Glossika for learning something like French or maybe Mandarin, but I would recommend against it for learning something like Arabic or Korean.

The nice thing about Glossika is that you can order custom-made laddered material. So if you're a native English speaker and you use their product to learn Spanish, then you can order a Spanish &gt; German Glossika product, and learn German from Spanish instead of doing it from English.

&gt; Poets of the Fall is a rock band formed in 2003 in Helsinki, Finland composed of singer Marko Saaresto (""Mark""), guitarist Olli Tukiainen (""Ollie"")  and keyboardist Markus Kaarlonen (""Captain""). They gained their first fame by recording the title theme of Max Payne 2, Late Goodbye. In June 2004 it was later released as a single and followed by Lift in September, which turned out to be a big hit. Their first album, Signs of Life was released in January 2005 and immediately went to number one on the Finnish Top40 list and remained on the chart for over a year. Their sophomore record Carnival of Rust was released in April 2006, preceded by a title track single, Carnival of Rust in March and providing another hit. The next singles were Sorry Go 'Round and Locking Up the Sun. Both albums have reached platinum status in Finland.

&gt; The name, Poets of the Fall, comes from the idea that two opposites form a whole, ie. there isn't one without the other. ""Poets"" here represent the positive side and ""the Fall"" the negative. Of course, when you join these two concepts, the ""Poets"" starts to sound just a tad mischievious as well... depends, of course, on how you perceive ""the Fall"". You might see it as a beautiful crisp season and the ""Poets"" are its insightful architects...

&gt; Among many others, the trio has received the following awards:

&gt; * Best Finnish Act at MTV Europe Music Awards 2006
* Best Finnish Music Video of all time in TV2's Musiikki-TV;     two bronze Muuvi Awards and Best Music Video of 2006 at The Voice (video Carnival of Rust)
* Two Emma Awards (the Finnish Grammys) in 2005 - the best debut album and the best new act
* Best Finnish band at the NRJ Radio Awards 2006
* Commercial Radio Stations' Newcomer of the Year Award in 2005

&gt;
&gt;Here’s the run down:
&gt;
&gt;-	The book is out on October 21st.
&gt;
&gt;-	It’s available through Amazon for order. 
&gt;
&gt;-	It’s a physical book- 600 pages, 14 illustrations created for the book.
&gt;
&gt;-	It’ll cost 16$ US, 20$ Canadian. The rest of the world- do the math!
&gt;
&gt;-	 100% of the profits is going towards cat shelters! The first cat shelter is called VOKRA, in Vancouver, Canada. 
&gt;Shhh! I haven’t told them about this yet!
&gt;
&gt;(Page is a WIP as I run too many errands today! If this sentence is still here it means I'm still busy!)
&gt;
&gt;(Okay! That’s the jist. I figured I’d make that simple explanation, in case someone would click here and only skim. Below you’ll find me talk and expand on all these topics! So read what interests you. Thanks everyone!)
&gt;
&gt;*** 
&gt;
&gt;Here we are! At the end of the ropes of this journey that started three years ago, with a [simple enough]( https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/2b653j/id_like_to_compile_normans_stories_into_an_ebook/) premise for a project, now blown up into a mild force of nature, with hundreds of contributors, all working towards a common goal- making the world a better place. Well, maybe not a better place, but a mildly improved place, like a renovated Mcdonald’s, or even a renovated Walmart.
&gt;It’s been a wild ride. When I started this project, I don’t think I had any idea what I was signing up for. I didn’t know Norman all that well, and I think it’s safe to say the subreddit back then didn’t either. Originally, the book was supposed to be a lot simpler. The plan was to collect 365 stories, past them together in a word document, and put it on the kindles. Of course things changed over the years. Norman blew up slightly, for one. Who would’ve thought that Norman would get 56,000 subscribers? Second, the quality of the stories had changed too. Most of the early stories had Norman as the butt of the joke, and I suppose he is still now. I think that Norman has matured a lot of a character, and when I collected the first batch of stories, I don’t think it was a good reflection of what Norman had become. So the project extended with a second batch of stories. Then, a third batch.
&gt;
&gt;Then a fourth. All in all, I’ve read thousands of Norman stories, and after a year and a half of constantly asking for more without considering where I stood, I’ve collected over 700 stories. Then the book project fattened up with the decision to become a physical copy, which is now a reality! The benefits include having the stories formatted in a nice way, greater control of the design of the book, the inclusion of artwork (which I’ll get into more in a different segment), and the inclusion of being able to put the book to my face, and sniff it. I am very much looking forward to that.
&gt;
&gt;**WHAT IS THE BOOK, EXACTLY?**
&gt;
&gt;In case you’ve made it this far into the post, or have been following the project but still not quite sure what the hell I’m planning and you’re too afraid to ask now, this little blurb will hopefully clear things up.
&gt;
&gt;The Book of Norman is a crossbreed between a serialized novel, an anthology book, and a coffee table book. The plot is minimal- it’s telling the day by day life of Norman, starting on January 1st, and ending on January 1st of the next year. Every day is an individual story, written by people here on the subreddit. Mainly they follow the similar structure you see here- roughly a page per story, though some go longer than that. The book is made in a way that there is a chronological reason for everything- stories of Norman’s car troubles line up properly with other writers’ car stories, and stories about Norman’s routines fit in routines set for the book too, like Chicken Thursdays. It’s also littered with subplots, some occurring at different points of the year, to keep things interesting. 
&gt;
&gt;The book also isn’t just comedic- the heavier themes that Norman tackles, like loneliness and depression, is handled with respect, but also not to beat the reader over the head. All in all, I’d hope that someone could read this and take away some new perspective on themselves. There’s two ways to look at Norman’s life- you can either find it depressing in it’s mundaneness, or perhaps you can take away just how content Norman is with his own life, and perhaps find some solace in the little things too. 
&gt;It’s also the sort of book that’s perfect if you only want to read something for a few minutes, on short commutes, or short trips to the toilet. 
&gt;
&gt;**THE BOOK IS OUT OCTOBER 21st.**
&gt;
&gt;That’s the date! I figured it’s a good time to release it- right before the holiday season, and far enough away from Halloween so we can enjoy Halloween in peace. It also gives a fair amount of time for people to stumble across and find this update, as well as have it so the book can reach people before the end of the year. There’s a few things left for me to do, mainly just technical jargon for getting it ready to be sellable. But the editing is as done as it can ever be, and everything is put in their places. 
&gt;
&gt;**AVAILABLE THROUGH AMAZON.CA/COM/EU**
&gt;
&gt;I decided to go with Createspace, which is a business model for self publishing that doesn’t involve me buying a bulk order of books and covering the expenses myself. Instead, it’s on a print on demand model, where the book will only be printed as often as it’s purchased. Also, the quality of prints generally seems to be pretty good! I would’ve loved to have found a traditional publisher, but this is what we got! Amazon is super handy for distribution too. A credible site with lots of traffic for buying books. It’ll be available for sale in North America and Europe, and if you live not in one of those two continents, send me a PM and I’ll see what I can do!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**IT’S A PHYSICAL BOOK, 600 PAGES, 14 ARTISTS**
&gt;
&gt;I mentioned above how the book works- with some stories taking more space than others. There’s also the artwork within the book too. There’s the two on the exterior of the book, which I’ll share here just to sweeten up this announcement. The front cover was done by Ryley Miller, and the back was done by Kody Urban, and we’ve been collaborating and working on those covers for quite some time. They’re little visual treasure hunts on either side littered with things from the book, dozens of Easter eggs to stumble throughout the story. On the inside, there’s another 12 drawings, one for the start of each month. Each of those drawings have their own little story as well- some are references to a specific story within their month, and some are generalizations of the theme of the month, trying to capture how Norman’s feeling. Then, there are some that are just fun- like Angela Protzman’s portrait of Norman posing with Norman.(link it?)
&gt;
&gt;**IT’ll COST 16$ US, 20$ CAD.**
&gt;
&gt;That’s the price! I feel like it’s a fairer amount, and possibly the lowest I could go before the profits would be rubbed to nothing. They’re also quite nice round numbers. Round numbers are nice. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**100% OF THE PROFITS IS GOING TOWARDS CAT SHELTERS!**
&gt;
&gt;I think I say “profits” in quotes because the whole 16$/20$ isn’t going towards charity, unfortunately. Amazon likes to take a cut, a fairly large cut. So now, it works out to roughly two dollars per book in profit, cutting back to me. Because book didn’t really cost me all that much, except a lot of time, and each artist who agreed to write/illustrate also agreed to giving to charity. Thankfully, we came out the other end without needing a second middleman.
&gt;
&gt;**THE PLANS FOR GIVING THE MONEY AWAY**
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea how well the book will do. I think, worst case scenario, the book makes 500 bucks. Best case scenario? Norman’s face is imprinted on the Statue of Liberty. It could really go either way, but because the book has the chance to make a lot of money or no money, I think the best course of action is to work on a ‘per 10,000$’ basis. For now, the charity the money is going towards is VOKRA, which stands for BLAHINSERTACRO. I chose them because they were a small, not profit volunteer driven charity, who has proven to do a lot of good for cats since they’ve been around since 2002, and seem to know what to do with their money. So, until The Book of Norman surpasses ten grand, they’ll be the only charity that gets the cut. But then I’m thinking that it would be nice to help out more than just one organization- and if the book does well enough, I’ll bring it up here on the subreddit! Find a charity we can all agree on that deserves some help. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know. 
&gt;
&gt;Okay! That’s everything folks! Three years later, and finally, a proper release date. I think one thing that I want to say and ask of the community, in the time coming before the launch, is please help get the word out! Marketing feels scummy, but if we don’t try and share it, mainly I’m thinking here on reddit, then the only people who will know about the book is the number of upvotes you see here. I think I’m going to fork some of my own money to buy some ads on reddit, and just try to help keep the subreddit get kicking again before the launch. Things have been quite dead around here lately, and I feel that the subreddit always gets a strong boost in quality stories when, 
&gt;well, new writers show up and try their own spin on the character.
&gt;
&gt;**Thanks everyone! Please tell your friends! See you on October 21st.**

There's no way of faking it, lol their cuckery is actually kinda fucking hilarious as it displays clearly just how utterly retarded they are.

For the Europeans I think it's more fair for them to criticize Trump since he is a foreign leader to them fair enough, but I think that's a bad call for any right-wing power as Trump is basically the most right-wing leader there is going.  Trump's weakenss is without him the cucks just take back charge, but I think it a miscalculation on their part.  Lots to learn from him while he is here and impress the next generation, mine, as it ages into power.

Denny_Craine,,,"&gt;but he was not that great with getting girlfriends

This seems to be a common thread among so many on the far right (I hate the term alt right, there's nothing new or alternative about it, it's the same ethno-nationalism that's been there for years), there's a common theme of early to mid 20s men dealing with the quarter life crisis so many of us (especially millenials) have gone through, having no sense of direction and few opportunities, and a difficulty finding romantic partners. All of which leaves them feeling lonely, alienated, and angry

I don't know what the solution is but I think it's a very important thing to recognize that these are the same conditions analysts have been saying attracts young Muslim men to jihadist movements. 

Whether domestically or in Europe or the middle east it's sexless young men with few opportunities and a dissatisfaction with the status quo politics that created that situation.

[deleted],,,"You've come about this the wrong way.  UEFA don't own football,  not really.  Go and Google the Platini interview with Martin Samuel and read what he says.  The ECA own football.

PSGs problem is their owners incredible naievity for politics which I'm not sure whether to be surprised about or unsurprised about.  The actions not just recently but overall are that of an immature schoolboy who doesn't like it when people tell.him no and thinks he can buy his way out of trouble.

Let me explain how football works at the top.  UEFA tries to do what it wants and the ECA apply constant pressure under the threat of breakaway to force it to do what they want.  And what they want is a revenue generating machine where the historically big clubs get preferable treatment in order to cater to the most fans.  This is why the new seeding system works how it does,  why FFP even exists and why it was changed for Milan.

PSG and Man City were taken over at similar times but the way they've gone about things couldn't be more different.  City appointed Directors who were already part of that ECA/UEFA old boys network; they spent a lot of time schmoozing and accepting the inevitable results of UEFA investigations without kicking up a fuss.  They told the ECA that far from trying to take over, they were serious businessmen whose interests aligned with theirs and they want to be PART of the cartel.  They want a seat at the table long term and were willing to be humbled short term to get there.

PSG has declared war on the table.  They didn't just break the rules, they took the piss with it.  Whereas City went to great lengths to use Mansours influence to generate this revenue with a shade of legitimacy, PSG literally just whacked a laughingly unjustifiable sponsorship deal with QTA on the table and said ""there's your FFP sorted"".  The Neymar and Mbappe stuff is just the latest expression of this.

PSG will end up thrown out of Europe because instead of trying to become part of the cartel by working with them, they've decided they'll do what they want instead.  And while this works as a Hollywood action movie, this type of maverickism doesn't work in real life.  You're pissing off the people who run a closed shop.

Cosimia1964,,,"Ultimately, you need to follow your gut. If it is telling you that there is danger here, listen to it. If spending time with her means that the kids spends less meaningful time with you, time with you wins every time. The train trip, for instance, is something you are doing with your kids, and you don't want them to disappear for a couple of days on your special trip with them. The other thing that is something special you want to do for the first time with your kids is a hard ""NO!"" Even having the kids for a month on the other side of the country is pushing it. When they are older, maybe, but not until you know both you and the kids can handle it. You can't exactly come rescue them if they are in trouble, and it seems like you don't fully trust her. This email about coordinating seems a bit entitled, because she isn't asking, she is telling you what is going to happen. Once again, a hard ""No, that isn't going to work for us.""

My red flag with you is that you start with the fact that you and your husband have ""created our own little bubble and don't like letting people in."" I get that, but as your kids grow up, people are going to be bursting that bubble wether you like it or not. A lot of the MILs created that same sort of bubble, and the problems that happen are because they are not flexible enough to let go of control of that bubble and/or to let it expand when it is time for their kids to grow up, or even let their kids move beyond that bubble. Sorry for taking your analogy too far. I am not saying that is you at all, but I am wondering if there is a little bit of this element mixed up with your understandable reluctance to allow your mom to take your kids to the other side of the country for a month, which is where your personal doubt about this is coming from. You are asking yourself if you are being too protective, or if your doubts and concerns are reasonable. This kind of self-reflection is a very good sign, and bodes well for you as a future parent of adults.

So, step back a bit, and have a conversation with your DH. Decide what you are comfortable with regarding the time and distance away from your kids you are comfortable with. This might be a multi-dimensional model. You might  be comfortable with certain relatives or friends taking your kids for a couple of weeks to Europe, but some people you would not feel comfortable leaving them alone with for 5 minutes. You may not even be able to articulate why you feel the way you do, but you both agree with it. If you don't agree, talking about it will help you figure out why you feel the way you do. How do you feel about your mom? What are you comfortable with? Would you feel differently if your step-dad were not in the picture? There is no right or wrong answer here. Trust your gut. She can ask all she wants, but you are the parent, and you decide what is best for your kids. If you have made the decision about what is and is not acceptable ahead of time, you will be more comfortable setting appropriate boundaries. We are all trained to be good kids and do what our parents want us to do whether they actually say it out loud or just hint at it. Some parents just have to sigh at the right time to get what they want. You don't have to be that person anymore. Your job now is to do what is best for your kids, and your mom can go pound sand if she doesn't like it.",True,False,,0,1504332260,,False,0,dmgjdwx,False,t3_6xjams,t3_6xjams,1506422730,8,False,JUSTNOMIL,t5_377ps,

OniLink96,,,"All of the novels have pretty tight focus on just one or two characters save for the Aftermath Trilogy, which changes perspective from Norra to Temmin to Sinjir to Jas pretty often.  So I guess not mostly guys, but there are still two of them and all of the characters are fairly equal in terms of importance.

There has been pretty little in the way of novels featuring original characters at all and Iden is the only female character to more more less have a starring role all to herself.  Though if you wanna get *real* technical, Iden was created for Battlefront II before she was created for the novel, so even she isn't exactly original to the novels.  Though I suppose that also discounts Temmin and leaves Sinjir as the only significant male presence in the Aftermath Trilogy that isn't a character created for something else.

There's been a particular lack of EU exclusive characters in both novels and comics, really.  I think that the Aftermath Trilogy and Twilight Company and Lost Stars draw a lot of their strength from not feeling like they're supposed to set up anything in particular and having a male lead doesn't really do anything for that, one way or another.  I just want more stories that feel like they're happening organically instead of trying to set up a new movie.  Because even though the Battle of Jakku was a big deal in the Aftermath Trilogy and Lost Stars it's not like either of them serve as direct bridges into TFA.

Though ""not feeling like they're supposed to set up anything in particular"" doesn't necessarily mean EU exclusive characters.  I think that Heir to the Jedi and Lords of the Sith are more interesting reads than some of the other things in the NEU because they're just free-floating stories that happened to have happened in this setting and aren't trying to get their leads anywhere in particular besides the end of the book.

Read it. 

It wasn't one rape. He waited for her husband to leave (iirc to work in a quarry for ~6 months) and then raped her continuously. He threatened to kill her sleeping children. He fucking bragged about it in public, saying he was taking aphrodisiacs beforehand, so that she could not show her face to people. She was a farm labourer. The fucker who raped her was a supervisor for farm workers. He took compromising photos of her and threatened to spread them around. Do you know the consequences of such a thing for women in Muslim countries? 

*On Aug. 28, 2012, Yildirim decided to break the vicious cycle of rape at gunpoint and the swirling rumors that had made her a prisoner in her home. Gider was once again at her door with a gun. She refused to take him in. The man tried to enter the house through the balcony. Yildirim grabbed the hunting rifle hanging on the wall and pulled the trigger several times. She said she has no recollection of what happened afterward. The next thing she knew, she was sitting at the gate of her house with bloody hands, with her 6-year-old daughter asking, “Mom, what happened to your hands?” She had decapitated Gider and tossed the head on the village square, shouting, “Here is the head of the one who dishonored me.”*

She was forced to give birth to the child put in her by rape despite requests for an abortion. The entire media flung mud at her. The court ruled that she'd been having a ""romantic affair"" and had never been raped in the first place. Her relatives abandoned her.

 This is a horror story.

Thanks for the reasoned response. Let me see if I can explain.

&gt; The biggest reason Americans are fat is because we have been a rich country for a long time

You'd be right if we were **not** [discussing America](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667). 

From the data:

&gt; High-income countries have greater rates of obesity than middle- and low-income countries (1). Countries that develop wealth also develop obesity; for instance, with economic growth in China and India, obesity rates have increased by several-fold (1). The **international** trend is that greater obesity tracks with greater wealth (2,3).

Emphasis mine, but so far, so good. However, then (again from the data):

&gt; Are poverty and obesity associated? Poverty rates and obesity were reviewed across 3,139 counties in the U.S. (2,6). **In contrast to international trends**, people in America who live in the most poverty-dense counties are those most prone to obesity (Fig. 1A). **Counties with poverty rates of &gt;35% have obesity rates 145% greater than wealthy counties**.

Again, emphasis mine. The takeaway is that, in the United States, wealth has an inverse relationship to obesity and their resulting diseases.

&gt; and businesses gave people what they wanted, tons of delicious food at a low price. That lead to people getting fat, a disease of the rich and happy. 

See above; not in the United States. I literally googled ""obesity rate by income USA"". I could have cited the NHS study on it, but you seem to not trust the outcome of action at a federal level, so I figured a hugely well-established non-political organization might be more trustworthy to you. Now, about the ""delicious food at a low price"":

&gt; Americans are starting to realize they have to watch their diet and business is changing,

This is true, but ironic, as it's revelations like [the fact that the sugar industry paid off Harvard University to blame consumption of fat for rising obesity rates](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/sugar-industry-paid-research-heart-disease-jama-report) that indisputably show that regulation of industry, at least at a baseline, is necessary at a federal level. 

People are starting to realize they have to watch their diet because large organizations in the public interest are revealing the truth: that obesity IS caused by ""tons of delicious food at a low price"". But not in the way you think. Turns out that, while fat is easy and cheap to add to food, sugar wasn't, as it is much less abundant. I say ""wasn't"" because this was the 50s and 60s, and so we needed an extra push to get the food Industry on board with buying more sugar, an add-on. 

Then, the sugar industry discovered the magic of high fructose corn syrup, *much* much less expensive to produce, increasing profit margins greatly, even at a lower wholesale cost. It gets a bit sciencey, by suddenly, foods began including more and more added sugar in the form of HFCS, leading to the sudden influx of ""light"" and ""fat free"" foods, which included more added sugar to replace the flavor lost from the reduction / substitution of fat. 

This came in the form of HFCS, which has 22% more fructose than glucose, and its molecules are not chained like less-processed sugar. The end result is that our cells don't release insulin when processing fructose like with glucose. This causes greater instances of obesity and complications from it, as shown in a [number of studies done on rats](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2010/03/22/sweet-problem-princeton-researchers-find-high-fructose-corn-syrup-prompts). 

The free market is literally favoring cheaper food sold at a higher profit margin that's more addictive to the human body (as we don't process as much of it as ""nutrition"", and it tickles the pleasure centers of our brain more - google or duckduckgo or whatever is your friend here), and it is selling it to poor people. Not fat people, *poor people*. Who then, in the USA and literally **no where else**, are 145% more likely to be obese.

&gt; with nutrition conscious foods booming (see: Amazon buying Whole Foods).

How do the two correlate? Amazon wants physical stores. They opened some as a trial. What better chain to buy than one that is frequented by [females between the ages of 25 and 39 with more than $1,000 in discretionary monthly income who likely work in architecture or interior design](http://www.businessinsider.com/whole-foods-customers-vs-aldi-2015-5)? In other words, people who order most of what isn't food from Amazon?

That's not ""the increasing nutrition consciousness"" of the American public, it's vertically integrating the places where wealthier people shop.

&gt; ""This is where libertarianism fails for me. It only works if you've already 'made it' by having the opportunities afforded to you that the vast majority don't, myself included.""

&gt; That's not accurate at all. The poor in countries that have been capitalist for generations are extremely well off compared to the poor in other countries, with most owning TVs, fridges, microwaves, computers, cell phones, and cars. 

Who mentioned capitalism? What do appliances have to do with obesity? You can have federal oversight and some blanket social programs and still be a capitalist society...? Last I checked, North Korea was the only actual ""communist"" country left, and I have no idea what their obesity rate is.

My point was that if you have access to educated parents who feed you in a balanced way because they were educated on how to, and a life if relatively low stress where you have the recreational time to go for a jog, and you can afford to shop at Whole Foods regularly, it's easy to not require additional resources to not be fat.

&gt; Poor people from other countries have been trying to get into America and Western Europe since the 1800s.

...sure...? But what does that say other than people wanting to be free from oppressive regimes and persecution, and possibly ensure a life for their children that is far better than it would be where they're coming from? What does that have to do with obesity vs. poverty, and education as it relates to either?

&gt; And personally, I'm a libertarian and I would be fine with short term state or local government programs to help people pay the bills while they are looking for work. It's only the federal programs I don't like. It creates stagnation in public policy.

Here's the thing - even things like the ACA are managed at a state level. Each state has their own exchange, etc. There aren't that many federal programs that are instituted and centrally administered by the federal government. How many times have you honestly had to do business with someone in Washington D.C. to accomplish some institutional task? I mean, we have things like the FAA, the FDA, the CDC, a common currency, common food standards, etc... things I think make sense to concur on (like air traffic and air space, how we respond to diseases, etc.) 

People like me that believe in efficient governance can still think that, if we are one nation, we should act like it and agree on a few very large, major and important things, like an extended family. There's waste and pork in federal spending, but the same applies to state spending, county spending, city spending, school district spending... pretty much anywhere people are involved and not as closely and publicly watched as they should be.

We should be turning lights on to make the roaches flee, but instead we argue about burning down the walls of the house. TL;DR here is, there are things that make sense to have managed locally. There are things that make sense to have standardized federally.

&gt; I work in digital marketing. The key to digital marketing is testing everything. They guy that is great at marketing but only does an A/B test will get worse performance almost every time compared to someone that tests 30 ads instead of only 2. So when you let the federal government set policy for the entire country, you are only testing one plan. When you let the 50 states set policy, you get 50 times as many chances to have a better outcome than the federal government.

Your analogy doesn't quite work here, and you actually illustrated why yourself. Ads perform well or not by demographic, as I'm sure you know. Each state is its own demographic, making its own ad for itself. Think of these as individual campaigns. Federal policy is not necessarily a competing ad campaign, but more of a corporate mission statement that informs the 50 individual campaigns. 

Nevada can have an ad campaign for how they handle registering car sales. Corporate HQ (the federal government) will not object - it is appropriate for that demographic, but still fits with the general mission statement of not being discriminatory (for example).

Utah can have an ad campaign (or 12) they A / B test which says you have to keep your ankles covered in public. Corporate HQ would ax the campaign because it goes against the mission statement: you can't be forced to dress a certain way in public.

Where federal and state policies conflict, the judicial branch gets involved to sort out whether the state law or policy is fair to *all Americans*, regardless of individual state.

This is important too because, as you implied, 50 markets are competing against each other in some ways too. If you don't have one governing body above them all, there's no one to catch individual states from cheating to unfairly compete (by dumping toxins into a drinking water supply, for example).

&gt; You would have to believe the federal government is so superior that they will do better in their one chance than the 50 states will be able to do with 50 swings at it. Ridiculous argument. 

Okay, for argument's sake, let's assume competing policies (because again, states can and do make laws, and they have a lot of leeway in how they're implemented.):

Parmesan is also more expensive in Europe, including Italy, than comparable hard cheeses, including Italian ones. The difference is that the name Parmesan is protected in the EU to only apply to the real thing, so things that might be sold as ""Parmesan"" elsewhere have other names here.

Importing things doesn't actually make them expensive. Just think about the world travels of a simple cheap t-shirt. Parmesan is expensive because it requires a long ripening time, i.e. storage space, and because it is of high quality with regards to ingredients and craftsmanship.

""Cultura universala"" din ultimii 200 de ani inseamna exclusiv cultura imperiala. Nu degeaba romanii care s-au afirmat au mers in vest sa se afirme.

Amen. I think that should be the real goal of these discussion right now, before we all drown in cure. 

On that note, I would also like to point out how much of a destabilizing factor these migrations have been, even threatening the stability of the host countries and their cooperative unions - something that I think provides justification for self defense measures being taken (in addition to the simple humanitarian justification that seems to be ignored). [Anecdotally](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/03/09/469647719/feeling-unwanted-in-germany-some-afghan-migrants-head-home), [many refugees](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/22/europe/italy-migrant-stories/index.html) do not want to leave or permanently migrate, many merely wish for the promises of western society (freedoms, social mobility, education, self determination), but by leaving they have made their countries, at least somewhat less likely to work toward those ideals (net emigration of ""moderate / non-violent"" persons, means relatively greater % of ""extremist / violent"" persons left). In order to correct the imbalance created by the migration itself, the people who were sought out as hosts, in this instance mainly EU countries, should fight the oppressors instead of turning inward on themselves or attacking the people seeking out their way of life - and work to establish areas that represent those values in and around the regions sparking the migrations. It seems to me people are arguing that either A) these people should have the right to pursue these ideals or B) they should go home, and far too few are arguing that these people should the ability to do both.",True,False,,0,1504338971,,1504339276,0,dmgluxl,False,t3_6v9y5v,t1_dmcl47b,1506423948,1,False,NeutralPolitics,t5_2tk0i,
UnderTheGuillotine,,,"Are you illiterate or merely ignoring everything that the above poster stated because it contradicts your quranic world view? As he stated, Mizrahim are the predominant population of Israeli Jews, they have never been out of the Middle East, that makes them as ""Semitic"" as any Arab. There is also no such thing as a ""Semitic race"".

Secondly, contemporary studies in population genetics has all but affirmed the Levantine origin of the vast majority of Jews, with the Mizrahim and Ashkenazim both being of predominant Levantine origin. Both of these Jewish groups exhibit, specifically on their Y-DNA, far more genetic affinity to the Samaritans, a people descended from the Israelites who had never left than the Palestinian Arabs do to the Samaritans.

The study produced by Haber/Zalloua et al (and undertaken predominantly in that hotbed of radical Zionism, the American University of Beirut), ""Genome-Wide Diversity in the Levant Reveals Recent Structuring by Culture"", determined the following:

1. Ashkenazim (despite some Southern European admixture picked up under the colonial influence of the Romans) are of predominant Levantine stock as is evident by the clustering in a private branch with the Mizrahi/Sephardic Jews, inferred by the model based Bayesian clustering analysis, affirming their origins in the Levant along with the Mizrahim. 

2. The predominantly muslim Syrian, Palestinian and Jordanians clustered on branches with Muslim populations as distant as Morocco and Yemen, indicative of extensive admixture with non-indigenous Arabians and correlating nicely with the islamic/arabian expansion.

3. The pre-Islamic Levant was genetically closer to Europe than it is today precisely because of non-indigenous, Arabian introgression correlating to the islamic expansion and a millenia of migration of Arabians and other external peoples into the Southern Levant.

4. Religiously isolated Near Eastern populations such as the Lebanese Christians and Mizrahi Jews show far closer genetic affinity to the Sidon BA Canaanite DNA (2017 Haber et al, Study, specifically detailed in the supplemental statistical analysis) than do the predominantly muslim Levantine populations, specifically Lebanese Muslims and even further away, Palestinian muslims. Even Yemenite Jews who exhibit some Arabian admixture are genetically closer to the BA Canaanite samples compared to the Palestinians sampled.

5.  Ashkenazi and Sephardic populations, to the extent that they may form a palimpsest of the Iron Age Israelites, reflect indigenous Late Bronze Age Canaanites. The genetic affinities of the Jewish populations with Druze and Lebanese may reflect a common Canaanite substrate. The Canaanites were a Semitic speaking people indigenous to the Levant and the Hebrew language remains the only extant Canaanite language. Arabic by contrast exhibits no Canaanite features such as the Canaanite Vowel Shift nor the w -&gt; y Consonant Shift because it is a non-indigenous language brought to the Levant by arab imperialist invaders along with the arabian supremacist islamic cult sourced from the hijaz.

gotokrokstadelva,,,"&gt; IQ-tester er ikke naturlover. Det er et mål som ofte er begrenset/hemmet av den personen/kulturen den er laget i. De reflekterer på ingen måter intelligens:

En avisartikkel fra The Telegraph. Nå er virkelighet og sannhet definitivt på plass. IQ-tester som utelukkende begrenser seg til mønstergjenkjenning er kulturuavhengige. Hvis kultur er avgjørende for alle grupper enn den kulturgruppen som skapte testen (europeere), hvorfor i all verden har det seg slik at blant annet øst-asiatere og ashkenazijøder scorer mye bedre enn europeere på disse testene?

&gt; På samme måte vil en afrikaner oppvokst i Norge ha høyere IQ enn en afrikaner oppvokst i et tredje verdens land i Afrika.

Har du noe belegg for denne påstanden, eller er dette noe du automatisk antar fordi det er en virkelighet som virker mer komfortabel enn den andre? Hvis afrikanere oppvokst i den vestlige verden oppnår samme resultater, fordi miljøet er det samme, så ville jo afroamerikanere vært på akkurat samme nivå som hvite amerikanere.

Faktisk kunne man jo argumentert for enda bedre resultater, for afroamerikanere har jo betydelige gjennomsnittsandeler av europeisk DNA, og har derfor ""the best of both worlds"". Men slik er det jo ikke.

Hvis dette ikke skulle stemme for afroamerikanere pga. rasisme osv, hvordan har det seg slik at f.eks. japanere skaper bedre resultater i USA enn hvite amerikanere?

&gt; Det har blitt påvist i tester hvordan mennesker med ulike adferdsmønstre, som folk som spiller mye videospill eller folk som tar i bruk rusmidler, ofte opparbeider resultater tilknyttet disse adferden.

Hæ? Hvilken atferd snakker du plutselig om nå?

&gt; Du har for eks. større genetiske likheter mellom en sort afrikaner nord i kontinentet, enn den samme afrikaneren har med en annen sort afrikaner helt sør i kontinentet. 

Den genetiske forskjellen mellom mennesker og sjimpanser er på ca. 1.2%. Den genetiske forskjellen på tvers av hele menneskearten, er ca. 0.2-0.4%.

Bare fordi dette er små tall, betyr ikke automatisk at forskjellene faktisk er så små at de er irrelevante.

i'm looking at the freedom lost, working out how much its worth (roughly) and then seeing what average incomes are. Its all very well saying that GDP went up, this ignores the fact that 4-5 months of leisure time was foribly removed.

I could chain you to a lathe and force you to work and you'd produce an awful lot compared to doing what you wanted most of the time, this isn't a benefit to you and we can tell this because I had to chain you to a lathe and force you to do it.

How much is access to a hundred acres of farmland and the removal of all taxes and rents worth? That's a good place to start.

&gt;You're aware most people didn't own property and thus couldn't vote then, right?

Yes, but they had access to enormous amounts of land, raw materials etc and were not taxed much, did not pay rents either and had few laws to obey. The state was miniscule compared to the size it needs to be to force property rights on the population constantly.

People were mostly free. Huge swathes of their time was spent on leisure activities.

&gt;Based on what metric?

Based on lost freedom, lost rights, lost time off.

&gt;Turns out it was 8-10 hours a day(no weekends) Plus 3 hours more for at least half the year, then 70 hours a week, declining later to 60, declined further over time. In 1937, before the FLSA i.e. the 40 hour workweek the average was 36 hours a week.

Wrong history, we are talking about europe. Stay on topic.

http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html

&gt; One of capitalism's most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil. This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth century. The implicit -- but rarely articulated -- assumption is that the eighty-hour standard has prevailed for centuries. The comparison conjures up the dreary life of medieval peasants, toiling steadily from dawn to dusk. We are asked to imagine the journeyman artisan in a cold, damp garret, rising even before the sun, laboring by candlelight late into the night.

&gt;These images are backward projections of modern work patterns. And they are false. Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all.

&gt;The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed. Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure. **When capitalism raised their incomes, it also took away their time**

&gt;they worked only as many days as were necessary to earn their customary income -- which in this case amounted to **about 120 days a year**, for a probable total of only 1,440 hours annually",True,False,,0,1504343135,,False,0,dmgn5pc,False,t3_6wzlut,t1_dmg9mcm,1506424589,1,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,

The tobacco tax has an effective rate of 14% on people making under 30k, a 4% effective rate on people making 30-60k, and a 2% effective rate on people making 60k+.  The payroll tax can't compete with that.

&gt; And since vaping is widely available as a less expensive and very effective nicotine replacement therapy, isn't actual tobacco a voluntary consumption ""good""?

True, but not relevant to the question of whether the tobacco tax is or isn't regressive.

&gt; Yes, college subsidies increase tuition when they're done in the crony way they have been in America, but I suggest Europe does it right, and in any case, the taxpayer still presently earns $5.50 per $1 invested in US public college tuition subsidies because degree holders pay way more in taxes over their lifetime.

I'd have to see that analysis to be sure, but I believe it's a large overstatement of the value of subsidies.  In particular, such analysis tends to assume those people who receive subsidies wouldn't go to college otherwise.  This assumption is a poor one, as colleges are reacting to the presence of subsidies in their pricing decisions.  

Colleges have extreme pricing power, and they price their product at the level the market can bear.  The result is a [huge pass-through effect on college subsidies](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr733.pdf).  Most of the money deployed towards college subsidies is simply a transfer from taxpayers to the rich.

They believe in Nationalism, Masculinity, Traditional gender roles, and 3rd position economics. 3rd position economics is neither capitalism, nor socialism, but a mixed system where a government of technocrats manage the economy. Private Property exists, but the only absolute rights are that of the state.

In the beginning they identified a Nation by heritage and culture, and not race, unlike National Socialism, a similar movement lead by Adolf Hitler in Germany. in 1938, though, this changed when they Allied with Germany.

The Fasct, the symbol of Fascism is an ancient roman symbol of authority. Italian Fascism stems from Mussolini's desire to bring back Rome, and restore Italy to Roman glory. Fascism is not a universalism, with national history being a big part of Fascist identity. So other nations, like Germany had their own version that had their own values.

The word ""fascism"" has been used to describe a whole spectrum of nationalist, anti-socialism, anti-capitalist, 3rd position economical systems, including national socialism, and social nationalism.

theinspectorst,,,"&gt;Leaving the EU a binary choice,

My entire point is that democratic politics are **not binary**. Democracy is a mechanism for arriving at imperfect compromises that bring together a society, not drive it apart. Undemocratic referenda on the other hand try to present decisions as binary, in which one side gets 100% of what they want and the other side gets nothing.

&gt;an agreement which ""everybody can sign up to as fair"" would never be reached with fanatical 'Remain' supporters like yourself who claim that the votes of people in Sunderland shouldn't count

The point I was making is that our democracy has been subverted. The 52% are being given 100% of the say over Brexit and the 48% are being given zero say. Plus the 52% have then gone to war with all of the checks and balances in our constitution - the role of Parliament, the judiciary, the civil service, etc - that would force the 52% to show some fucking humility and pay some democratic heed to the 48%.

In such ways, the 52% have assaulted the fragile basis on which we all sign up to being part of the same demos - which, per my original point, is a precondition for democracy and for us all being held to a 'democratic' outcome in which some people get outvoted by others. This may have very long-lasting repercussions, not least because the people and places that voted Remain are net taxpayers and the people and places that voted Leave are net spending recipients - so suddenly the foundations of our welfare state are brought into question too. The Brexiters are tearing this country apart with their selfishness. My exaggerated point about Sunderland was just serving to illustrate this.

In an alternate reality in which the Brexiters were more democratic and had an ounce of humility, they might have sought to address the concerns of Leavers without ignoring the concerns of Remainers. I struggle to believe that, given serious time and attention and negotiation to the problem over a number of years, we couldn't have reached a messy compromise that your so-called 'fanatical Remainers like me would have consented to as fair. But that's not what the 52% wanted. Even now the 52%'s politicians and media rail against treachery at any sign that Theresa May and her government might not pursue the hardest of hard Brexits.

The 52% need to learn about democracy, because they are the narrow majority now and our democracy will fail if they don't learn to behave responsibly.
