[We know global warming is having and will have a negative affect on us](http://www.skepticalscience.com/its-not-bad.htm)

&gt; What of mankind's impacts is actually causing this? The current buzzword seems to be ""carbon emissions"", but I've seen some references that indicate there are other interactions relevant to climate change.

Considering the greenhouse effect was described over a century ago, and still stands today, I think it's safe to say: carbon emissions.

&gt; Fat chance in hell China or India would care to weaken their industry for 'green'.

Actually, China sees a business opportunity. That's why they're implementing a carbon trading system in 2017 to reduce emissions across the board and are producing millions of solar panels.

The US has the opportunity to do the same, but it would require the government demanding that carbon emissions are reduced, such as with a carbon tax. Otherwise, no business will bother reducing their emissions. People will not prefer fuel-efficient vehicles, and will not install extra insulation in their homes, etc, etc.

&gt; Is the US going to ""go it alone"" on carbon? Would the US doing so have any meaningful impact to the original discussion about actually impacting climate change?

The US is a laggard currently. The EU has made more progress than the US since 1990. [Economists think the US should cut its emissions.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution) After all, it is the second-largest emitter, and has trade influence over just about every country.

&gt; If the US is not adequately powerful, then we cannot ""lead"" (and force) other countries to become half as efficient on climate change as we are

How is the US not powerful? It has the largest military, still the largest economy, and is a huge importer from China, India, Mexico etc all those countries you are calling inefficient.",0,AskTrumpSupporters,1,1468726562,t5_3cr3o,1464740957,nimble,,0,False,d3r44g5

It's hard to find some videos on Hillary that are not her character assassination. I happened to watch a few, giving the facts without bashing her. Here are some that might give you a different perspective on some of her actions, which have been now collectively denounced:

Of course, Sanders' people don't mind repeating half-truths, as long as they serve their purpose.

BTW, I don't have any interest in the US presidential race, as I can't vote, being European. However, I hate to see all this unjustifiable bashing of the most qualified candidate in this election, who happens to be the woman, fighting against various injustices for her entire life.

Believe it or not, Americans often get quite a bit of scrutiny at the UK border, because a lot of Americans have friends there -- and, of course, speak English.

I think that if you do 90 days in England more than twice, you very well might get some push-back at the UK border, if not some lengthy questioning, perhaps even on the first visit.

A few questions you might be asked:

1.) So, where exactly are you coming from? Where did you stay? What were you doing there? Were you working?

2.) Ah, so you say you were working in Holland and France -- did you have a work visa? (Checks your passport for something more than Schengen stamps.) Ah, you didn't? 

(At this point, you are sending a strong message to the UK border officer that you may be planning to do exactly the same -- working in the UK -- for three months.) 

3.) So, where will you be living in the UK? What will you be doing for three months? Have you got enough money? The UK is an expensive place, you know. 

Personally, I would do three months in the UK, and then choose three months somewhere else outside of Schengen, like (awesome) Istanbul or Serbia (or another Balkan country), where you can have a luxury, big flat for the cost of a shitty room in a shared flat in England. 

Also, if you do end up overstaying  your Schengen 90 days, even by a few days, there's a chance you will get a stamp in your passport (if not fined and/or banned for 5 years), so don't do that, and recognize that if you do overstay in Schengen, the UK might not allow you to be admitted, because they think you might do the same there. 

I know you think I'm exaggerating about the UK, but they really are incredible dicks to everyone staying more than a few weeks. (Personal experience: Although I now have an EU passport, I studied in the UK on a student visa in a U.S. passport.) 

Moreover, ‚Ç¨3,000/person for three months, won't be enough for the UK. Risky business!

Anyway, I think this is a great plan, but I do think you might fuck yourself if you do England more than once. (Also, generally speaking, Scottish border patrol officers are more generous, I've heard, than those in England, where there's a lot of xenophobia.)

Because they weren't far superior.  Contrary to popular belief, the dark ages weren't a decline for Europe but the transformation from the clan period to monarchy, with the formation of the modern countries originating in the dark ages.  They are just treated as a 'decline' because they aren't as well known as classical history or the age of exploration.  Saying the Middle East was far superior to Europe doesn't even make sense considering the Middle East was ruled by Greeks, Romans, then Romanized Greeks for a large portion of its history.

As to why Europe took off?  Before industrialization, wealth was created on plantation based agriculture, which does best in warm fertile regions.  This is why the fertile crescent, nile river delta, and yellow river valley did well during the classical era.  This is also why Southern Europe was wealthier than Northern Europe during the classical era.  Trade was dominated by the silk road, which connected China, the Arab World and Southern Europe.  With the Age of Exploration that began to change, with transatlantic trade becoming a great source of wealth for Western and Northern Europe.  Southern Europe, the Middle East, and China, which were well connected to trade during the Silk Road era but were not connected to the new transatlantic trade routes.  Industrialization created another source of wealth, this time far greater than what agriculture alone could provide and sprang up first in Northern Europe.  Industrialization did best in regions where labor wasn't already consumed by plantation based agriculture.  This shifted the wealthiest regions of the world from warm fertile regions to colder less fertile regions.

The Dalai Lama was present during the cultural genocide of Tibet. His country, Tibet, was settled and taken over forcibly by the Chinese. Mao Zedong whispered into his ear ""Religion is poison"" before he started a campaign of wiping out their entire culture/religion.

Trump supporters want to keep refugees out for the following reasons (correct me if you feel these are in accurate):

1. Fear of potential terrorism
2. Having to support the unemployed through government programs like welfare
3. Having potential jobs taken
4. Inability of non-western Muslims to assimilate into western culture.
5. Permanent stay in their country.

The Dalai Lama *wants Europe to accept refugees into their countries for the sake of their safety and well-being*, and you can see that in the article. He doesn't want them to *stay permanently*. Trump supporters don't want them there in the first place and their reasons against them coming in in the first place are based on cultural/racial stereotypes (that granted, have at least some basis in reality) of non-western Muslims coming into the country and failing to assimilate and causing social conflict. Many liberals want them to return to their home country after they are safe and ready to return. He is against the permanent residence of Muslims in European countries because he feels that they may lead to the cultural genocide that happened to his people. He doesn't want Germany to become an Arab country the way Tibet became part of China. His reasons aren't based on cultural/racial stereotypes, but the very fact that different cultures exist.

Any of the European rubbers should give you good spin + speed. Andro Rasant for balanced spin/speed. Joola Maxx or Rhyzm for maximum spin. Donic Sonex JP Gold or Bluefire M2 for blistering speed. Tibhar for really soft-sponge rubbers like Genius Sound or 5Q Sound or Aurus Sound.

Make sure you are using high viscosity water-glue when sticking rubbers.

 Also if you are using water-glue and have tuned the rubber ( booster ) you will need to give 24 - 48 hours extra before the rubber becomes almost flat and ready for sticking. You will need to put the rubber + blade under some weight overnight ( only on the rubber and not the handle ! You will break your blade!) to get the rubber to stay stuck.

Normally, water-glue has problems if you dont dry it thoroughly. And a semi wet glue is going make the rubber come off the paddle.

LS is also known as LastShadow. He previously had a background in starcraft (I think BroodWar) and also Poker. He started looking into LoL like late season 3 to early season 4. His previous  Esports experience wtih Starcraft meant that he was clearly very knowledgable within the subject. He very quickly began to understand the game and by part of the way through the summer split of EU LCS he had established himself as the head coach of SHC (Supa Hot Crew) who finished 3rd in the regular season. They were a decent roster, with players like Selfie, KaSing and Impaler. Unfortunately they messed up in playoffs and he stopped coaching them

Since LS is American he then went on to coach an NA team, called Brawl with ex-TSM chaox, Remilia and Selfie. That didnt work out so he then went onto coach gravity in NA LCS. Complications arose since he had lived in Korea for several years before that. After that he left the team and in Korea he streamed a lot. He is actually very good at the game, and consistantly reached high diamond - master tier on the KR server. He plays with LCK pros sometimes and he can speak/understand Korean very well. As for his game knowledge it is really really impressive. Like it is super good, he sometimes has problem explaining it in a way everyone can understand, but in terms of how he understands the game, he understands it to an LCK pro player level. His mechanics aren't really the best though, so he sits in high diamond and low masters usually, playing champs like Lulu and soraka.

As for Rapid, idk how much you know about him either but he is a rly good caster. Before SpoTV hired him he did stuff independently. He covers a huge variety of games. Even the obsure games nobody else wanted to cast, he would do. Such as the EU CS qualifier games in the EUNE region and other obscure leagues.

As someone who used to watch (and love) the OGN broadcast, I found myself equally as happy to watch this new broadcast as the old OGN one which is now on LCK 1.

1464750949,1,Nepata,t3_4lywvp,,t3_4lywvp,"&gt;Statistically almost all immigration to the US is from 3rd world countries.

I question this. PEW Research Center seems to indicate that a majority come from 1st world countries, although a large amount certainly come from poorer countries too. Almost all, though, is heavily misleading (considering that 23% come from Mexico, and many come from Europe/China/Japan).  

The argument is essentially the same Libertarian argument for most/all other things. It is a violation of the NAP to have closed borders. It is government coercion backed up by the threat of violence. Libertarians aren't pro immigration *or* pro open borders. This is a common misconception. We are pro border privatization, which can be similar, but yet very different. We still want to take some common sense approaches to immigration like removing the incentivization for immigration though.",0,Libertarian,1,1468729536,t5_2qh63,False,,,0,False,d3raflv

Exactly.

&gt;Trump isn't anti-immigration. He's anti-unvetted and illegal immigration.

He is vocally anti-accepting-of-any-refugees. Let's make sure we're staying on topic. If you feel the brush I painted was inaccurate, please say so, but I think it's a fair representation.

&gt;And that's what will happen to the USA as well if we accept mass Muslim immigration.

Okay. We're talking about the Dalai Lama and his views on Europe, make sure we're on topic.

&gt;Funny how you assume the worst with the reasoning

Feel free to argue different reasons, but so far your one argument was that Muslims that immigrate en masse will not assimilate. You fear that some are Jihadists who pose a danger, that's 2 of the 5 bulletpoints. Are you not against the idea that they will either take American jobs and/or welfare? And I think you might be misinterpreting the use of my word ""stereotype"" here. Stereotypes can be based on reality. It is stereotypical that non-western Muslims have a hard time fitting into western culture, it is also *true* for the group if we view it as a whole.

&gt;Trump and his supporters use literally the same reasoning that the Dalai Lama uses.

I demonstrated that they aren't. The Dalai Lama wants to give asylum to refugees and wants them to leave later, Trump supporters don't want to give them asylum in the first place. What they have in common that they want to preserve the culture of their countries, but not that they are afraid of the socio-economical damage that they might do to the country. No one thinks it's bigoted to send refugees back home when it's safe. People *do* think it's bigoted not to let them in in the first place because of the stereotype of the group as a whole.",0,AskTrumpSupporters,4,1468729569,t5_3cr3o,1464751279,nimble,,0,False,d3rai45

It is by far not an ideal language for the equal representation of global cultures, nor is it the most efficient design of communication, nor the easiest possible structure to learn. However, it is relatable, familiar. It found friends with Europeans who easily associated with it, giving an edge against its competitors at the time. Also importantly, it has the inherent flexibility for change, on top of an author who permitted the idea of change, which feeds into an unidealistic, imperfect naturalization of the language. All this upsets the idealistic views of conlang enthusiasts, but increases its viability for a friendly, easy-to-learn language in an increasingly English-focused international playing field. Esperanto is what it is today because of how it was made and how it stayed with the changing times.

then you have the guys who join because their countries are so terrible they will do literally anything to get out, and the Legion offers a handy path for those who want to. no idea what they say in the interviews with the recruiters and the Gestapo about their motivation, but obviously many still get through, if for no other reason than that the are probably far less likely to desert than brits or americans. obviously, they don't make very motivated soldiers.

finally. although this is slowly changing. its still an occasionally violent place where the NCOs have been known to pick on and extort junior enlisted (especially weak ones). in many european countries, military service is not viewed as an especially or unusually noble profession as it is here in the United States. for many it is just a job and they will get everything they can out of it, by means legal or otherwise.

&gt;Some things are starting to become very clear about why you refuse to accept that immigrants are causing problems there.

I'm white, calm down. Don't worry, I'm white.

&gt;LOL No I'm not scared of the Roma but they do cause a lot of problems including crime and squatting on private property without permission of the owners. 

That's true, but it's not like that's a recent issue. 

&gt;Serbs and Russians typically assimilate to the countries they move to.

Russians are typically socially conservative so might not fit in so well in Sweden and the like.

&gt;I seem to recall a few news stories about Muslims doing that. Maybe you have read them? Or the grenade attacks in Malmo? 

ISIS is currently a huge terrorist organisation attacking various western places in an attempt to draw out a war and have people like you think that its ""muslims"" who are doing the attacks, yes. And it's working. This doesn't prove that muslims are terrorists.

&gt; Maybe you have read them? Or the grenade attacks in Malmo? 

Again, mass shootings in the US are a much bigger issue for you to worry about than muslim terrorism.

&gt;As for the rapes, Sweden is cucked so they refuse to release the crime stats by race or immigrant status.

Oh right, that must be it. The facts agree with you but the govt is just too ""cucked"" (cringe) to release the data that proves you're right. and it's just a coincidence al the available data proves you wrong.

&gt;However if you dig into these incidents, each one tends to be a migrant.

I'm going to hold you to this:

How many of the people arrested for the NYE attacks were recent refugees/migrants from the ME? How many attacks on US soil were done by refugees?

There are much easier ways to get into a contry than waiting several years to most likely have your asylum status rejected.

People like to throw around accusations like ""the white man's burden"" as to discredit some some as racist, or possibly taken as a metaphor for a condescending view of ""undeveloped"" national culture and economic traditions, identified as a sense of European ascendancy which has been called ""cultural imperialism"". Considering that, I argue that contact with the Amazon people is a philanthropic view which the rich nations surrounding them have a moral duty and obligation to help the poor better themselves whether the poor want the help or not.

When you think about it, the indigenous people are so backwards that they could not effectively understand modern forms of government, and therefore can not effectively rule themselves. How will the Amazon people survive when their rainforests are close to disappearing because of exploitation of logging industries? There have already been instances of tribes begging for help because they can't adapt to climate change or fight off drug cartels and poachers.  If they are not killed by the rapidly changing environment they are displaced into an urban center and assimilated into the New culture with the destruction of their culture.

 It is Western society's responsibility, then, to guide and structure these primitive Amazon peoples in the limited ways that they could understand, until they naturally matured enough culturally to act like civilized people.

I'm only too aware of how little market penetration the old consoles had, east of the Atlantic. (I'm from the US, originally from the South; even there, consoles were pretty easy to come by.) And at least from what I've seen, the average pirate distributor has bad taste in what games to pirate -- like you mention with ""200 different Mario cracks in one.""

The pirates have pretty ambitious console designs, though. That Polystation picture, I don't know what to think of it -- it's somewhere between bleak and amazing. And the Pegasus certainly had a nice name, if nothing else.

Then again, things weren't the best even in the US; Nintendo had strange ideas as far as what kind of games the US would want to buy, and the SNES really acquired its reputation once it went out of production and piracy picked up in the early 2000s. Even then, though, the games are interesting more for their potential than for what they actually accomplished; even Squaresoft at its high-water mark made a lot of amateurish mistakes. I've got some ideas for the kind of things that JRPGs tried and failed to evolve into; maybe I'll get the chance to explore them one day.


At any rate, though, I know what you mean about Paradox; their games really don't have much charm, and I expect that they'd leave anyone cold if he was used to Koei.

Depends on which country, and which drugs. In the US thousands of people are incarcerated for petty drug possession which in many European countries would get you either a warning or is entirely legal. There are drugs which are over-the-counter in the UK which are illegal in the US, for example if in the UK you buy Modafinil online, you've done nothing wrong. You do that in the US without a prescription and you could potentially be fined tens of thousands of dollars and go to prison in many states; maximum sentence in california is a year. For a drug which has no physical or psychological addictiveness and no side effects beyond that of acetaminophen.

I'd also argue that freedom for you guys to use whatever food additives you want in your food, whatever amounts of HFCS, etc, is not really a good freedom.

It will just not happen, and if it would, nothing garantee that all of them will push for sharia law. Even inside a country, nobody in history achieved such a union of objectives.

&gt; Idk where you get that assumption from.

One of the stats I gave you earlier.

&gt; The facts are that it didn't, and there is more extremist now then 10 years ago

Tides goes in tides goes out. Extremism has been repelled in Europe during the previous centuries, it may come back in one form or another a little, but I'm confident it will lower again.

The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Southeast Europe with different and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the east of Serbia to the Black Sea at the east of Bulgaria.

The Balkans are bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea on the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast.

 I suspect IndianCountry subreddit is populated with white passing Natives.   You can tell by the way they act towards any stupid white person who wanders in there asking questions and being shitty.  They are *super* tolerant, like they are speaking to one of their own.  Or maybe it's just me and I'm a crazy asshole and too angry but they strike me as way too tolerant of white fuckery and seem very liberal and they say the same sorts of things, that it's a state of mind and connection with the culture. I do believe in having ""an Indian nature"" though.  It seems we are naturally oriented in a way that is diametrically opposed to WASP culture.  The perspectives and ways of thinking and being are totally different (I think the suppression of this nature in addition to the poverty contributes to the high rates of suicide) and it seems very radical to white people, even white people who believe themselves to have ""fringe"" beliefs. It surprises me actually.  




 On the one hand the issue with blood quantum seems valid and there are issues with disenrollment but I'm not sure that's for me to have an opinion on since I was never enrolled and never received shit...  but on the other, you never have white passing mixed people with one drop of African blood in them going around claiming a deep spiritual connection to African or black culture.  And they never try to reclaim their *actual* European tribal roots and culture, which would be perfectly valid.  I ask them what it means to them to be part Native American and they never have an answer.  





I personally grew up totally ashamed and embarrassed of being Native American because I grew up around white people and Hispanics, especially my spiritual beliefs because of stupid white people conflating new age hippie bullshit with Native American spirituality.

&gt; BRUSSELS/LONDON European Union governments should not ban services like home-rental site Airbnb or ride-hailing app Uber except as a last resort, the EU says in new guidelines, seeking to rein in a crackdown on the &amp;quot;Sharing economy&amp;quot;.

&gt; In guidelines seen by Reuters, the European Commission said any restrictions by EU member states on these new online services should be justified and proportionate to the public interest at stake.

&gt; A case in point is Uber, which considers itself merely a digital service connecting drivers and passengers as opposed to a transport service, which would make it subject to more onerous rules on driver qualifications, road rules and insurance.

1464765119,1,baazaa,t1_d3rfsqi,,t3_4lu8tj,"&gt; So explain the USA and China?

China isn't resource rich relative to it's size and population. The USA largely achieved supremacy by protecting its nascent industries from British competition, back when their dollar was too high due to cotton exports and the like. You'll probably recall Adam Smith: 

&gt; It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American colonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures, those household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the women and children in every private family... 

&gt;Were the Americans, either by combination, or by any other sort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and, by thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital into this employment, they would retard, instead of accelerating, the further increase in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct, instead of promoting, the progress of their country towards real wealth and greatness.

The northern industrialists wanted protectionist measures and they got them (it was one of the reasons for the civil war). Needless to say the wars in the 20th century definitely helped the US as well.

Nowadays the USA has all the talent and capital, it's hard to overcome that sort of entrenched advantage (you have economies of scale etc.). It still didn't protect the rust belt though. As you point out their high-tech sector also benefited from things like the space program and military R&amp;D.

 If we abandon free trade and adopt protectionism then we can easily compete, indeed that's why we had an automotive industry and a steel industry etc. in the first place, but that's not going to happen.

&gt; So you are saying we join the Euro and that will make all the difference?

Yes if we joined a currency union we'd be a beneficiary. 

&gt; Well that's strange, most people at work are highly trained. 

Is this an export industry or one that's effectively trapped here? Because if it's the latter and the industry doesn't employ many people then it doesn't say much about our ability to produce human capital besides the fact that we can do it if really necessary. So far as I'm concerned the only high-skilled field that we're competitive in is mining services (although there's some nice green-shoots in biotech, aquaculture, a few other things).  

As for Germany, the kids there that can't get into uni and are ushered into technical jobs seem to end up better-employed than our graduates. If we stopped treating 'years of schooling' as a proxy for human capital and consider actual hard technical skills their workforce would slaughter ours.

 ---  

&gt;A Casta (Spanish: [Ààkasta], Portuguese: [Ààkast…ê, Ààka Ét…ê]) was a hierarchical system of race classification created by Spanish elites (espa√±oles) in Hispanic America during the eighteenth century. The sistema de castas or the sociedad de castas was used in 17th and 18th centuries in Spanish America and Spanish Philippines to describe as a whole and socially rank the mixed-race people who were born during the post-Conquest period. The process of mixing ancestries in the union of people of different races was known as mestizaje. A parallel system of categorization based on the degree of acculturation to Hispanic culture, which distinguished between gente de raz√≥n (Hispanics) and gente sin raz√≥n (non-acculturated natives), concurrently existed and supported the idea of the racial classification system.

 &gt;Created by European (white) elites, the sistema de castas or the sociedad de castas, was based on the principle that people varied largely due to their birth, color, race and origin of ethnic types. The system of castas was more than socio-racial classification. It had an effect on every aspect of life, including economics and taxation. Both the Spanish colonial state and the Church required more tax and tribute payments from those of lower socio-racial categories. Related to Spanish ideas about purity of blood (which historically also related to its reconquest of Spain from the Moors), the colonists established a caste system in Latin America by which a person's socio-economic status generally correlated with race or racial mix in the known family background, or simply on phenotype (physical appearance) if the family background was unknown. From the colonial period, when the Spanish imposed control, many wealthy persons and high government officials were of peninsular (Iberian) and/or European background, while African or indigenous ancestry, or dark skin, generally was correlated with inferiority and poverty. The ""whiter"" the heritage a person could claim, the higher in status they could claim; conversely, darker features meant less opportunity.

Tu n'as aucune id√©e de ce dont tu parle. La ""loi travail"" en Suisse on l'a d'aussi loin que je m'en souvienne, et personne n'en est mort. Les patrons Suisse ne licencient pas en masse, notre taux de ch√¥mage est tr√®s bas et nos salaires √©lev√©s, c'est √† dire tout le contraire de ce que pr√©disent les pleureuses fran√ßaises. Et les frontaliers fran√ßais viennent s'offrir sur le march√© du travail Suisse comme jamais. Quelle bande de tra√Ætres, pas vrai ? Se vendre √† des esclavagistes!

&gt; mais tout le monde sait bien pourquoi le fric coule tellement √† flot en Suisse.
  
C'est des conneries. La Suisse avait un [d√©ficit budg√©taires sur plusieurs ann√©es](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/government-budget) et il a fallu que l'on se dote d'une loi sur le frein √† l'endettement, accept√©e par le peuple, pour r√©ellement r√©gler le probl√®me. La fameuse ""r√®gle d'or"", qui nous a bien servi, tellement bien que l'Allemagne s'en est inspir√© et l'utilise d√©sormais pour son propre compte. Si le fric coulait √† flot en Suisse nous n'aurions jamais eu besoin d'une loi sur l'endettement, alors arr√™te de raconter des sornettes, merci.

La France aurait vot√© une augmentation de ses cong√©s les yeux ferm√©s au nom du ""progr√®s social"", en laissant la facture √† l'√©conomie!
  
&gt;ou le fait que vous √™tes tr√®s travailleurs/mieux form√©s. Tu sais bien au fond de toi que la Suisse n'est rien de plus qu'un Luxembourg/Monaco en plus gros et n'existe qu'√† travers son secteur bancaire.
  
Balance les chiffres. Dire que la Suisse n'existe que par son secteur bancaire est aussi stupide que de dire que la France n'existe que par son tourisme.
  
Je n'ai aucune piti√© et je te dis les choses clairement car tu en as grand besoin. La France est un pays impossible √† r√©former et Jupp√© en sait quelque chose. Le bilan de Hollande s'est r√©sum√© √† vous vendre des r√©formettes sociales qui ne co√ªtaient pas un rond, il n'y a rien sur le fond.

 ---  

&gt;Podemos (Spanish: [poÀà√∞emos], translated in English as ""We can"") is a left-wing political party in Spain.

 &gt;The party was founded in March 2014 in the aftermath of the 15-M Movement protests against inequality and corruption by political scientist Pablo Iglesias. Podemos is a left wing populist party, which seeks to address the problems of inequality, unemployment and economic malaise that followed in the wake of the European debt crisis. Podemos has called for a renegotiation of austerity measures and seeks to curtail the Treaty of Lisbon. The term ""populist"" is sometimes used by political opponents to refer to the party in a pejorative way.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/f2f7dcef5b43440fb2bd7fc769f1c66c.png)  

&gt; Wishbone Ash is a British rock band which achieved its greatest success in the early and mid-1970s. Their most popular albums included Wishbone Ash (1970), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976). They were one of the first bands to use twin lead guitars.

&gt; Wishbone Ash can trace its origins back to Torquay, Devon, England, a seaside resort in the southwest of the country. It was there that Martin Turner and Steve Upton first performed together; Turner on bass, Upton on drums, before moving to London in 1969 to seek fame and fortune. In the capital the decision was made to place an advertisement for a keyboard player and a lead guitarist. The resulting audition threw up two guitar leads, but nobody could decide who to choose and the trademark twin-lead sound of Wishbone Ash was born.

&gt; Ted (David) Turner and Andy Powell soon went through the poverty and growing pains of a new band, but were fortunate that Miles Copeland was championing their cause and a fairly rapid progression was achieved. The first Album, Wishbone Ash, was released in December 1970 and their second, Pilgrimage, surfaced just six months later to reach #6 in the NME charts. Great things were just 11 months away with the release of Argus (1972) -- possibly the band's best album; certainly their most commercially successful -- which reached #2 in the UK charts and went gold.  Argus is considered to be one of the great rock classics of all time.  The next album, Wishbone Four, only 12 months later, went silver.  

&gt; After these early highs, Ted Turner decided that he had had enough, and left the band to be replaced by Laurie Wisefield. Although Laurie‚Äôs style was not to everyone‚Äôs taste, he was generally well liked by the fans and brought a slightly harder edge to the folk-tinged progressive rock that was the Wishbone Ash formula. Wisefield was a dynamic player and became an excellent partner to Andy -- they were to play together for a very successful 11 years and the MKII version of the band is very well thought of for most of its output. About this time the band became more influenced by America and would eventually move there. 

&gt; The next album, There's The Rub (1974), was recorded in Florida and produced by Eagles producer Bill Szymczyk. Once again it was to do well, achieving silver disc status. There's the Rub included the instrumental piece F.U.B.B.  Steve Upton was arrested in New Zealand for announcing at a concert it's full title.  In New Zealand, swearing in public is a criminal offense, and when Upton announced the title at an outdoor concert, a woman sunbathing in her garden nearby complained to the mayor. Upton spent the night in jail, and the album reached #3 in New Zealand due to the publicity.

&gt; It was inevitable that a turkey was due and to fans Locked In (1976) fit this bill. This record was not released -- it escaped! Fortunately things were much better with the quality of the following albums and although the high chart positions were gone, the fans were enjoying some competent, well-crafted output.
 
After 11 years in the band, Martin Turner decided to leave. This move began a period of frequent changes of bass player with the likes of John Wetton and Trevor Bolder being two of the better known; however, Wishbone Ash always has attracted musicians of the highest order. A much more controversial move was the introduction of Clair Hamill to fill in some of the vocal talent Martin had taken away with him. Clair was not popular with the fans which was perhaps a little unfair. She had contributed backing vocals on Just Testing (Turner's last album (1980), which he had also produced) and had co-written the excellent Living Proof, which is still a crowd favourite today. Her stay was short-lived with Andy Powell taking on more vocal duties. Wisefield left in late 1985 and the band continued to tour with various replacements, but were very much in limbo until 1987 when a miracle occurred. Miles Copland persuaded the original lineup to reform for a project for a music charity that he was helping, and a Hammersmith Odeon concert which the BBC recorded resulted. The project produced an instrumental album Nouveau Calls (1987), which was very well received. Even better received was the fact that three years of the original lineup were to follow. 

&gt; Just when things were going so well, Steve Upton decided to quit the business entirely in 1990, to be replaced by Ray Weston. Martin Turner carried on for another year before leaving to pursue a solo career, and Ted left two years later. The next five years saw lots of personnel changes, but eventually resulted in a good period of stability with Ray Weston returning and Bob Skeet joining on bass in 1998.

&gt; The new millennium has also seen stability in respect of Andy's guitar partner, with the last 6 years being filled by Ben Granfelt and subsequently Muddy Manninen, both of whom come from Finland. 2005 saw Wishbone Ash celebrate their 35th year. 2006 heralded the new album Clan Destiny (the first featuring Muddy as guitarist). 2007 saw the exit of long-term drummer Ray Weston, due to the increasingly hectic pace of band life. Joe Crabtree (formerly of The David Cross band) stepped up to fill his place. With regard to new releases, 2007 saw First Light, which features original recordings of the songs featured on their debut album, as well as some outtakes. Also released that year was the new album The Power of Eternity (partly featuring Joe Crabtree on drums), which coincided with the Autumn tour.

&gt; Wishbone Ash are still performing 150 gigs a year in the U.S. and Europe. They get very supportive crowds with good numbers turning out all over Europe -- the U.S. tends to attract smaller audiences, but very committed fans.

1464770815,1,JJSwat77,t3_4m075m,,t3_4m075m,"The LCS, LCK, LPL, and LMS are all just the tournament names for the different regions. The format for each of these regional tournaments differs per region so if you want specifics you can look those up. They are sectioned into two ""splits"" spring and summer. The spring split champions get to go to MSI while the summer split champions are guaranteed a spot at worlds. Oh and the NA and EU LCS aren't really related in any meaningful way.

 MSI takes place in the gap between the splits and is like a mini worlds, the best teams from each region compete and they fight for seeding at Worlds which means MSI this year was actually somewhat impactful.

After MSI the second split for each respective region starts which is why they are live right now, EU and NA start in a few days.

After the splits are over the best teams from each region as well as some international wildcard teams (these are teams from regions that are smaller and do not have their own big tournaments  during the year like the LCS) go to compete at Worlds. This is the biggest and most important tournament of the year and always has some great games.
 Again the qualification to get to Worlds varies from region to region so if you want to know more about that you can look it up.

The challenger series for each region is a place where up and coming pro teams compete for a spot in their region's big tournament (example NA challenger competes for a chance to get into the LCS) At the end of each split the bottom teams are relegated and forced to play against these challenger teams to retain their spots within their respective regional tournament. Again the specifics on the challenger series, relegation, and promotion to the regional tournament (LCS) vary from region to region so you'll have to look up specifics if you want them.

As far as all star, it's just a fun tournament where fans vote for their favorite players from each region to go compete together, meaning you could have a team with a mixture of NA and Korean players playing against a team made up of EU and Chinese players. It holds no real value as far as standings in other tournaments or Worlds goes but I do believe there is a monetary reward for the victors.

I hope this helped and wasn't too confusing; I know it's long but I tried to keep it as organized and concise as I could. 

Edit: If you want schedules for all of these events just look at the lolesports website.

1464772606,3,Ligerian,t1_d3ric6u,,t3_4lzyoh,"&gt; Lorsque la France est intervenue en Libye, c'√©tait avec une r√©solution l'ONU qui sp√©cifiait noir sur blanc que les troupes ne devaient pas mettre le pieds dans le pays.

Pire que cela, la France ne devait pas attaquer mais juste emp√™cher les troupes et avions loyalistes d'attaquer. Mais, en pratique, on a fait ""Bah le plus simple pour pas qu'ils attaquent, c'est de les attaquer !"". L'objectif √©tait bien de faire tomber Kadhafi  et il √©t√© clairement affich√© par tout le monde dans les m√©dias. Ce qui est assez formidable quand on y pense : des dirigeants francais, tout sourire, admettent sans g√™ne enfreindre le droit international. 

Donc les r√©solutions de l'ONU ca pourrait aller si c'√©tait pas juste de l'op√©ration de comm' : le r√©sultat vient en parti de notre non-respect du droit international et du refus de dialogues. En effet, il y a eu des plans de paix pr√©voyant des √©lections (propos√© par des pays d'Am√©riques du Sud notamment) et accept√©s par Kadhafi mais on les a juste √©cart√©s d'un revers de la main. La raison : les mecs qu'on voulait mettre (le fameux ""conseil national"") repr√©sentaient peanuts et Kadhafi aurait surement gagn√© des √©lections !

&gt; La Yougoslavie aussi a √©t√© un √©norme fiasco

Un beau merdier aussi √ßa, mais il s'est pas r√©sum√© √† juste envoyer des casques bleues pour faire joli. D√©j√†, la base il y avait un projet de casser compl√®tement une r√©gion, sortie partiellement de l'influence du grand fr√®re russe, avec des gros probl√®mes mais incluant encore un semblant de socialisme et une d√©fiance pour l'OTAN parfaitement inacceptable bien entendu.   

&gt; l'ONU n'est pas une assembl√©e de doux r√™veurs bienveillants, mais un espace de n√©gociation entre des dirigeants avec leurs propres int√©r√™ts

Tout √† fait, mais au moins les choses se font au yeux du monde et des peuples, qui peuvent constater clairement les mensonges de leur gouvernants (et demander des comptes). Faut quand m√™me se rappeler des √©pisodes comme Colin Powell avec sa petite fiole d'arme bact√©riologique irakien (comme le disait ma√Ætre Verg√®s ""les mauvaises langues disent que c'est BHL qui a piss√© dans la fiole avant la s√©ance""). Les peuples √©tant g√©n√©ralement oppos√© aux guerres d'agressions, c'est au moins positif qu'il voient leurs dirigeants se confondre dans des op√©rations de comm' devant l'ONU avec des mensonges et des hypocrisies.

In romania, in functie de context/auto/domeniu, vei vedea ca leadership si management sunt terminologii folosite interschimbabile. Asa ca trebuie sa te intreb ce te intereseaza mai exact? Partea teoretica a leadershipului/managementului sau partea practica/aplicativa?

Partea teoretica este foarte comuna si poti gasi o cantitate enorma de teorii de leadership/management. Ele deseori nu sunt fundamendate in realitate, atat pentru leadership/management (relatia intre superior-subaltern) cat si in cadrul sistemelor de management.

Spui ca te intereseaza cele din Europa, ei bine, leadershipul este universal, componenta culturala fiind minora. Iar un sistem de management care se respecta ofera un cadru teoretic care este universal prin natura sa. Asa ca nu este nevoie sa te limitezi la cele din Europa, mai ales daca iei in considerare ca e un continent omogen si nu vei gasi diferente majore, mai ales la nivel inalt (corporate) unde e la moda sa aplici ultimul ragnet in materie de leadership/management/team leading etc. Anii trecuti era la moda Kaizen-ul, acum din cate pot sa vad pe piata, a inceput sa scada.

Cat despre universitati, nu vei gasi, cel putin in tara, cursuri decente. ASE-ul, care se lauda cu partea economica/manageriala, foloseste niste carti scrise de profii de acolo ce contint niste chestii hibride si foarte diluate, care se bazeaza pe teoriile classice (Fayolism, Taylorism, etc) imbinate cu opiniiile personale ale autorilor. Evident, dupa cum am mentionat anterior, nu sunt fundamentate catusi de putin in realitate. Nici macar teoriile clasice pe care se bazeaza nu erau foarte aplicabile in perioada lor, ce sa mai zicem acum? Eu personal iti recomand sa citesti in mod cronologic despre variile teorii si sisteme care au fost create, despre autorii lor (ca sa intelegi de unde vin ideile) si despre situatia economica/sociala pe scurt din perioada lor. Cartea [asta](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000148.html) e un primer bun, dar ca toate lucrurile in viata, e bine sa citesti si de la alti autori pentru a evita sa iei ca a tare biasul autorului respectiv.

Cand treci de partea clasica, poti sa incepi sa cauti pe google (nu stiu de nici o carte care sa anexeze bine ultimele teorii aparute) teorii moderne despre leadership / sisteme moderne de management. Aici vei intra deja in articole/studii publicate in jurnale de specialitate. Evita rahaturile de pe bloguri/site-uri axate pe ""business"" sunt doar apa de ploaia, marketing gimmicks pentru consultanti.

Acum, daca ai ochiul format, o sa vezi pe partea de management ca este foarte criticat modelul clasic al economiei, intrucat nici o persoana inteligenta nu accepta modelul omului rational ca motor al economiei moderne (sau chiar clasice, dar e alta discutie). Behavioural Economics / Evolutionary Economics fiind directiile sugerate, dar pentru ele ai nevoie de o intelegere mai adanca a fenomenelor psihologice umane sau teoria evolutiei biologice, numai asa poti intelege mecanismele pe care se bazeaza. Inevitabil, daca ajungi in ramurile astea, vei gasi si critici asupra modelelor clasice sociologice pe care se bazeaza teoriile de leadership.

Aceeasi recomandare o am si pentru teoriile de leadership, citeste despre ele in mod cronologic, o sa vezi ca o parte din ele se intercaleaza cu cele de management, iar pe masura ce citesti despre teoriile moderne (post 1960-70) vei vedea ca se axeaza mai mult pe natura innascuta a omului si pe mecanismele ei cat si pe natura contextuala a liderului.

pues bien como el gobierno USA no hace nada gratis, se lo han cobrado, las falsas acusaciones de este mentecato a sueldo de la DEA, agencia antidrogas. por el expediente de quedar nuestro ej√©rcito a disposici√≥n de los planes de Washington para acosar las fronteras rusas en una escalada peligros√≠sima de tensi√≥n contra un pa√≠s contra el que no tenemos ning√∫n contencioso, todo lo contrario, es un alisado contra el yihadismo y las amenazas que nos afectan espec√≠ficamente, procedentes del sur del Medditerr√°neo.Y la base de Rota, cuya soberan√≠a completa ha sido cedida al Gobierno USA,en una medida extrema sin precedentes a la que , ni siquiera Franco se hab√≠a atrevido, est√° ahora directamente involucrada en el Escudo antimisiles que Washington est√° desplegando en varios pa√≠ses europeos. Este dispositivo, al mermar la eficacia de un contragolpe ruso a un eventual ataque preventivo de la OTAN, no es una medida defensiva, como se vende ala opini√≥n p√∫blica, sino agresiva y ofensiva, ya que reduce el coste en represalias de cualquier ataque que la OTAN est√© tentada de emprender contra Rusia,y lo hace m√°s probable. dentro de planes estrat√©gicos del Pent√°gono para desmembrar la Federaci√≥n Rusa y saquear sus inmensos recursos energ√©ticos y naturales, dando un respiro al crecimiento despilfarrador y destructivo, as√≠ como dinamizar la econom√≠a estancada y languideciente mediante un revival del keynesianismo militar.

Esto nos pone en el punto de mira del poder√≠o militar ruso, y justifica medidas que ponen en peligro nuestra seguridad.El gobierno Rajoy traiciona los intereses b√°sicos de seguridad de los espa√±oles, involucr√°ndonos en est√∫pidos riesgos de guerra que no nos concierne en absoluto, sacrific√°ndonos sin escr√∫pulo alguno a intereses extranjeros.Y todo para conseguir una ronda de calumnias contra nosotros, que les sirva para retener enga√±ado a su electorado, y as√≠ prolongar el saqueo de Espa√±a otra legislatura m√°s, a terminar de arrasar las pensiones con un agujero de m√°s de sesenta mil millones de euros.

Y en cuanto las calumnias que sufrimos de la oposici√≥n venezolana, esas las paga el PP con futuras promesas de negocio a cargo de nuestros presupuestos p√∫blicos, adem√°s de chanchullos ya en marcha , como el saqueo de Nova Caixa, Galiza por la familia Capriles, merced a las cl√°usulas de indemnizaci√≥n de p√©rdidas en el contrato de venta,del banco, por importe de varios cientos de millones de euros que pagaremos entre todos.Por un lado o por otro, saqueando nuestra fiscalidad en beneficio de compinches de negocios turbios, o sacrificando nuestra soberan√≠a militar y nuestra seguridad en aras de intereses de potencias extranjeras, el Gobierno del PP es una banda de g√°ngsters y traidores que tendr√°n que enfrentarse al juicio de la Justicia, de los espa√±oles y de la historia.Que el deshonor y la ignominia abochorne a sus familias y descendientes durante generaciones.Salud.",0,podemos,1,1468733642,t5_31h78,False,,,0,False,d3riukw

Regarding hit-and-run tactics, I don't know where you're getting the notion that Napoleonic armies were some immobile lump. Napoleon didn't win his battles by just sitting in a line and seeing who ran out of ammo first, battlefield maneuvers were crucial to his victory, and some tactics hadn't changed all that much from the ancient era. Cavalry also formed a significant portion of armies and French cavalry was arguably the best in Europe, the Mongols aren't going to be running around with impunity.

But the UK didn't really have any stakes in the Balkans, and has been busy dealing with the Irish question (Liberals wanted to give all of Ireland home rule, which led to a buildup of nationalist and unionist militias in Ireland), so any plans for waging a war lacked popular support. The British were among the few players who seriously tried to prevent a war from breaking out, even while the other major powers started to mobilize.

But Britain was hardly unified in disinterest in war. Parliament was split, with no clear majority of any party, and there were politicians pushing for it the whole time. They saw strategic interest in a war against Germany: If France and Russia lost, there would be a dominant power in continental Europe, which already *was* the biggest rivaling naval power at that point.

1464775445,4,Akaeir,t1_d3qlsr2,,t3_4lt5nh,"This is the first time in my memory as well that's there's been so much violence, I think you would have to go back to the 60s or 70s to find turmoil akin to what's happening now. The country and the global system are both at or, frankly, past breaking points (in my opinion the whole apparatus really kept collapsing, just less obviously and dramatically, after 2008; it's a well known secret that the so-called ""recovery"" is based on fairy magic invented bullshit (oh, unemployment is SO LOW because we stop counting people after they've been unemployed for x relatively small amount of time, hurrah!) only really benefited the 5% and up, and that's being generous, everyone else got pushed further towards serfdom and into the [""Unnecessariat""](https://morecrows.wordpress.com/2016/05/10/unnecessariat/) ). Also,  I *really* don't think that most Democratic citizens think the country is walking towards rainbows, even that poll has 64% of dems as being dissatisfied or angry. 

I could really write you a book on the topic, but I think it suffices to say the current state of the US is quite dire and one of the reasons is that, I believe anyway, the elections are basically now more of a spectacle than a real contest. Yes, yes, socially the dems are different from the repugs but economically but in the end it's basically the same deal and what the fight represents is just the same old story of the world, two factions of the elites clashing, both of whom certainly do not have the mass of people's best interests at heart. 

Here's my prediction for how thing's'll go with the election reality TV show they've got going on in the US: things are going to get really fucking crazy for the next few months. Every progressive is going to POUR all of their energy into the sheepdog bullshit figure of Sanders, leaving no time for actual activism that might bring a real change. All the nutso rightwingers are going to froth and become more rabid surrounding the literally fascist figure of Trump. Clashes will happen with increasing frequency. Hillary will win and both sides will be pacified for a few years, having spent all their energy getting frothed into a lather surrounding the hollow spectacle that is the election cycle. 

I could be wrong of course, but this is what I see coming. The WORST case, in my opinion, would be if Sanders won. That motherfucker is 1. an *establishment figure* (good lord, how stupid people are to think he's anything else) and 2.  even if he *weren't* an establishment figure he would be absolutely incapable of bringing real change about due to the *degraded and fucked up structure of the now inextricably intertwined political, governmental and corporate apparatuses are*. This is the scariest possibility because it's been shown over and over and over again in history that once a seemingly far-left political figure or major change starts to almost kind happen and then doesn't, after the far left fails THAT'S when traditional, ugly totalitarianism steps in the fill the void. Like Italy wherein there was almost a socialist / communist revolution that fell flat on its fucking face because of x, y z and then BAM Mussolini. Or even what's been going on recently in Europe, for example in Greece where Syriza talked a really good game, then teamed up with the right, then basically totally fucked over the now enraged and increasingly disaffected right wing populace. 

There's no good outcome, frankly. Oh, and in some way a Trump presidency, although disastrous, would be slightly less scary than a Sanders one because at least it would pacify the crazy fucking right wing gun nut brigade for a while. When THAT shit starts to really slip the coop (something I think is inevitable within the current trajectory), it's going to get really ugly really fast and that might be another outcome of a Sanders presidency (or even a Hillary one, frankly). 

I've read a lot on this and over the years watched even relatively conservative figures basically yell themselves hoarse trying to warn people about the corporate coup in slow motion that's taken place, without basically any of the deeply indoctrinated and propagandized general public seemingly able to break free of said indoctrination to even figure out what's been happening for decades now let alone take the necessary action to correct the problem. What we're seeing now are the inevitable effects of late stage capitalism and unless things are turned around, it's only going to get much, much, much, MUCH worse. 

Bill Moyers is one fairly towering figure in particular who went so far off the rails, PBS cancelled his show Moyers &amp; Company for becoming too radical. For example, [this episode wherein he interviews former conservative Mike Lofgren about what Lofgren's termed the ""deep state""](http://billmoyers.com/episode/the-deep-state-hiding-in-plain-sight/) is pretty revealing. I personally think that every Western citizen should watch that whole damn series because dude just really lays it out there and a lot of people can hear it much better from him than they can from actual radicals, who have been warning about the [inverted totalitarianism of the corporate state for many, many, many years](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/sheldon_wolin_and_inverted_totalitarianism_20151101). 

But yeah, ha, it's nearly impossible to convey these ideas because they're fairly complex and we live in a pretty Orwellian time where men are women and we've all been conditioned to TL;DR too many complicated words are doubleplus ungood, comrade.

I have seen academics and professionals say that leaving will end up with our economy tanking, our job market suffering. I've read papers that say that immigration is a (much needed) net benefit to the country, and foreign newspaper articles discussing their issues as qualified people flock to the UK.

I live with an NHS recruiter (foreign EU citizen) who works in an office in London where the majority of employees are EU and the majority of applicants are EU. My mother worked in the NHS as part of the clinical library services used by doctors and frequently commented on the foreign (especially EU) doctors and how many there were. Articles suggest a quarter of our doctors are from the EU. I'm yet to see anyone explain how this would be replaced. 

I've read the immigrants tend to be more likely to have qualifications (64% of immigrants vs 26% of British population) and the billions that this saves us as a country. 

I've read about how immigration causes the average wage to rise if you're earning more than the average wage (ie. Pay Gap increases) and as a qualified worker currently picking up further qualifications that will allow me the mobility to work anywhere in the world... This is great!

As a musician, I tour the world. I've just been asked if I could do a week in Germany in September. A weekend in Scandinavia in August. A week in Italy in October. I am paid ludicrously well to do these weeks away. Removing right to travel would make it harder for me to work in these markets. 

I am unsure that any argument based around democracy holds weight. The majority of EU legislation is fairly reasonable and on issues that we've brought to them (for instance, the tampon tax) we've been able to have a great effect: the EU is now changing how VAT works. We can work with the EU, and whilst not all of our politicians are electing to do so, I'm optimistic that in the future it will be possible. 

**So, in short. There are three major arguments for brexit. Immigration, economy and democracy. All three seem to lack evidence or support from academics and statistics to be suitable for backing ""leave"".**",0,unitedkingdom,1,1468734052,t5_2qhqb,False,eu,,0,False,d3rjpvy

We don't wave flags, we generally don't know all the words to our own national anthem and are fully prepared to admit the faults in our own country. Blind patriotism isn't seen as a virtue here, because we've seen the horrors it can lead to.

On the other hand, the US's isolation from the rest of the world has allowed it to keep that ridiculous patriotism without suffering any real consequences. No one was ever able to invade the US and they were able to hide away from the world wars for years and then jump in at the end and save the day. Even the clusterfucks of Vietnam and the Iraq Wars haven't dampened their nonsense because, while they might not have really won them, no loss would have entailed being invaded. For the most parts, everyone at home was safe and the US itself was never a war zone.

There's nothing wrong with liking where you live, I do, but to be proud of it? To talk about ""we"" and ""us"" like you had a part in your country's entire history? To a European it's just a little bit unsavoury

If you're not thoroughly organized going into a large city you may be overwhelmed initially. I know for a fact traveling through a giant country like Germany or a place as concentrated as Italy I wouldn't have been able to see everything I would have liked by myself. Paying a bit extra to have transportation, accommodations and food (although not much) taken care of may be worth it. I found traveling France, Sweden, Netherlands, the UK and Belgium extremely easy on my own. I knew where and when I wanted to go to locations, mostly everyone outside of France spoke English extremely well and I never felt myself flustered by having to know another language. I know enough French to get by in France and had my neighbor (whose French) comprise a list of places to visit and people to call if I needed it. I ended up visiting some castles, visiting Paris, traveled along the coast and also went to Disneyland, because why not. 

So my 4-month trip was maybe 1/3rd group travel followed by the remaining 2/3rd consisting of solo traveling and meeting up with people (I actively played Xbox, halo especially, and made oversea friends). I enjoyed both aspects thoroughly. It's truly depends on what you're trying to seek out of the trip, how much money you have, how long you're staying, what your goals are, etc. Some are accomplishable on your own, others are very difficult to say the least.

All in all, the fact you can wake up and say ""I want to go to another city/country"" is an amazing feeling. I never had a difficult time finding hotels/hostels for the night and typically stayed in rather cheap locations outside of the nights I arrived and the nights before I departed from Europe.

It is not impossible to find a hostel for $15. In fact, I stayed at one in Osaka and Tokyo for that, maybe a bit more for Tokyo. Otherwise, couchsurfing is a good idea, not only to save money, but to make friends with locals as well.

For food, the combinis are your friend. I would buy my breakfast and lunch there a lot, making it as cheap as buying meals from a supermarket in Europe. Also sushi train restaurants are very affordable (I think $1.50 a plate if I remember correctly). 

Otherwise you can walk a lot (just walking around Osaka and Tokyo at night was awesome), go to free temples and attractions, watch Japanese TV, buy cheap whisky from the combinis (it's dangerously cheap), and hang out with other travellers and locals.

**TL;DR: If we leave most likely nothing will happen, if we stay most likely things will get worse (politically).**

The only reason that I think Brexit is even feasible is because we still have Pound Sterling currency. If we had the Euro we'd need to make our own currency, which is a death knell for any referendum (as the Scottish separatists can attest). But the fact we have an independent currency used by an independent central bank means we can be fairly sure there won't be total economic collapse.

In fact amongst all the economic hysteria of both sides, Remain especially playing up fears of economic uncertainty, the pieces I've read from economists with no vested agenda (such as the IMF) is that nothing much will really change. Britain is far too big a market to kick out of the EEA (which you can belong to without being an EU member, as Norway and Iceland have chosen), so concerns about major financial shifts are pretty minimal. It also means Dan still wouldn't pay import taxes on his legos. 

The more legitimate concern is legislative. If we were to leave the EU, we would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the CJEU or obliged to comply with the ECHR. It's up to personal opinion whether this would be a bad or good thing. The Conservative Party have been saying for some time they want to scrap the ECHR and create our own Bill of Human Rights, so presumably this would give them the opportunity. And the Supreme Court would be the final court for appeals - and very few cases make it past the Supreme Court up to the CJEU anyway. 

While I've no love for the Conservative Party, I would still rather this than the current EU situation. The clause of ever closer union, with no mention of electoral reform for the EU, means that to remain would be to grant ever increasing powers to an ever decreasingly accountable EU parliament. It wouldn't so much be US federalism with widespread national elections, so much as a USSR bureaucracy with little to no accountability for the majority of the legislature. If we leave this, our government will remain accountable and closely tied to the general UK public. 

I could go on about how centralisation only works on small scales, or the collapsing Schengen Zone under pressure from refugees, or the economic desparity between members causing tragedies like Greece, but I think I've made this wall of text plenty high already.

You know that Australia is stripping its own citizens of citizenships if they participate in military action against Australian soldiers? Yet Britain rewards such atrocious action welcoming such people into their country.

For what it's worth: Reddit is an English speaking site, and consequently is mostly used by people in Europe, the U.S. and Australia, where many people are of European descent. Celiac disease is prevalent in Northern European descended people (yes, I know it's not exclusive to that group). Given those two facts the information I gave was relevant to the discussion.

Your assertion that lactose intolerance is the norm for adults is true but misses the point in the discussion at hand.

*(Let's not forget historical Muslim powers are also guilty of imperialism, colonialism and shaping borders)*

Europe, America and Japan have negatively affected other regions as well, They too help shaped the borders of their colonies and conquered states. As provided in my example Vietnam, once under brutal occupation by France, Japan and the US. Now Vietnam has put the past behind them and moving on, looking towards the future, forming friendly and productive relations with their former colonial powers, as opposed to producing constant hatred and envy of the their old enemies.

In recent times Vietnam has been developing good relations with its former occupier the US, with most Vietnamese moving on, looking to the future and developing a favorable view of the US. An example perhaps to follow.

&gt;Aside form constant occupation of the region for its oil but I could be wrong since Europe and America did do the same things to other regions for a long time such as Africa or China and they got along (well sorta for the latter) just fine.

Somewhat fine, yes, as alluded in my post above. I don't deny Western intervention has had a detrimental affect in helping to ferment secular, democratic and tolerant societies in the middle east, due to the West's support of Islamists to counter communists and socialists during the cold war. 

Even without western intervention, due to Islamic scripture and the example of Muhammad and the Sahaba, their would likely be much hatred and contempt for non-Muslims who reject Islam (as can be seen from history) culminating in, discrimination, oppression and violence, towards non-Muslims and Muslims of differing sects/interpretations, viewed as 'Apostates/Blasphemers/Not true Muslims', by other Muslims. Wherever Muslims, (or atleast religious and conservative Muslims) accumulate in large numbers, the surrounding non-Muslim population seem to have a hard time living peacefully and cordially side by side...

&gt;*""Islam's borders are bloody and so are its innards. The fundamental problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism. It is Islam, a different civilisation whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power."" - Samuel P. Huntington.*

&gt;*""In Eurasia the great historic fault lines between civilizations are once more aflame. This is particularly true along the boundaries of the crescent-shaped Islamic bloc of nations, from the bulge of Africa to central Asia.

Another worrying thing is that the the 'chilling effect' of mass surveillance deters people from ever voicing critical thought in the first place.

https://theintercept.com/2016/04/28/new-study-shows-mass-surveillance-breeds-meekness-fear-and-self-censorship/

&gt; A NEWLY PUBLISHED study from Oxford‚Äôs Jon Penney provides empirical evidence for a key argument long made by privacy advocates: that the mere existence of a surveillance state breeds fear and conformity and stifles free expression. Reporting on the study, the Washington Post this morning described this phenomenon: ‚ÄúIf we think that authorities are watching our online actions, we might stop visiting certain websites or not say certain things just to avoid seeming suspicious.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The new study documents how, in the wake of the 2013 Snowden revelations (of which 87 percent of Americans were aware), there was ‚Äúa 20 percent decline in page views on Wikipedia articles related to terrorism, including those that mentioned ‚Äòal Qaeda,‚Äô ‚Äòcar bomb‚Äô or ‚ÄòTaliban.'‚Äù People were afraid to read articles about those topics because of fear that doing so would bring them under a cloud of suspicion. The dangers of that dynamic were expressed well by Penney: ‚ÄúIf people are spooked or deterred from learning about important policy matters like terrorism and national security, this is a real threat to proper democratic debate.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; As the Post explains, several other studies have also demonstrated how mass surveillance crushes free expression and free thought. A 2015 study examined Google search data and demonstrated that, post-Snowden, ‚Äúusers were less likely to search using search terms that they believed might get them in trouble with the U.S. government‚Äù and that these ‚Äúresults suggest that there is a chilling effect on search behavior from government surveillance on the internet.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; The fear that causes self-censorship is well beyond the realm of theory. Ample evidence demonstrates that it‚Äôs real ‚Äî and rational. A study from PEN America writers found that 1 in 6 writers had curbed their content out of fear of surveillance and showed that writers are ‚Äúnot only overwhelmingly worried about government surveillance, but are engaging in self-censorship as a result.‚Äù Scholars in Europe have been accused of being terrorist supporters by virtue of possessing research materials on extremist groups, while the British Library refuse to house any material on the Taliban for fear of being prosecuted for material support for terrorism.

Remember, slavery was legal, it predated the people of the time, and the government openly facilitated it. I dare you to find me one man who agrees that slavery was moral. Adolf Hitler was voted for by the majority of German voters, and every single horrific act of genocide and human suffering performed under the Third Reich was **legal**. Rape is still legal, or at least punished with some stern words and no action, in some parts of the world.

So I think we will agree that whatever is legal is not necessarily moral. In addition, something can be moral but not legal: in some countries in Europe, if I am attacked by a home intruder and kill him in self-defense, I may get sent to jail. Defending my life from a violent attack is obviously moral, but it is not legal. In many parts of the world, the act of spending one's life with the one he/she loves regardless of gender (homosexual relationships) is illegal, but I think you will agree it is not immoral.

Since moral acts can be illegal, and legal acts can be immoral, we have to conclude that legislation has nothing to do with morality. Almost all of these laws are approved by the majority, so the opinion of the 51% of the population has nothing to do with morality either. Consider the following thought experiment: tomorrow, after a passionate speech by Adolf Hitler Jr. on television, 51% of the population of the world decide that they want to exterminate the jews. They have a majority - but is genocide suddenly moral? They also decide to ban all ownership of Disney cartoons. Is watching the Lion King immoral because the majority banned it?

So morality is independent of both legislation and majority vote. It is logical to extend that to a more universal statement: *morality is independent of legislation, as well as the opinion of any number of people*. Rape is immoral no matter what the government and/or the majority says. 

Now then. If something is **a right**, then it *must* be moral. You can not have the right to rape, plunder and shoot infants. In other words, nobody can have the right to perform an immoral act. So we must agree that morality is a necessary condition for a right to exist.

Morality must also be universal. There can be no exception to the statement that 'rape is immoral', because otherwise, morality has no meaning. If an act is immoral in one situation, then it **must** be immoral in all situations regardless of personal feelings. We can't eyeball morality based on what feels right, because then we are not talking about a consistent system of ethics.

We have all of the information we need, so lets derive a conclusion from it.
1) Moral = Universal
2) Legal =/= Moral
2) Popular =/= Moral


Theft is the forceful removal of property from its rightful owner. If I show up to your house with a gun and demand a percentage of your income, then I can not be said to be acting morally, therefore, **theft is immoral**. If you disagree, please do give me your home address, I need a new car.

Taxation is an act of forceful removal of property (a percentage of money) from its rightful owner (the taxpayer). Since the definitions are the same, taxation falls under the wider umbrella of theft: although not all theft is taxation, all taxation is, indeed, theft. If all taxation is theft, then all taxation is immoral.

The government claims that it has a right to tax you, because it is legal. These are contradictory statements: if taxation is immoral, and legislation can not turn an immoral act into an immoral one, then taxation can not be a right. The government claims that it derives that right from the will of the majority, but as we saw earlier, the majority can not make an immoral act moral.

Therefore we can only conclude that the government has no actual right to tax anyone.",0,Anarcho_Capitalism,3,1468736416,t5_2qorf,False,11,,0,False,d3roqhf

I can't wait to see all their time, money and efforts to bring ""peace"" here come to absolutely nothing and for this latest venture to fail miserably.

It will be as good as the satisfaction I got when Kerry and Obama came to realize what I knew from day one - that no, they cannot in fact end this intractable conflict no matter how positive and determined they may be. Now they don't even bother with this issue because they've learned. Those fools got what they deserved, and now these EU politicians will be taught the same lesson when cold, hard reality smacks them in the face.

The point of no return has been crossed; the two state solution is dead, the peace process is over. Israel is the sole and only rightful possessor of Jerusalem and the ""right of return"" - far from being an ""inalienable right"" - is in fact a myth; a fantasy. But the Arabs need to cling to the ""right of return"" lie  - no matter how ridiculous the prospect of it is - while they hold up their old metal keys to homes within villages inside of a country that doesn't even exist anymore.

Among some issues, valid in my eyes, that are raised: language barrier and lack of communication towards players not willing to join the chat. Granted, language barrier is mostly an issue in Europe and on Garena' servers (inability to speak English at a decent level, or to understand what's said despite the talker's accent). The rest of Asia is also concerned, but they're playing on country servers, rather than regional servers.

Rykener testified under oath that his customers never knew he was actually a man. If true (and Ruth Mazo Karras, who is one of the most important scholars on medieval sexuality in general as well as prostitution more specifically, has seen little reason to doubt him), this suggests that PIV sex was one option among many that e.g. one could have with a prostitute, and Rykener &amp; clientele were engaged in others.

Many of them are economic migrants just looking for better opportunities. It also doesn't address why most of them are male, and how that will play a part on their segment about birthing rates.

&gt;* The worlds longest tunnel officially opened on Wednesday, with the trailblazing rail passage under the Swiss Alps aiming to ease transit through the heart of Europe.

&gt;* With political unity on the continent shaken by a massive influx of migrants and the looming threat of Britains European Union (EU) departure, Swiss President Johan Schneider-Amman said the tunnel would join the people and the economies of Europe.

&gt;* It should also make rail freight more efficient  partly by supporting heavier cargo, which should reduce the number of smoke-spewing lorries on the roads, in turn improving traffic and curbing pollution.

&gt;* The number of daily rail passengers is expected to increase from the current rate of 9,000 people to 15,000 by 2020, according to the Swiss federal railway service.

&gt;* It cuts through rock and throws the debris backwards while simultaneously placing the pre-formed segments of concrete that form the shape of the tunnel.

I've always loved [this somewhat contentious conversation](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/opinion/a-conversation-in-lieu-of-a-column.html?_r=0) between the New York Times former executive editor Bill Keller and Glenn Greenwald.

Also this [interview with Julian Assange](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-julian-assange-part-i/) where he touches on some of the problems with citizen/blogger journalism. Sorry for the big quote but it all feels relevant.

&gt; So, it was my view early on that the whole of the existing Fourth Estate was not big enough for the task of making sense of information that hadn‚Äôt previously been public. To take our most recent case as an example, all the journalists in the world would not be enough to make complete sense of the 400,000 documents we released about Iraq, and, of course, they have other things to write about as well. I always knew this would be the case. I was very confident about having enough source material. So what we wanted to do was to take all that volunteer labor that is spent on writing about things that are not terribly important, and redirect it to material that we released, material that has a real potential for change if people assess it, analyze it, contextualize it, and push it back into local communities. I tried very hard to make that happen, but it didn‚Äôt. I had looked at all these people writing Wikipedia articles, and all these people writing blogs about the issue du jour, whatever that was, especially in relation to war and peace. And I thought about the tremendous amount of effort that goes into that. When some of these bloggers are asked why they don‚Äôt do original stories, and why they don‚Äôt have opinion pieces and analysis of media output, they say, ‚ÄúWell, we don‚Äôt have original sources so we can‚Äôt write original material.‚Äù So, surely, rather than write a Wikipedia article on something that would have no political influence, the opportunity to write about a secret intelligence report revealed to the world at that very moment would surely be irresistible, or so I thought.
&gt; 
&gt; But I‚Äôll give you an example to explain what I found instead. I released a secret intelligence report from the US Army Intelligence on what happened in Fallujah in the first battle of Fallujah in 2004, and it looked like a very good document‚Äîsecret classification labels all over it, nice maps, color, a good, combined military and political description of what had happened, even Al Jazeera‚Äôs critical involvement. And there was analysis of what the US should have done, which was to conduct a political and psychological shaping operation before they went in. In the case of Fallujah, some US Military contractors had been grabbed and hung in the town, and the US response gradually became an invasion of the town. So, rather than being a carefully pre-planned operation, it had been a continual escalation. They hadn‚Äôt set up the necessary political and media factors to support the military objective. It was an extremely interesting document, and we sent it to 3,000 people. Nothing appeared for five days. Then, a small report by a friend of mine, Shaun Waterman at UPI, appeared as a newswire, and then another one by a guy, Davis Isenberg, who spends half his time at the Cato Institute, but published this for the Asia Times. But before the UPI report, there was nothing by any bloggers, by any Wikipedia-type people, by any leftist intellectuals, by any Arab intellectuals, nothing. What‚Äôs going on? Why didn‚Äôt anyone spend time on this extraordinary document? My conclusion is twofold. First, to be generous, these groups don‚Äôt know how to lead the intellectual debate. They‚Äôve been pacified into being reactive by the presence of the mainstream press. The front page of The New York Times says something and they react to that. Find what is newsworthy and tell the public that it is newsworthy. That‚Äôs the generous interpretation, but I think the main factor, however, for those who are not professional writers, and perhaps many who are, is simply that they use their writing to advertise their values as conforming to those of their paper. The aim of most non-professional writers is to take the cheapest possible content that permits them to demonstrate their value of conformity to the widest possible selection of the group that they wish to gain the favor of.
&gt; 
&gt; So if one were a European leftist, why wouldn‚Äôt going through that secret Fallujah document, assessing it, and writing about it properly advertise one‚Äôs own values to their group? Well, actually, it would. But the cost-reward ratio doesn‚Äôt work. The cost is that they would have to read and understand a thirty-page document, and then write about it in a way that would get this new information into their group and prove that it was important. But The New York Times and other mainstream press vehicles already do that, and they‚Äôve also created the market for a response. One only needs to read a single article in The New York Times and issue a riposte or agreement.

Use what ever (sticks, rocks, trash) and dribble around them, between them etc etc. Or find a wall that you can kick the ball against and control it etc etc.
And if you have a few friends close by, play little matches against each other. Make goals from what ever, we always used jackets or towels as posts, and make the pitches small. Play 2v2 or 3v3 or what ever etc etc etc. 

This is what everybody was doing when i grew up and we did that all day and all night. Even before and after soccer practice at the clubs, we went straight out again to play some more. 
We didnt have a pitch close to our houses with goals, we had a basketball court tho and we used that to shoot at the backboard or throw the ball against the backboard to work on your timing when you go for the header or try to head the ball in the basket or to control it on the chest and turn etc etc. Or we used a playground and used the swings as a goal or push the swings around and try to hit it with the ball etc. We used everything we could.

I think to answer your question it would depend on what type of future career path you are looking for.  Several schools in Europe have excellent LLM programs for international students.  (Personally would have loved to go to LSE's LLM program for Banking/Finance)  If you plan to work as an Ex-Pat overseas or at think-tank/advisory agencies (ie. the FED, World Bank, etc.) then having the international LLM experience could be your foothold into that door.  There are also several of the large law firms that have branch offices overseas and hire Ex-Pats who are knowledgeable about that regions legal system.
I noticed you are a LLB in New Zealand?  As for doors being opened and closed in your country, I really cannot help you there, as I am not familiar with the job market for attorneys in your country.  I would presume that adding the ""name value"" of any high ranking institution would further make you a more marketable prospect for any employer.
I personally made the leap to get my LLM (financial law) because of the job market.  Here in America the job market is not the greatest for lawyers.  I did it as an investment and as a way to make myself a niche in the market.  (specializing can be a risk) But, I have not regretted my decision and in fact I really enjoyed my time getting my LLM, since it was in a field I really enjoyed.  I hope this helps, I do understand there are similarities and differences between job placement, career paths, education, etc. between our two countries.

So if you say that you prefer the Synology OS, I trust you because clearly you have much more experience than me. I've looked at the RS815 and it seems really nice but on the expensive side. I think for my needs, as you mentioned mainly music and video streaming to various PCs, phones and tablets around the house (all windows/android btw), something cheaper would be nice. Also, you spoke about virtual machine, to be honest there is a possiblity that I'd run a virtual machine from the network but never on more than one PC at the time (basically if I'd like to test an OS and don't want to do it from my PC).

Regarding the part about RAID, I've doing some research on how it works (I'm quite the newbie), and I'd really like the chance to not lose all my pictures/songs/videos/films/shows. So having a drive fail and losing everything would be devastating (it happened once and so many pictures and songs were lost, really, for lack of a better word, sucked).

I want the possbility to expand which I surely will - new songs come out everyday, tv shows and films too, pictures are taken etc. That's why I mentioned a 4bay for easy expansion. Also, I expect that even if I have 4 bays, the device will work if only 2 HDDs are plugged in, right?

1464795290,3,seanr9ne,t1_d3rsutd,Nimble Navigator,t3_4m1bkv,"&gt;True - but Syria is the top donator of refugees and the primary cause of the refugee crisis. About the other donors, you go go on to say that it is wrong to ""paint them all as war-torn"". Umm... what? The countries that you named were Pakistan, Afghanistan and North Africa (by which I assume you mean Somalia and Eritrea). All of these countries are war torn. They have all recently experienced major civil wars that have destroyed both their population and economy.

The problem is they're always at *war*. When are most of these countries not fighting internally? It seems like many from different countries used the EU's acceptance of Syrians and the mass influx as an opportunity to get easier access.

&gt;Some of them are. But why do you think they need better work? Because their country isn't providing opportunity. And why not? Because of the civil wars. They are still in this sense refugees, and in any sense deserve our help.

Most of the civil wars have nothing to do with us, and they're seemingly perpetual civil wars in many of these countries. There are about as many poor and misfortunate people in Asia as Africa, why aren't we opening the opportunity flood gates for all of them too? There's technically room...

&gt;The male:female ratio is roughly 6:4, which is, in my opinion, nowhere near astronomical, and wouldn't change birth rates hugely. Anyway, the aspect of birth rates that the video shows is not how high they are at the moment, but how they will decrease over time, which should have no correlation with gender distribution.

Yes, they will decrease in time due to assimilation. Living in refugee camps, sanctuary cities, no-go zones, and muslim-only communities aren't steps toward assimilation. Male:Female ratio also helps in describing the sexual assault problems.

&gt;I'm not denying that such a thing that you make sound so apocalyptic exists, but a source would be much appreciated.

&gt;The places with better welfare systems are where they will be safer. The refugees aren't just fleeing from war because they might die (although this is the main reason), they're fleeing because the war has had disastrous effects on their country's infrastructure.

Pretty sure Greece and Turkey's infrastructure are still ahead of Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia. They don't need to travel to Germany to be considered safe. They want to because there is more wealth.

1464795314,2,the_phet,t1_d3rt193,,t3_4lufwf,"OK, now image that you are Ireland. Your waters are almost the same as the UK, and your fish is almost the same. As Ireland, your fishing is limited by a quota. The main reason why these quotas exist is because we are over fishing, so if the UK post EU decides to go berserk, they'd be basically destroying nature (probably the tories don't care, but probably you care). Not every country out there is respecting the environment, and that is why EU product is defended against outsiers who don't respect the limit of nature. The UK can respect it, but then nothing really changes pre or post EU.

Let's go back to Ireland. You are under some restrictive EU quotas, and suddenly the UK is out, no quotas, and they overfish while you underfish following the EU laws. Do you think that would be fair for them?

Examples of the UK bullying EU to get better quotas: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35109146

The quotas themselves: http://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/documentation/publications/poster_tac2015_en.pdf

You will see the UK has the best quotas in their own products. For example, cod, which is the most eaten fish.

You know what's as bad or worse than peeling back the layers of his ideals to find holes? Exactly the same thing happening today with things that are far from ideal even in vision - which is what's currently going on. Your story sounds like accepting shit is better if you know it's shit rather than aiming higher and being prepared for disappointment.

Support him. Make it work. Don't keep fishing for a perfect leader to answer all problems - they don't exist. Get behind someone you know is morally incorruptible, forthright, and *help him make it work*.

Corbyn is the biggest strength any party could have, he's trusted as a genuine person - which *almost no other politician is*. That's an incredible angle to work. If only the people around him could see it and get behind it.

Here's the problem with politicians wanting to ""elect an electable leader"" - all politicians think an electable leader has qualities the general population don't care for. ""electable"" leaders *aren't leaders people want to vote for*, they are at best *the least shit option* - which is why we have such a piss poor crop of self-absorbed arrogant cunts ruining our country at the moment - they ""were electable"" and because no alternatives were offered they managed to scrape enough votes off the floor to get in.

Safe and ""electable"" is not winning supporters for *any* party - it's creating massive apathy and a scenario where extremists are becoming credible. So much of Europe is heading this way because they're run in the same way by the same type of politicians in failed two-party systems that are barely distinguishable in their middle ground out-of-touchness.

Is it hate speech when people say they want to limit immigration/migrants?   That seems to be the big question at the moment really.   

While I'm not stating for or against that issue, there seems to be an overwhelming push to classify discussions of the issue as ""hate"" - which seems a complete misuse of what would be a normal discussion within a country - immigration and borders.

For example there was a Dutch politician being prosecuted for 'hate' I believe for saying he wanted to limit intake of Moroccans into Holland.  Agree or disagree on that issue, I object to a politician being charged for simply discussing it.  (and if that's what the EU brings, that is a fundamental problem)

Banning on 'hate' can - and is - being misused.

&gt;No worries guys, we have not forgotten about the rest of you! Of course Artists will also get their Art Contest during these Celebrations. This time, the Art Contest is one of the earlier contests, giving the Artists plenty of time to work on something beautiful!

&gt;Do you think you have what it takes? We think so too!

&gt;For this contest you'll have to create an artwork about your favorite EU-Exclusive Unit(s)! Seeing that these contests surround our beloved (and sometimes not so beloved) Brave Fontier RPG's second Anniversary, we thought it would be a great idea to look back at all the different Exclusives our server has been introduced to over the past two years. This art contest will also follow the same theme as the other events!

&gt;What do we want you to create?

&gt;This time, you are going to get a lot more freedom than with our last art contest. The only condition is that you have to include EU Exclusive content. This can be a background based on the island of NeoAvalon, it could be baby Lucana and baby Themis fighting over Gazolina's rabbit Plushy, or something like Alvitr trying to pick flowers, but not being able to because her claws are in the way! The choice is completely yours! However it is important that your entry is original and completely yours! That's because we're looking for creativity and fairness.

&gt;Rules:

&gt;Use anything you like to create your piece! Pen and paper, PhotoShop, even good ol' Paint! Let your ideas take care of the rest!
No plagiarism! Anyone stealing art will be immediately disqualified! 

&gt;If you use material that is not your own/Gumi's, you must add the sources you used in the post with the picture. 

&gt;You cannot use art that has been used in another contest

&gt;The contest is open for entries from today 21:00 to 21:00 24th of June, 2016!

&gt;Only 1 entry per Summoner allowed

&gt;You need to enter your Ingame Name &amp; Summoner ID in your post
Once you've made your entry you cannot edit that post or we'll see it as cheating! If you want to change your entry, you have to delete your original entry and submit a new one!

&gt;Be creative and think out of the box! ^^

&gt;How will the winners be chosen?

&gt;When the deadline has been reached, all players will be able to vote for their favorite drawing! Out of all the votes, the most popular 5 entries will receive a fantastic reward! When voting, pick your personal TOP 5 Entries, and make sure to leave your User ID so we can enter your name in the Lottery! Details about how to vote will be communicated later.

&gt;All voters for the Top 5 Community Picks will automatically be entered in a lottery! More information about this near the end of the contest!

&gt;Rewards:

&gt;1st place: 3 Zodiac Units of Choice, 3 Trident Keys, 3 Mystery Frogs, 
1 Free Summon Ticket - And THREE points on the Grand Leaderboard!

&gt;2nd place: 2 Zodiac Units of Choice, 5 Imp Artons, 2 Trident Keys, 2 Mystery Frog, 1 Free Summon Ticket - And TWO points on the Grand Leaderboard!

Military strategy as derived from Napoleonic techniques influenced leadership in both the north and the south, and played a large hand in informing both army organization, and battlefield theory (for artillery, infantry, and cavalry). George McClellan would eventually lead the Army of the Potomac during the ACW, but before the conflict had started, he had already written and published two influential military works (i.e., manuals) on bayonet tactics, as well as cavalry techniques. The former was directly influenced by French military theory that he had personally translated, and the latter was the result of his time in Europe during the Crimean War as an observer. Both of these works were influenced by European theory (one of them specifically French), and had a huge hand in informing military techniques during the ACW. 

Another highly influential author of military theory leading up to the ACW was Henry Halleck, who would also go on to command Union forces at the highest levels during the ACW. In the mid-1840s, Halleck was sent to Europe to absorb and learn new or evolving techniques, and he came back with lots to say. His 'Elements of Military Arts and Science' bore out a lot of Napoleonic influence, and informed many of the military commanders, north and south, on ""proper"" military techniques during the ACW.  

In sum, the prevailing military theory of the 1860s was heavily influenced by European theory of the 1830s, 40s, and 50s, which was itself a student of the Napoleonic school. Although Halleck and McClellan were both outed as poor field commanders during the war, they nevertheless had an unmistakable influence on the persecution of the war during its early years. This influence was directly tied to European military theory of the early to mid 19th century, which was the product of Napoleon's influence in many ways.

The european war was over at the start of barbarossa. 


&gt; Once they turned the Germans around at Stalingrad

Or 6 months earlier when the soviets swatted away the german forces from moscow. Or even months earlier when the germans couldn't take leningrad and decided to siege it instead. And no, it wasn't winter that beat the germans. It was the nearly 20+ million men advantage that the soviets had along with advantages in airplanes, tanks, every conceivable armaments along with home field advantage. 


&gt; The Allied invasion at D-Day only quickened the pace of Germany's defeat.

It didn't quicken anything. D-Day is one of the biggest jokes in military history. Go read about what D-Day was. It was a none-event that we turned into a gigantic farce just to push propaganda. 

Only a few thousand died during the landings ( and most of those were friendly fire or accidents ). 99.99% of the soldiers involved in the landing didn't even fire their weapons. 

""4,414 confirmed dead""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings

So it was slightly more deadly than 9/11.


Growing up, I used to think D-Day was the greatest military event in human history because of all the silly propaganda ( documentary, movies, history books, etc ) that focused on it. Then later on, I read about what the real war was about and it just exposed that history we learn is just propaganda. We are no better than anyone else. We lie, exaggerate, bullshit, etc to make ourselves look better and to diminish others. 

D-Day would have been an enjoyable vacation for the soviets/germans fighting in the eastern front. Sightseeing with hardly any fighting on a nice ferry ride across the english channel.

In other words, these types of visual depictions do not normally need to be classified as ""art"" in order to receive legal protections.

Where people (such as /u/redthrow1125) may get confused is that the law in most of these countries normally forbids the depictions of  children engaged in sex acts or other imagery involving children that is explicitly sexual or lascivious. However sometimes there are legal exemptions or legal defenses that apply specifically to media of an artistic/literary nature or scientific/educational nature..

But this is different to the legal protections afforded to depictions of casual/non-sexual nudity, which are much stronger protections and don't necessarily require that the visual media have artistic or educational qualities.

In other words, nude selfies of minors are not inherently illegal in most Western countries. They only become illegal if they are explicitly sexual in nature (e.g. depict masturbation, focus on the sexual regions of the body, etc.) and they do not otherwise qualify for special exemptions related to artistic/literary works or scientific/educational works.

It's also worth noting that the law in many Western countries often does not classify breasts as a sexual region and instead the law is primarily concerned with the anal-genital region. In other words, it's unlikely that an image containing only topless nudity of minors would be classified as illegal, regardless of the context/suggestiveness.",0,news,1,1468740067,t5_2qh3l,False,,,0,False,d3rwc24

They really wouldn't care.  When you are appointing scholars to a permanent position from which they pretty much can't be fired, the last thing that's on your mind is whether the admin office will have to file some papers.

mithy speaks incredibly fluent English so i'm not sure what the point of even mentioning this is

&gt;In the last split, Trick also was able to speak to Emperor in Korean, but now, without a fellow countrymen on this new G2 roster, will this factor affect Trick‚Äôs mentality?

Trick wanted to stay with perkz, not emperor so that's all that needs to be said about that.

&gt;Perkz showed in the finals versus Origen that even when his team was ahead, he would force aggressive plays, trying to carry when it wasn‚Äôt really needed. Will he be able to sideline his ‚Äúego‚Äù and allow Zven to carry when necessary

G2 won the split handedly with a worse ADC while perkz was playing this way so having the best EU ADC makes it even easier for G2 to accommodate perkz playing this way.

&gt;To add, the competition in Europe looks very stiff this split: Fnatic was able to regain their legendary support Yellowstar. This move bolsters the 5-time EU LCS Champions, bringing them together to once again rival the top teams.

ignore the fact that fnatic don't have reignover and huni anymore who went 17-1 in NA and yellowstars individual play in NA was shit

&gt;H2K also picked up Freeze as their new ADC, and although some may regard him as a slight downgrade in mechanics, the organization has stated that their team atmosphere has greatly improved following the Czech‚Äôs arrival.

H2k still has chokers in jankos/vander/ryu

&gt;Vitality made two roster changes, and people have already begun to write them off. However, any team with the ‚Äúmonster‚Äù Cabochard is not a team you can take lightly.

I believe the issue here is one of self-preservation. It's the belief that one's culture is worth preserving. My argument is not really about feeling superior because our tests say we are smarter as you suggest. It's about recognizing that values like freedom of speech, critical thinking and secularism are worth defending.

I don't disagree with you on this. I do, in fact, believe that Western civilisation is, in most aspects, superior to most other civilisations on the planet currently. The reason I have for this is the results that this civilisation has achieved.

&gt; I am not advocating getting rid of African people, that is absurd.

I didn't think you were really advocating that but it didn't kind of come across like that.

&gt; I am merely pointing out that the difference in birth rates implies that 'Westerners' are on the way to becoming an increasingly smaller minority. Consequently our values, which, let's be honest are a big part of why we have achieved so much in such a short period of time, are in danger of being rejected by the majority of the world population.

That isn't unlikely. Chinese, Indians and Muslims are the largest groups that will possibly take over. We can't do much about that except try to spread those values in a way they won't be rejected.

&gt; On the Flynn effect, I see that as a bit of a moot point because nobody is actually claiming that IQ is 100% biologically determined. 

The Flynn effect covers a number of factors, I fail to see how it's a moot point.

&gt; What is interesting about the Flynn effect to me is that in certain developed countries the effect seems to have reversed. In these countries the median IQ has actually been dropping

Also observed by those looking into this. The rate at which intelligence increases seems to be slowing down in most developed countries. But consider this: less developed ones are still going, as they develop they maintain a high rate, whereas the developed ones have rate that has tapered off, in some cases even gone into the negative and regressed on intelligence. I think this supports the idea that given the opportunity to develop, the nations that are now behind might catch up to within statistical insignificance.

&gt; (possibly as a result of immigration).

Perhaps but what country has enough immigrants in it, that are so stupid as to have a noticeable effect? A possibility is that we now have larger disparities in income and most Western societies have a larger proportion of malnourished kids. On the other hand, most societies also have far lower levels of severe childhood health problems so these might cancel out. Basically we don't know yet what the determining factors are.

&gt; I might be oversimplifying your stance, but it seems like you are suggesting that we are all more or less the same, 

No, I'm suggesting we should all be treated equally, given as much of the same opportunities as possible and only then can we be compared against one another fairly.

&gt; that it's simply a matter of education. While education is obviously very important, I hesitate to embrace the idea that education is the ultimate equalizer. 

Not just education. Overall mental stimulation, nutrition, public health and a whole bunch of other environmental factors which are very different between the developed nations and ""third-world"" nations. And my argument is we can't come to definitive conclusions without controlling for all other factors, which we haven't done yet.

&gt; I believe that genetic factors and their effects on cognition are very significant, and I am not just talking about IQ.

I disagree (this also applies to your last paragraphs). It's too short of a timescale for evolution to work in such differences. The USA has existed for less that 250, European colonisation of the Americas is a little over 500 years old. Russians have lived under no more totalitarian regimes than Europeans for most of their history. From the last Tsardom to the Soviet Union was the most recent period of Russians living under a much more repressive regime than Americans. 

Are you seriously arguing that there is not only compelling evidence for a ""critical-thinking gene"", a ""drive for entrepeneurship"" gene, a conformism gene (or sets of genes for these traits) and furthermore, counterparts of these? Are you also saying that these traits were selected for in both places in the span of a couple hundred years?

There is some evidence to suggest that behaviours like risk-aversion, independence and certain personality traits are, to some extent, hereditary. To the greatest extent of my research into this topic, I haven't seen anything to prove that human behavioural traits can be selected for in a population to the point where we can about over-representation of said tratis in said populations.

What we do know is that the traits you are talking about are societal characteristics (ie the belong in the environment category) and those are ""inherited"" through being brought up in one society or the other. To say that such traits are genetic, over-represented and selected for in a gene pool seems like a set of outlandish claims to me and, at this point, I will have to ask to cite your evidence and substantiate the claims that:

&gt; consider the case of Russians who have lived under totalitarian regimes for hundreds of years

What is your specific time-span? What makes the Russian totalitarian regimes of that time-span significantly worse, with respect to the traits you claim were selected against, than other regimes under which, genetically similar populations, lived, during the same time period.

&gt; So what you end up with is a gene pool 

What is your conclusive evidence that the following characteristics are even represented in the gene pool at all?

&gt; characteristics like risk-adversity, conformism, lack of critical thinking, lack of drive for entrepreneurship are way overrepresented

What is your evidence for over-representation of said characteristics in modern Russian society? What is the definition of over-represented here? More than the global average or some other kind of baseline?

&gt; Meanwhile in the U.S. you have the opposite where characteristics like risk-taking and appetite for entrepreneurship are overrepresented in the gene pool relative to other countries.

Similarly, what is the evidence that these characteristics have a) representation in the gene pool of a nation, b) an excessive level of representation in American society?

&gt; This is true because to get there, you had to have these characteristics in the first place.

What about the slaves or the indigent Europeans with nothing to lose? What about the original European religious groups that were essentially chased out of their countries and found themselves fleeing to the Americas?

Finally, what evidence do you have that, with human lifespans and fertility rates, natural or artificial selection processes would have had a significant effect on the distribution of traits in the gene pools of a nation and, does that evidence control for movement of people and cross-breeding throughout the time-span you are referring to?

&gt; Of course I'm grossly oversimplifying and there are a bunch of other factors that come into play, but I hope you get the gist of what I'm saying.

""Dear male refugees,


I am so sorry!


Almost a year ago I saw the hell from which you have fled. I was not directly in the heart of it, but I visited the people in the refugee camp in southern Kurdistan. I saw old grandmothers who had to take care of too many children without parents. I saw the eyes of these children. Some had not lost their light. But I also saw children whose gaze was empty and traumatising. I showed Arabic characters to around 20 Yazidi children in their maths class and still remember how a small girl started crying only because a chair fell.


I have had a taste of the hell from which you fled. I didn‚Äôt see what happened there and didn‚Äôt experience the challenging journey you had to make.


I am glad and happy that you managed to get here. That you were able to leave IS and its war behind and did not drown in the Mediterranean.


But I am afraid you are not safe here.


Burning asylum homes, daily attacks on refugees and a brown [tn: used in German as a synonym for Nazi] mob running through the streets. I have always fought against the fact that that‚Äôs how it is here.


I wanted an open, friendly Europe. One in which I‚Äôd be happy to live and where we would both be safe. Sorry.

You, you are not safe, because we live in a racist society. I, I am not safe because we live in a sexist society.


But what I am most sorry about is that the circumstances of the sexist and excessive actions that were done to me will only contribute to the increasing and ever more aggressive racism to which you are exposed.


I promise you I will scream. I will not allow it to go on happening. I will not look on and do nothing and let it happen when racists and concerned citizens say you are the problem.

This is done by turning the throttle speed knob down to the point where the engine has to get most of its fuel through the single idle outlet port controlled by the idle mixture screw and **not** from the three acceleration bypass ports immediately downstream of the throttle butterfly.

The engine gets the extra fuel it needs for acceleration from the bypass ports when the throttle is just cracked open and engine vacuum drops off.

If the bypass ports are prematurely uncovered by turning the idle speed knob up, the rider will grind gears when going from first to neutral and won't be able to find neutral, especially when the engine is hot.

When shifting on the fly, RPM isn't as important and I just fan the clutch, never completely disengaging it as I shift up or down.

But at idle RPM, like maneuvering in traffic, it's imperative to have the throttle as fully closed as possible so the large square dogs on the slides of the sliding gears are turning slowly as they engage with the slots on the side of the fixed gears.

Some older European motorcycles (like Greeves and Husqvarna and CZ and Bultaco and Ossa come to mind) could not be shifted without gear grinding unless the engine RPM was down to idle.",0,Fixxit,1,1468741001,t5_2sti8,False,,,0,False,d3ry62j

Just because they got annihilated in the subsequent war, and just because the US was more than happy to gobble up the territory they took doesn't mean Mexico was innocent, or that the US wasn't justified, certainly by 19th century standards.

Sure US actions in Cuba were imperialist. Sure, it was a de facto colony, and sure that was wrong. But Cuba had the highest standards of living in the Carribean during that period. Its nothing compared to Belgian colonization of the Congo for instance.

&gt;Stock-market returns are arguably the best barometer of economic performance

Who the hell is arguing this? Seriously, that's a complete crock of nonsense. It doesn't matter that much, from my perspective, because the economic case for Clinton is pretty straightforward:

* Reduced deficit, big time
* Stayed out of wars
* Reduced military spending
* Foreign policy kept ME stable and gas prices low
* Kept Europe stable
* Governed as a centrist

&gt;You also point the the Bush/Cheney administration as being an example of what will happen with Trump, but that's specifically what Trump voters were rallying against when they nominated him.

That's not the point as much as pointing out that the president matters and times can be very different depending who is at the helm. 

I really urge you to take seriously how much of a lightweight Trump is. When asked about policy, its clear that he knows about as much as Palin, which is nothing. He literally said he learns about foreign policy by ""watching the shows"" and then called out [John Bolton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Bolton) as someone that might guide our nation. That should terrify any reasonable person. Bolton is completely insane.

And you point out that Clinton might go back on proposals. I'm sure she will. But Trump literally makes it up as he goes along and contradicts himself on nearly every position he's staked out. He has even referred to his policy ideas as ""suggestions"" subject to change just because. That should scare the shit out of any reasonable person.

He says bizarre stuff like we should bomb sovereign Iraq's oil fields so ISIS might not use them for funding. And he would ""wipe ISIS out"".  You cannot wipe ISIS out without boots on the ground. Or he didn't mean it and we still have no clue. Neither are good signs of a steady leader.

Now with Hillary, we know who her people are likely to be. We know they are realists. We have a very clear idea what kind of foreign policy she will have. With Trump, everything he has said sounds completely insane.

Now maybe you haven't paid attention to anything but broad brushstrokes of the campaigns. I encourage you to do some homework. I have trouble thinking anyone reasonable can look at the two and not come away thinking that the best thing about Trump is that he might accidentally change his mind to something reasonable rather than the absolutely insane ideas he's presented so far.",0,politics,0,1468741846,t5_2cneq,False,,,0,False,d3rzyn5

Oh absolutely! 

I *do* think (opinion follows) there's been sensationalism on the part of the press *alongside* playing-down on the part of *other* press - - - right wing outlets and tabloids tending towards [coverage like this](https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1490836/cover-depicts-blonde-woman-groped.jpg?w=400), left wing outlets and rags tending to [choose these images](http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20151216&amp;t=2&amp;i=1102855443&amp;w=644&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=&amp;pl=&amp;sq=&amp;r=LYNXMPEBBF1FW), both with an editorial tilt.

That's why I wanted to clarify the scope of OP's question.

If it's strictly being asked ""Hey, have some of these refugees raped people?"", then, sadly, yes - though I don't think it necessarily colors *all* refugees that way.

You missed the point though. It goes deeper than that.
LGBT people fall under an umbrella of people that left wing people advocate the ""culture"" and ""rights"" of (whatever that means, also a controversial topic, that even LGBT criticize), and if we accept that  people with LEFT WING VALUES hold a large amount of power, then the argument is valid.

In Europe this is known as the 1968 schism, where many left wing values became government values (before that, the governments was quite conservative).

Let me put it another way: If right wingers held power over culture, then media would be advocating the rights of Christians and other conservative religious group, condemning LGBT people, condemning immigration, condemning any other type of family than the ""nuclear family"", condemning atheism, etc. (Basically how the West was before the 1960s and 1950s).

This might be true in some Southern regions of the USA, but at least in Europe, this isnt the case at all. We are constantly bombarded by left wing advocacy.

I cannot possibly see a mutiny in the Finnish armed forces from the move, let alone from officers.

Their military has trained with NATO partners, they have joined joint NATO led missions, and have participated in NATO exercises. The armed forces at the very least seem to have a very real working relationship with NATO, I doubt those officers have the same view of NATO for example, that they'd have of Russian forces, of which they constantly train to fight.

In anycase, a government invitation is obviously not a hostile military invasion, lets keep that in perspective. No one is saying NATO will unilaterally 'force' Finland to join (nor has that ever been the case before, something the Russian govt won't willingly grasp) or even more unthinkably, unilaterally stage bases in Finland, especially when NATO is dragging its heels in stationing in the rest of Eastern Europe that is part of NATO, which does indeed want NATO forces stationed. This isn't the USSR after all.

Anything that does happen with regards to Finnish participation in NATO will be at the request of the Finnish government.

It's nice that we both live in Canada as I feel some things are slightly different than in the US (although I may be wrong).

I didn't realize how minute the differences are between the **""advanced"" driver assistance** package and the standard assistance features. The extras seem a little unnecessary and I believe I'll take this out in order to save 2,000. 

It's actually really good that you brought up the **""extras""**, post-sale, you mentioned because it's important for me to factor some budget for those as well. I read up on Audi care and it seems like a nice way to spend $ 900 dollars. If I remember correctly, at 25k, 50k, and 75k, they do a full check/refresh of your car. 

I'd imagine they'd offer loads of extras, such as service warranties, undercoats, body-coats (as you mentioned),etc. Do you recall any specifics? If so, in your opinion are any worth considering?

There was one more ass-on which we didn't bring up, I believe it's names **""adaptive suspension""**. I left this one out as I felt the standard suspension would be great as is. 

The **HUD** I am going to get, although I want to confirm you can turn it off. I'm iffy if it will ever become an ""annoyance"" at night time especially. It is definitely pricey at $ 1000.

Thanks for the info on the **fuel consumption**; very useful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the dealer said that the A4 takes premium gasoline only. Any less quality can damage the engine. 

As far as the **colours**; I'm going up to my closest dealer on Friday to see more in person. They didn't have a ton of colors on the lot (Manhattan Grey, Ibis White, Scuba Blue, Metallic and standard black), but I'll do the best I can with what I'm working with. As of now, either of the whites are in the lead, with the black interior. 

One last question; regarding the **Google Maps on the virtual cockpit**. When I was at the dealer, I asked why the map isn't looking like the ""Google Maps"" I see on the ads. They said it may be Europe only. From what you're saying, it works in correlation with your smart phone. Is this easy to set up? Is it automatic when you have your phone on you?

Also, in general, how are the **smart phone features**? Dealer mentioned the car has a built in WiFi hotspot, is this true? Also, any experience with the Apple CarPlay or Android Connect? Any other features you found unique or interesting?

Again, thanks for the great info. Extremely helpful.",0,Audi,1,1468742828,t5_2qr4d,1464806406,,,0,False,d3s21nw

However I think a bigger factor was the democratization or popular revolution in learning.  Prior to the renaissance (1350ish) reading, learning, arts and science were largely confined to monks, clerics and priests.  Even much of the nobility were functionally illiterate.  There were no schools for commoners, and the primary reason for reading was for religious study (and the Church didn't want common people to read the scriptures as it could lead to questions they didn't want to account for - see Protestant Reformation).

Literacy slowly increase in the through the 1200s so that by 1300, most Kings and Princes would be literate, at least in French and Latin. Literacy was needed for diplomacy and administration of a kingdom. It was the bourgeoisie, or merchant class however that really drove literacy as better record keeping allowed credit and greatly expanded commerce.   By the 1400s, the 'Renaissance' man became the ideal multi-talented aristocrat, diplomat, soldier, artist, writer, inventor, explorer, botanist, (alchemist) and composer.  Finally, with the invention of the printing press, knowledge exploded and this enabled the modern state.

Westeros seems to have a medieval learning culture.  While it seems many or most of the Lords are literate, unlike their renaissance counterparts, they seem to have little interest in science and technology.  Higher learning is confined to the Maesters and the Citadel.   Treatment of commerce seems to be very inconsistent.  Davos (who was illiterate) is described as a smuggler.  In a medieval sense, a smuggler is one who conducts commerce outside of what is controlled by the Lord.  Ser Jorah sold poachers into slavery.  A poacher was anyone who hunted the Lord's game without his permission. But Westeros seems to have an abundance of private shops that in medieval Europe only existed in the largest cities. There are no schools in Westeros, other than the Citadel.  Noble children learn to read and write from a maester but this is not available to commoners.  Commoners can learn trade craft, but only through guilds and apprenticeships. 

IMO - it's a lack of widespread education and literacy that prevents progress in the GoT universe.",0,gameofthrones,53,1468742869,t5_2rjz2,False,10,,0,False,d3s24rr

In the EU, it was IG-88B, one of 4 IG-88s that were entirely identical, labled A through D. IG-88A was sort of the leader, being the original model and the one to activate the others. He planned to overthrow the galaxy by installing a program into every droid he could to pull off a sort of Order 66 of droids on his command. He also arranged to have himself installed in the Death Star II secretly, gleefully correcting missed shots from the main superlaser against the Rebel fleet so that they were more effective. When the Death Star blew, IG-88A was destroyed.

IG-88B is the one we see aboard the Executor in Empire Strikes Back and acted as sort of the public appearance of IG-88 (the galaxy believed there was only one of him). Like Boba, IG-88B tracked Han to Cloud City but considered Boba's presence to be a threat. He tried to ambush Boba and got destroyed for his efforts shortly before Han's arrival. According to the EU, it is his wreckage we see in Cloud City's trash.

IG-88C and D worked together shortly after to try and avenge B's destruction. They attempted to intercept Boba during his lengthy return to Jabba to collect Han's bounty. Boba destroyed C when he turned Slave I's weapons on him and shortly after destroyed D in a 1v1 dogfight between Slave I and the IG-2000, the personal ship of the IG-88 droids.",0,StarWars,61,1468743010,t5_2qi4s,False,,,0,False,d3s2fie

Baseball, Football (US style), and Basketball got the nod and the push. Many returning from WWII looked down on the ""European sport."" So in the US, most played it through club systems. Eventually, more monied communities could pay in more and hire coaches that really knew the game rather than just fathers that learned it as they went along. By the time I played, it was far more impressive to make a Select team (high level club team) than a high school team, especially if you wanted the attention of college recruiters. Most high school programs are second rate and can't compete with the resources of the major clubs. Many HS programs (in my time) were coached by ex-players just out of HS and going to community college. The top level clubs on the other hand, had salaried coaches who really knew the sport. Prior to HS you only had clubs to participate in. And clubs could be cheap and local, coached by someone's Dad who knew you couldn't use your hands and had to kick the ball, to expensive with paid coaches and lots and lots of travel. It is no wonder our system is so skewed. I'm sure this will all change quite a bit in the next couple of decades with soccer gaining steam over here.

It's not a charity, they're developing talent for their teams... this is how it works all across the world.

The fact that the next Messi could walk into D.C. United's academy and they would ask his parents for a check rather than trying to develop him is ludicrous. 

I think part of the problem is with the college draft system, clubs get free talent coming in every single year so they have less incentive to invest in their academies.

1464807515,1,AmericanFartBully,t1_d3rxd89,,t3_4lvs96,"&gt;""*..Muslim countries at the forefront of the fight for women's rights.*""

Because the real *forefront's* not limited to some particular place or another in one time or the next.

Bill Clinton, as president, hired &amp; appointed an unprecedented # of women to various positions in his Cabinet (1st woman as Secretary of State) as well as judgeships and throughout his administration.  However, the US has never seen a woman elected as head of state.  Even though such a '*first*' is pretty old news in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, &amp; Turkey.

So, suffice it so say, the Islamic world has a feminist vanguard of its own just like anywhere else, just like it has battles of its own, just like anywhere else.

&gt;""*..people's beliefs and attitudes toward equality are dependent on the dominant religion of the area?*""

Nope.  Religion or *religiousness* could be -a- factor among many.  But never exclusively.  There's more to a culture than just religion; and, indeed, major world religions like Islam span many cultures and practically depend on adapting appropriately.

&gt;""*The United States and most of Europe have had secular governments for several centuries.*""

Mmhhmm...depends on what you mean.  Secularism, as a value, is certainly on the rise in the West.  But that doesn't really exclude something like religion from the values that inform its societies.

Likewise, the most powerful leadership in most Muslim countries is not even disposed toward what's actually religious authority.  Like, the head of Pakistan's army isn't a religious leader, right?  He's a military man by training, a general.  Just like Saudi Arabia's King...is a monarch.  And his authority is absolute, above and beyond any expressly religious authority.

&gt;""*The whole concept of human rights was invented by these western countries.*""

But not developed in some sort of social &amp; historical vacuum.  Stuff like the 10 Commandments or Code of Hammurabi is well-prior in terms the foundation of modern law.

&gt;""*elected an Islamist party*""
So, so what?  What's wrong with that?  Isn't that that their prerogative in a democracy?

&gt;""*What's the major difference between these countries?*""

Lots of things, lots of material factors.  Climate, history, neighbors, *ect*...

I'm going to post what somebody else posted on a 2017 Mazda 6 unofficial rumor thread just yesterday. I don't know how accurate this is so just take it with a grain of salt until everything is official.

Here are changes for the 2017 Model (at least here in Europe). This model can already be ordered and it will start delivering in October:

**‚Ä¢ Matrix Grey Metallic (46G) color
‚Ä¢ LED indicators in the exterior mirrors increased - The turn signal will now receive the same shape as the Mazda CX-5 and is thus visible from the front also.
‚Ä¢ G-Vectoring standard**


**‚Ä¢ Dynamic accelerator control for all diesel models
‚Ä¢ Better noise insulation - The decisive points as headliner, roof pillars and door area were meticulously improved for wind and road noise reduction in the interior. In all
Sports Line and Nakama Intense models a thicker glass is used in the front doors. In all diesels engines, engine modifications were made for the engine noise reduction.**


**‚Ä¢ Head-up display shows the traffic signs - The information in the display appear in finer resolution, optimized arrangement and multicolored. Simultaneously, the new traffic sign recognition shows the current status of the speed limit and important warning signs. (The Navi SD card needs to be inserted.) Two of the drivers individualized orientations of the display can be used in the two memory functions of the electric seat adjustment can be stored (Leather interior)**


**‚Ä¢ instrument display in TFT color
‚Ä¢ New steering wheel and steering wheel heating
‚Ä¢ SBS and SCBS update
The City Emergency Brake Assist (SCBS) now uses a high-resolution front camera and recognizes also pedestrians and two-wheelers. At the same time the scope of the SBS for the autonomous braking expanded.**


**‚Ä¢ Automatically folding exterior mirrors
This feature is standard on Exclusive Line.
‚Ä¢ Activation of the coming-/ Leaving Home function corrected
This light function can now be activated via the switch to ""Auto"" and therefore
more intuitive than before.**

**There are no cosmetic changes, apart from HUD being projected to the windshield (as seen on new CX-9)**

However, the accused nearly always have their lives ruined, and the more high-profile they are, the more severe and lasting the damage.  I agree that the justice system needs major reform, though, but when it comes to sex abuse cases, most of that reform I think should go towards protecting the accused, as is typical in many European countries.

That is what I'm talking about by the disease and the root problem. Let's start with Steinem, since you brought her up. She was backed by the CIA, presumably as a way to weaken the family, destabilize society, divide &amp; conquer, and make the masses easier to control (weak families allow the government to inculcate children much easier).

To me it's stupid to go after female enfranchisement. That is not the issue. The issue is the people using female enfranchisement, in some cases, as a vehicle by which to subvert nations.

I just don't think your model has much explanatory power when looking at history, and looking at Eastern European countries (e.g. Poland has had female enfranchisement since 1918).

Look at when the problems with subversive ideologies taking hold in America started emerging. Did it appear with the women's vote in 1920? I would argue no. It preexisted women's suffrage and continued to reappear intermittently afterwards. Bolshevism came to the USA with an immigrant wave that lasted mainly from 1880-1920. The First Red Scare was happening pretty much contemporaneously with the Nineteenth Amendment campaign and its ratification.

If we fast forward to later, the next big resurgence of radicalism in the 1960s was perhaps amplified by the womens' vote, but the womens' vote was not the root cause of it. 

If your model had any explanatory power, we would expect that as soon as a country ratifies womens' vote, they will start to descend progressively into degeneracy and radicalism. But that's not what we see. The radicalism appears to surge episodically, and largely independent of whether or not a country has female enfranchisement yet. And some countries that tend to preserve a strong national identity and traditionalism, like in Eastern Europe, do not appear to have these problems to the same extent, despite having female enfranchisement for nearly a century.",0,The_Donald,2,1468744101,t5_38unr,False,centi,,0,False,d3s4qvu

That isn't the relevant number. The relevant number is ""how many 'sickos' are there who:

1. are interested in harassing strangers to begin with,
2. are not invading opposite-sex spaces to begin with,
3. would be stopped by not allowing trans folk access,
4. are acting in ways that are a serious threat but disallow any legal action on the basis of e.g. harassment laws, and
5. aren't interested in the same sex.

This does not appear to be a large number, given that the jurisdictions that have allowed trans access have seen, at most, one or two cases among millions of people. In particular, it appears to be far, far less than the number of trans people (in the tens to hundreds of thousands) allowed access in those jurisdictions.

&gt; They don't even have to be physically raping people, but if a grown man, who clearly is a man, decides he just wants to start using the woman's locker room in his local gym regularly, what would anyone be able to do if we remove all boundaries?

I don't get why this is some ultimate nightmare scenario that is so horrifying that we need to deny civil rights to trans people because it might, hypothetically, be done by someone else.

I have loads of far east asian and black friends who have fit into the culture with no issues whatsoever. There are those who do, and they can fuck right back to where they came from.

Also, the Uk is doing better than any other country in the EU, besides maybe Germany (and by the looks of it, Uk will soon over take them due to rapefugees). There is no one country that is more influential than Britain in the EU today, once again barring Germany. We are a powerhouse. So I don't know what you mean when you say we are fucked. We are doing better than most other countries. Ofcourse we have problems, but they can all be traced back to white and non white immigration.

Most BRITISH Muslims, don't want Shariah law, and that would be clear to you if you lived here. I DON'T KNOW about Muslims living in Britain, that might be quite high. I don't like these people living in my country either. Also, all weed dealers I know are immigrants. NOT children of immigrants, but immigrants. 

I see all people who are immigrant and foreign Arabs, Whites, blacks, europeans, jews whatever, equally: as non-brits. And until my people can get back on their feet, they are unwelcome.

Ehtnicity might be the deciding factor in your country, and if you want that to apply to your country do so by all means, I don't care. But It's not the deciding factor in Britain. In Britain, it's the ground and it's you ancestory. If Your ancestors were British citizens, so are you.

Also, when you talk about ""they worked their lands"" you are referring to a bunch of people thousands of years ago. We have new Laws, new rules and a new standard now. The whites of today, DID NOT work the lands. They are not justified i throwing out who they want. THE BRITS ARE.

In our country, we have a difference between white and British. Not all europeans, whether they be French or German, or even Hungarian or Bularian are welcome to the UK. Not all brown or black people are welcome. The only ones welcome are British nationals, and that's why I consider myself a Nationalist. Our country is being stolen from us. By immigration, not only coloured immigration, but also european immigration.

So as I said before, you want your country to kick out all non-whites, go for it. In MY country, we kick out non-Brits.

All these other regions have very conservative cultures, regardless of religion. Culture is the greatest factor, and before you say it, yes, I know religion is a part of culture. But it is only a PART of it. The truth is, many factors shape a culture and these factors can even be at odds with each other (which helps explain why the middle east is so decided amongst itself).  

 

We cant ignore that imperial wars in the Middle East and N Africa (mostly waged by NATO and Russia) have given rise to drastically increased sectarian conflict, which pushes these people groups further toward 'fundamentalism' and barbarism. 



 
After generations of ravaging the ME and N Africa we ask how so many monsters could come from one region, and we point the finger at their religion, which will likely have SOME influence along with culture, but we ignore our nation's role in creating the hell scape that turns these people into monsters.
 

To top it all off, people saying Islam is incompatible with western society are ignoring the fact that millions of muslims are already an integral and functioning part of western society, and they are against Sharia. ",0,worldnews,1,1468745099,t5_2qh13,1464813637,,,0,False,d3s6pr5

Eu pelo menos acho que n√£o abortaria uma gravidez, mas n√£o acho que todo mundo tem que pensar como eu, nem o Estado tem o direito de se impor nesse caso.

Ela tem liga√ß√£o com as causas femininas, foi de autoria dela a altera√ß√£o da CLT que estendeu o direito √† licen√ßa-maternidade e ao sal√°rio-maternidade √† m√£e adotivas, por exemplo.
