1464739533,t3_4ly6g7,DiogenesKuon,2,t3_4ly6g7,"First a terminology clarification.  In hockey terms a 2 on 1 means there is 1 defensive player and also the goalie defending.  I think you are asking about a 2 on 0 (i.e. two players attacking with no defenders except a goalie).  A 2 on 1 is dangerous, but still not as bad as a penalty shot for the most part.

First off, on a 2-0 you don't have all the time in the world like you do on a penalty shot.  Defenders are coming full steam back down the ice to catch you, and even if they aren't that close, it's hard to know exactly how far they are behind you, so you are going to be rushed.  A penalty shot you get all the time you need, so there are some advantages to a penalty shot over a 2-0.  Of course the 2-0 can get a rebound, while the penalty shot can't, so there are advantages back the other way.

If the goal gets dislodges while a shot is on it's way to the net, then the officials can award a goal even if the goal becomes dislodged.  It actually takes some effort to dislodge the net unless you are moving rapidly, so if the attacker realize what the goalie is trying to do they can just shoot it in and even if the goalie gets the goal off in time he might have the goal awarded anyway.

I've never seen this happen in the NHL, although I do recall seeing a post on reddit about it happening in a european league.  I don't think there is a specific rule against this, but the refs could decide to give a penalty shot for dislodge the net, and an additional unsportsmanlike (the refs have latitude to call anything they wish unsportsmanlike, although I'm sure there would be a media frenzy both ways about it in this case).",,0,answers,2,t5_2qkeh,1468726239,,False,0,False,,d3r3frm

1464739752,t1_d3qnnax,ColonelSwede,-1,t3_4luadg,"&gt;He did pretty well in the Champions League. But, we're criticizing him based off last season.

No shit Sherlock. We're critizing him for last season because that's his only season. 

&gt;He should have done better, but Martial and Rashford really are amazing talents.

They're fucking kids who play versus adults and they manage just fine. But somehow Memphis can't because ""oh the league is so physical"". Give me a break. 

&gt;And what the fuck is that bullshit ""over 100 Eredivisie games"" bullshit??? At least do a little research to back up claims. It's honestly something people should be banned for on this subreddit. It's such a ridiculous claim. He has 90 games, where his first 28 games were mostly subs. In his second season in the first team, only 2 out of 20 games were games he started. His first season, all 8 of his games were as a sub. In the fucking Eredivisie were every kid is played.

So he had 90 instead of a 100, certainly big enough difference to be worth all this hilarous rage and calling for bans. Not to mention +20 European caps, and national team caps, including World Cup appearances for a team that won the 3rd place. 

&gt;His breakthrough season was his third season. 32 games, a good season for him. People were really unsure of him, though.

Correct, because he was a ball hog and wasteful in attack. Turns out that's still the case, except you can't get away with shit like this in EPL. 

&gt;Compare that to Martial. 20 year old, star of Manchester United. There's 12 people who scored more than him, though. 12. He got 11 goals, which is so far from the 20+ goals a season you want from a striker.

It's a good thing that Martial played mostly as a winger, then.

&gt;He went through a lot of physical changes.

Oh right, the poor thing, EPL is just too physical for him. Meanwhile, Rashford moved from playing 17 year olds to starting for the first team and he adapted within about 30 minutes, because that's how much time he had to prepare when Martial got injured.

&gt;he changed position compared to his PSV days

No, he didn't. He played most of his games on the left wing, same as for PSV. You shoulda probably ban yourself for not making any research.

&gt;Combine that with a lack of trust from the manager

Manager doesn't trust the player who's been consistently shit. Somebody call the police.

&gt;He didn't finish the season on a high note, but he was barely given the chance.

What are you even talking about. He has 45 apps and played well over 2000 minutes. 2000 minutes. Two thousand minutes. Poor guy never had a chance to do anything, certainly.

 To properly understand Machiavelli's philosophy, you must know some of his other works - namely his [Discourses on the first ten books of Levy,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourses_on_Livy) where he establishes his personal, morality based philosophy (as in the tradition of Aristotle and Cicero.) 

He was undeniably a republican. But...if a ruler were to act in the way prescribed by Cicero, he would quickly be taken advantage of, deposed, and possibly killed. One of Machiavelli's most famous quotes: 

&gt;“How we live is so different from how we ought to live that he who studies what ought to be done rather than what is done will learn the way to his downfall rather than to his preservation.” 

The reality is that a state functions largely (if not exclusively) because of the government's monopoly on force. The whole reason they have that monopoly is to establish peace, order, and the safety of their citizens; if a price doesn't make peace with that reality, he is failing as a ruler and will surely be deposed.

But don't think he was supporting cruelty for its own sake. Rather he believed that if you must be cruel in the course of keeping order, you should go about it in the kindest way possible - swiftly and cleanly.  ",,0,worldnews,6,t5_2qh13,1468726447,,1464740629,0,False,,d3r3vmo

&gt; Fat chance in hell China or India would care to weaken their industry for 'green'.

Actually, China sees a business opportunity. That's why they're implementing a carbon trading system in 2017 to reduce emissions across the board and are producing millions of solar panels.

The US has the opportunity to do the same, but it would require the government demanding that carbon emissions are reduced, such as with a carbon tax. Otherwise, no business will bother reducing their emissions. People will not prefer fuel-efficient vehicles, and will not install extra insulation in their homes, etc, etc.

The big part of the reason the western world surpasses other areas is because the west is the first region to achieve *self-sustaining growth.* There is an economist called Thomas Malthus who formulated the principle that populations grew when there was extra food and then they were limited by their inability to produce more food: ie starvation and population crashes. For the most part, Malthus' analysis is correct for the preceding centuries. Again and again we see empires go through cycles: the population grows and then crashes and empires rise and fall with these cycles. When the population grows and there is excess food, the empire is able to tax more individuals and harness produce more from the land. However, at some point the population becomes so high that land holdings shrink--you have to divide your land among your kids--and so your plots of land get smaller and smaller until its not enough to sustain you. When that happens, the population straves, taxes become harder to collect, riots happen, no one is happy. 

Now, turn to England. Across Europe in the 1500's onwards, peasants increasingly revolt, rebel, and gain more and more rights. In continental Europe, this often meant they got land, but in England the elites were a bit more organized so peasants were freed from the bonds of feudalism *but they were not given land, the land remained in the hands of the elite.* This had two key consequences. On the one hand, the elites were able to consolidate their land holdings into larger and larger holdings, allowing them to produce crops more efficiently and employ technologies, so agricultural productivity goes up. On the other hand, many of the former peasants move to the cities, feeding rudimentary factories and acting as an industrial basis. However, this is all happening during a bout of the Plague, so England is a high wage economy when this happens. Hence we have innovation in technologyin order to increase your bang for your buck (you pay a person 7 dollars an hour regardless, but with tech advances they're now making 20 shirts and hour as opposed to just 1). And from then we get the rest of the Western world following England. 

Here is the crucial thing: across the world there is a divide between peasant and lord, between worker and landlord. Peasants act in self interest. They just want to live and have enough to get by. In times of excess, population increases, and while there is still excess this is great for ruling elite because it means they get more taxes, but once population outstrips the land's capacity to support it (and remember, areas caught in these cycles are those that can't implement efficient tech as they could in England) you get revolts in the base.

No no, that's exactly what it said. It said that immigrants are convicted 5.5 times higher than the Swedes **and** that they commit 5.3 times higher likely to rape. Those two numbers specifically address the likelihood of being charged and the likelihood of committing the crime.  

&gt; t's also important to note that Sweden classifies rape differently in their statistics than other countries. 

That reform came in 2005, the statistics I'm pointing to are showing 2x increase in rapes from 2012.  

&gt; But if we want more statistics, note that Germany has received the most refugees yet has a lower rate of sexual assault and rape than Sweden does.  

Germany has received less refugees per capita than Sweden. As a matter of fact, Germany is 6th in Europe in terms of accepted refugees per capita.

Different cultures have different moral values, and the culture of Middle Eastern and North African people has values which are incompatible with those of Western Culture. If that's the case, then any countries accepting refugees should pay close attention to insure that they're properly integrating them. And certainly [mayors shouldn't be blaming women](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35243482) for not keeping enough distance between themselves and ""strange men,"" and certainly [police chiefs shouldn't tell women to stay home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuGiciGwF0Q) in order not to get raped.

&gt; At the same time, Europeans have outlawed harmless religious practices such as wearing head scarves simply out of spite of their religion.  

European countries have also outlawed harmless practices like wearing your motorcycle helmet or a balaclava in public places. Sure you might have just gotten off your motorcycle, or it may be really cold outside, but you can't sit in class with your helmet or your balaclava on. And not only Western European (i.e. non-Muslim) countries have banned it, until recently [Turkey had too](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131011-hijab-ban-turkey-islamic-headscarf-ataturk/) and [it's still banned in Bosnia](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/02/hijab-wearing-women-react-bosnia-court-ban-160202133259025.html). Even the Bosnias, who are Muslim, recognize the need to ban the hijab.  

&gt; Unfortunately there is not a lot of information about these rapes or who perpetrates them.   

If we don't have any information on who the perpetrators are, then how does your next statement even make sense?  

&gt; However, what about a compromise where only Muslim women are allowed refuge? Since men are by far the more guilty gender in sexual assault cases.  

Or how about we ensure that if a country takes in refugees, they're being properly integrated, the government doesn't hide their crimes, the victims aren't being blamed, and the criminals are deported the moment they do a violent crime?

I disagree. Sloukas is a good player with experience but he didn't have an impressive season. Started meh, got injured, returned well. His 3FG% was career-low this season and his stats are similiar to what Zisis had last season. *(I like them both)*

OTOH, Datome and Udoh *(maybe even Dixon)* were far more important signings. Both were selected All-Euroleague 2nd Team. Udoh led the team in scoring, broke all-time Euroleague record for blocks and formed the Europe's best big man duo with Vesely. Datome played really good and hit clutch shots all season with impressive %s. He was their best shooter and 2nd top scorer. 

&gt; Olympiacos, by comparison, went through a complete rebuild in 2011 and a 50% budget reduction, won the Euroleague the same year, repeated the next and reached the finals again after that. Maybe it's unfair to bring it up cause that was basically one of the top 5 miracles in the history of sports, but that's what ""not taking long to become a serious contender"" is.

You are right with the budget and I agree that it's how you spend the money but they still kept Spanoulis and Papanikolaou, brought Printezis back and they were like the 3 guys with the most minutes that season.

Fenerbahce also kept only Vesely and Bogdanovic from last year's rotation and built a team with a different style.

1464743693,t3_4luo45,flybrand,2,t3_4luo45,"[Question 1: How do pension funds get a deficit?]
There are two key concepts;

*  The value of the promise being made (this is the [NPV = Net Present Value](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp))
*  The time value of money ~ interest rate ~ rate of return ~ indication of risk being taken

If we promise u/smashhulk that if they (1) crush two cars for Reddit (2) today, we will (3) pay them $100 (4) in one year...

*  I've declared that in one year I will have $100
*  I make assumptions about how I will have that $100 in one year

This is in line with what a pension does.

*  Employees somewhere agree that as part of their compensation, they will receive value in the future
*  Example = State/Country/Company/Tata highway workers take a lower wage rate (say $15 / hour, when market rate is $20)
*  In exchange for lower current compensation, the state/country agrees to pay them some sum of money / service in the future 
*  The state/country/company/entity then creates a pension plan that will take care of this future obligation
*  If u/smashhulk is an employee of this pension, they will work on the roads for a period of time and for a set of rules, and then will receive some form of compensation in the future
*  Change out the original statement of u/smashhulk's job description, now they will; (1) work on road improvement for (2) ten years, then we will (3) pay them $100 / year for (4) 20 years [starting at the end of their employmnt] or until they pass away. 
*  We've now got a much more complicated financial instrument that spans 30 years, but still involves the two key concepts - How much did we promise?  What do we assume we need today in order to pay u/smashhulk at the date we've agreed to?

This is where things fall apart.  If we go to the basic 'smash two cars for Reddit' compensation scheme;

*  If I have $100 today, then I can put that in an account, and u/smashhulk has a 100% 'fully funded' pension plan
*  If I have $95 today, and the 'R' rate of return will provide me with $5, then the pension plan has a reasonable amount of risk exposure
*  Problems develop when the plan requires a very high 'R.'  What if Reddit can only put $66 in the account?  Will we realistically come up with $34 in one year? (This implies an 'R' of near 50% - practically impossible.)
*  Things can get worse from there.  What if we have no money today?  What if we have someone who *should* pay us $100 once those two cars are smashed?  What if they will only pay us $80?  $66?
*  What if Reddit doesn't have to pay u/smashhulk if they are not alive in one year?  If u/smashhulk lives a risky life style (fighting alongside his friend, a Norse God), and we would expect that there is a 10% chance of death in the year, then it would be reasonable for us to only project a future payment of $90...
*  If the future value of the pension is really only $90, then should we have $90 in the account today?  What if we only have $60?  What if we think we'll have $60 pretty soon?

Deficits are created when:

*  Companies create obligations to employees in the future, but those obligations are not fully funded
*  There are many rules around the calculation of 'R' 
*  This gets even more confusing when we introduce variable payments based on things like life expectancy, paying of medical claims (if health insurance is included), or any kind of adjustment to future values that track to GDP
* It also gets a bit goofy, in that companies have very clear rules in how they could defer these kinds of obligations if they were owed to a vendor (someone that provides concrete or steel beams for the roads, or provides transportation for the concrete and steel beams), but the rules can be very different if they are owed to the company's employees

[Question 2: How is this allowed to happen?]

Who pays for social security in the US?  Who pays for many of the pension plans in Europe?  Very few of these plans are 'fully funded.'  In our example, they depend on Reddit getting ~$90 in the future, then earning all the way up to $100.

'How is this allowed to happen?' depends highly on 'Where' and 'What type of entity?'  There are standard accounting practices in the US.  These can vary if it is a municipality or a company.  

Many states have laws about how their pension plan must be funded - many of them do not follow their own laws.  Many states will go so far as to 'borrow' from a pension plan to pay bills if they can't make ends meet (my home state of [Oklahoma](http://newsok.com/article/3545942) has a history of this and has a terrible record of funding pension plans).  This is the equivalent of saying, ""we had $100, but we're going to take funds out, thanks for smashing the cars, u/smashhulk.""  

Often times, as with social security, companies will try to change the rules.  ""We've decided that Reddit needs four cars smashed, and instead of paying in one year, we'll pay in five.""  (We've just pushed out u/smashhulk's retirement age.)

The industrial age and the invention of rifles drastically changed warfare. African nations that used modern combat equipment effectively fared far better than those who were without.

The Ashanti Kingdom is a notable example in west Africa that used guns to combat the British effectively. It took 4 wars for the British to finally conquer the Ashanti.

The Somalians under the Dervish state repelled the British for years until airplanes were invented. 

The Ethiopians were never colonized and were conquered by the Italians for 5 years after a pretty impressive war with minimal resources. Before that they defeated the Italians, during the battle of Adwa Ethiopian forces inflicted more casualties on the Italians than any other force did to another in the 19th century.

And African States aren't the only ones to be conquered by European forces ""easily"". The people from the Americas didn't fair any better, again lacking modern firepower.

Believe it or not, Americans often get quite a bit of scrutiny at the UK border, because a lot of Americans have friends there -- and, of course, speak English.

I think that if you do 90 days in England more than twice, you very well might get some push-back at the UK border, if not some lengthy questioning, perhaps even on the first visit.

A few questions you might be asked:

1.) So, where exactly are you coming from? Where did you stay? What were you doing there? Were you working?

2.) Ah, so you say you were working in Holland and France -- did you have a work visa? (Checks your passport for something more than Schengen stamps.) Ah, you didn't? 

(At this point, you are sending a strong message to the UK border officer that you may be planning to do exactly the same -- working in the UK -- for three months.) 

3.) So, where will you be living in the UK? What will you be doing for three months? Have you got enough money? The UK is an expensive place, you know. 

Personally, I would do three months in the UK, and then choose three months somewhere else outside of Schengen, like (awesome) Istanbul or Serbia (or another Balkan country), where you can have a luxury, big flat for the cost of a shitty room in a shared flat in England. 

Also, if you do end up overstaying  your Schengen 90 days, even by a few days, there's a chance you will get a stamp in your passport (if not fined and/or banned for 5 years), so don't do that, and recognize that if you do overstay in Schengen, the UK might not allow you to be admitted, because they think you might do the same there. 

I know you think I'm exaggerating about the UK, but they really are incredible dicks to everyone staying more than a few weeks. (Personal experience: Although I now have an EU passport, I studied in the UK on a student visa in a U.S. passport.) 

Moreover, €3,000/person for three months, won't be enough for the UK. Risky business!

Anyway, I think this is a great plan, but I do think you might fuck yourself if you do England more than once. (Also, generally speaking, Scottish border patrol officers are more generous, I've heard, than those in England, where there's a lot of xenophobia.)

1464746619,t3_4lysff,thebeefmachine,4,t3_4lysff,"I posted this in the other thread, but it seems the discussion is more relevant here, so I'll do a copy pasta.  

The two most contentious issues are DNT and co-ops. Here are my thoughts of how these could be handled. 

**DNT** 

Must be called BEFORE buying an arena ticket, and clearly labelled as such. For example, I did my first 'fun' run yesterday (because I was tired as f_ck and really couldn't concentrate to play competitively, but still wanted to entertain the stream), so I swapped over to EU and played a Hunter over Rogue.  

I didn't actually label it DNT as the leaderboard was gone, but the point is I labelled it a fun run before I purchased the ticket, and even went to a different region as I don't play any 'fun runs' on my main account.  

As /u/falcone83 mentions, somebody could just open up a hunter/druid/priest run, and declare it as DNT before drafting, knowing that it is likely to be below their average.  

Needs to be labelled DNT before purchasing the ticket. This is a clear rule and easy to follow. The system is ripe for abuse if any other implementation is allowed.  

The streamer could start drafting, notice it's going bad, and then be like ""oh hey guys, let's just try to draft a silly deck!"" to take the pressure off them.  

**Co-ops**

This one is really simple. The run is counted for whoever is actually playing the run (i.e. who's account it is on). For the same reason, coaching would not count for a streamer (as presumably, they are spectating the person they are coaching).  

If you start a run and then get someone in half way through, it is still YOUR run. If you are start a co-op half way through somebody else's run, it is still THEIR run.  

The whole Co-op thing is really straight forward, and as far as I'm aware, this was mostly done correctly by the previous guy. There is one example that was not included, but given he was tracking like 50 runs per day and this wasn't made particularly transparent by the streamers, I'm not convinced that this was anything more than human error.

.... it's not about their birth rates. If our government didn't import that many of them in the first place, there wouldn't be so many of them no matter how many kids they had once they were here. Check this out:  
http://www.nationalist-archive.com/data/usa-immigration-history-map.html  
1960-2014 = 7 million LEGAL Mexican immigrants. Almost 20% of all. It's all to do with our immigration policy, not their birth rates.

&gt; But you want America to remain American ... but you sure as shit wouldn't have a problems with Europeans coming over and joining the country, would you? 

This is like the third time I have to repeat: **I don't want mass immigration of any sort**. Even Europeans. We don't need immigration. None of the problems America has these days will be solved by immigration. We have more dogs than children these days. Will immigration solve that? NO. Then why bother?

&gt; And you're the one talking about white people as a group.

Well America as a ""new nation"" had the luxury of having to choose its race so to speak... ""American"" would have just become an ethnicity after a time which would have been European in its origins (main of Anglo-Saxon kind). That didn't happen, so now we have a bunch of mongrel Europeans who are just ""white"" rather than American.

&gt; I'm saying you're pining for and glorifying the days when racism was abundant, because at least there was less Mexicans around.

I can glorify any time period I want. This is so stupid. Victorian period in England was great. Go ahead, start pointing out how they were all probably ""racist"" back then too therefore it's all illegitimate somehow and that whole period therefore was shit, right? 1960s weren't great because of racism. It was great because of all the other things. If you think adding racism alone to America will make it great, then you're just stupid. I can't think of a single problem that would solve it. If all the past is defined by ""oppression"" to you then I feel sorry for you. 

&gt; the economy, the citizens, etc.

... I wasn't put here on earth to serve this ""economy"". What the fuck do I care. Economies come and go. Governments come and go. I'm pretty sure capitalism won't exist in a 100 years. I'm pretty sure communism won't either. It's all just debt notes from the central bank. It's literally meaningless in the long run. Europeans are older than money. We survived before such a thing as ""economy"" or ""government"" even existed. The only constant is blood.

&gt; Why would Europe going from 2% muslims to 5% muslim or whatever mean that you are dead? People practicing a religion or being non-white near you doesn't kill you.

No, I meant to say that if me and my descendant go extinct anyways, what do I care about this landmass and who's on it? I'm no longer part of it whether dead or alive. The whole project is dead.

&gt; ""us"" being white people?

I meant ""us"" as a general term. Humans don't live to merely serve the economy and to make its numbers pretty. Better?

&gt; Nobody is ""importing"" them, they're not a good or service. They're fleeing war zones that we've created.

I'm not even talking about refugees... although I hear plenty of people on the news saying how we ""need"" them to prop up our ""aging"" societies. So yeah, there is an inventive. Also, vast majority of foreigners in Europe aren't even refugees. All those Africans in France are there because of a relaxation in France's immigration policy. Same with Indians/Pakistanis in England. It's all due to the change in the immigration policy.


&gt; No, people can move where they like. It's kinda ... how the world works. An Australian can move to England if they want, an Italian can move to the US. 

No, that's just you. A tiny white minority on this planet. None of the people in Asia think that. Do you know what sovereignty means at all?

&gt; hel, the US would be NOTHING without immigration. 

I wouldn't consider all those who came before 1880 as ""immigrants"". They were settlers in the new world. There was no America back then. Only wilderness. There was nothing to ""immigrate"" to.

&gt; There is no reason everyone should hide in their nation states, refusing to ever talk to or interact with other minorities out of fear. This is literally nazi propaganda. ""Africa for the Africans"", etc. Except you're twisting it to suit nationalism.

I don't ""fear"" anyone... ironically, it's you who's been propagandized to such level. A nation-state is just a community on a larger scale. Do you have a problem with the concept of communities? A community can be exclusive too, otherwise what makes it a community in the first place? Don't say ""values"", because I just explained how ""values"" come and go every few generations. What exactly binds this history community - dead and present - for the past thousand years?  
Also, as far as Hitler, he never said such things either. You've been ""educated"" too much I think. Here:  
&gt; I promise you I am quite free of all racial hatred: It is, in any case, undesirable that one race should mix with other races. Except for a few gratuitous successes, which I am prepared to admit, systematic cross-breeding has never produced good results. Its desire to remain racially pure is a proof of the vitality and good health of a race. Pride in one's own race - and that does not imply contempt for other races - is also a normal and healthy sentiment. I have never regarded the Chinese or the Japanese as being inferior to ourselves. They belong to ancient civilizations, and I admit freely that their past history is superior to our own. They have the right to be proud of their past, just as we have the right to be proud of the civilization to which we belong. Indeed, I believe the more steadfast the Chinese and the Japanese remain in their pride of race, the easier I shall find it to get on with them.

1464748419,t1_d3qzb8r,LIPCSB__,9,t3_4lwh6p,"&gt; what should they have done. 

As difficult as it may be to swallow, of the three options the US had in August of 1945 (Operation Olympic, Operation Starvation, and the atomic bombings), the two options with a much larger estimated death count are more in-line with Catholic teaching. 

The atomic bombings are out because they are a direct attack on a civilian population center.  No matter how good the outcome, that's not permissible.  It's like convincing Hitler's mother to have an abortion--even if you know it will prevent the European theater of the second world war, it's an evil that the Church will not tolerate.  

Operation Olympic is not a direct attack on civilians (at least, the invasion as such isn't--the USAAF would almost certainly have firebombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Kokura in some hypothetical world without the atomic bomb).  The civilians who take up arms become combatants.  Killing them in battle is morally defensible.  Any civilian casualties caused by the Japanese government (and any executed POWs) are on their hands, not those of the Americans.  Likewise, any war crimes committed in China and Korea remain Japanese offenses.  The US would not be culpable, any more than all the people who didn't kill Hitler are culpable for the Holocaust.  

I am honestly not sure what the Just War teaching on naval blockades is.  If the Church would tolerate cutting off the Home Islands from maritime commerce, then 1/3 of the Japanese population could starve to death and their war-making industry grind to a halt.  By the end of 1945, the Red Army should see to the end of the Kwantung Army.  Many more Japanese die than in the bombings, but they are not directly killed--they simply starve to death.  I don't know if that would be acceptable under Just War theory.

Is that unreasonable? Is it wrong for the people of a country to want to protect and maintain their distinct culture?

That's what I'm asking you. I know my own answer, and of course it's not unreasonable. But how does one justify it? Yes, white people should protect and maintain their culture. Europeans must defend their values, otherwise they'll disintegrate or be destroyed. Those values are to me worth fighting for, and plenty of non-whites agree and willingly assimilate. But the sad truth is not all people value fraternity, liberty, and equality like we do. Whether they like it or not, assimilating to Western Civilization is accepting the preeminence of a social structure designed by and for a white culture that's evolved to seek out, of its own volition, the expansion its ideological territory to be inclusive of all people regardless of their ethnic origins. Plenty of people willingly assimilated to the Roman Empire as well... Whether they realized it or not they were legitimizing Roman cultural superiority.

I don't want to make this about race, but it is, at least in part, about race. It's definitely about culture as well and partly about religion.

There is also an assumption implicit in your argument, not one that I disagree with but that could be challenged on the grounds that Europe ""doesn't belong to white people.""

Of course it would have been a process of completing this reform and units that were equipped with older weapons and equipment and fighting in different formations would still have been very much evident even after the dawning of the Principate. However, the Caesarian Legions which conquered Gaul were - by and large - equipped with the square shield and gladius sword adopted after the conquest of Hispania and organized into cohorts, while representing the largest concentration of Roman military power in existence at the time. In short, the field armies deployed in the decisive theater at the time were armed and organized according to the newest and best technology of the day. Of course the entire force was not to receive 100% reforms until the state could afford the time and cost and found itself at peace: the Pax Romana, i.e. the Principate.

Your concept of modern meritocracy versus what we know of the ancient is, however, flawed. Even if the majority of centurions were members of the Equites - that is, knights - class, they were still not the aristocracy such as the Patricians. For comparison: the armies of the French Republic and the Armies of the American Republic are both paragons of meritocracy, and yet the overwhelming majority of junior officers are and were made up of persons from middle class (petit noblesse or petit bourgeoisie) origins. Whether that can be attributed to access to education, favoritism based on class, or an undefinable id that is unique to those who experience a background devoid of want is debated, what is not debated is that if even only 30 percent or less of the Roman force (roughly that of Napoleon's armies) contained common men who won their position of authority based on achievement and merit it would have been lightyears ahead of its contemporaries. 

You also mention ""dilettantes"" as another example of backward projection. This is a misunderstanding of what I meant: Any Roman Aristocratic man had a clear path of civic service marked out before them in their political career starting with minor ""elected"" office, followed by military service, followed by higher elected office culminating in the Senate, Priesthood, Consulship, Governorship or remaining or returning to military service. What I meant by the nepotism of the legates was not *your* projection of our contemporary notions of 16th to 19th century European aristocratic dilettantes placed in positions of immense authority with little skill, but that despite skill shown in the political arena or the military sphere, Roman men of real means had little choice but to move through the prescribed paths. So, while a clever politician and poor strategist may wind up in charge of a large body of armed men, also a skilled general could find himself out of his depth as consul, and the thought that this system could not be - or wasn't - abused is nonsensical.

Lastly, your continued reliance on a single source that holds contrarian views to the established history is suspect. Perhaps Goldsworthy's assumptions revolutionary, and herald a new understanding - equally plausibly they are revisionist (particularly if he rejects meritocracy based on the middle class staffing the centurion posts - as you state - without a comparative analysis of opposing forces' social structures and hierarchies, it smells a bit revisionist) and may well find rejection as biased by the academic community. Furthermore, my statement about the draftee army of the Vietnam Era versus the contemporary volunteer force was meant as a juxtaposition of two forces easily distinguished despite a short elapsed time period and a common culture. I admit again that I worded that poorly, and can understand why you interpreted it as a being based specifically on the difference in professionalism (although that's of course a factor, it is hardly the unique one), and wanted to be clear in my intent.",,0,AskHistorians,1,t5_2ssp3,1468728897,,1464997800,0,False,,d3r92ti

This is partly because discs are way more complicated systems with more engineering challenges, and partly because cheap brands like Tektro and Promax can make good rim brakes because they're so simple they're hard to get wrong. 

But with discs that's not the case and only Shimano and established US/European manufacturers like Avid, Hayes, Formula, Magura have a solid reputation with discs. 

So it's not just that the brakes are potentially worse, even if they're not the rest of the bike will have lower quality parts compared to a bike the same price with rim brakes. You typically need to increase your budget by about $150-200 to get the same kind of quality of parts on disc bikes.

The Dalai Lama was present during the cultural genocide of Tibet. His country, Tibet, was settled and taken over forcibly by the Chinese. Mao Zedong whispered into his ear ""Religion is poison"" before he started a campaign of wiping out their entire culture/religion.

Trump supporters want to keep refugees out for the following reasons (correct me if you feel these are in accurate):

1. Fear of potential terrorism
2. Having to support the unemployed through government programs like welfare
3. Having potential jobs taken
4. Inability of non-western Muslims to assimilate into western culture.
5. Permanent stay in their country.

The Dalai Lama *wants Europe to accept refugees into their countries for the sake of their safety and well-being*, and you can see that in the article. He doesn't want them to *stay permanently*. Trump supporters don't want them there in the first place and their reasons against them coming in in the first place are based on cultural/racial stereotypes (that granted, have at least some basis in reality) of non-western Muslims coming into the country and failing to assimilate and causing social conflict. Many liberals want them to return to their home country after they are safe and ready to return. He is against the permanent residence of Muslims in European countries because he feels that they may lead to the cultural genocide that happened to his people. He doesn't want Germany to become an Arab country the way Tibet became part of China. His reasons aren't based on cultural/racial stereotypes, but the very fact that different cultures exist.

Unlike NZ the UK has massive immigration from low skill low wage EU workers - legislation mandated by Brussels. There are currently 3.3 Million EU migrants in the UK - thats 3.6% out of an actual total of Non-UK born residents at 11.3%. Further there is a very sizable population that has gained residency through the historical murky legal stats of former colonies along with undocumented illegal immigration. This was such a problem that the Govt actually put an annual cap on legal migration (means tested) at '24,000' in 2010 [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom). Hardly a shining example of working immigration policy.. more cracking down on the small % of immigration they could actively control.

NZ has a rough foreign born population of 25% - biggest group being from the UK (c.7%). Modern immigration statistics present that around 60% of recent migrants came through means tested visas (high skilled) and 40% coming in under non means tested (partnership etc). annual total migration figures show that there is c.100K immigrants per year. Assuming 40% of these arrivals are unskilled - thats &gt;1% per year - WITHOUT taking into account for the amount of Kiwis leaving, which up until 2012 was actually resulting in a Net decline in immigration - i.e. more leaving than coming in.

TLDR: Not comparable/ NZ has way better policies

LS is also known as LastShadow. He previously had a background in starcraft (I think BroodWar) and also Poker. He started looking into LoL like late season 3 to early season 4. His previous  Esports experience wtih Starcraft meant that he was clearly very knowledgable within the subject. He very quickly began to understand the game and by part of the way through the summer split of EU LCS he had established himself as the head coach of SHC (Supa Hot Crew) who finished 3rd in the regular season. They were a decent roster, with players like Selfie, KaSing and Impaler. Unfortunately they messed up in playoffs and he stopped coaching them

Since LS is American he then went on to coach an NA team, called Brawl with ex-TSM chaox, Remilia and Selfie. That didnt work out so he then went onto coach gravity in NA LCS. Complications arose since he had lived in Korea for several years before that. After that he left the team and in Korea he streamed a lot. He is actually very good at the game, and consistantly reached high diamond - master tier on the KR server. He plays with LCK pros sometimes and he can speak/understand Korean very well. As for his game knowledge it is really really impressive. Like it is super good, he sometimes has problem explaining it in a way everyone can understand, but in terms of how he understands the game, he understands it to an LCK pro player level. His mechanics aren't really the best though, so he sits in high diamond and low masters usually, playing champs like Lulu and soraka.

As for Rapid, idk how much you know about him either but he is a rly good caster. Before SpoTV hired him he did stuff independently. He covers a huge variety of games. Even the obsure games nobody else wanted to cast, he would do. Such as the EU CS qualifier games in the EUNE region and other obscure leagues.

As someone who used to watch (and love) the OGN broadcast, I found myself equally as happy to watch this new broadcast as the old OGN one which is now on LCK 1. I suggest going on LCK 2 and watching it and seeing if you enjoy. It really is pretty good, definitely undeserving of the negative stigma people had of it.

Would you mind explaining what ""misunderstanding"" you're referring to here?

&gt;The enlightenment is essentially secular Christianity applied politically.

How can there be such a thing as secular christianity? Christianity is a religion, and is therefore inherently contrary to secular ideals.

More importantly, the Enlightenment was not a purely political movement, although most of the ideals of the Enlightenment are applicable to politics. The Enlightenment was fundamentally centered on rationalism, the idea that reason and evidence are ""the chief source and test of knowledge,"" which was contrary to traditional religious, and therefore political, views of the time.

&gt;Key to it is the doctrine of universal equality...

This may be true depending on if you mean equality in the way the US Declaration of Independence means it, or the way socialists mean it.

&gt;The western tradition is based on empiricism...

If you're not talking about the Enlightenment, I don't know what ""tradition"" you're talking about that values empiricism.

&gt;...republican warrior aristocracies...

Warmongering aristocracies are exactly what pushed the world into the dark ages, and kept it there for over a thousand years. The Enlightenment was actually the first step in the long process of pulling humanity out of the dark ages.

&gt;...and the suppression of free riding on the commons.

This is an economic principle, not inherent to Western society, nor exclusive to it. there is no reason to believe Arab thinkers (or anybody else, for that matter) would be any less interested in this problem than Western thinkers.

&gt;The Crusades were responses to repeated Muslim attacks on the European world.

This is false. The only major violence happening between christians and muslims prior to the first crusade were battles between the Turks and the Byzantines, and even these were not religiously motivated. Urban II actually called for the first crusade partly as a favor to the Byzantine emperor (to help him fight the Turks), and partly to unify the christian world in the hope that they would stop savagely murdering *eachother*.

&gt;Now as to your first question, considering how little Africa contributes to the world, whether in questions of science or aesthetics, wiping them out represents no big loss to us.

Africa contains over 1.1 billion people, and is the source of many of the natural resources used by the world, be it the developed or developing world. The whole continent put together has an annual GDP of approx. 2.4 trillion USD. African nations have many of the world's fastest growing economies. Sub-Saharan Africa alone (not even factoring in Northern Africa) is expected to reach an annual GDP of 29 trillion USD by 2050. If all of those people just died, all of that wealth would be gone from the world, and the whole world would be the lesser because of it. It is ridiculous to say that Africa contributes little to the world.

All of this is even ignoring the contributions made by persons of African descent living outside of Africa. If you're worried about the contribution of Africans to science, I refer you to these two lists:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_inventors_and_scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_inventors_and_scientists)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African-American_mathematicians)

Once again, it's ridiculous to say that Africa has contributed little to the world.

&gt;...as long as those groups are willing to cooperate I don't see why we can't co-exist.

What you're saying here is contradictory to your initial statement. What you have basically said here is that we should not harm them if they are not harming us. This is the same position I hold.

 ---  

&gt;The water buffalo or domestic Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is a large bovid originating in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China. Today, it is also found in Europe, Australia, and some American countries. The wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) native to Southeast Asia is considered a different species, but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.

 &gt;Two extant types of water buffalo are recognized based on morphological and behavioural criteria – the river buffalo of South Asia and further west to the Balkans, Egypt, and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east. The origins of the domestic water buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river type may have originated from India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago. Water buffalo were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia, in modern Iraq, 2500 BC by the Meluhhas. The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffalo.

I have erstwhilely refuted this formulation of left-AnCap counter-reactionary argumentation within a [previous essay](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/4gw464/a_hypotheticality_against_leftancap/).  

&gt;the 'immigrant rape-gangs' are free to move in unowned space, but they can expect lead if they try to cross the borders of my property without my consent.


[Again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/4gw464/a_hypotheticality_against_leftancap/). This ethico-poltical conceptualization is unbounded delusional madness.  

&gt;In Ancapistan with open borders, the rapes would have never happened. The city would have belonged to a COLA that could have vetted anyone living there by whatever standards it chooses, and private defense agencies would have enforced that and shot any raving 'rape gangs' before they crossed the fence.

**We do not presently dwell within an AnCap society**. I reiterate:   

&gt;Incontrovertibly, a closed border policy would have prevented Rotherham (and other such instances of mass-rape of Europeans by Muslims); by still supporting open borders, you are heinously insinuating that mass-rape of Europeans by Muslims and other related horrificalities are an acceptable cost for complying with your perverse dogma.

&gt;If you do not believe such mass-rape is an acceptable cost of open borders, then you must join us (The Dark Enlightenment) in our support of closed borders; if you continue your support of open borders, then you are okay with Europeans being raped, tortured, beaten, brutalized, robbed, sexually assaulted, peripherally plundered via welfare, and, I reiterate, raped as an acceptable cost of open borders and (correlatively) complying with its accompanying deontological perversities (which means you can be dismissed with nigh infinite condescension as expendable garbage).
You must choose closed borders or Rotherham; no alternative potentialities are even realistically conceptualizable; left-AnCap counter-reactionaries must conclusively answer The Rotherham Question if they are desirous of retaining any residual intellectual integrity.

#

&gt;Stop trying to reduce this into a binary question of 'closed borders or mass rape', because a third, effective, stateless option exists.

Your alleged ""effective and stateless"" option is not sufficiently politically achievable; if you left-AnCap counter-reactionaries had participated in those immigration-relational deliberations which caused Rotherham, then you would have chosen open borders and (correlatively) mass-rape.

1464754585,t1_d3rakv1,yourorborous,1,t3_4ke1z7,"No I haven't got to that point yet and I'm not sure I never will. And yes, if you bring people of a nation like Japan that's highly industrialized and put them in an environment like the Congo there will be a very hard and troublesome adjustment.

However, that doesn't mean they would never be able to assimilate. If it's absolutely necessary they would adapt over generations. Then again, as its been shown, if you take a baby from Japan and have it raised in the Congo amongst the natives there it would do just as well. There may be some question about the baby's looks haha but culturally speaking they would be just as competent as any other native Congo person. 

Your view on groups melding is a bit bleak, I feel. There's never been such a thing as a ""pure"" race. There's always been mixing and mingling of ethnic groups all across the board. Especially given the ""Out of Africa"" theory which is the best we have for human dispersal given our archaeological findings of Homo erectus. The problem is this idea you're perpetuating that has been around for centuries, and has, pretty recently, been shown to be too simplistic to understand humans behaviorally, culturally and genetically. 

The problem is with environmental determinism which has been shown time and time again to be too reductionistic to fully encompass the full nature of humans behaviorally. Races do not have innate characteristics and behaviors. There may be slight predispositions but the rest is determined through nurture/culture. If you even studied various cultures in Africa this should be abundantly clear. Things have become homogenized by a foreign, western understanding during colonization and imperialism but our understanding has advanced far beyond those simplistic and archaic views of races and groupings of people. 

Genetically speaking, you're more closely related to indigenous groups in Africa than you are with other people of European descent. That's simply fact. Given the time they were there, genetic recombination had more time to create variable allele frequencies and therefore there's more genetic diversity in Africa than anywhere else and all other groups who migrated out experienced a sort of ""bottle neck"" effect. That reduced the amount of allele variation and so there was less over all variation. One biologist wrote that comparing Europeans, Asians and Africans genetically would be like comparing Elephants, Hippos and Mammals generally, respectively. If that makes sense. 


In this way the difference you claim to be unsurmountable are simply superficial and are the result of culture clash than some biologically determined hostility. That's where our understanding diverge. That's where I think you should try conducting your own research, perhaps sociologically or anthropologically,  to see another perspective. 

To answer YOUR question though haha I don't think it's ""wrong"" to want to only live with white people, but I think it's simply limiting. I certainly, personally, don't want to live with only white people, and the problem comes when you ask yourself where would white Americans go? Kicking everyone out wouldn't work, especially with the African American population that have just as much right to be here as white people do. Unless they all went to Europe, but I don't think many white separatists want that necessarily. I think it's easier, and much better to learn to live peacefully as common people. We're already trying to move in that direction. 



I was really just trying to see your personal rationale, but I personally will never see it your way. I hope your research branches out to maybe see more of what I see, or that you're open to less environmentally deterministic and racialized ideologies and consider the other side. 

That's really the only way to grow and challenge oneself intellectually.  

Thanks though for being open, honest and for replying :) feel free to bring up any points you think refute mine of you wish.

Palestine was a colonialist mandate state created by the British in 1 week along with Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan etc. in 1 week in the same office in the same city of San Remo. Geroge R.R. Martins Game of Thrones Nations were thought about longer than Palestine was. Israel was established through kicking out the British by force and self-determination, giving it much more legitimacy than a colonial mandate state meant for the Jews in any case. Today, Palestinians demand a Palestinian state which is 100% ethnically pure of Jews, a demand unique of all the countries in the world. Funny how the only thing about Palestinian culture that is truly unique is their complete inability to live with Jews, they demand they must leave. /r/European likes to bitch about ""Israel gets to be Jewish only but we're racist when we want Europe to be European only?!?"", but they don't know that Israel is already 20% ARab, a FAR higher percentage than any European country that they complain are becoming ""Islamic Arab countries"". Anyway, I wouldn't support the creation of any state in the world if they had as a condition of that state the law that it must be Jew-free, and I certainly don't support a Jew-free state in the land of Israel which would split Jerusalem, one of the world's most ancient cities, in half to please a bunch of ""non-racist and tolerant"" anti-colonialist Leftists who are too stupid to realize that by supporting Palestine, they're supporting a colonialist state that wishes to be Jew-free. In stark contrast, Israel was not made up on a map, it was re-established through blood guns and steel, against all odds from an Arab army that openly declared their intent to ethnically cleanse the land of every last Jew. Sad that today the narrative has flipped, but the SJW's who support Palestine really are the true racists, they're against anyone who isn't a cuck for Arabs or Islam, which means that being a Jew-hater isn't too bad, it's for the greater good after all, which is the establishment of a 23rd Islamic state at the expense of the world's only Jewish state. Sad!

They are acknowledged by the EU. All you have is conspiracy theory bs. I wonder if you even know that the Swedish authorities have not kept rape statistics relating to race/ethnicity since 1995? Nah, you prolly don't know.

Hey, every 107 seconds someone in the US is sexually assaulted. Keep that in mind whilst you are reading this.

&gt; Police chief

Give me a link to an article. That is not the chief of all the Swedish police. I am 100% sure you are obfuscating what that video is about and when it took place. So give me a link to a Swedish article talking about that.

&gt;Here's some German stuff.

Was that done by Muslims? You have evidence? Also, are sexual assaults and rapes in Germany a new thing? You do know hwo many sexual assaults and rapes take place in Germany, and have been taking place, for a very long time, right?

&gt;I gave true numbers. If 57% disapprove and 13% approve, then there's a bit of a neutral gap and so that's 43% of polled who can't bring themselves to disagree with Al Qaeda.

What makes you think the 43% knows about Al Qaeda or what they have done? Heck, many people in Afghanistan had no idea what 9/11 even was. You are conflating the people who did not give an answer or wanted more detail with those who actually approve. There is a huge difference between 43% and 13%. And playing it off as nothing is tantamount to a lie. So you were lying.

&gt;So I should have said empathize. Then I'm correct. I used the wrong word and I'm sorry, you got me there. They emphasized with the bombers. I was wrong.

Except you tried to play off empathizing or understanding why someone would do something, namely the invasion of Iraq in this case and the mass murders and rape and torture that followed by Western Christians, as somehow approving of the bombing attacks. That is a blatant lie. The poll itself shows 99% explicitly saying the bombings were unacceptable.

&gt; Now, I don't trust some of your numbers because he said something was 35%, you said ""you're lying, it's 25%"" and I clicked the link and read 35% in the article. 

Where

&gt;Go back to the SRS echochamber.

I like triggering people in this alt-right echochamber.

Also, has it been 107 seconds yet? Yes? That means someone has been sexually assaulted in the US. I wonder why civilized, enlightened, white Western culture embraces so much sexual assault :( Why don't you do anything about it?",,0,KotakuInAction,0,t5_33726,1468731345,,False,0,False,,d3re4hr

1464758825,t3_4lzojg,live_free,6,t3_4lzojg,"&gt; Alongside classes in civic studies and national history, Polish schoolchildren have a new subject to fit into their timetables: Nato lessons.
&gt; 
&gt; For the next two months, the government plans to give Polish schools the option of teaching up to four hours a week of classes on the world’s most powerful military alliance — and the benefits that Poland derives from being a member of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahead of Nato’s biennial summit this July in Warsaw, the plans are the centrepiece of efforts by the Polish government to emphasise — to audiences at home and among both allies and adversaries — the importance with which the country regards Nato as a guarantor of its sovereignty and, increasingly, its most important international interlocutor.
&gt; 
&gt; ***Polish schools have been provided with “lesson plans” for students, covering topics such as the participation of Polish troops in Nato operations in Afghanistan or, more topically, the alliance’s decision-making process for setting up military bases on Polish soil.***
&gt; 
&gt; Establishing a permanent Nato troop presence in Poland is now almost certain to be agreed by Nato leaders at the Warsaw summit. But it remains a contentious measure that critics, including many within the alliance, say risks inciting Russia to further aggression.
&gt; 
&gt; Other, less aggressive topics are also on the curriculum for Polish students: designing posters for the alliance, for example. Or drawing maps of Nato operations.
&gt; 
&gt; Michal Korkosz, an 18-year-old high school pupil, said special classes on Nato risked “a kind of glorification of one organisation” but that students currently learnt more about the EU than about the military alliance.
&gt; 
&gt; “I feel safe knowing that Poland is [a] member of Nato because the EU does not have any army and is not united on the military field and Nato is,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Aleksandra Kusmierz, civic studies professor at a high school in Stalowa Wola, said pupils already learnt about Nato but that “every student in my school would have something to say about it”.
&gt; 
&gt; “It is a very good idea that experts from the ministry or from Nato come to schools,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; ***A spokesperson for Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs, confirming the plan’s details, said free books on Nato and its importance were also being distributed to every school and library in the country.***
&gt; 
&gt; But Poland’s cheerleading highlights an emerging paradox at the heart of the new ruling Law and Justice government’s relationship with its western allies.
&gt; 
&gt; It wants “more” Nato — but in many ways less EU, even though Moscow sees the organisations as two sides of the same coin.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent weeks, Warsaw’s new administration has criticised the EU for what it calls meddling in its internal affairs and bitterly rejected German-led EU attempts to make all member states accept a quota of Middle Eastern migrants. Brussels has also threatened sanctions against Law and Justice for attempts to neuter the country’s constitutional court and seize control of public television.
&gt; 
&gt; While many in Poland’s security establishment understand the need for solidarity within Nato, some also bemoan the degree to which it might be distracting from what they regard as a more urgent concern.
&gt; 
&gt; Witold Waszczykowski, the Polish foreign minister, told a security conference last month that Russia was a bigger danger than Isis.
&gt; 
&gt; The lack of Nato troops permanently stationed in Poland and the Baltic states was a “security gap”, said Mr Waszczykowski.
&gt; 
&gt; ***“For Poland, this [reinforcing the eastern flank] is an existential issue,” said one senior Polish security official. “Migration, even terrorism, is not.***
&gt; 
&gt; ***“Nato is fundamental to our independence and our sovereignty,” he added. The new Nato classes were a reflection of that, he added.***
&gt; 
&gt; ***“Maybe there are a few other Nato states who need the lessons more than Poland does.”***

1464758991,t3_4lzp4e,live_free,2,t3_4lzp4e,"&gt; Patriot missiles are needed in the Baltic states to deter a Russian invasion, Estonia’s defence chief has warned.
&gt; 
&gt; As Nato agonises over proposals to deploy four battalions in eastern Europe concerns are growing that the measure will not be enough to provide a credible deterrent to future Russian aggression. The deployment of a force of no more than 4,000 personnel would be the first permanent basing of alliance troops in the region since the fall of the Iron Curtain.
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview with the Financial Times, Lieutenant General Riho Terras, Estonia’s commander-in-chief, said an inadequate air defence capability made the Baltic region vulnerable to a Russian lightning attack. Nato needed to consider increasing the number of warplanes it has based in the region, and plan for the deployment of Patriot batteries.
&gt; 
&gt; “Of very great importance is our self-defence capability . . . what we need [for that] is air defence capability,” said Gen Terras. “We need to be ready and we need to look at what we need to do. Russia behaves opportunistically. If they have the opportunity, they’ll jump through the window to take it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Nato chiefs are set to finalise a package of measures aimed at boosting eastern European defences at the alliance’s biennial summit, to be held in Warsaw in July.
&gt; 
&gt; Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are widely seen as a prime target for Russian revanchism, should relations with Nato deteriorate further. The Baltic countries are linked to the rest of Nato territory by a narrow strip of land that runs between Belarus, one of Moscow’s staunchest allies, and Kaliningrad, the heavily militarised Russian coastal enclave.
&gt; 
&gt; “The Baltic states can be seen as an island,” said Gen Terras. “The gap is small . . . there’s one railway and two roads going through it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Basing new battalions there was a strong first step, said the general, but Nato also needed to develop its own anti-access aerial denial, or A2AD, strategy such as powerful surface-to-air missile systems — that the alliance has long feared Russia could use in the region.
&gt; 
&gt; Nato military chiefs say Russian missile systems in Kaliningrad have carved out an “A2AD bubble”, making it hard for the alliance to manouevre its forces anywhere in the area, even deep within its own territory.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, it would be too risky to deploy the Spearhead rapid response force, the 5,000-strong brigade established in 2014, in most of Poland or anywhere in the Baltic region in the event of a conflict with Russia, alliance generals believe.
&gt; 
&gt; The Baltic states cannot develop an A2AD capability on their own, said Gen Terras and need Nato to do so. “At the least, we need to be trained to get [Patriot missiles] here quickly . . . and to know where to position them, if not to have them based here [permanently] like it was the case in Turkey,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Any such development would draw an angry response from the Kremlin, which has already threatened “retaliatory measures” to the proposal to deploy four battalions. It would also up the ante in the stand-off between Russia and the US over missile defence. Patriot batteries are capable of intercepting tactical ballistic missiles but not of striking down intercontinental systems.
&gt; 
&gt; Stepping up Nato’s air power in the region could be an easier alternative. An existing Nato Baltic air policing arrangement involves a rotational deployment of alliance fighter jets. Four British Typhoons and four Portuguese F16s are on high-alert ready to intercept suspicious Russian aircraft. Shifting it to an air defence mission would involve a far larger deployment with combat capabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Such decisions would be contentious, said Gen Terras, who was confident they would be made. “The crucial thing, whatever happens, is the unity of Nato. The centre of gravity for us is that unity,” he added. “Without it, we all lose.” ",GR/US Citizen - Brussels Economist,0,europe,2,t5_2qh4j,1468731478,BELG,False,0,False,,d3reenr

For a long time from the 1880s to the world wars socialism had a powerful presence in our society, we have a proud history of radical anti-capitalism, from the Haymarket Affair to the IWW to Debs to the literal shooting battles workers got in to fight for their rights and dignity

The problem is we've forgotten. The 50s saw insane and despicable concerted efforts by the government to purge socialists from unions, I'm talking about shit like trying to pass laws forcing members of socialist, anarchist, and communist groups to register with the government, the FBI waged a campaign for decades with the sole purpose of infiltrating, spying on, harassing, and sabotaging leftist groups (COINTELPRO), it went so far as to murder leftist leaders (Freddy Hampton). 

By the end of the cold war the left was so utterly and completely purged and destroyed from the national discourse that center left liberals only concerned with identity politics became what we call the left today

For fucks sake even the self proclaimed socialists like Bernie are just European style social democrats. It's been so effectively removed from society that kids calling themselves socialists haven't ever even *heard* the phrase ""workers control of the means of production"".

Everybody and their brother have a gun under their pillow. So as I watch the marching krouts I wasn't scared. I knew there was a plan. Some underground militia was being formed ready to take the fight to the enemy. For now, I just have to wait.

Day 5: Our house was searched. We all hid in the hidden room behind the dresser. They asked the landlord about us, they knew we fled from Germany and they know we are Jewish. They will be back. I know our luck will run out. There are rumors of the militia planning an attack soon. I want to join. I want to fight.

Day 7: They came back again for the second day in a row. They are getting suspicious. They know we are here. Sooner or later our landlord will get taken or killed. He is doing too much. We need to leave this place. I told my family I am joining the militia I am going to fight back.

Day 10: It's working. The Germans have no idea where we are coming from. The militia knows the city and they don't. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. The military is having success too. The Navy is blockading so the enemy has no relief. We are going to win this easily.

Actually no, most everyone is and continues to be on the wrong page. 

Per the post title: ""Check out Google's **Memorial Day Doodle**"". 

There was none. The title was accurate. 

But then look at /u/PhysicsIsMyMistress dishonest title: ""...chastises Google for **not celebrating Memorial Day**...""

A subtle but key difference. He wasn't chastising Google for not celebrating Memorial day - he was chastising them for celebrating it so limply (i.e. no Google Doodle, just a ribbon).

PhysicsIsMyMistress deliberately misrepresented his post to imply he was wrong and dishonest. Very ironic.

&gt;This is an interesting claim. Do you have any evidence in addition to them doing a doodle of someone you hold to be anti-American?

Facebook censoring conservatives. Twitter censoring conservatives. Tax evasion. Company cultures which shun conservative values (I'm an active VC investor in CA and regularly visit tech companies). 

It's abundantly clear they hold the US in contempt with the exception of its pool of highly skilled workers and favorable business laws. 

When they don't hold it in contempt, they are simply lacking in pride (a t-shirt with the American flag on it would prompt ill-concealed snickers). 99% of these people have never served in the military and are so divorced from America's history they may as live in Europe.",,0,AgainstHateSubreddits,-1,t5_38gfm,1468732187,t,False,0,False,,d3rfwtz

The Balkan Peninsula, or the Balkans, is a peninsula and a cultural area in Southeast Europe with different and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the east of Serbia to the Black Sea at the east of Bulgaria.

The Balkans are bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea on the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast. The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala 2,925 metres (9,596 ft) on the Rila mountain range in Bulgaria.

 I suspect IndianCountry subreddit is populated with white passing Natives.   You can tell by the way they act towards any stupid white person who wanders in there asking questions and being shitty.  They are *super* tolerant, like they are speaking to one of their own.  Or maybe it's just me and I'm a crazy asshole and too angry but they strike me as way too tolerant of white fuckery and seem very liberal and they say the same sorts of things, that it's a state of mind and connection with the culture. I do believe in having ""an Indian nature"" though.  It seems we are naturally oriented in a way that is diametrically opposed to WASP culture.  The perspectives and ways of thinking and being are totally different (I think the suppression of this nature in addition to the poverty contributes to the high rates of suicide) and it seems very radical to white people, even white people who believe themselves to have ""fringe"" beliefs. It surprises me actually.  




 On the one hand the issue with blood quantum seems valid and there are issues with disenrollment but I'm not sure that's for me to have an opinion on since I was never enrolled and never received shit...  but on the other, you never have white passing mixed people with one drop of African blood in them going around claiming a deep spiritual connection to African or black culture.  And they never try to reclaim their *actual* European tribal roots and culture, which would be perfectly valid.  I ask them what it means to them to be part Native American and they never have an answer.

&gt; BRUSSELS/LONDON European Union governments should not ban services like home-rental site Airbnb or ride-hailing app Uber except as a last resort, the EU says in new guidelines, seeking to rein in a crackdown on the &amp;quot;Sharing economy&amp;quot;.

&gt; In guidelines seen by Reuters, the European Commission said any restrictions by EU member states on these new online services should be justified and proportionate to the public interest at stake.

&gt; A case in point is Uber, which considers itself merely a digital service connecting drivers and passengers as opposed to a transport service, which would make it subject to more onerous rules on driver qualifications, road rules and insurance.

&gt; BRUSSELS/LONDON European Union governments should not ban services like home-rental site Airbnb or ride-hailing app Uber except as a last resort, the EU says in new guidelines, seeking to rein in a crackdown on the &amp;quot;Sharing economy&amp;quot;.

&gt; In guidelines seen by Reuters, the European Commission said any restrictions by EU member states on these new online services should be justified and proportionate to the public interest at stake.

&gt; A case in point is Uber, which considers itself merely a digital service connecting drivers and passengers as opposed to a transport service, which would make it subject to more onerous rules on driver qualifications, road rules and insurance.

&gt;Meanwhile the rich pricks WHO DO NOTHING in Saudi Arabia and who helped start 9/11, sit and watch Europe systematically fall apart

So?

&gt;Other rich gulf states, could give a fuck about their fellow Muslims.

Almost like muslims aren't a monolith and they can't be treated as such, and regularly kill each other and there would be a great reason to flee muslim countries if you were a muslim and not move to fuckin Saudi Arabia where your wife will get stoned to death and won't be allowed to leave the house. Great compassion there.

&gt;At the same time, citizens in these countries 1st Amendment rights are being censored, but Im sure thats all part of the plan

....... I'm going to assuming this was just a typo. You do realise the 1st amendment doesn't apply to the rest of the world right? No countries in Europe have free speech. Actally I think France might.

&gt;There is a significant Christian population in Syria as well. Do they matter if they are fleeing?

Yes, and those are the people you are saying shouldn't be allowed in too.

1464765119,t1_d3rfsqi,baazaa,1,t3_4lu8tj,"&gt; So explain the USA and China?

China isn't resource rich relative to it's size and population. The USA largely achieved supremacy by protecting its nascent industries from British competition, back when their dollar was too high due to cotton exports and the like. You'll probably recall Adam Smith: 

&gt; It has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our American colonies towards wealth and greatness, that almost their whole capitals have hitherto been employed in agriculture. They have no manufactures, those household and coarser manufactures excepted, which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture, and which are the work of the women and children in every private family... 

&gt;Were the Americans, either by combination, or by any other sort of violence, to stop the importation of European manufactures, and, by thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods, divert any considerable part of their capital into this employment, they would retard, instead of accelerating, the further increase in the value of their annual produce, and would obstruct, instead of promoting, the progress of their country towards real wealth and greatness.

The northern industrialists wanted protectionist measures and they got them (it was one of the reasons for the civil war). Needless to say the wars in the 20th century definitely helped the US as well.

Nowadays the USA has all the talent and capital, it's hard to overcome that sort of entrenched advantage (you have economies of scale etc.). It still didn't protect the rust belt though. As you point out their high-tech sector also benefited from things like the space program and military R&amp;D.

 If we abandon free trade and adopt protectionism then we can easily compete, indeed that's why we had an automotive industry and a steel industry etc. in the first place, but that's not going to happen.

&gt; So you are saying we join the Euro and that will make all the difference?

Yes if we joined a currency union we'd be a beneficiary. 

&gt; Well that's strange, most people at work are highly trained. 

Is this an export industry or one that's effectively trapped here? Because if it's the latter and the industry doesn't employ many people then it doesn't say much about our ability to produce human capital besides the fact that we can do it if really necessary. So far as I'm concerned the only high-skilled field that we're competitive in is mining services (although there's some nice green-shoots in biotech, aquaculture, a few other things).  

As for Germany, the kids there that can't get into uni and are ushered into technical jobs seem to end up better-employed than our graduates. If we stopped treating 'years of schooling' as a proxy for human capital and consider actual hard technical skills their workforce would slaughter ours.

 ---  

&gt;A mime or mime artist (from Greek μῖμος, mimos, ""imitator, actor"") is someone who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a performance art, involving miming, or the acting out a story through body motions, without use of speech. In earlier times, in English, such a performer would typically be referred to as a mummer. Miming is to be distinguished from silent comedy, in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch.

 &gt;The performance of mime originates at its earliest in Ancient Greece; the name is taken from a single masked dancer called Pantomimus, although performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime such as mummer plays and later dumbshows evolved. In early nineteenth century Paris, Jean-Gaspard Deburau solidified the many attributes that we have come to know in modern times—the silent figure in whiteface.

We buy a car with roughly the same price (taxes are much lower than some nordic european countries). If we want to buy a phone, computer, bicycle or anything similar, we pay the same price.

Rent is of course cheaper. In most cities, a shit apartment close to the center is about 250€. If you don't mind living outside the city you can have a 2 rooms small apartment for about 150€. If you want to buy an apartment you have to figure how to get at least 20.000€. Minimum wage won't allow you to live by yourself.

Going out is also cheaper. Here you pay at most 25€ per person if you go to a luxury restaurant. If you go to a normal restaurant you can expect to pay 10-15€.

A cab is roughly 0.4€ per kilometer. Transport is about 0.4€ per ticket or cheaper if you take a pass.

For anything we buy we have a government tax of 20%. It used to be higher but I expect it to increase again.

Of course, life is quite simple for those who manage to net 1000€ or more as a monthly wage. But unfortunately it is harder for us to travel (same prices as any other country), buy cars, buy electronics, clothes and so on. We don't afford them as easy as someone making the average salary in Germany or Norway.

Can you imagine to make 400€ per month and want to play a game that costs 60€? That is insane. How about making 300€ per month and paying that price? That is, of course, if somehow you managed to get a computer able to run said game.

From UKCISA:  http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Information--Advice/Fees-and-Money/England-fee-status#RL?rl_playlist=playlist3324&amp;rl_id=0

In order to qualify for 'home' fees under this category, you must meet all of the following criteria:

&gt;(a) you must be settled in the UK on the first day of the first academic year of the course; and

You are British, so are settled.

&gt;(b) you must be ordinarily resident in the UK on the first day of the first academic year of the course; and

You are living here, so meet this.

&gt;(c) you must also have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for the full three year period before the first day of the first academic year of the course - eg, if your course begins in October 2016, you must have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands from 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2016; and 

As far as I can tell, you **do not** meet this requirement, hence must pay International fees.

(d) the main purpose for your residence in the UK and Islands must not have been to receive full-time education during any part of that three-year period.

Again, you were working as you said, so this is OK as far as I can tell from here.

As a form of nationalism, Zionism posits 1. that the Jewish people are a nation, 2. That they are a nation in need of a state, 3. that that state ought to be established in what by then was known as Palestine.

A nation, in the words of Benedict Anderson, is an 'imagined community' such that even if we stipulate, through evidence such as Jewish Ghettoization, that the Jews thought themselves to be a distinct community in the middle ages (point 1.) we know factually that points 2. and 3. of the Zionist program simply didn't exist until much, much later.

So for instance, when you say:

&gt; Especially as the Caliphate was, generally-speaking, more tolerant than Christian Europe.

Sure, Islamdom was often more tolerant of Jews, generally speaking, than many parts of Christian Europe. *But* Jews who migrated to Islamdom (like those who were expelled from Spain after the reconquista and who went to the Ottoman empire), did not therefore establish a program of creating a new state, nor did they wish to settle in Palestine despite Palestine being within the territorial borders of the empire in which they now resided. Unsurprisingly they used that tolerance to try to prosper in imperial centers like Istanbul rather than a barren imperial periphery like Palestine.

An account must also be made of the long tradition of Jewish *non*-Zionism or *anti*-Zionism. Even *after* the publication of Herzl's *Der Judenstaat*, which is often taken as the birth of the Zionist movement (despite significant precursors, [including even among gentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone_Memorial)) a large portion and perhaps even a large majority of, for example, American Jewry rejected Herzlian Zionism. [""America is our Zion""](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1898/12/18/page/32/article/america-is-our-zion) the Union of American Hebrew Congregations declared three years after Herzl published *Der Judenstaat*.

Even the document that was arguably most significant in actually establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, the Balfour Declaration, met significant resistance from Jews in the British government on the basis that such a declaration would undermine the rights and status of Jews as British citizens (or citizens of other countries).

It's not actually until the Balfour declaration is an established fact that American Jewry, for instance, gains majority support for a Zionism in Palestine (which remains purely a political support, as only a small fraction of American Jews ever actually migrate), and certain portions of Jews (e.g. Reform Jews and portions of the ultra-orthodox) remained opposed.

**Sourcewise**, for the American portions (which I'm most familiar with as opposed to international Jewish attitudes towards Zionism) see *The Columbia History of Jews and Judaism in America* and Howard Sachar's *A History of the Jews in America*.

On Jewish opposition to the Balfour Declaration within the British Government, virtually any history of the subject will cover it, but see for example Lord Montagu's memorandum on the subject [here.](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Montagumemo.html)

Nope. We can't compete with BRICs because we offer very different products and services. We are a European developed economy offering finance, consultancy and IT services, the BRICs offer mineral wealth, engineering and exports. It's nonsensical to try and compete with BRICs. Even so, if we wanted to, it makes more sense to compete with outside economies as a member of the largest and most affluent single market in the world, instead of trying to compete with Europe. By leaving we both lose the clout that is associated with membership and will have to undercut the largest and most affluent single market in the world to be competitive. I can't see any upsides there. 

&gt;negotiate trade details all around the world more quickly or favourably as benefits?

We have less leverage as an economy than the economies of the EU combined. We're going to have to accept worse trade deals in order to compete with Europe. This on top of substantially weakening the links to the EU, who remain our most important trading partners. Again, I'm not seeing many positives. 

&gt;you don't see the benefit from having a surplus of cash at hand because we're not sending it via brussels to get skimmed off and sent around europe?

You mean the less than 0.5% of GDP we pay to have access to the largest single market in the world? That investment is returned; the numbers are hard to estimate, but considering optimistic estimates say our economy will shrink by 2% in the event of exit, I'd say we're getting value for money here. We'd gain £250 million per week and lose a hell of a lot more in unfavourable trade terms, devalued currency, lower investment confidence and worse economic growth.

His and his party's popularity index was tanking by the end of 2014, but he successfully rode people's fears about the migrant crisis, so now they are on the up once again. 

He's populist to no end and with the help of seasoned American Republican political advisors he mastered that since his return to governance in 2010. He had a moderately surprising defeat after his first term in 1998-2002 which could have been attributed to his more lenient and live-and-let-live attitude to the opposition and that bit him in the ass. Now Fidesz is a steamroller, defeating all opposition proposals with success (even now that they've lost their 2/3 supermajority). That is greatly aided by the incompetence of these parties, too. 

He also realized that politics is an abstract concept for the majority of voters, the ones who only get by in life. To them, the billions of Fts that are being thrown about in political talks are incomprehensible amounts, because their personal wealth rarely exceeds more than a few tens of thousands of Euros, often even less than that. 

So they focused on reaching the hearts of these people so they would decide once and for all that he is the best political choice for them. They did that by forcing privately owned public utility companies to artificially lower their prices, resulting in a ~6-8€ combined monthly utility bill reduction for most people. That amount they can understand, that they can appreciate. A second thing they could comprehend is their fears about migrants, who are basically painted as Neanderthal savages who are incapable of doing anything, but being criminals and welfare leeches in state media. So he built our famous wall, too, that regained the voters he lost by the end of 2014. 

So now when we had a $1 billion scandal about Orbán's friend, party member and colleague, president of the National Bank people didn't really care. Just like they didn't care a year ago when we had a $600 million scandal about brokerage companies who worked closely with some ministries turning out to be running a Ponzi scheme for about 15 years. Or the time when $10 billion of private pension funds were appropriated by the government. 

The society is in a very sad mental state, and the country's economic one is equally tarnished. We are dead last in the Central European region in economic markers, but we were among the richer countries when we joined in 2004. 

Orbán's motto is definitely that of Epictetus' : ""Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."" So he's working on controlling those views hardcore, even if the manure continues to pile up under the rag. ",Budapeöst,0,hungary,10,t5_2qzzt,1468733605,BACS,1464772833,0,False,,d3rirpt

To keep up with Hungarian events, I hang out on here, the Budapest subreddit, the Europe subreddit and the European subreddit (before it got kicked out). That being said...

I think you should take whatever you hear on here with a grain of salt. I find that Reddit strongly deviates from what I noticed in the Hungarian people in general. For example, Jobbik and LMP have virtually no presence on this website. In reality, however, Jobbik has become one of the most popular parties over the last few years. This subreddit seems much more geared towards left-wing politics than the many Hungarians whom I met in both Budapest and (especially) the countryside.

Thus, I also think the opinion of Orban on here and most of the other sub-reddits is disproportionately more negative than Hungarian society in reality. I'm not saying every Hungarian loves him, but I think you won't likely get a representative answer here. 

From what I noticed in Hungary, there are a lot of people who like him, but there are also a lot of people who have the following attitude (copy and pasting the opinion of my colleague from last year: ""he's not the best, but there isn't anyone better right now.

That honestly depends on which nation and heraldic jurisdiction you are talking about. In general the answer would be yes in the British Isles, sometimes in western and central Europe and mostly only for cadet houses, and not at all in eastern Europe.

I understand many people feel these women are coerced into wearing these garments, but I bet some muslim women do feel more comfortable having their hair covered. Also, if a person is very religiously devout, they can't really separate their public (or work) selves from their religious beliefs. For example, sikh males must always wear a turban, even in place of a helmet during military service. An employer banning a sikh from wearing his turban would effectively prevent that sikh from accepting that position. Though the ban would be equally imposed on all employees, it would only really affect those part of minority religious groups. I'm from the States and our religious freedom laws are different from European countries, but the Supreme Court has usually found in favor of protecting minority religions in cases like these.

I have seen academics and professionals say that leaving will end up with our economy tanking, our job market suffering. I've read papers that say that immigration is a (much needed) net benefit to the country, and foreign newspaper articles discussing their issues as qualified people flock to the UK.

I live with an NHS recruiter (foreign EU citizen) who works in an office in London where the majority of employees are EU and the majority of applicants are EU. My mother worked in the NHS as part of the clinical library services used by doctors and frequently commented on the foreign (especially EU) doctors and how many there were. Articles suggest a quarter of our doctors are from the EU. I'm yet to see anyone explain how this would be replaced. 

I've read the immigrants tend to be more likely to have qualifications (64% of immigrants vs 26% of British population) and the billions that this saves us as a country. 

I've read about how immigration causes the average wage to rise if you're earning more than the average wage (ie. Pay Gap increases) and as a qualified worker currently picking up further qualifications that will allow me the mobility to work anywhere in the world... This is great!

As a musician, I tour the world. I've just been asked if I could do a week in Germany in September. A weekend in Scandinavia in August. A week in Italy in October. I am paid ludicrously well to do these weeks away. Removing right to travel would make it harder for me to work in these markets. 

I am unsure that any argument based around democracy holds weight. The majority of EU legislation is fairly reasonable and on issues that we've brought to them (for instance, the tampon tax) we've been able to have a great effect: the EU is now changing how VAT works. We can work with the EU, and whilst not all of our politicians are electing to do so, I'm optimistic that in the future it will be possible.

1464776113,t1_d3rf8lg,EpikurusFW,2,t3_4lznie,"I don't have such a positive view, sadly.  Perhaps it's due to over-familiarity (I've lived there and visit every year) but my view is that a) the basic classic Greek dishes are, indeed, classic, but b) most of the tavernas execute most of them poorly.

I'll elaborate a little.  Most tavernas in Greece cater primarily to the tourist crowd (both internal Greek tourists and foreign tourist) rather than relying for their income on repeat business.  That encourages a mentality of 'get the punters in but once they are in we've already done our job'.  One of the ways they bring people in is by having menus that are the size of bibles.  Nine or ten page long menus at a small taverna with one or two people in the kitchen.  What does that mean?  Well, it means almost all the food is pre-prepped (often off-site) and frozen.  No small restaurant can keep fresh ingredients ready for over a hundred dishes and most businesses will put profit over quality (especially in Greece) so the end result is lots of low quality dishes.  Now, if you aren't exposed to Greek food that often it will still seem nice.  The basic flavours are going to be there and what's not to like about the fundamentals?  But often you will be getting low quality produce.  

The number of Greek waterfront restaurants that serve cheap frozen fish from asia and points east is astonishing (New Zealand Green Lip Mussels on a Greek island?  fuck right off!) and the prices of meals do not reflect the quality of the ingredients or the staffing costs (Greek salad / village salad in Plaka, the heart of Athen's tourist district, often comes with generic foreign white cheese instead of actual feta - Shame! Shame!).  Eating out in Greece costs more than it does in Germany, typically, and that is, frankly, appalling.  

Now the bitching is over, I'll add that if you go to a taverna in an out of the way village you're likely to get some stunning food but often you won't be able to access it if you don't speak a bit of Greek.  For Greek speakers they will ignore the menu and reel off the stuff they cooked today, just four or five things to choose from that will all be amazing, but if they don't speak English and you don't have any Greek the biblical menu will come out and you'll be eating from the freezer again.

One truly sad thing about the state of food in Greece at the moment is that a huge amount of regional variation has been lost as 'the Greek menu' has become homogenised across the country.  you will see pretty much the same menu everywhere, and that's a great shame as some of the regional cuisine is excellent but has been supplanted by the need to cater to what tourists expect.  If you have ever had a 'Greek salad' in Crete, you are eating an alien dish that was never served in Crete pre-tourists and that has pushed the actual local food off the menu.  On top of the loss of regional variation, the desire to produce the 'expected' food has also squelched most innovation in Greek tavernas outside a couple of big cities.  The dishes are fixed, they are done as expected and not messed with.  

Finally, a quick whinge about the way fresh fish is priced.  This shit about giving a price per kilo on the menu is criminal.  It's not so bad for the locals, who can have a conversation with the server and go into the kitchen to pick their fish but for tourists it's often an excuse for the restaurant to unload quantities of fish that they don't want as the amount of fish you will get is not specified on the menu and they can then charge you for whatever they feel like selling you.  And that cost is going to be massive compared to what fish costs in most other places in Europe.  Across the Aegean, in the fish markets of Istanbul they sell the same fish for a quarter of the price you would pay in the markets of Athens and restaurants are also about a quarter of the price compared to Greek restaurants.  There is a lot of shameless gouging going on.

All is forgiven, though, when you rock up to a small taverna in a quiet village in Pelio and get served fresh calamari and a half kilo of nice crisp white wine for five euros.  But when you get reminded of how good Greek food can be it throws into relief just how far most of what is served has fallen.",,0,food,2,t5_2qh55,1468734060,,False,0,False,,d3rjqgt

You feel ""icky"" when any amount of intolerance must be displayed towards the intolerance of Islam, so you pretend that it isn't intolerant and that any appearance of it is a symptom of non-Muslim intolerance of Muslims (that's because you're  a racist; it's called *the soft bigotry of low expectations*... you deprive Muslims as humans of agency and responsibility, dehumanizing them for the sake of protecting the arbitrary ideology of Islam that doesn't deserve any such defense). Sorry, but history and a simple reading of Islamic scripture and tradition, not to mention listening to the Islamists themselves, disagrees with you. Reality disagrees with you. So stay in your echo chamber and fascinate yourself with fallacious perceptions of irony, I see the same in you, except that I'm right and you're wrong. When Trevor Phillips, the man who popularized ""Islamophobia"" in England and Europe comes out to say he was wrong, and that Islam makes Muslim minorities different to all others, you should know that you're on the wrong side.

We aren't talking about exterminating Jews, Slavs, Gypsies... because they are ""Untermensch"", we're talking about being able to politically sanction a group of ideologues in our own countries, because of their beliefs. Beliefs that put them in the exact same position as the Germans were to the Nazis; giving cover and support to a totalitarian ideological movement. It's the Muslims' Islam that  categorize Humanity into ""kafirs"", ""slaves"" and ""free women"" and ""free men""; it's they who fantasize about Islamic supremacy, not those who speak against it in the name of freedom and equality.

I'm a humanist that supports to use ""Nazi"" rhetoric to challenge literal Nazis of the 21. century, the Islamists and jihadists. Just like the people who were against the Nazis during WW2 had to use ""Nazi"" weapons to fight them. I suppose you'd prefer surrendering and enduring total Nazi domination and the genocide of millions, because fighting the Nazis by killing them is hypocritical and ironic, right? Because Nazis want to kill and if we killed them we're literally Nazis, right? *""Ha ha, what an irony!""* No, not irony, it's tragic. It's sad that a Late Iron Age Arab supremacism is defended by people who pretend that they're the enemies to totalitarian ideologies like the Nazis', when they're actually just supporting another version of it today; while attacking those who merely want humanist supremacy, with its terrors of equality and freedom for all humans.

Therefore under dutch law you may:

Persecute/fine the corporation itself.

Persecute the ""boss"", the chairman or other people who factually lead. Also if employees for instance commit crimes and their boss knows but doesn't act, he may also be prosecuted. However there are strict guidelines for that.

You may also persecute the corporation and it's leadership.

&gt; Goods currently carried on the route by a million lorries a year will go by train instead. The tunnel has overtaken Japan&amp;#039;s 53.9km Seikan rail tunnel as the longest in the world and pushed the 50.5km Channel Tunnel linking the UK and France into third place.

&gt; The completed tunnel travels up to 2.3 km below the surface of the mountains above and through rock that reaches temperatures of 46C. Engineers had to dig and blast through 73 different kinds of rock, some as hard as granite and others as soft as sugar.

&gt; Its trajectory will be flat and straight instead of winding up through the mountains like the old rail tunnel and a road tunnel opened in 1980.

She may not be literally required for it, but it's a soft requirement to this day, between LS/SBB she offers survivability that is frankly still pretty much unparalleled on any server.

Heinrich was pretty broken as well, IIRC he was the reason EU removed the buffed HP scaling on BB (a la Rize) since he was just way too strong. Even with his mediocre animation he's still one of the best 7* units of any server, the combination of slot efficiency and damage/survivability is pretty silly.

Arthur is reasonably balanced now, but on release, given how many units he outclassed/destroyed I'd argue he was released a bit too early as well.

Lovren used to play for Dinamo Zagreb. Dinamo Zagreb is owned by Zdravko Mamic. Mamic makes players sign unfair ""slavery"" contracts so that they have to pay him % of his paycheck even when they leave Dinamo. Even Luka Modric has to take something like 25-30% of his paycheck and give it to Mamic. Usually all this is hidden from the public, but some players decide to resist. Good example is Eduardo, who didn't want to give 40% of his salary to Mamic anymore and made his story pubilc.

So far we know that Mamic is corrupt piece of shit. As stupid as it sounds Mamic also owns Croatian national team and gets to pick who is coach and which players will play. So Croatian coach Ante Cacic gave a lot of chance to Dinamo Zagreb's young players. Lovren didn't like not playing and he called Cacic on his bullshit and said something like: ""Those young players from Dinamo don't deserve that much playing time, and they are only playing because it will boost their value (playing in a team with Modric, Rakitic, Mandzukic &amp; co.) so that Mamic can make more money when he sells them to European teams.""

Cacic and Mamic didn't like that so Lovren isn't playing.

Good example is Croatian Euro squad. Remember Alen Halilovic? One of best Croatian young players with amazing potential? Well he isn't going to Euros, because Mamic already sold him and can't profit with him playing. Instead  Marko Rog, Ante Coric and Marko Pjaca (all 3 Dinamo players) are included in squad, because they ""deserve chance and are showing potential"", but the truth is they are going to Euro 2016 to increase their value, so that Mamic can sell them for more money into better club where they will get biggers salary, so that Mamic can take bigger cut.",Arsenal,0,soccer,1185,t5_2qi58,1468734943,s1 1 team-1 country-eng,False,0,False,,d3rlm08

You were relegation contenders before Moyes stabilised and steadied Everton. Milan were winning trophies with Balon D'or winners and world best players in several positions in those years.

AMD has the potential to either crash and burn or take off again.  If their new processor is a success they'll be doing pretty well, otherwise it's hard to say.  Someone was saying due to anti trust laws in Europe (?) that Intel really needs AMD to still be on the market so they have that going for them as well, which is nice.  They're also generally the leading provider of lower to mid range processors/graphics cards so they're big in the budget crowd.  Also, as I understand it, AMD is currently what in at least some/most of the consoles.  If they can maintain that contract they'll be doing alright.

Both of them are riding on hype waves right now so don't be surprised if you hit a short term dip right after you buy.  Though people have been waiting for the NVDA dip for about a week now it seems but it keeps going up.

Also worth noting if VR takes off in the next 5-10 years I imagine both companies will be doing fairly well comparatively to where they are now but VR is still a pretty niche technology regardless of how many cool You Tube videos or the like you see right now.  Honestly though, both companies could very potentially have a bright future.

&gt;&gt;Not all ideas are equal. Not all cultures are, either. Deal with it. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;americans and europeans are not significantly more bigoted than other races ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So you conclude from those two comments that americans and europeans in general are racist?

**YOU** are the one judging other races and peoples. **YOU** are the one ranking European and American culture as above that of others.

At the same time, **YOU** are the one calling me a bigot for making the exact same sweeping judgements about *your* group of people based on the **EXACT** same premises. Not only that, but I even explicitly explained that this is what I was doing, and it **STILL** managed to pass by your hollow intellect unnoticed.

You pretend that Muslims ""cultural values"" can be extrapolated through ""statistics"", yet you firmly reject having your culture judged by similar standards.

That's called hypocricy. You argue contradictory things with each new breath, causing the cognitive dissonance.

Just like with Mexico and the US this has always motivated people from less fortunate areas to flee their home situation (war, poverty, religious persecution, etc.) and try to migrate into countries that are perceived as offering a better life.

For a long time this problem was mainly ""contained"" to Africans trying to get to Southern Europe by boat which is a very hard journey that ended in a lot of deaths which have been ignored for a time.

Now however due to the war in Syria and Iraq a new influx of migrants is coming into Europe by land which is a much more manageable and achievable journey.

In addition migrants or would-be migrants from other (closer) regions joined the already existing migrant stream hopping to have better chances in the current climate. This increased the overall spotlight on migration and the perceived ""problem"".

In reality at the start of the new influx there was a logistical problem because countries like Germany weren´t prepared to process high amounts of migrants in a reasonable time. However from a total ""amount"" perspective the influx isn´t really insurmountable. It´s more a realization that this might be the new normal and that we should try to find a better solution that isn´t ""let them die before our borders"" or ""let them all in without limits"".

However while politicians discuss, migrants are ""stranded"" in some key locations being barred from going forward but also not wanting to back down.

One time when I went to Italy some years ago (just before the euro switch), I had to spend a day on Milano and around it running around for business and not only did absolutely no Italian speak a word of French, English, Spanish or German, but the only way they'd communicate was to speak louder and faster until you'd finally get it. It was quite frustrating.  
OTOH I just went back and while I made an effort to learn a few words, the fact that I was in Rome and Napoli (places with lots of tourists) during the beginning of the season meant that everybody was extra nice and tried its best to be understood, using whatever language they knew (usually English, but often French). A lot of them sounded like the Marx Brothers which always put a smile on my face. 
I also know people in Corsica which is a popular destination for Italians who regularly have to face Italian tourists speaking Italian with absolutely no intention whatsoever of making an effort to be understood (apart from the louder and faster thing). Maybe it's because the Corsican language has roots close to many Italian dialects. Although there aren't that many that speak it.

And then, I remember going to a shop in Paris with my camera and being immediately addressed in English. It took a few exchanges before the guy finally let go and resigned himself to speaking French.

In the end it probably mostly reflects on the level of comfort of a lot of European countries population with foreign languages.

Europe, America and Japan have negatively affected other regions as well, They too help shaped the borders of their colonies and conquered states. As provided in my example Vietnam, once under brutal occupation by France, Japan and the US. Now Vietnam has put the past behind them and moving on, looking towards the future, forming friendly and productive relations with their former colonial powers, as opposed to producing constant hatred and envy of the their old enemies.

In recent times Vietnam has been developing good relations with its former occupier the US, with most Vietnamese moving on, looking to the future and developing a favorable view of the US. An example perhaps to follow.

Somewhat fine, yes, as alluded in my post above. I don't deny Western intervention has had a detrimental affect in helping to ferment secular, democratic and tolerant societies in the middle east, due to the West's support of Islamists to counter communists and socialists during the cold war. 

Even without western intervention, due to Islamic scripture and the example of Muhammad and the Sahaba, their would likely be much hatred and contempt for non-Muslims who reject Islam (as can be seen from history) culminating in, discrimination, oppression and violence, towards non-Muslims and Muslims of differing sects/interpretations, viewed as 'Apostates/Blasphemers/Not true Muslims', by other Muslims.

1464785209,t1_d3r8z8t,Chucklz,2,t3_4lxhvk,"&gt; While sending QSL cards through the mail is popular, it can get expensive, especially internationally.

For an example of this, some European nations have very expensive international postage.  You might need to send 3 or even 4 USD in an envelope to cover the postage to reply.  Add your $1.15 US postage to get the card to the DX, and you are looking at a significant expense for each card.  

Compare this with the Buro/bureau.  First, my club (and many like it) offer free outgoing buro service through the ARRL.  It is free in the fact that the club picks up the cost, but if you had to go it alone, the current cost is as follows:
Up to 10 cards in one envelope, $2.00
11-20 cards in one envelope, $3.00
21+ cards, at $0.75 an ounce, with a minimum charge of $3.00.
So clearly the best rates are with some bulk, which is why so many clubs offer some kind of buro service.

The exact cost of receiving cards depends entirely on your local incoming buro.  Here in 2 land, I pay $0.60 or so for an envelope credit.  I can get about 15-20 cards from an envelope.  So, you can see how you can save an incredible amount of money by using the buro.

At present all of those Bills with the red L have been put forward by the Lords and not the Commons. 

They will go to the Commons later on and that symbol will eventually change but because it is so early on in the Parliamentary session they have not made it that far.

The vast majority of these are introduced by those Lords who are Ministers on behalf of the Government. But by definition those Ministers who sit in the Lords are not elected.  

I don't think it is incorrect at all to imply that those proposing these Bills are unelected and that this process mirrors, to a large degree, the process of lawmaking in the EU. With the European Commission (appointed, not elected just like the Lords) and with the process then moving on to other legislative bodies. 

I am basically trying to clear up the misconception that all the House of Lords does it refine the finer wording of legislation put forward by the Commons. That is not the case. It is only part of what they do.

All too often I read, hear and see criticism of 'unelected bureaucrats' in Europe proposing laws (see the comment above my original post). All well and good to criticise the EU for it - but then you have to ask the question: Why are these same people not criticising the UK for the same? The only reason is that it doesn't further their political interests. If they truly cared about a lack of democracy they would act.

The EU has become protectionist, slow.-moving, introverted and self-serving.
  
The UK, however, has an incredible history of global trade, economic flexibility and skilled international relations. 
  
The world has changed since 1975, largely owing to the WTO. Rendering FTAs unnecessary for international trade. We have no FTA with the USA for example.    

We would be a smaller negotiator on our own, but we would be able to make trade-agreements and deals that are more uniquely suited to us, rather than a compromise for a 28-member block.  
    
We have a unique economy; bolstered by financial, legal, digital and creative services. A free floating, untethered, deregulated economy would be hugely beneficial to the UK's smaller, independent businesses. Think of Hong-Kong, Singapore &amp;amp;amp; Switzerland as inspiration.  
  
The UK could lose VISA-free access to Europe, but would have room to manoeuvre in terms of negotiating new agreements with our commonwealth family and global partners. Retirement in the Bahamas, Nepal, Fiji, South Africa, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, India could all be better facilitated.        
  
The UK is in a unique position of being the country of origin of the world's Lingua Franca.
  
Non-EU citizens pay very large fees to study in the UK, and are of a huge benefit to educational funding.

Restoration of British fishing waters, creating industry in towns left barren by EU redistribution. An end to Fishing quotas, and the subsequent dumping of fish.

Saying that country has a single government is absolutely false. They are exactly the model you are describing, with multiple providers of security and law all in competition with each other.

Except an Anarcho-Capitalist conception of society has multiple groups *that aren't limited by political borders*. That's a pretty key difference.

What you're describing in Syria is a state of many small states fighting over territory. You don't ""choose"" any of them, they choose you when they occupy the area you live in (unless you live in a hut in the middle of the desert or something, in which case it's a null point since no one else is enforcing anything on you).

The FACT is that the current wave of migrants have a culture that leads them to be much more likely to commit sexual assault than the native population of these European countries.

That's funny, this is usually an argument I hear from American white supremacists agaisnt blacks and why they are 'inferior' or need to be kept in check, yet you have no problem applying it to 'muslims', even without proof.

&gt;&gt;Again, not racism. You can call them bigots if that's what you think they are but THE TWO WORDS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. They are NOT synonyms and they do NOT mean the same thing. Racism is part of bigotry, but bigotry isn't always racism.

Then why do I constantly see *racist* arguments thinly veiled as *cultural* arguments interchangably and not exclusively arguments based on the supposed incomatability between Muslims and Westerners?

&gt;&gt;Furthermore, pointing out the OBJECTIVE, DATA showing that certain cultures have values that are inconsistent with ours isn't bigotry, it's called ""not being in denial about the facts"". Talking about FACTS is not prejudice and therefore, by definition, also not bigotry.

What 'facts'? Is it a 'fact' that 90% of refugees are male? Is it a 'fact' that Europe is overrun by migrants? Is it a 'fact' that an influx of young males from the Middle East translates to higher rates of sex crimes? Is it also a 'fact' by extention that higher rates of sexual assault proves Muslims inherently incompatible with the West?

They are all thinly veiled xenophobic and bigoted opinions, amounting to little less than sweeping judgements. It's not, as you laughably suggest, based on ""mind reading"", it's based on the posers' own words and rationales.

**YOU** are the one hiding behind the dictionary definition of words. If I started recisting Nazi propaganda about the Jews and defended myself by saying *judaism isn't a race, it's a religion*, you wouldn't buy that for one second. You wouldn't say ""*oh okay, that makes what you're saying factual and 100% cool*"". You would point out, as I did, how I'm using racist arguments and hiding behind a dictionary definition to legitimize my bigotry.

The ultimate irony in all of this is of course that you did *exactly* what I predicted, namely whip out a dictionary and say I'm wrong because my characterization isn't dictionary air-tight, using that as an excuse to overlook my entire point and keep talking bullcrap.

That's why unions are at all time lows in the Industrialized world.

&gt; ou said that Africa was always a violent tribal sewer so provided you with examples of mighty and prosperous civilizations that existed on the continent. 

No you didn't.  You provided an example of *relative prosperity* to try an defend this socialist drool.  My point remains - collectivism kills and holds back people.  Africa is a prime example.

&gt;  I can think of a lot of capitalist ""thugocracies"" (European imperial empires, the US, 

There was a time Europe certainly was that.  The US has never been so on any real scale.  The fact you think so merely demonstrates how desperate you are to prop up your ideation in the face of facts that refute it.

&gt; Why would the average person be less well off when they receive the full fruits of their labor? 

Because the size of that ""fruit basket"" is inherently smaller in collectivist economic structures.  I'd rather have .001% of a trillion dollars than 100% of one thousand dollars.

&gt; Those who own the means of production tend to prosper more than those who do not.

You - like every Socialist-Syndicalist - act as if the ""means of production"" just magically existed and were stolen from those po', po' workers.  Someone had to fund, build, and maintain those means.  They are called ""property owners"" and have a right to the sweat of *their* brow.  Nothing stops the po', po' workers from pooling *their* capital to build another means of production.  

&gt; Why is it impossible for workers to do this on their own?

It IS possible but only by one means: Capital accumulation and formation by one means or another.  Your beloved peasants couldn't build a silicon fab on the best day of their lives.  But they might be able to own a fraction of one via market and Capitalist action.

What you flog is both fundamentally dumb - it flies in the face of observable fact - and dangerous - it's get another form of peddling collectivism as the answer for all mankind.

&gt; Except an Anarcho-Capitalist conception of society has multiple groups that aren't limited by political borders. That's a pretty key difference.

They aren't limited by political borders - they operate in whatever areas they are welcome. 

&gt;What you're describing in Syria is a state of many small states fighting over territory. You don't ""choose"" any of them, they choose you when they occupy the area you live in (unless you live in a hut in the middle of the desert or something, in which case it's a null point since no one else is enforcing anything on you). If you live in Damascus and would rather Al Nusra govern you, or you live in Kurdish territory and would prefer the Baathists, you can't ""sign up"" to their service because you're automatically under whoever occupies your home.

Completely wrong - it just happens that people prefer to support security providers that operate in a more exclusive way. That's perfectly within their rights and still functions exactly as it would in any anarcho-capitalist society. You can't tell them that they aren't allowed to support who they prefer, or bind those groups according to any of your personal rules when you don't pay for it.  

&gt;By the dumb definition you're using, literally every warzone ever is Anarcho-Capitalist. If you lived in Eastern Europe during WW2, you could ""choose"" the Nazis, the Soviets, or even some third party like the Armija Krajowa, the UPA or the Forest Brothers. Why, it was Anarcho-Capitalism!

&gt;There is a very clear difference between ""many small governments fighting"" and ""Anarcho-Capitalism"" that I think should be obvious even to non-ancaps. Hell, there's a book written by a leftist called ""The Star Fraction"" that clearly establishes the difference between the two.

No, the problem is that ""Anarcho-Capitalism"" in reality will always devolve into a war zone, because that's always what happens when you have multiple military and security forces operating in the same place in competition with one another.

A lot of the ""hate"" and ""anger"" he's so worried about is A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE of the mod being pulled. Things prior were very peacefull and most people were quite content to ignore the existence of any number of other mods. 

It only became a problem afterwards, causing people to be rather irrate about the blatant hypocrisy involved in this. Which in turn spawned stuff such as ""the monkey"" mod as a backlash to it. 

The best thing about this is, their actions and censorship ARE THE DIRECT CAUSE of hatred, anger and animosity between various groups where prior they could ignore one another.

Those fools got what they deserved, and now these EU politicians will be taught the same lesson when cold, hard reality smacks them in the face.

The point of no return has been crossed; the two state solution is dead, the peace process is over. Israel is the sole and only rightful possessor of Jerusalem and the ""right of return"" - far from being an ""inalienable right"" - is in fact a myth; a fantasy. But the Arabs need to cling to the ""right of return"" lie  - no matter how ridiculous the prospect of it is - while they hold up their old metal keys to homes within villages inside of a country that doesn't even exist anymore. Those houses - gone. Those villages - ruins. That country - now Israel. The myth of a ""right of return"" is all the Arabs have left and it is because of the fateful decisions they made back in 1947 and 1948 that this is now their lot in life.

So there is nothing to talk about with the two faced PA. If they want an end to ""occupation"" they need to look beyond the land west of the river Jordan. Otherwise, they better start thinking about becoming Israelis.",Israel,0,Israel,1,t5_2qhvo,1468736767,il,1464789451,0,False,,d3rphbi

1464791352,t3_4m0ygg,BennyLincolnLogs,33,t3_4m0ygg,"The ""slums, ghettos, and favelas"" concept is a bit of a false premise to begin with. A lot of top players come from working-class backgrounds, but certainly not all of them do...and very few (especially outside of Latin America) come from abject slum-level poverty. Most elite European players come from fairly comfortable upbringings by global standards.

The most technically skilled American players thus far...Donovan, Dempsey, now Pulisic...are very much products of these maligned suburban clubs and turned out alright. There are also numerous examples of ""ghetto kids"" with flashy skills who go to Mexico (where these players are supposedly better-appreciated) and are completely underwhelming at senior pro level...Jose Torres, Sammy Ochoa, Joe Corona, Edgar Castillo and countless others come to mind. Jorge Villafana beat out hundreds of these ""ignored"" elite Latino players in a TV contest show and he is only just now (after a conversion to defense) making any sort of mark as a pro. The reason most of these players don't get noticed by big-time youth clubs is that they aren't good enough.

There is this constant hand-wringing in American soccer about what we're supposedly doing wrong (a dynamic that Klinsmann shamelessly promotes and capitalizes on) when what has really held American player development back is pretty simple: a lack of exposure to high-level soccer on television...and that's not an issue anymore. The number of American players growing up with a proper auto-didactic education in the game is expanding rapidly, and there will be many more Donovans and Dempseys to come, not just one or two every generation.

TL;DR: The ""scout inner cities more"" argument is nothing new in US soccer circles, and is usually expressed as a lazy cliche that ignores the numerous working-class Latino players who actually do make it to pro level and aren't that good. There will be better US players of all classes and ethnicity as the game becomes more and more a part of mainstream American culture.",Charleston Battery,0,soccer,33,t5_2qi58,1468737507,s1 249 team-249 country-usa,1464793027,0,False,,d3rqwiu

I was going to write something about how the EU gave us the WWW, but then I remembered that the WWW was almost a guerrilla effort. Tim Berners-Lee worked on it for 3 years in his spare time before getting any real assistance from CERN, and although the CEO of the non-profit who hired me was a major supporter, I was afraid to tell the CEO who replaced him when he retired, how much time I was spending on developing an open source software project that had no clear path toward revenue for our organization.

The point is that these things that are really innovative always start small. Most of them wither and either barely survive, like XCOR, or die, like Rotary Rocket.  XCOR was started by Jeff Greason, who had about $200 million to his name at the time, which was roughly the same time as Musk started SpaceX. If you have ever heard Greason talk, he is like a more articulate Musk. He had all the advantages Musk had, and all the resources, but he did not go all in, and he did not bet big, on the orbital market and commercial launches.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Greason

One should not count Greason out, yet. He is kind of like Wright Aircraft by the start of WWI. He was there first, before Musk, but others have passed him by, like Curtis, DeHaviland, and Fokker passed Wright. But Orville Wright made a comeback, as an engineer working for his former competitors. The engine in the DC-3 (and the B-17), the Wright Cyclone engine, was designed by in large part Orville Wright, and that was the most successful airliner in the world for almost 20 years. If Greason's newest company finds a place designing deep space vehicles that ride to orbit atop Falcons, he may yet get to Mars.",,0,spacex,17,t5_2srow,1468737574,,False,0,False,,d3rr1nw

I think to answer your question it would depend on what type of future career path you are looking for.  Several schools in Europe have excellent LLM programs for international students.  (Personally would have loved to go to LSE's LLM program for Banking/Finance)  If you plan to work as an Ex-Pat overseas or at think-tank/advisory agencies (ie. the FED, World Bank, etc.) then having the international LLM experience could be your foothold into that door.  There are also several of the large law firms that have branch offices overseas and hire Ex-Pats who are knowledgeable about that regions legal system.
I noticed you are a LLB in New Zealand?  As for doors being opened and closed in your country, I really cannot help you there, as I am not familiar with the job market for attorneys in your country.  I would presume that adding the ""name value"" of any high ranking institution would further make you a more marketable prospect for any employer.
I personally made the leap to get my LLM (financial law) because of the job market.  Here in America the job market is not the greatest for lawyers.  I did it as an investment and as a way to make myself a niche in the market.  (specializing can be a risk) But, I have not regretted my decision and in fact I really enjoyed my time getting my LLM, since it was in a field I really enjoyed.  I hope this helps, I do understand there are similarities and differences between job placement, career paths, education, etc. between our two countries.

Because I'm traveling to both China and Japan, I bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016Q8PP0Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) from Amazon. It's a cell phone charger and a portable wifi that comes with 60 euros of credit to fill it up. It costs $69 USD. The prices on Amazon fluctuate, but according to [camelcamelcamel](http://camelcamelcamel.com/GlocalMe-Unlocked-Roaming-Free-SIM-Free-Countries/product/B016Q8PP0Y), it's the cheapest it's ever been. 

The Japan data plan is 1GB for 15 euros. It expires after 30 days, but I don't need it for that long. They also have a 1GB for 7 euros for both China and Japan, which what I'll probably get and then top off as I go. Once my free 60 euros is gone, I can use Paypal to top it off with the GlocalMe app. 

And this is for traveling all over the world, but you buy data plans based on the location you're traveling to. It also can host up to 5 devices at the same time. Honestly, this was the best thing for me. I also researched just renting these portable wifi devices and picking them up upon arrival at the airport and then just dropping it off when you leave, but for the same price, I can have one of my own and take it all over the world, not just in Japan. 

You have to buy data packages, but it's way cheaper than getting the [AT&amp;T world roaming data plan](https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/international/roaming.html), which is what otherwise we'd have to get. It was like $60USD for just 300 MB. [Here's screenshots](https://imgur.com/kT6V83s) from the app for details on all available data packages. Or you can pay for it to work anywhere in the world for 0.05 euros per MB. Or you can pay for an annual data package of 2 GB per month to work in 58 different countries (Europe, Japan, China, U.S., Canada, some Caribbean and some South American countries). 

I haven't used it in Japan yet, but I have poked around with it here in the U.S. since it comes with 100 MB already installed. My iphone had no trouble connecting to it and used a few MB just testing it out. My friend also connected his android without problem. It can also be used for laptops and tablets, of course, but we'll be using it for maps and translation on our phones and using tablets on hotel wifi to conserve data.

&gt;Technology was one of the important facets of Mongolian warfare. For instance, siege machines were an important part of Genghis Khan's warfare, especially in attacking fortified cities. The siege engines were not disassembled and carried by horses to be rebuilt at the site of the battle, as was the usual practice with European armies. Instead the Mongol horde would travel with skilled engineers who would build siege engines from materials on site.

&gt;The engineers building the machines were recruited among captives, mostly from China and Persia. When Mongols slaughtered whole populations, they often spared the engineers, swiftly assimilating them into the Mongol armies.

Very interesting link to the exerpt [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_military_tactics_and_organization#Catapults_and_machines). I actually suggest you read this page above all the rest, because it best demonstrates the sophistication of the Mongol military. 

Part of the reason they were so terrifying was that their mounted cavalry could move faster than any other unit in previous history. This is largely due to the fact that they *did not* have a food supply chain. The general strategy was to sack a small city when they needed supplies, and in times where that wasn't possible, drink blood from one of their four mandatory horses for sustenance.

Their siege equipment did come in supply trains, and those were very well planned and organized by various Chinese and Persian engineers that they spared. Which makes me want to reiterate that while the Western world was going through a dark age, the East and particularly the Middle East were going through eras of explosive thought and growth- a growth whose halt was largely attributed to the Mongols.

As for violence, I know how violent the Romans were. But I'm again going to link a very interesting excerpt straight from a wiki that might be interesting:

&gt;Historians regard the Mongol raids and invasions as some of the deadliest conflicts in human history up through that period. Diana Lary contends that the Mongol invasions induced population displacement ""on a scale never seen before,"" particularly in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. She adds, ""the impending arrival of the Mongol hordes spread terror and panic.""[1] In addition, the Mongols practiced biological warfare by catapulting diseased cadavers into at least one of the cities they besieged.

On population:
&gt;Ancient sources described Genghis Khan's conquests as wholesale destruction on an unprecedented scale in certain geographical regions, causing great demographic changes in Asia. According to the works of the Iranian historian Rashid al-Din (1247–1318), the Mongols killed more than 700,000 people in Merv and more than a million in Nishapur. The total population of Persia may have dropped from 2,500,000 to 250,000 as a result of mass extermination and famine. Population exchanges did also in some cases occur but depends as of when.[10]

&gt;China reportedly suffered a drastic decline in population during the 13th and 14th centuries. Before the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people. The 92 Chinese cities destroyed by Mongols would not appear to account for this population fall, it might account for loss of 45 million people.

---

&gt;* British special forces are blasting Bollywood music as a new psychological warfare weapon against Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists in Libya on the advice of a Pakistani-born intelligence officer, it emerged today.They came up with the idea after the Pakistani-born intelligence officer with the British Army said that Bollywood tunes would annoy ISIS, which considers music un-Islamic.

&gt;* ""We needed to unnerve militants and at the same time use some sort of passive measure to gauge their force strength in the area we are working and it went well,"" a source told the 'Daily Mirror'.As part of a force known as the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), British forces are training Libyan troops on how to drive out ISIS from the town of Sirte and a 185-km stretch of the Libyan coastline.The psychological operations unit intercepted ISIS communications and blasted them with Bollywood chart music, in direct retaliation of the Sharia law imposed inside Sirte banning all things western or frivolous.Bollywood songs will be seen as a huge insult by the terror outfit, the newspaper reports.British and Libyan soldiers also dumped two cars with Bollywood music blaring out near Sirte.According to media reports, as well as tormenting the terrorists, the new musical weapon is also helping reveal their hiding places as when ISIS members complain about the music over their radios, it gives away their precise location.British special forces are in Libya in a non-combat role, training the nation's forces in how to wipe-out ISIS.The SBS (Special Boat Service) - sister agency of the SAS (Special Air Service) - will only launch an assault on ISIS if they are attacked first.It is believed that ISIS, who have held swathes of coastal Sirte for 20 months, have around 4,000 insurgents in the region.

Ik heb ook nog wel een vraag voor Pechtold. Want jouw opmerking doet me ook denken hoe de visie op een goed functionerend Europa beter verwoord moet worden. Tenminste, als dat al beter verwoord zou zijn in de landelijke politiek had ik het ondertussen hopelijk al meegekregen. Maar er wordt dus door pro-Europese partijen wel bevestigd dat dit Europa niet goed genoeg werkt, maar ik zou ze graag met concrete oplossingen zien komen en een beeld op de toekomst waarin de EU wordt 'gefixt'. Zoiets hoor ik ook graag van GroenLinks. Ik vraag me namelijk af wat de oplossingen zijn. Mijn vermoeden is: afstand nemen van de machtige VVD-, PvdA- en CDA-achtige partijen en samenwerkingen in Europa (nu zijn het geloof ik echt zulke partijen van andere, conservatievere, landen die vooruitgang in de weg zitten) en in heel Europa progressievere partijen op die zetels zien te krijgen met de verkiezingen voor het Europees Parlement. Als dit de manier is, wil ik weten hoe D66 dat hoopt te kunnen veranderen, en of ze in Nederland deze visie op een beter Europa niet kunnen promoten. Want een beter Europa begint dan ook hier lijkt me.

Daarnaast vraag ik me ook af wat D66 z'n positie is nu privatisering en marktwerking onder veel kritiek komt te staan, maar ik vermoed dat ik dat wel op hun site ofzo kan vinden. M'n vorige vraag misschien ook wel. Moet ik alleen de motivatie hebben om het op te zoeken, haha. Maar jouw opmerking over symbolen is sowieso erg sterk, dus zeker daar de aandacht op vestigen, waarschijnlijk stellen andere mensen ook wel die andere vragen!

En wat bedoel je precies met D66-lid tegen wil-en-dank? ;) Ik herken me er in ieder geval wel in, want ik ben ook D66-lid terwijl dat van mij helemaal niet hoeft. Maar ik wilde me oriënteren op de lokale politiek en om mee te doen met de lokale D66 (zoals het op mij overkomt de enige echt goede partij in onze kleine gemeente) moest ik lid worden van D66 landelijk.

1464796260,t3_4m1wl4,Jamak2001,1,t3_4m1wl4,"&gt;Today it is time for a another event as part of our wonderful Anniversary Celebrations!

&gt;No worries guys, we have not forgotten about the rest of you! Of course Artists will also get their Art Contest during these Celebrations. This time, the Art Contest is one of the earlier contests, giving the Artists plenty of time to work on something beautiful!

&gt;Do you think you have what it takes? We think so too!

&gt;For this contest you'll have to create an artwork about your favorite EU-Exclusive Unit(s)! Seeing that these contests surround our beloved (and sometimes not so beloved) Brave Fontier RPG's second Anniversary, we thought it would be a great idea to look back at all the different Exclusives our server has been introduced to over the past two years. This art contest will also follow the same theme as the other events!

&gt;What do we want you to create?

&gt;This time, you are going to get a lot more freedom than with our last art contest. The only condition is that you have to include EU Exclusive content. This can be a background based on the island of NeoAvalon, it could be baby Lucana and baby Themis fighting over Gazolina's rabbit Plushy, or something like Alvitr trying to pick flowers, but not being able to because her claws are in the way! The choice is completely yours! However it is important that your entry is original and completely yours! That's because we're looking for creativity and fairness.

&gt;Rules:

&gt;Use anything you like to create your piece! Pen and paper, PhotoShop, even good ol' Paint! Let your ideas take care of the rest!
No plagiarism! Anyone stealing art will be immediately disqualified! 

&gt;If you use material that is not your own/Gumi's, you must add the sources you used in the post with the picture. 

&gt;You cannot use art that has been used in another contest

&gt;The contest is open for entries from today 21:00 to 21:00 24th of June, 2016!

&gt;Only 1 entry per Summoner allowed

&gt;You need to enter your Ingame Name &amp; Summoner ID in your post
Once you've made your entry you cannot edit that post or we'll see it as cheating! If you want to change your entry, you have to delete your original entry and submit a new one!

&gt;Be creative and think out of the box! ^^

&gt;How will the winners be chosen?

&gt;When the deadline has been reached, all players will be able to vote for their favorite drawing! Out of all the votes, the most popular 5 entries will receive a fantastic reward! When voting, pick your personal TOP 5 Entries, and make sure to leave your User ID so we can enter your name in the Lottery! Details about how to vote will be communicated later.

&gt;All voters for the Top 5 Community Picks will automatically be entered in a lottery! More information about this near the end of the contest!

&gt;Rewards:

&gt;1st place: 3 Zodiac Units of Choice, 3 Trident Keys, 3 Mystery Frogs, 
1 Free Summon Ticket - And THREE points on the Grand Leaderboard!

&gt;2nd place: 2 Zodiac Units of Choice, 5 Imp Artons, 2 Trident Keys, 2 Mystery Frog, 1 Free Summon Ticket - And TWO points on the Grand Leaderboard!

&gt;3rd place: 1 Zodiac Unit of Choice, 5 Burst Emperors, 1 Trident Key, 1 Mystery Frog, 1 Free Summon Ticket - And TWO point on the Grand Leaderboard!

Hint for those of you studying IT at the TU and you're in the bachelor's program: Go to the Dekanat and ask for a letter saying you're allowed to attend master's classes. It doesn't have to say that you're accepted to the master's program, just that you're allowed to take classes (which you are). Have whoever is handling your HR then submit that letter to the AMS and they should accept it and then you can work 20 hours a week. Worked for me. 

If I remember correctly, your income also isn't limited as a non-EU student, only the hours you work a week (apparently the AMS also audits sometimes), so you could officially, on paper, log 20 hours a week but work more and get paid for more. Just need to work it out with your employer.

&gt;The Indian Army fought in Ethiopia against the Italian Army, in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia against both the Italian and German Army, and, after the Italian surrender, against the German Army in Italy. However, the bulk of the Indian Army was committed to fighting the Japanese Army, first during the British defeats in Malaya and the retreat from Burma to the Indian border; later, after resting and refitting for the victorious advance back into Burma, as part of the largest British Empire army ever formed.

Hardest dungeon you've cleared: Dragon rush and Hera rush, most regular mythicals, 1 C9 and 2-3 C8s. 
Current team(s): A.Shiva, A.Hino, Cao Cao, Yamato, Leilan, sometimes flex Valen. This is really my only team at the moment, and is almost completely hypered. 
Team Cost: Enough for anything I have. 
MP available: 36k (basically nothing). 
IAP status: Very rare, but I've been saving stones for this since February. 

Help me with: I've just bought 150 box space and then made ~35 pulls. I got an interesting combination of trolls and cool stuff that has filled out some colours I haven't really used before. I basically want something that hits the spots that Shiva can't and plays differently. I'd love to clear arena and think I have the main parts for water and light Norsebound teams that might manage it. I would say I have better subs for water but I don't have the MP for a puppeteer and don't really want to sell half my box. 

Here's what I think I have:

Red: No real change here, though I did pull Gadius to play with at some point. 

Blue: I had a very small but good core of blue cards, and just pulled Blonia, Skuld, and I&amp;I. This is where I think I must now have a great team, and I can probably use the leader guides to get most of the pre-SI/latent info I need. Any further advice is very welcome though. 

Green: lol :(. I don't think I have anything here. 

Light: I had a Saria and absolutely nothing to sub on her, but light gala has given me a few cards that should work, including Raphael. I also got DQXQ, so not sure which makes the best lead given my box and the new awoken DQXQ. 

Dark: I pulled 2 Haku. The first of these was really exciting, since I knew I'd have a great team if I pulled Pandora or Lucifer. Sadly I didn't. It does make my potential Yomi team even better, I already play an underdeveloped version of this team a little, but Shiva's TPA + 6 combo is about my limit of consistent combining at the moment.

Military strategy as derived from Napoleonic techniques influenced leadership in both the north and the south, and played a large hand in informing both army organization, and battlefield theory (for artillery, infantry, and cavalry). George McClellan would eventually lead the Army of the Potomac during the ACW, but before the conflict had started, he had already written and published two influential military works (i.e., manuals) on bayonet tactics, as well as cavalry techniques. The former was directly influenced by French military theory that he had personally translated, and the latter was the result of his time in Europe during the Crimean War as an observer. Both of these works were influenced by European theory (one of them specifically French), and had a huge hand in informing military techniques during the ACW. 

Another highly influential author of military theory leading up to the ACW was Henry Halleck, who would also go on to command Union forces at the highest levels during the ACW. In the mid-1840s, Halleck was sent to Europe to absorb and learn new or evolving techniques, and he came back with lots to say. His 'Elements of Military Arts and Science' bore out a lot of Napoleonic influence, and informed many of the military commanders, north and south, on ""proper"" military techniques during the ACW.  

In sum, the prevailing military theory of the 1860s was heavily influenced by European theory of the 1830s, 40s, and 50s, which was itself a student of the Napoleonic school. Although Halleck and McClellan were both outed as poor field commanders during the war, they nevertheless had an unmistakable influence on the persecution of the war during its early years. This influence was directly tied to European military theory of the early to mid 19th century, which was the product of Napoleon's influence in many ways.

cosa intendi per problemi sociali? è ovvio che tutti sono responsabili per i propri reati. Ma la legge si applica anche agli immigrati. 

La gestione sbagliata dell'immigrazione porta alla creazione dei ghetti, che creano attrito e problemi sociali. Pensavo ti riferissi a questi fenomeni qui. 

Un piano serio pensato a livello europeo potrebbe benissimo riuscire ad integrare gli immigrati senza che si creino ghetti. 

&gt; Ti sei mai chiesto dove vuoi arrivare? 

non capisco, non sono io la classe dirigente italiana/europea

&gt;  Che senso ha prenderne in maniera furibonda e senza criterio?

non ha senso, infatti non è ciò che sostengo. il fatto che le politiche attuali non funzionino non significa che non possano esistere politiche che funzionino. 

&gt; Per quale motivo stai affossando te stesso e l ambiente in cui vivi?

io non sto affossando nessuno, tanto meno sostengo la classe dirigente attuale. Non sono fan di Renzi e non l'ho votato, voterò no al referendum così magari se ne andrà, e Salvini avrà la possibilità di salire al potere. comunque Qualsiasi partito  che vincerà le elezioni avrà un approccio all'immigrazione più restrittivo di quello di Renzi.

The european war was over at the start of barbarossa. 


&gt; Once they turned the Germans around at Stalingrad

Or 6 months earlier when the soviets swatted away the german forces from moscow. Or even months earlier when the germans couldn't take leningrad and decided to siege it instead. And no, it wasn't winter that beat the germans. It was the nearly 20+ million men advantage that the soviets had along with advantages in airplanes, tanks, every conceivable armaments along with home field advantage. 


&gt; The Allied invasion at D-Day only quickened the pace of Germany's defeat.

It didn't quicken anything. D-Day is one of the biggest jokes in military history. Go read about what D-Day was. It was a none-event that we turned into a gigantic farce just to push propaganda. 

Only a few thousand died during the landings ( and most of those were friendly fire or accidents ). 99.99% of the soldiers involved in the landing didn't even fire their weapons. 

""4,414 confirmed dead""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings

So it was slightly more deadly than 9/11.


Growing up, I used to think D-Day was the greatest military event in human history because of all the silly propaganda ( documentary, movies, history books, etc ) that focused on it. Then later on, I read about what the real war was about and it just exposed that history we learn is just propaganda. We are no better than anyone else. We lie, exaggerate, bullshit, etc to make ourselves look better and to diminish others. 

D-Day would have been an enjoyable vacation for the soviets/germans fighting in the eastern front. Sightseeing with hardly any fighting on a nice ferry ride across the english channel.

""Dear male refugees,


I am so sorry!


Almost a year ago I saw the hell from which you have fled. I was not directly in the heart of it, but I visited the people in the refugee camp in southern Kurdistan. I saw old grandmothers who had to take care of too many children without parents. I saw the eyes of these children. Some had not lost their light. But I also saw children whose gaze was empty and traumatising. I showed Arabic characters to around 20 Yazidi children in their maths class and still remember how a small girl started crying only because a chair fell.


I have had a taste of the hell from which you fled. I didn’t see what happened there and didn’t experience the challenging journey you had to make.


I am glad and happy that you managed to get here. That you were able to leave IS and its war behind and did not drown in the Mediterranean.


But I am afraid you are not safe here.


Burning asylum homes, daily attacks on refugees and a brown [tn: used in German as a synonym for Nazi] mob running through the streets. I have always fought against the fact that that’s how it is here.


I wanted an open, friendly Europe. One in which I’d be happy to live and where we would both be safe. Sorry.
I am so unbelievably sorry for both of us.


You, you are not safe, because we live in a racist society. I, I am not safe because we live in a sexist society.


But what I am most sorry about is that the circumstances of the sexist and excessive actions that were done to me will only contribute to the increasing and ever more aggressive racism to which you are exposed.


I promise you I will scream. I will not allow it to go on happening. I will not look on and do nothing and let it happen when racists and concerned citizens say you are the problem.
You are not the problem. You are actually not any problem. You are mostly wonderful people, who have earned the right as much as anyone else to be safe and free. That you for being who you are – and it’s great that you are here.""

1464799772,t3_4m0ygg,ElChrissinho,4,t3_4m0ygg,"Thanks for posting the article, this is pretty fascinating, especially reading the comments. When I was a child, we had a choice of seven fields within 5-15 minutes walking distance to go to play on and everyone played with football, it wasn't hard to get a game together. Usually you wouldn't need to plan it, you could just walk up and find kids having a game and join in. You could go to your local youth side and join in without paying a thing too. I imagine that's the same all over Europe and probably all over South America too. From there, if you're good enough then you get scouted to represent the area and then if you're still good enough you get to play for your county or borough and then the best players will be scouted by professional clubs in that area and offered trials. No money is paid anywhere along the way. Maybe, at worst, some of the youth sides would ask for a few quid a week (literally a few quid, nothing like in the hundreds or thousands) but even then that'd just be to pay to rent better pitches or buy some equipment. 

That's the route that every player in that England side would have taken and probably the same the world over, like I say, certainly in countries like Holland and Germany at the very least.

I never imagined it'd be the same system in the US but the disparity is shocking. Paying thousands of dollars just to play for a club is extraordinary. From the comments, it seems like that won't change until football becomes as popular in the US as it is in other countries, and that's a long, long process, if it ever happens at all. In the meantime, The US needs to be proactive in making sure that no great talent is lost. From the comments, it seems like the clubs don't have proper scouting networks or academy set-ups. Of course, you also can't scout a player if he's not playing for a team, so these sides need to be accessible to all. The question is how to do that? 

The best response would be to have teams that don't have to travel so far and can be in a competitive league, but that's not realistic right now as football isn't ingrained in the culture there and there's no grass-roots level, as such, at least not to the same extent as other countries. Maybe clubs should be required to offer a set amount of free places per year, the professional clubs need to do more to have better relations with these clubs too so they don't miss out. It's a complex issue and there are no easy answers.  ",,0,soccer,4,t5_2qi58,1468740431,,False,0,False,,d3rx3vd

Because Iraq? She voted Yes along with 78 of her colleagues in the Senate. I wish she hadn't but she wasn't the only one duped by bad intelligence from the Bush cabinet.

Because Libya? [A UN coalition including Britain and France, Russia and the Arab League, asked for our help](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/hillary-clinton-libya.html) in preventing a massacre by Gaddafi. Tens of thousands of innocent civilian protesters were being marched on.

&gt; Did the opposition’s Transitional National Council really represent the whole of a deeply divided country, or just one region? What if Colonel Qaddafi quit, fled or was killed — did they have a plan for what came next?

&gt; “She was asking every question you could imagine,” Mr. Jibril recalled.

&gt; Mrs. Clinton was won over. Opposition leaders “said all the right things about supporting democracy and inclusivity and building Libyan institutions, providing some hope that we might be able to pull this off,” said Philip H. Gordon, one of her assistant secretaries. “They gave us what we wanted to hear. And you do want to believe.”

The transitional government, in retrospect, was not able to stand up to the internal strife present in the country. The arming of Islamic extremist rebels by Qatar didn't help.

&gt; It was bad enough that Libya’s elected officials lacked the will to force militias to lay down the arms they already possessed. Now, with Libya veering toward civil war, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — waging a broader war for influence throughout the region — were providing opposing militia commanders with back-channel resupply routes.

It didn't turn out well, at all. We know that. Looking back I'm not sure we could have known. I suppose we could have allowed Gaddafi to continue to hang his opponents in the streets. To turn tanks on his citizens. These were hard choices with uncertain consequences, and the failure was shared by Americans, Europeans, and Arabs.

I trust that the experience was instructional for Mrs. Clinton. I don't think you can conduct global politics without making mistakes. I don't think you can learn without making mistakes. Robert McNamara said something to that effect when reflecting on his experience in WWII and Vietnam.

Mrs. Clinton has, to her credit, negotiated a nuclear arms drawdown with Russia, a ceasefire between Israel and Palestine, and the opening of diplomatic relationships with Myanmar as they sought to move from dictatorship to democracy.

She's not without mud on her face, but at least she has had her feet on the ground. And her views, though sometimes misguided, are founded in reality.

She's not advocating torture. Or for an increase in nuclear proliferation. She's not pushing away our global partners or shrinking our sphere of influence.

&gt; “His advocacy for aggressively waging trade wars is a recipe for economic disaster in a globally connected world,” it argues. “His embrace of the expansive use of torture is inexcusable.” It refers to his “hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric,” which they argue will alienate “partners in the Islamic world making significant contributions to the effort,” while endangering “the safety and constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of American Muslims.”

&gt; His insistence that Mexico will pay for a wall between the two countries “rests on an utter misreading of, and contempt for, our southern neighbor.” And his argument that Japan should pay far more for the basing of American troops there — it already foots much of the bill — “is the sentiment of a racketeer, not the leader of the alliances that have served us so well since World War II.”

Hardly anyone in the foreign policy community trusts Trump, due to his wild swings [""from isolationism to military adventurism within the space of one sentence""](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/gop-foreign-policy-figures-denounce-donald-trumps-worldview.html?version=meter+at+3&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click) which explains his striking lack of credible foreign policy advisors.

In terms of violence, let me tell you a story. Erin Pizzey set up the first shelters for women victims of domestic abuse in Europe. As part of her research she interviewed the women in the shelters about their experience and what would tick their partners off, etc. She was shocked to find that the vast majority (&gt;70%) of domestic violence cases were reciprocal, i.e: both the man and the woman hit each other. When she tried to tell people what she had found, that domestic violence was not in fact a gendered issue, guess what those equality loving feminists did?

They sent her bomb and death threats, and poisoned her family dog. She had to leave the UK.

I bet you've heard the statistic that 1 in 3 women will be a victim of domestic violence in their life time. But I'll also bet you haven't heard that an almost equal number, 1 in 4, men will experience domestic abuse in their life time. Nor will you hear that same sex couples (especially lesbian couples) have disproportionately high levels of DV. 

I guess you haven't heard about the primary agressor laws either, set up to perpetuate the Duluth Model? These laws basically boil down to ""the stronger looking person is the primary agressor"". Couple this logic with the ideas that now every domestic violence cause must lead to an arrest, and you end up with the outrageous statistic that 21% of men who call the police for help in situation END UP BEING THE ONES ARRESTED.

Why have you never heard about this stuff? Because feminists *don't care* about actual equality. Third wave feminism would rather complain about manspreading (gasp! Men want to sit comfortably!) than any actual issue. Despite there being an almost equal number of domestic violence cases against men as there is women, you know how much funding there is for male shelters in most places? Nothing.

To offer the flip side, I'm also in that same demographic reddit appeals to mid to late 20, and voting leave.

I've said this before, but I'm voting leave because the current status quo no longer makes sense, Essentially as Europe grows and incorporates new members and further integration most Europeans will look at the UK with his ""special"" on veto's and favourable finance arrangements with Europe with distain.

For me, the European project is becoming a two speed europe, with France and Germany spearheading the drive towards a federal europe, while the UK likes the ""Lets take it slow, steady, gradual change or no change"".  

The UKs ""identity"" so to speak, for the public is mostly European tolerance, no fully supportive, but more treat the European Project as a curiosity and suspicion.

This annoys the hell out of the countries who want to drive towards a federal and more integrated Europe, and this is the Crux of the issue.  As more members are brought in, and as the drive towards a federal europe is mandated by those who put in the most (bar UK) you'll see voting blocks appear (which is already happening) where the UK's view is ignored, or overridden.  

Our voice inside Europe will shrink because of our mistrust of the European Project, so I see two options.

Leave or Remain.

Now, remain as it currently stands is pretty much keeping the status quo but with EVEN MORE opt outs and special status symbols, which doesn't help the underlying issue I perceive of a two speed europe.

So I'm voting to leave, because it's the only way to change the status quo.  The UK either leaves and becomes successful outside of the EU in which case, we no longer be a drag on the Project and are no longer on the receiving end of disdainful members actions, or the UK fails, and apples to rejoin the European project, but with our citizens being much more aligned with Europeans and with most of our special status and veto's and opt outs gone.



Essentially, Remain is the continuation of the slow death of British influence and status while Leave offers a chance to shake things up, and if it goes tits up, we rejoin with a more aligned national mindset. ",,0,PoliticalDiscussion,10,t5_2sfmf,1468740843,,False,0,False,,d3rxtxh

The closer to the sea the more expensive they are. Check with the owners about internet, in some places it's not that great and can vary a lot in the same town. 

My recommendation is to get a house close to town and to the beach and just get a bike or a scooter (50cc motorcycle) to move around. 

Another option is to rent in one of the mostly english/german towns that are on the coast. You can hardly call it Spain, but's it's easy if you don't know Spanish.

Also being on the peninsula makes it easier to take a quick trip to any other Spanish or European city. Or just rent a car and follow the coast. I will absolutely recommend this if you go to cadiz or almeria, they are full of small beaches and little towns that have a lot of charm. 

For the two month rent thing I'd just call the listing and ask. They may have you leave a deposit or something or the sort.

When you're traveling, it is stupid easy to talk to people and make friends b/c everyone is away from home surrounded by new things to do and see. Some people will be great, others will be jerks, same thing as life at home. The advantage is that every time you change hostels you hit the reset button and you get to start over and apply what you learned last time. 

Start out just talking to people and finding common ground, be aware of your personal tics(interrupting people, insecurities, etc...) and from there you can build on small talk until they become someone you can make plans with(hit the bars or go to a museum). A female should exercise the usual cautions, but its completely safe if you're  smart about it. 

Most importantly whether you're traveling or at home, you just have to keep putting yourself out there and learn from your mistakes. I recognize that not everyone can just jet off to travel, but the experiences are more than worth any financial hardship, and the rinse and repeat nature of meeting people abroad just speeds up the acquisition of inter-personal skills.

Government wise, we only have two pro-NATO parties, one major and one small. Parliamentary system here works in a way that requires at least three major parties, or two major and many small ones to form a majority government. It would be impossible to reach majority just to put the issues to the parliament even in the current political climate of fear mongering that went on for last two years, much less actually get the parliament to vote for it.

And then there's the whole issue of the fact that government isn't actually responsible for foreign policy or military in this country. President is. Foreign minister works as a subordinate of president when it comes to actual foreign policy, through in practice they work in tandem due to issues caused by EU crossing over foreign and domestic policy.

This sort of ""base"" would only be possible through back door deals, which would be distinctly undemocratic and arguably unconstitutional. We have a history of those as I note above (German troops in preparation for Barbarossa). We had to eject those eventually in the end of world war 2 by means of war. So there's plenty of precedent.

&gt; More worrying than a few idiots shouting into the void is the way in which this mod reflects the views of its creator and how it's being used to promote those views. In both versions of the 'European Phenotypes and Names' mod, the description has pointed towards the creator's YouTube channel, encouraging players to check it out.
Alongside a handful of videos about the mod and its recent controversy, his channel also contains a video entitled 'An Argument for the Continued Existence of Europeans'. In this rambling video essay, the mod's creator makes the case that European culture is about something more, ""something deeper"", than just ideas. It's unclear what he's referring to at first, but inevitably it turns out he's talking about gene pools

the mod actively directs you to the youtube page and that would have been on  page before jump prethe scores of videos about stellaris stuff.

That said, its an interesting idea. When I think of any group that is not allowed to be criticized in any society, I absolutely cannot think of any that isn't SOMEHOW linked to the regime in power.

The USA is somehow unique in this respect because of its freedom of speech philosophy is atypical compared to other nations with freedom of speech. Still you will find that criticizing groups which hold power, will lead to problems for that individual. For example, serious criticism of the military-industrial complex, firearms &amp; armaments industry, Oil&amp;Gas industry, AIPAC/Israeli lobby (THE most influential foreign policy lobby in the USA), etc...

Outside the USA, in Europe for instance, it is even easier to make that example since freedom of speech is totally different there. In downright authoritarian countries, that is even more apparent (China, Syrian regime, Russia, etc etc).

Even though the person delivering the hate speech may not be violent or have any violent intentions, there may be others who hear/read the hate speech and use it as motivation or inspiration to commit a violent act against the group which is being targeted by the hate speech.

The other reason why many countries (although not the US) ban hate speech is that it targets and victimizes broad groups of people, based solely on group association or factors (e.g. age, sex, race/ethnicity, etc.) which the members of the group often cannot control or change.

It's also worth noting that the notion of ""freedom"" is often different in the US as compared to other Western nations.

In the US, ""freedom"" is often treated as right to say whatever you want regardless of how offensive or hateful it might be.

In other Western countries like Canada, the UK, and many European nations, there is a different notion of ""freedom"" which is more about ""freedom from worry"".

In other words, people from these countries often see freedom from the perspective of ""freedom of not having to worry about people attacking me with hate speech"", ""freedom of not having to worry about expensive medical bills"", etc. In other words, it's about the freedom to live your life comfortably without having to unduly suffer.",,0,explainlikeimfive,1,t5_2sokd,1468741685,,False,0,False,,d3rzmab

Capital crimes can run in the millions, not to mention the economic failures that come from people feeling unsafe.

Homeless people are mostly just insane, which in most cases means they have above average intelligence, but they are insane due to a brain malformation. Taking care of them costs around 20.000 € per month, so mathematically it all works out.

Until human rights are abolished for the migrants, and a lethal boarder, alla iron curtain is erected this is the smartest thing you can do. This isn't like migrants from central America, only genocide will stop this, as genocide began it. Germany is playing a hefty, but sane game. We can't litter a boarder with thousands of corpses, it's a matter of honor, and no one currently has the army, and the power to do so.

(Soon.)

The whole give them cash to fuck off approach doesn't work, because then they go home, and more come to get that paper. They have to be housed until completion, and returned to their homelands impoverished so their fallen in starving faces become monuments as to why you shouldn't go to Europe.

So this isn't ritual suicide by any means, this is what happens, if you don't establish a boarder with a wall, mines, a group of radicalized guards who will shoot women to kill in the moonlight, and some automated guns that mow down everything from men, to women, to children. My father was there, and he  is still greatful he didn't have to kill like so many others.

In eastern Germany where hundreds of thousands longed to live in the country that was living it up on their cheap exports (western Germany economic miracle lol), only death deterred people from their dreams.

I hope this explains the situation, and why Germany is doing this. It's just that Angela Merkel doesn't want to seem like she is contemplating genocide, and uses /pol as a political advisory board, which goes against the sensitivities of a civilized nation.

plz read the fact is below :- 

By the year 1932, actor-director Himanshu Rai was back in India after having been exposed to filmmaking in Europe. His ambition was to bring this new cultural phenomenon to the Indian audiences. Himanshu Rai had to struggle a lot to get this idea off the ground, primarily because of the money involved. He was meeting many people and trying to convince them about the magic of cinema but the effort was proving rather unsuccessful. He had the complete support of people such as F.E Dinshaw, Sir Feroze Sethna among others but they could not help him when it came to the crucial aspect of financing. Filmmakers in India had ideas and no money.

In the 30's, the movie business was treated as a 'dirty business'. People would talk about movies, but many wouldn't even consider going to watch one. This would be similar to people talking about gold prices but seldom buying it. Even though movies did make people curious, its reputation as a professional field was considered immoral. There seemed to be a lack of respect for the profession because it was considered the domain of undesirable sections of the then Indian society. Women didn’t want to act in films and only women of ‘bad repute’ (read prostitutes) acted in female roles. Otherwise men themselves played female roles. Due to this lack of respect and understanding for the profession, financiers during those times would face an impossible challenge when it came to getting returns on their investment.

It was during this hunt for financiers that Himanshu Rai came in contact with Abhimanyu Prasad Singh, a close friend of Seth Badriprasad Dube, who was a well known financier in other fields. Seth Badriprasad refused to finance Himanshu Rai due to the ‘dirty’ background of the profession. Abhimanyu spoke next to Seth Badri Prasad's son Rajnarayan Dube. He was a young and dynamic businessman who operated a successful company called Dube Industries, which he had founded in 1929. Rajnarayan Dube was born on 10th October 1910 at Kalighat in then Calcutta was an ardent devotee of Maa Kali. He was influenced by the power of art and creativity at a young age. Both men met at the Taj Mumbai Hotel in Colaba and discussed an initial investment amount of Rs.25 lakh. However, Himanshu Rai couldn't not convince Rajnarayan Dube to invest the amount because of the dismal returns on investment that the Indian movie industry offered. At this point, it would seem that Bombay Talkies would never come to be, but things have a way of working out in unexpected ways.

A few months passed by and Himanshu Rai had grown increasingly despondent because it was becoming impossible to raise investment for his movie company. In his depression, the man attempted suicide but was unsuccessful. Rajnarayan Dube got wind of this through Abhimanyu Prasad Singh and wondered about this man, one who so completely and wholeheartedly believed in the power of cinema and talking pictures that he did not see it fit to continue living if he couldn't follow his dreams. Rajnarayan Dube decided that Himanshu Rai was onto something here and finalized the investment with him soon after. In doing this, Rajnarayan Dube went deliberately against the advice of his father, Seth Badriprasad Dube, who felt that this would not be a good investment choice. In doing this, Rajnarayan Dube gave birth to the Indian Film Industry, which has now gone on to become a huge cultural and financial force in the country.

On 22ndJune, 1934, Bombay Talkies began operations with Himanshu Rai, Devika Rani and Rajnarayan Dube along with other personalities like F.E Dinshaw, Sir Feroze Sethna and Niranjan Pal . The movie company was named by Rajnarayan Dube's mother, Shrimati Gayatri Devi. Though Light of Asia was a concept which Himanshu Rai built during his days in Europe, the first film to come out of the stables was Karma, which launched the same year. It was followed by Jawani ki Hawa, Achhut Kanya and Jeevan Naiya. The last two are nw considered classics The movie company operated along a principle of keeping the creative aspects and business aspects separate. Rajnarayan Dube would look into the business end of things and both Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani would immerse themselves in the creative pursuit. This approach gave rise to some of the most technically impressive films seen this side of the planet. The technical prowess was due to the movie studio employing German and other European technicians, prominent among them being Franz Osten.

Bombay Talkies was single handedly responsible of making the careers of some of the leading talent in the golden age of Indian cinema. Besides Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani, the company gave the world Ashok Kumar (who initially was a lab assistant in the company but when Himanshu Rai got sick due to illness he gave Ashok Kumar a chance to work onscreen), Leela Chitnis, Madhubala (who began as a child artist and was given her stage name by Rajnarayan Dube himself), Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Mehmood, Kishore Kumar, Kamal Amrohi, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Sashadhar Mukherjee ( the first manager of the company), Lata Mangeshkar, Satyajit Ray, Amiya Chakravarti, SD Burman, Manna Dey, Saraswati Devi (who was the first woman music director in Asia), and many more. All in all, Bombay Talkies gave the world more than 280 of the most talented movie professionals in the last century.

While Himanshu Rai's original vision for a movie production house sowed the seeds for the formation of Indian cinema as an industry, Rajnarayan Dube single-handedly architected the business angle of the entire industry which was yet to come. He supported various new theatres such as BN Sircar's New Theatres in Calcutta, V Shantaram's Prabhat Pictures, Homi Wadia's Wadia Movietone, Sohrab Modi's Minerva Movietone, LV Prasad's Prasad Labs and Pictures (Prasad was an ex-technician from Bombay Talkies), SM Vasan's Gemini Pictures and Mehboob Khan's theatres. Rajnarayan Dube financed these fledgling companies and made them stronger. In essence, he build the entire movie ecosystem in the country. Everyone whom Rajnarayan Dube supported went to on build a name for themselves in the industry.

Also, the artists that had worked in 'Bombay Talkies', many have been felicitated by India's most respected award, “Dadasaheb Phalke Award” by The President Of India. Devika Rani, one of the founder of Bombay talkies was the first recipient of the award by the President in 1969, later in 1977 Nitin Bose, in 1980 Paidi Jairaj,in 1987 Raj Kapoor, Ashok Kumar in 1989 , in 1997 Kavi Pradeep,in 1990 Lata Mangeshkar, Dilip Kumar in 1995, in 1997 Kavi Pradeep, and in 2013 Pran were also awarded.

Rajnarayan Dube had a big vision for Indian Cinema. He wanted Indian filmmaking to be a respectable profession. He thus stipulated that Bombay Talkies would only hire graduates. He hoped this move would legitimize the Indian film industry of the thirties and forties, and it certainly did. Besides this, Rajnarayan Dube also wanted the Indian film industry to be inclusive of Indians from all states and sectors of life. Even though the movie company worked with European technicians, Rajnarayan Dube would bring on Indian technicians and make sure that they learnt the art of moviemaking. He also brought a lot of Indian writers onboard so that movies could have an Indian cultural sensitivity and thus could appeal to a large amount of people. This move gave rise to a whole new Indian profession, movie making! This seemed to be a good move in the light of circumstances that were yet to arrive.

During one scene in the movie Karma, there was a minute long kissing scene between Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani onscreen. This caused quite a stir in Indian society then. Rajnarayan Dube was furious about him not being informed about this scene. Himanshu Rai, reportedly held his ears' and said that it would not happen again. Rajnarayan Dube, however, resolved to screen all films by himself before they could be released. He was a Brahman and a conservative and strictly discouraged smoking, drinking and other vices in the studio premises. He was also a very caring employer for those pioneering people who worked at Bombay Talkies. He made sure that Education, Rent, Food and other daily necessities were provided free of cost to employees of Bombay Talkies. He also championed the rights of the movie industry by setting up Unions and Associations such as IMPA (of which Bombay Talkies was the first member). He also helped grow the regional film industry. He staunchly supported Marathi, Hindi, Bengali and Southern cinema. If it wasn't for Rajnarayan Dube, the Indian movie industry would have resembled other Southeast Asian movie industries from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Bollywood today is big enough to compete with Hollywood movies.",,0,india,0,t5_2qh1q,1468742085,,False,0,False,,d3s0gve

É mais que óbvio, se vires o comentário ao qual eu tinha respondido, que eu não defendo um regime comunista mas sim um regime nacionalista meritocrático. Até te explico porquê.

O comunismo e o capitalismo são dois lados da mesma moeda, ambos contêm uma inerente desigualdade. No caso do comunismo, é o facto de todos serem recompensados de igual modo. Dizer que tanto um doutor como um camponês merecem receber o mesmo é uma injustiça para com o doutor, porque o que ele faz tem mais mérito. Por outro lado, o capitalismo recompensa mais o mérito, mas tem o problema do nepotismo e do privilégio. Não são dadas as mesmas oportunidades a todos, uns são lebres e outros tartarugas

Num regime nacionalista meritocrático, todos começariam do mesmo ponto de partida e as recompensas seriam dadas de acordo com o mérito de cada um

A razão pela qual eu uso o termo 'nacionalista' é porque estou farto de ver parasitas a receber da segurança social e a contribuírem zero para a nossa sociedade (excepto em criminalidade). Isso iria acabar. Depois também há o facto de eu achar que o multiculturalismo deveria ser global e não nacional, isto é, cada cultura no seu país em vez de diluída por tudo o que é sítio

EDIT: já agora aproveito e dou um exemplo da hipocrisia dos globalistas/multiculturalistas:

3. Completely disregards country taxes, fees and other costs.

Mass shootings in the US right now are extremely, **extremely** common. A single shooting in any first world European country is a national tragedy and talked about for weeks afterwards. A shooting in the USA is just today's shooting, there'll be another one tomorrow and after that. You might have no point of reference with other (read: civilised) countries, but the rate at which your citizens are shooting each other is ridiculous.

Your cancer treatment statement is so unbiased it's ridiculous. There's very little someone can do, lifestyle wise, to increase or decrease their chance of getting cancer. My aunt who was vegetarian all her life and lived out in the country-let's just say she lived the healthiest life of anyone I've ever known. She died of cancer at age 57 after extensive treatment which allowed her to live 7 years longer than she would've if she lived in that shithole you people call a country.

&gt;Though there are over 7,000 living human languages, only a dozen of them actually matter.

Off to a great start. Because obviously the *primary* way people communicate with each other doesn't matter.

&gt;holdovers from cultures that should have become extinct generations ago.

Bordering on racism. Wonderful. All this in the first two sentences.

&gt;Take Taiwanese for example. The Taiwanese were the indigenous people Chiang Kai-shek almost wiped out to create modern Taiwan. Like Chinese, their language has different meanings depending on the tone it’s said in. “RIce” is different than “riCE”  is different than “rICe” and so on.

Well… this demonstrates such a fundamental non-understanding of how tones work it's kind of sad. The notation for whatever the author is trying to say is terrible -- but it looks like he's trying to indicate stress? In which case that would be *very* wrong, because that's not how tones work.

&gt;where Chinese has four tones per word

Mandarin has four. Dialects like Cantonese have a lot more.

&gt;Now I have to do tongue exercises when I wake up just so I can say, “GOod morNING.”

Stress again.

&gt;Another reason Taiwanese is typical of the languages we refuse to care about is the word they chose for cat: “Meow.” Call me a Western chauvinist but if your naming animals after the sounds they make, you’re not really cut out for the modern world.

[Yeah, fuck languages that have onomatopoeic words for animals!](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60331/12-animals-named-after-noises-they-make)

^Sorry ^for ^MentalFloss ^but ^I ^need ^to ^prove ^a ^point

**Korean:**

&gt;Koreans had the smarts to trash the whole swishy characters thing and convert their type into a very efficient series of circles and squares that requires even less characters than the phenomenally awesome English.

K.

&gt;Handy, but it’s still Asian and sounds like all the other ones.

Korean definitely doesn't sound like ""all the other ones"", it sounds like Korean.

**Mandarin:**

&gt;To get each tone correct, you need to curl your toes and tense your stomach muscles with your eyes squinted like you’re throwing a golf ball into a teacup forty miles away.

I can guarantee you if it's that hard to do tones for you, it's not the fault of the 960 million native speakers for making the language suck… or something.

**Cantonese:**

&gt;Can you imagine being nagged in this language? It sounds like a turkey being strangled to death. No wonder Chinese workers barely ever come home.

Pretty sure being nagged is the annoying thing, not Cantonese.

&gt;Appears to be more advanced only because Japan is more advanced but I’m sorry—women sound stupid when they speak Japanese and the men always sound grumpy.

Ah, here's the ""my opinion is infallible fact"" thing again.

***Middle Eastern:***

&gt;I guess I should know more than nothing about Middle Eastern languages before summing up the entire globe, but all I know is

Great start.

&gt;my ears bleed every time an Israeli or an Arab speaks. Could they have more phlegm in their throat please?

I want to think this is just a really shitty attempt at humor.

***Germanic/Eastern European:***

Pretty bad header name, but anyway.

&gt; No wonder Russians don’t have stand-up comedy. That language sounds like a guy trying to eat his teeth. The fact that Russia has some of the greatest writers in the world using such an ugly language is a testament to how horrible it is to be outside in Russia.

I don't really get this one, but anyway here's the objective fact problem again.

**German:**

&gt;It’s efficient as hell

I'm pretty sure he just got that because he thinks Germans are efficient. Anyway, I'm going to come back to this in a bit.

&gt;it’s whom English has to thank for being so darn convenient

Oh my god. The *only* thing that could have made this article badling-ier is saying that English came from German. It's a step above ""English came from Latin"", though, so… yay?

&gt;What other language could come up with a word for “the dark humor associated with other people suffering” (Schadenfreude)

I don't know. Any language that allows on-the-fly word compounding?

**English:**

&gt;I’m obviously a little biased here but have you ever heard a more flexible and succinct language in your life?

Well… languages like most dialects of Chinese are objectively more succinct. Flexible isn't an objective term, though, so I can't halp you there Gav.

&gt;It takes about a week to learn

…Maybe if you're a native Scots speaker who learned English as a child, forgot it, and then moved to an immersive English-speaking place, sure.

&gt;Unfortunately, utilitarianism tends to be a little drab (check communist dictator uniforms).

What do communist dictator uniforms have to do with… like, anything?

***East Indian:***

**Urdu:**

&gt;Basically a party in your mouth where everyone is invited. It sounds like a chili bubbling over a xylophone and it’s so fun to speak, I’m surprised there aren’t more Indian rappers.

There are Indian rappers. Also, I believe the majority of Urdu speakers are in Pakistan (I'm not 100% on that, though), so a better term would be Hindustani if you're talking about both.

Not that this guy cares, though.

**Scandinavian/Icelandic:**

&gt;These languages are almost as hard to learn as Chinese but are even harder on the ears so why bother?

And this is where I go back to the German thing.

German and Icelandic have practically the same grammar. The major difference is that Icelandic has fewer speakers, I guess, and a phonemic inventory closer to English (it's the only other Germanic language that kept /θ/ and /ð/).

Also, they're *way* easier to learn than Chinese. They're all Germanic languages FFS, unless he's *also* including Finnish, which I hope he isn't.

***Latin:***

**Portuguese:**

&gt;The most hideous language in all of Europe. Including it in the Romance Languages is like calling rape romantic.

Holy shit. Did Portuguese kill this guy's mother or something?

**Spanish:**

&gt;we have Puerto Ricans here and they are to the Spanish language what Glaswegians are to English and the Québécois are to French

Funny.

**French:**

&gt;There are so many ludicrous rules and masculine and feminine words

Going back to it again.

Yeah! Except German, which is efficient as hell, has 3 genders and retains Germanic strong verbs! But two genders with fewer irregular verbs? Ludicrous, I say!

&gt; The French like to pretend there’s a method to their madness but whenever you ask one of them how a certain sentence is said correctly, they close their eyes and say it silently to see if it sounds right. Know what that means? The only way to understand the language is to memorize it.

So apparently French people have memorized the entirety of their language in a way English speakers don't. *Of course* they're going to repeat stuff to see if it ""sounds right"". Duh.

&gt;I was told it’s just fancy English with “er” at the end.

Well, that's what a lot of infinitives end in, so…

&gt;French is often described as the language of love, but it is surprisingly limited when it comes to discussing the subject. “Je t’aime” could mean “I like you” or “I love you.”

Cuz context isn't a thing.

***Greek:***

&gt;Known by so few people they invented the saying, “It’s all Greek to me.”

Pretty sure the Greek didn't invent a saying about how they couldn't understand their native language. They're not the French, after all.

**And back to Latin again… or something:**

&gt;Italian is the most beautiful living language there is.

Second, of course, only to the harmonious and æsthetically pleasing Proto-ULTRAFRANSKRIT.

&gt;Look at the phrase “Bella figura.” It doesn’t just mean “beautiful figure.” It means dressing sharp, feeling good, behaving properly, and just basically being amazing.

TIL that idioms are.

&gt;You cannot spend time in Italy and not start picking up the language.

Well… for this guy I think it just might be possible.

&gt;Like all Latin languages, it may be a little low on logic

Kudos in keeping your MGTOW side quiet, most people will not understand and may even take personal offence to your world view, it's happened to me personally, so keep it as secret as you desire.

I am in the UK too and things seem to be a bit more sane this side of the pond, but whether they stay that way after the EU referendum who knows.

On to your motivation or lack thereof, it is natural to feel down after reality has punched you square in the jaw and kicked you in the ribs for good measure, so don't feel guilty about feeling despondent. I too felt that way after taking my red pill. It is a bitter taste indeed.

However, take stock of your situation. You are only 16 with your whole life ahead of you. Think yourself lucky that you have 'seen the light' this early on and can use that knowledge to help you grow as a man.

No man can go wrong with self-improvement in my humble opinion. Pick up hobbies that will give you skills or build on ones you already have, learn a language, run, read, cycle, swim, lift weights, anything you can pour your energy into. Any idea what career field you want to head into? It will be great to start researching into different areas that may interest you so start talking and building up a network of contacts.

Happiness is a state of mind, and you have to make yours, so find what makes you happy and content and surround yourself with it!

For example, breasts don't magically appear on a girl's 18th birthday. I've known 14 year olds with a bigger rack than many a 40 year old. It is not unnatural to be attracted to that. Unlawful to act on: yes. Unethical to act on: sure. Unnatural: no. Being attracted to little pre-pubescent children however is unnatural. They have no secondary sexual characteristics, so there's nothing there that we're wired to find attractive.  

Secondly, you're right that they are not capable of consenting --in the US. In large parts of Europe, they are. Europe is not a backwards, barbaric place, is it? This just shows you how arbitrary these limits are. Even within the US, there is a lot of difference: most states actually have 16 as the age of consent. A few have 17 and only a handful have 18 as the age of consent. So when you're saying they are not capable of consenting, you have to add ""depending on where you live"" because the law works differently everywhere.  

Thirdly, even if the law says 16 is the age of consent, that doesn't mean a 14 year old can't have consensual sex. It happens all the time. Age of consent is 16 in my country, yet when I was in high school, lots of teens that I knew who were 14 or 15 years old were having sex. They were not raped or forced, they were having consensual sex --even if the law said they couldn't.

Yes, workers can do that. Those are called co-ops. [Here's a sort of goofy looking infographic about them.](http://i.imgur.com/B00tDRm.jpg) [You also might be interested in learning about the Mondragon Corporation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) Co-ops and communes are the closest thing you'll get to socialism inside of the capitalist system. Some socialists have a bit of an adversity to this idea though. Here is a quote from Rosa Luxemburg on co-ops.

&gt;Producers’ co-operatives can survive within capitalist economy only if they manage to suppress, by means of some detour, the capitalist controlled contradictions between the mode of production and the mode of exchange. And they can accomplish this only by removing themselves artificially from the influence of the laws of free competition. And they can succeed in doing the last only when they assure themselves beforehand of a constant circle of consumers, that is, when they assure themselves of a constant market.[...]
If it is true that the possibilities of existence of producers’ co-operatives within capitalism are bound up with the possibilities of existence of consumers’ co-operatives, then the scope of the former is limited, in the most favourable of cases, to the small local market and to the manufacture of articles serving immediate needs, especially food products. Consumers’ and therefore producers’ co-operatives, are excluded from the most important branches of capital production – the textile, mining, metallurgical and petroleum industries, machine construction, locomotive and ship-building. For this reason alone (forgetting for the moment their hybrid character), co-operatives in the field of production cannot be seriously considered as the instrument of a general social transformation. [...]
Within the framework of present society, producers’ co-operatives are limited to the role of simple annexes to consumers’ co-operatives. It appears, therefore, that the latter must be the beginning of the proposed social change. But this way the expected reform of society by means of co-operatives ceases to be an offensive against capitalist production. That is, it ceases to be an attack against the principal bases of capitalist economy. It becomes, instead, a struggle against commercial capital, especially small and middle-sized commercial capital. It becomes an attack made on the twigs of the capitalist tree.

&gt;If a business got big enough, wouldn't the workers eventually have to choose representatives to oversee different aspects of the company? 

[Here is a chart showing how things were structured in the anarchist controlled territories in Spain during the Spanish Civil War](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/CNT_structure.png) After coming to a consensus on their own, workers could send delegates to higher councils which would represent them. At first, this might sound like it could easily revert back to statism or capitalism but the delegates didn't actually hold power over the workers they represented. These committees were for overseeing routine administrative duties such as resource allocation and communicating with distant allies. Delegates could have their position revoked at any time. Think of it as being like me asking you if you could pick up my pencil off the floor. You walk over, pick it up, and hand it to me. Does this give you power over me? No. What if you don't pick it up? I can ask someone else to do it or get off my lazy ass and do it myself. If a delegate declared themself the owner of a factory or the ruler of a city, their claims would be laughed at, just as someone proclaiming themself king of the United States would be. The people would just mock them and send someone else to do the job. 

Here is a quote from George Orwell describing his experiences in the anarchist controlled regions of Spain

&gt;""I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragón one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilised life– snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.– had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master.""",Anarchist Communist,0,Libertarian,1,t5_2qh63,1468742892,,False,0,False,,d3s26hq

There was a guy who runs a Swedish blogg about economy and general politics and he looked at the numbers and found that the popularity of SD follows the flow of immigrants. Once a commune starts getting a bunch of refugees/immigrants then the share of people voting for SD increases proportionally.

So is kind of like this. In the town were I grew up the social democrats have always been the most popular party and we haven't really seen any refugees since the 90s when a bunch of families from the Balkans were placed in our little town. Now we've been getting a bunch of refugees and it is starting to become more and more of a problem and as the problems become self evident to everyone who honestly looks at the situation then the SD increases in popularity. I think most people need to see the problems of ""multiculturalism"" first hand before they are willing to vote for the SD and if you go back and look they are the only party that is actually growing in the polls.

Oh don't worry peace and tranquility will come again. People make the mistake of thinking that this moment that we live in right now is the moment that will last forever.

If someone could go back to the 5th century and talk to the Italians they would probably think that the fall of Rome meant that Italy would be forever ravaged by barbarians and would never be a relevant state again but just a few centuries later Italy was the cultural and scientific center of Europe again and this started what we now call the Rennaissance. I'm pretty sure that what we're seeing right now is simply just another ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" and it will not be fun and we might not like it but eventually things will settle down again.

If you look at the stay campaign. How much information do you see only related to the economy (yeah basically all of it). However they cannot actually predict what will happen. If you push all the bullshit about he economy out of the way for the stay / leave argument. You will realise that the stay campaign doesn't actually have any thing else to campaign with. But the leave campaign has a massive amount about democracy and the problems that Europe actually creates and that is what this vote is actually about. Do you want to be ruled by Europe by people who create laws who are not elected?

Here is a few interesting facts....

1. The people elected to the eu parliament (these the the guys we vote for). Do not actually have the power to propose or repel new laws in the eu. This is the only parliament in the world that does not have this sort of power. The eu commission is actually what creates the laws. Which is done behind closed doors by people who are appointed and often the people who are appointed are people who are actually de-selected by are democratic process by people not voting for them. They just happens to be qualified for the job.

2. Centralisation of power is never a good thing. When things become centralised they often make decisions that suit the major areas and often make a bad decision for other smaller areas like N.I.

3. In order for democracy to work it has to be transparent to the people. This means the ""people"" have to have a basic understanding of how to interact with their mp and how the ""system"" works. I think we can safely say that nobody actually understands how the eu works because its too damm complex. Do you know that the eu has 4 presidents? Can you name them? Can you name at least 12 eu parliament members? Can you name anyone in the eu commission?

4. If we leave we are going to take a hit to the economy. This is completely true. We will take a hit but that is because Europe basically provides funding to support broken economic models and bad industries. So when you leave this support is lost and it take a while for the economy to re-configure its self. However because of less regulation and red tape. It is more than likely to develop a much better economy in the long run after 3-5 years.

5. We do not require a trade agreements to actually trade with Europe after we leave. When a country exports something it simply has to obey the laws of the country it is exporting to. This is what we currently do with lots of other countries around the world. The only difference here is that if we leave we don't have to pay the damn eu tax'es when we export stuff to other countries.

6. Our economy needs migrants in order to function at the minute. That is because people are having less kids than they used to so we need skilled people to do the jobs. After you leave you get to cherry pick the people you want instead of basically bring in a massive random selection like we are currently doing and only a fraction are actually useful. There are lots of other counties in the world that use this sort of system and it works really well for them.

The fact that the next Messi could walk into D.C. United's academy and they would ask his parents for a check rather than trying to develop him is ludicrous. 

I think part of the problem is with the college draft system, clubs get free talent coming in every single year so they have less incentive to invest in their academies.

##America issues a travel alert covering Europe

YESTERDAY, the United States issued a travel alert aimed at those thinking of visiting Europe, warning them of the risk of potential terrorist attacks “throughout” the continent. On the face of it this seems odd. No one denies that the threat of terrorism this side of the pond is real. France is still operating under a state of emergency following the attacks in Paris earlier this year. It will soon host the European football championship, the world’s third-biggest sporting event after the World Cup and the Olympics. Few doubt that terror groups have a beady eye on the event—least of all France itself, which is deploying 90,000 police, soldiers and security guards to watch over the tournament.

It seems reasonable, therefore, for the State Department to point out such specific concerns. But how useful is it to apply an alert to an entire continent? Shamila Chaudhary, a counter-terrorism expert and former official with the Obama administration, told the BBC that terrorism in Europe was now “normalised”. Europeans, she said, “have been in denial about their domestic terrorism.” But Europe is a large and diverse place. The risks of being caught in a terrorist incident are miniscule. It seems as bizarre to issue an alert for Europe as it would be for all of Asia or Africa (or indeed the United States).

Travel “alerts” do not advise people to reconsider whether to travel in the first place—that is the job of the State Department’s more strident travel “warnings”. And according to John Kirby, a government official, the current guidance, which is an extension of that issued after the attacks on Brussels in March, is not based on specific intelligence. But Gulliver is left with a feeling of bemusement that a visit to Europe is now akin to an act of bravery. 

What does this mean for business travellers? Probably little more than some extra (and pointless) security training for those intrepid enough to visit the continent. As we have mentioned before on this blog, road warriors are often more measured about the threats they face overseas than casual travellers. Most can do the maths and thus reassure themselves about the slim chance of getting mixed up in anything nasty. And in any case, as we also pointed out, underpinning any bravado is the simple fact that people do what their job expects.

But companies themselves are becoming more concerned. According to research by American Express Global Business Travel (GBT), a corporate-travel firm, over the past two years the safety of employees has overtaken cost to become organisations’ biggest concern when organising work trips. And since the Paris attacks, says Elyes Mrad, the head of the firm in Europe, requests for proposals are now more likely to focus on questions specifically related to terrorism. Twenty-four per cent of companies now provide travellers with security training before their trip, reckons GBT.

Firms have a duty to take warnings from government seriously, says Mr Mrad, but equally it must be remembered that the guidance coming from officials is generic, aimed more at the general traveller than battle-hardened businessman. So firms must be savvy enough to undertake their own risk assessments without necessarily being swayed by the official line. Two weeks after the Paris attacks, Mr Mrad decided to move a team meeting from Brussels to the French capital to allow staff to show solidarity and to prove that, as far as is possible, business life would continue as normal. That seems like a more sensible approach.",New Jersey,0,europe,1,t5_2qh4j,1468743211,FINL,False,0,False,,d3s2uve

Bill Clinton, as president, hired &amp; appointed an unprecedented # of women to various positions in his Cabinet (1st woman as Secretary of State) as well as judgeships and throughout his administration.  However, the US has never seen a woman elected as head of state.  Even though such a '*first*' is pretty old news in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, &amp; Turkey.

&gt;""*..people's beliefs and attitudes toward equality are dependent on the dominant religion of the area?*""

Nope.  Religion or *religiousness* could be -a- factor among many.  But never exclusively.  There's more to a culture than just religion; and, indeed, major world religions like Islam span many cultures and practically depend on adapting appropriately.

&gt;""*The United States and most of Europe have had secular governments for several centuries.*""

Mmhhmm...depends on what you mean.  Secularism, as a value, is certainly on the rise in the West.  But that doesn't really exclude something like religion from the values that inform its societies.

Likewise, the most powerful leadership in most Muslim countries is not even disposed toward what's actually religious authority.  Like, the head of Pakistan's army isn't a religious leader, right?  He's a military man by training, a general.  Just like Saudi Arabia's King...is a monarch.  And his authority is absolute, above and beyond any expressly religious authority.

&gt;""*The whole concept of human rights was invented by these western countries.*""

But not developed in some sort of social &amp; historical vacuum.  Stuff like the 10 Commandments or Code of Hammurabi is well-prior in terms the foundation of modern law.

I learned Mexican Spanish and the question I always got was ""¿Por qué hablás como narco?"" They tend not to like Mexican or Argentinean accents, but they won't do more than laugh at you good-naturedly. Paraguayan Spanish isn't hard to pick up. Guaraní is the tough one. I learned Guaraní because of the nature of my work (volunteer at a foster home), but if you learn a few words and get to know the culture, people will love you and accept you easily.

I felt safe in most of the places I went, but at the same time, you have to know which places to stay out of. Just be smart about where you go at night and take taxis (super cheap) and you should be fine. The night life in Asunción is great. CDE, not amazing. There's a ton of stuff to do in CDE during the day and the city kind of shuts down at night, you 'd want to go across the border to Brazil if you wanted to go out.

You can get pretty much everything you're used to in local grocery stores, although imported stuff is pretty expensive. On the bright side, meat, wine, and fruit are both ludicrously cheap due to free trade laws with Brazil and Argentina. I'd definitely recommend checking out an open-air market while you're there, such as Mercado 4 in Asunción or Centro in CDE. You can find a lot of cool stuff there.

The quality of living isn't quite as high as in Europe or the US, but if you make a comparable salary to what a middle-class worker would make there, you can live like a king. Housing and food are both cheap, so you can quite easily get something that's pretty high quality.

I disagree. There are many lines that Trump has crossed that I think put his rhetoric over the line into extremist territory. Things like a religious test for immigrants, or a new border force tasked with rounding up and forcibly deporting millions of people, can only be classified as fringe proposals, even if they enjoy broad support.

Context does matter - these views are not extremist when taken relative to the beliefs of American conservatives today. However, if you broaden the context to _all_ Americans, and include historical context going back to the Gingrich era, the views are certainly extremist.

In regards to Bernie, I believe similarly that, taken only in the context of American politics, he certainly is extremist.

Perhaps its worth trying a year or two at another place, apply for a higher up position, and a pay rise? THEN maybe if it doesnt work, try London. 

You will need savings to come to London and start up - say 3 months of paying yourself. You will also need to put down a deposit to rent a flat... thats 6-8 weeks upfront... could be £1200-1500. So you might need something like £5k in the bank before you even consider the move :S

Your friend working in the pawn shop... im not sure where he is living, but it must be far away out of London as anyone on minimum wage (i.e. about £800 p/m after tax?) can not afford a single room flat (£700 pm) and food! They would need to get some income support benefits, and im not sure what EU country you are coming from but I heard there are some new regulations stating that you can not get benefits until working for a few months now (might only apply to Romania / Bulgaria.. im not sure).

About London - theres a lot going on here but jobs are found through you being recommended. By law, yes you can apply to any job and your CV or reel might get looked at... but as far as I know, this industry works on recommendations. Who would have you cut their feature if they didnt know you, and have someone say 'yes he cut my film/short/doc and is good' ?

A reel is useful, and CV, but as you are saying... (and others here) its more to show 'these are the cool things ive worked on' ... not your edit skills. Although it should be put together nicely, dont go over the top on effects, choose good music, cut it in a clean and thoughtful way.  Be careful what kind of titles you use, if any.

PM me if you want to talk more... ill try answer and questions (Im a Londoner! Working in London but not on features... yet...)

He undoubtedly was thinking *about* it in some sense. That is, he was undoubtedly thinking about the concern of how to relate to growing Nazi military build up and their overtures to toward impending expansion in a way that would benefit the USSR. That doesn't imply he had settled on planning to contribute to the Nazi invasion until the secret negotiations, however.

Remember that in April 1939 Stalin was also making direct inquiries with both the British and French governments about a possible coalition to combat German military efforts. The USSR was in an extremely precarious position in which they were ""thinking on their feet,"" as it were. That's not to defend the Nazi-Soviet coalition, it's just unlikely that it was a highly planned and orchestrated affair.

&gt;If you believe in a worldwide dictatorship of the proletariat, how could you not, especially if you believed it had to happen in industrialized western Europe?

This was an orthodox Leninist conception that had been almost entirely eliminated from Soviet concerns in the Stalin era, though. Stalin's administration was defined by a sharp nationalistic turn to the concern of ""Socialism in One Country."" The idea of a global revolution based on capturing western Europe was associated with Trotskyism and severely opposed by the Stalinist authorities.",,0,SubredditDrama,9,t5_2ss5b,1468743483,,1464810050,0,False,,d3s3fq4

On the one hand, I think it's unique and good book for a several reasons -- its intelligent and subtle approach to race and nationality, some very solid writing, the time spent in Europe, the last 50 pages or so -- but I also found it to be kind of a slog. It took me about the time it should have taken to read a book several times its size.

Cole gives the reader no real plot to guide him/her, but more so the novel -- as far as I can tell, and maybe someone who has spent more time with it can correct me here -- has no real structure. There are many mediations and digressions about historical context, but almost every character and every subject is given the same amount of space. The reader has no way of discerning what he/she should be paying attention to; this can make the reader stop paying attention.

Here's my thought: this is an unfair bargain. As I look back on this book, almost any 50 pages could be taken away and the novel would be more or less unchanged. Sure, there are certain parts that echo throughout, but most are replaceable. The prose too is very good, but does not cary the novel the way certain Modernists might supply no plot but through the intensity of their prose carry the reader along. 

But as I've said, I'm conflicted and I wonder if I had read the whole book like I read the last 50 pages (in one sitting instead of in pieces on the subway to/from work) I might have given it a fairer chance.

2) He's 2 years after his draft year and was under a Pt/game. Graovac was well over a pt/g at the same spot in his development and we're all hoping he can maybe be a 3rd line center. Duke's points/game during the regular season actually went down from last year to this season. He's had a great playoffs this year, points-wise, but maybe the Wild see him as having plateaued, or maybe there's something more they don't like.

We'll have a better read on the situation if/where Duke gets redrafted. Maybe this will come back to bite us in the ass, maybe it won't. Regardless it's amazing to me that not signing a 6th round pick that was the 5th highest point-getting player on his team has garnered as much negativity as it has. 

I'm not going to pretend to have watched enough of Duke's game to say that this is for sure the right move, but I do think that maybe the people getting paid a lot of money to watch and analyze him play know a little more than we do. I don't think our Scouting department is amazing, but I think that if they are saying not to sign a guy at all there's probably a reason for that.

I'm going to post what somebody else posted on a 2017 Mazda 6 unofficial rumor thread just yesterday. I don't know how accurate this is so just take it with a grain of salt until everything is official.

Here are changes for the 2017 Model (at least here in Europe). This model can already be ordered and it will start delivering in October:

**• Matrix Grey Metallic (46G) color
• LED indicators in the exterior mirrors increased - The turn signal will now receive the same shape as the Mazda CX-5 and is thus visible from the front also.
• G-Vectoring standard**


**• Dynamic accelerator control for all diesel models
• Better noise insulation - The decisive points as headliner, roof pillars and door area were meticulously improved for wind and road noise reduction in the interior. In all
Sports Line and Nakama Intense models a thicker glass is used in the front doors. In all diesels engines, engine modifications were made for the engine noise reduction.**


**• Head-up display shows the traffic signs - The information in the display appear in finer resolution, optimized arrangement and multicolored. Simultaneously, the new traffic sign recognition shows the current status of the speed limit and important warning signs. (The Navi SD card needs to be inserted.) Two of the drivers individualized orientations of the display can be used in the two memory functions of the electric seat adjustment can be stored (Leather interior)**


**• instrument display in TFT color
• New steering wheel and steering wheel heating
• SBS and SCBS update
The City Emergency Brake Assist (SCBS) now uses a high-resolution front camera and recognizes also pedestrians and two-wheelers. At the same time the scope of the SBS for the autonomous braking expanded.**


**• Automatically folding exterior mirrors
This feature is standard on Exclusive Line.
• Activation of the coming-/ Leaving Home function corrected
This light function can now be activated via the switch to ""Auto"" and therefore
more intuitive than before.**

**There are no cosmetic changes, apart from HUD being projected to the windshield (as seen on new CX-9)**

There's almost nothing in terms of student life. There's usually not a central campus, just a set of buildings in the city that the school purchased which can often be scattered throughout the city. There's no student center, no dorms, no dining facilities beyond maybe a small café, no varsity athletics. Professors are also paid less and have larger class loads. Compared to the US, European university education is a very bare-bones experience. It's very similar to community college here in the US: you go to class, you maybe get a snack at the cafeteria, study, then go home.

Here in the US, our universities are more than just universities. They're basically self-sustaining cities with housing, entertainment, athletics, shopping, police departments, infrastructure, etc. A lot of this is due to the huge size of America as well as the location of American public universities. In Europe nearly everyone goes to university locally and nearly every university is located in a large city. There's really no need to create non-academic facilities and services. In America not only does the huge size of the US force students to travel miles away from home to attend school, but public universities are often located in small towns where there is little in the way of privately run lodging and other services, necessitating the providing of those services by the school itself.",,0,politics,16,t5_2cneq,1468744060,,1464813742,0,False,,d3s4nsj

Let me try: 

My perception is that Trump has run on a platform of making America a self-sufficient superpower. This comes up in his statements about immigration, about international trade, about refugees, about military power and engagements, etc. 

I see many Americans supporting this stance because they feel that there have been so many problems with the perceived ""others"". The ""others"" include Middle-Easterners, Mexicans, Chinese, Russians, even the EU depending on the context. 

If Trump's plans to isolate the US with the attitude ""because we can do it better"" plays out, it makes a very clear statement that Trump doesn't care about the international community or the US position in it - he wants the US to be the superpower on top of it. 

This is the attitude that I get strongly from Trump supporters - that the most important thing is that the US is on top. Because of that, I feel that Trump supporters generally don't care about the US as a member of the international community. 

This is why I'd say Trump supporters don't care. Help me understand if I'm close to understanding your position. ",,0,politics,2,t5_2cneq,1468744063,,False,1,False,,d3s4nyj

The issue is the domestic born muslim population, not foreign born.  They are basically using terrorism to lash out against their living conditions much like poor black people use gangs in the US. Instead of gangs, they are going the 'jihadist' route but most aren't even that religious.

---------------------


**At Manchester United and Real Madrid you were one of many stars, but now, playing for Bayer Leverkusen, You’re the star - as is also the case with the national team. What has that been like?**

We all know the history of United and Real – European Cups, fighting for everything – but now I'm with the thrid-best team in the Bundesliga. Instead of making Leverkusen sound small, I want people to see that they have similar things. I know it’s not the same as United or Real, but this year was the sixth season that I’d played in the Champions League and next season is going to be my seventh. If I’d had more chances at United or Real, I’d probably have been ‘the star’ there as well – we’ll never know, because I didn’t have the chance. I never had the chance to play 20 games in a row so people could say: “He’s a good player who should stay” or “He can’t be the star – he’s not a good player”.

**Do you think that if you’d been less humble and more arrogant, that might have made a difference at your previous two clubs?**

Then that wouldn’t be me. I don’t want to be someone else. I treat people the way I want them to treat me. You don’t need to be arrogant to achieve things. Ask the United fans. The numbers are there. I started only 85 games at United and I scored 60 goals [in total]. At Real Madrid, I started just 12 games and scored nine goals. At Leverkusen I’ve started 37 games and I have 26 goals.

That's not how refugee camps in Syria work...you have to be a refugee

We don't vet people with no documentation. We simply wouldn't admit them. 

&gt;I doubt that refugees will assimilate into the West because I've seen what has occurred in Europe. Why has Europe's refugee assimilation been so porous that they are now facing extremism and disenfranchisement?

Theres too many refugees, and it enables them to avoid assimilation. This isn't the case with the US.



&gt;I doubt that people who are seeking refuge should be able to choose where that refuge takes place. Why should people be able to bypass dozens of countries where refuge is available in order to go to a desired location? How is that refuge seeking and not immigration?


They don't get to choose, the UNHCR randomly allocates them.


&gt;
I doubt that it's a smart security risk or economic policy to provide refuge status to refugees unless their are both assimilation protocols and opportunities for the refugees. I believe this is where Europe failed, immigration without opportunity or assimilation. Do you believe that we have the opportunity to give these people? Do you believe opportunity should be taken away from Americans and immigrants in the U.S. in order to provide for these refugees?

And if FG and Lab had been in anyway respectful of people who disagreed with IW.

But it didn't happen that way nor can IW be convincing now, especially since it involved all kinds of old fashioned scandal setting it up.

Now about rich people. I was being a bit facetious when I said mistreated. Because I interpreted your statements to mean that they are being asked to pay more than their fair share, and that to mean mistreatment.

Its interesting that you bring up a social contract. I think we consider a social contract in Ireland to mean two different things. My view of it is that everybody has an obligation to contribute to taxation in accordance with their means, and obversely the more means you have, the greater your obligation to look after others. I consider this the responsibility of wealth.

I think you believe the rich have no such added obligation, and that they should pay the same % as everyone else. After all, they have earned their wealth and are entitled to it--their obligation to others is no greater than anyone else's. 

Correct me if this is wrong.

Now to that I'd say that indeed the concentration of wealth is heading to a very dangerous level. The economic model of the 1800s, was a society of 'haves and have nots'. All of that was changed by the rise of the middle class.

With inequality increasing, downward pressure squeezes the middle, hollowing it out. As the middle hollows out, the gulf grows and the middle class as a stratum disappears.

This process is well underway in many economies. The US and EU, which conservatives and the right wing desire to emulate, both have middle classes stagnating and thinning out. Both have decreasing social mobility, and increasing debt per capita. 

We can see this clearly by tracing the strata and their recovery post 2008. In the period following, the wealthy captured a y/y share of wealth, assets, and income. Meaning the poor and middle classes did not as fully recover. 

There are too many people on low wages, with a rising cost of living, for us to consider that poor and working people have recovered. And they keep saying it. The middle class seem to be defined by those who escaped losing their livelihood in the recession, and who aren't underwater in their mortgage.

Looking at the housing market in that sense, with its high % of cash buyers, and low sales volume, it's clear the middle are facing serious pressures financially.

Wealthy people do not face these issues. They have eclipsed their pre-2008 income and asset levels. Their recovery is real.

So any society we manage in this climate needs to focus on relieving the pressure where is being felt, and increasing social mobility in the two lower strata. Essentially demand side economics.

And because we can't create our own euros, the wealthy have to finance our return to a truly healthy economy. After all, they destroyed it in the first place.

Now with SF and FF, the next election will be determined by how well SF manages to conflate FF and FG. The more they make the two inseparable, the more they and the independents will gain. If we have 3 more years of austerity, voters will not forget who are responsible for it. 

Not a shinner, FG, or FF supporter by the way. My political investiture at present has waned with what I consider to be a gross lack of merit to lead and vision in the Irish political class. Just FYI.",,0,ireland,1,t5_2qhb9,1468745267,,1464812830,0,False,,d3s72jn

&gt;I don't understand how leaving the EU is going to increase the chances of making the EU a transparant trade bloc?

By negotiating our own terms of trade this can be accomplished, if it takes 5-10 years of work rather than being stuck in an archaic institute as the EU then so be it.

Look, it's dirty, you truly do have to watch out for thieves, it's covered in graffiti, and it's generally a city of utter chaos. Honking horns, Vespas passing you by on narrow streets in Europe's most densely populated city. But the main street, Spaccanapoli, is phenomenal and there you will find a type of authentic Italian culture you can't see in Rome or Florence or Venice. I was there 2 weeks ago and don't get me wrong, I was relieved when I left... but it was definitely worth it. I also found myself participating in the local nightlife one night (drinking on the street) and it was awesome.

If you walk the Lungomare (called Via Caracciolo for most but not all of the way, it's the area along the sea) to Via Toledo (Main shopping street) to Spaccanapoli (a nickname, it's really called Via Benedetto Croce for most but not all of the way) you've seen the important parts of the city. Off Spaccanapoli check out Via San Gregorio Armeno, a side street with shops selling handmade nativity scene figurines year round. Once again, you can't find that type of kitschy Italian-ness in Rome. On Via G. Armeno walk one block North to Via dei Tribunali where you can find the famous pizzerias of Napoli, and your tour is completed. Bonus points for taking the Funicular up to Castel Sant'Elmo and taking in the amazing views.

Oh, and I actually preferred Pompeii to Herculaneum. But if you're really into ruins you should do both.

This is a logistical nightmare in its own right - each team have around 50 tonnes of kit. FOM hire 7 747 cargo planes to move all of this around the world. With the team equipment are the safety, medical (and backup) cars. 
When the kit arrives it has to be processed through customs - some countries make this easy, others are a bit more difficult to deal with. Once released the kit will go to the circuit, usually around the Monday, team personnel will begin arriving on the Wednesday to start setting up the garages. 

In terms of repairs, the cars are stripped down for shipping and go in a packing case - the front and rear wings are removed, engine and gearbox too. When arriving at a circuit once the garage is set up, the cars will be stripped and rebuilt to whatever degree is necessary and then an initial set up for whichever track they are at. If the tub has been rendered unusable (by accident) the team will have a spare in their kit which they will build up in to a car.

When the flyaway races are held in a row (for example Australia-Bahrain-China-Russia) some kit will be shipped by sea, purely for cost reasons. This is usually extra supplies or new equipment (e.g updated parts). I think they also do this when the overseas equipment isn't required. For example, we've just had Spain and then Monaco. Rather than flying all equipment out they will have shipped some by sea to Canada direct from their bases a few weeks ago.

In extreme circumstances parts will be flown out as and when needed - in the old days it wasn't unknown for a team member to turn up at an airport clutching an important part - even paying for an extra seat if need be! Mercedes actually chartered an aircraft to fly an MGU-H for Hamilton's car at the Russian race. This was flown out after qualifying, arrived in Russia in the early hours of the morning, Eccelstone helped to get it through customs quickly, it was then fitted to the car before daybreak.

For the European races the teams take all the kit by road in trucks, this will include the huge team ""motorhomes"" that you see in the paddock. For back to back races (like Hungary and Germany this year) the trucks will go directly from one track to the other.

&gt; Annual interest costs have plunged from €63.9bn in 2010 to €48.5bn in 2015, helping Germany to run a budget surplus last year despite the costs of the refugee crisis, and plan for another this year.

&gt; In 2015, Germans set aside 17 per cent of their disposable income, second only to Sweden within the EU. Not only do Germans save more than most of their European peers, they do so in a way that makes them particularly sensitive to low interest rates.

&gt; ... 

&gt; The country has the EU’s lowest home ownership rate, 52.4 per cent, meaning that many Germans have not benefited from the rising property prices that have accompanied the ECB’s expansive monetary stance. Germans, meanwhile, have never really developed a taste for investing in shares. Just 14 per cent of adults say they hold stocks, according to the Deutsches Aktieninstitut, a lobby group.

&gt; There are various reasons for this, according to Gerrit Fey, head of capital markets policy at the Deutsches Aktieninstitut. Some are structural. The tax system does little to encourage widespread share ownership, and the public pension system does not require people to get involved with markets.

&gt; “There is no capital stock linked to a particular worker that needs to be built up for retirement, so people aren’t forced to think about the stock market in the same way,” says Mr Fey.

&gt; There is also a psychological element. “Germans are very conservative about how they invest,” he says. “The basic mentality is: if I don’t have to take a risk, I won’t.”

&gt; The big stock market cycles of the past 20 years have not made it any easier to overcome that scepticism. Millions of Germans bought shares in the part privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, only to be burnt when the dotcom bubble burst. The 2008 financial crisis deepened Germans’ suspicion about shares.

&gt; ...

&gt; As the ECB has pushed rates towards zero, bank margins have withered. A study by BaFin and the Bundesbank last year found that Germany’s 1,500 small and midsized banks expected profits to fall by an aggregate of 25 per cent by 2019, mainly due to the collapse in net interest income. The study projected that if rates fell a further 100 basis points, lenders’ profits would plunge at least 60 per cent by the same date.

&gt; The ECB’s decision to cut its deposit rate to minus 0.4 per cent in March also means that German banks have to pay a charge on their excess liquidity. Last year, the bill was €248m, according to the Bundesbank.",European Federation,0,europe,2,t5_2qh4j,1468746277,EURO,False,0,False,,d3s97ts

I know how the EU works (or rather I know how opaque it is). You make a fair point that the EU as an organisation is opposed to any change of direction because of technocratic immobility, and because people staffing the institutions want to keep their cushy jobs. Same with the appalling Strasbourg circus.  

I do not think this is optimal and would definitely welcome an increase in transparence, financial oversight, and a renewed consensus among member states as to the direction the whole project is supposed to take. 

The problem lies within the political elites in the member states, which seem to blindly push forward for more expansion both in size and in scope, while populations are at best questioning the whole process. 

Yet my point stands. This cannot work if you have a large country with enough leverage to opt out of major common policies. I personally have nothing against the UK leaving, although I would find it a bit sad. But then there should be no 'all but membership' set of treaties offer on the table either.

---

&gt;* German newspaper Sddeutschen Zeitung has linked Moscow's deputy Mayor Maxim Liksutov to the Magnitsky case in an ongoing investigation, the Meduza news website reported Wednesday.

&gt;* The joint investigation by Sddeutschen Zeitung and Swiss company Sonntagszeitung is looking into leaked information from the so-called Panama papers.

&gt;* Company Zibar Management transferred more than $336,000 to the account of Estonian firm Transgroup Invest in 2012, Sddeutschen Zeitung reported.

&gt;* Zibar Management was claimed to be one of the entities involved in the 5.4 billion ruble ($81 million) theft from the Russian government budget by head of Hermitage Capital William Browder.

&gt;* The incident resulted in the U.S. introducing the Magnitsky Act, which bans certain Russians involved in human rights violations from entering the U.S.

Not when you consider that the US has paid $100B of the total $150B cost of the thing. If there has been 101 long-term crew aboard, why haven't ~75 of them been Americans?

&gt; November 2012, ESA obtained the commitment of its member states for it to construct an ATV-derived service module for Orion, to fly on the maiden flight of the Space Launch System, thereby meeting ESA's budgetary obligation to NASA regarding the ISS for 2017–20. **No decision was made about supplying the module for later Orion flights.**

Also, the service module was in compensation for part of ESA 8% commitment to the ISS.

Japanese steel was generally low quality and brittle, but those quality concerns led to very specialized techniques to make the most out of what was available.

In Europe, the sharpness of a sword was also less important because chain mail and plate were not totally uncommon among the sword fighting classes, while in Japan lacquered leather, and silk made up the bulk of armor, so sharpness could make the difference between a kill and an easily deflected blow.

Ultimately though, in both regions, spears were much more common on the battlefield than swords, for their relatively low cost, versatility, ability to engage an enemy at a distance, and of course ease of use.

Yeah, like the Chinese, which took 20 years.  It still takes a loooong time to do.  The germans, also, took down ""highly advanced, sophisticated, and well defended cultures"" and eventually met once they couldn't take down...two actually.  Point being that the past is not precedent.

&gt; thousands of years of technological progress. 

A thousand, not thousands, and again I ask - what, specifically?  Was their armor better?  The horses had cyborg parts, what?  Oh, and you know what they couldn't do in those 1000 years? - Find a way to make their laminated bows stay together in the rain and dampness, which Europe is full off.  That's right, the bows fell apart in the rain, because that ""technological progress"" that made them better bows only worked better in arid enviornments.

&gt; Saying that Romans would 'learn Mongol fire' is just pure postulation, and not really useful in an argument.

No, I mean it not like one side in a war has ever stolen and re-purposed the other's technology, right? /S  That's commonplace, as a practice.  Stealing secrets from other countries is commonplace.

&gt; And I don't know how many more times I have to state that even though Mongols were famous for not always needing a supply train, they were extremely capable of maintaining one when they wanted.

You can state it a billion more times and it won't stop it from being an issue.  Not to mention if they conquered the whole of the Empire they would have to maintain a navy now, and the Mongols were notoriously poor sailors.

&gt; Or that they had advanced siege weapons.

And I dunno how many more times I need to ask for one of these magic ""advanced"" seige weapons the Romans didn't have too that doesn't involve gunpowder and was an actual siege weapon, not a handcannon.

&gt; I understand that nothing I say will make you change your mind; that's fine. But your actual arguments for the Romans mostly focuses on cannons, and forgets everything else

If you read all my comments here, you'll find that I only mention cannons to you, starting a comment or two ago, and that was to refute your notion that the Mongols had actual wall-busting siege cannons, which they didn't at their peak, and which were rare items, like the legendary loot of the era.  And you're right, you won't change my mind that this would be a long hard fight that would go on for a long time, and would not be some glorious sweep for the Mongols.  The Mongols were a very bright flash in the pan that faded into the background once their conquests ran out of steam, like the Vikings, and would have a hell of a time going up against the glory of Rome.  If they had been able to conquer Europe at their peak, they why didn't they, especially considering Europe was weaker then that at the Romans' peak?  Why didn't they, if they were such hot shit?  It's hard enough to conquer all of Europe on a Risk board, let alone in real life.

1464824309,t1_d2wtd82,idnw,1,t3_4iag2a,"Hey Kronus88. I am happy you are considering Paraguay as a home country. I make myself available to any other questions you may have. I will like to give you heads up concerning some of your comments below. 

Comparing to Paraguay, Europe is a far more politically and socially unstable than Paraguay. True that the state controls many aspects of your life, and you may have less personal choice. But in many instances, when I found myself traveling back to Paraguay I thought that, man I wish we could do thing better here (and we are starting to). 

I will give you a couple of examples that you will find deeply irritating about our country. 

Health care, it is quite horrible and you never know the quality of services you are getting. I don't know how old you are, but if you are in your 50-60s, you should not consider coming to Paraguay to retire as your life expectancy may see a decrease, for example treatment for cancer is not a widely availble, or alzhaimers and such. 

The roads are horrible, you are not going to want to leave the house because of the fumes of cars, traffic and potholes. Simply for this reason I suggest you avoid Asuncion altogether and go find a secret nook of Paraguay where all the white germans have their little utopian community (campo 9, chaco). Although there is no night life, it will feel a lot more like living in the country side of, let's say Indiana, than it would feel like you are living in Delhi. 

Crime - Although the Violence in Asuncion is relatively. If you do get any time of crime done against you, don't expect any justice to be serve. NADA. ZERO. The legal system is broken. This alone is a big reason not to live in Paraguay.

If you are going to move alone, and don't know anyone, it will be rough man. It is different for me, as I am from there and have family in Paraguay, but I am not sure about wanting to permanently live in Paraguay. 

On the other hand, if you are more of the utopian kind, this is what I suggest you to do. 

1. Meet a cute girl in Asuncion and have her move in with you. (This is because you are moving to a colony and there is nothing to do in the colony)

2. Buy property close to a colony (Campo 9 recommended). Buy lots of land, as its cheap. 

3. Ask around the colony who build houses, some of the houses build in those colonies match to the construction requirement in first world countries. i.e. 

3. Grow your own food. Soil is very fertile. You won't have the opportunity to do that in Asuncion. 

4. Buy solar panels. There is a lot of sunlight, that way you are not dependant in the unstable grid in Paraguay. 

If you do all the above, you will have a shit ton of money remaining every month, which will allow you to buy nice toys and travel more often than you would if you were living in, let's say Berlin. 

I find that to be a better life scenario than moving to live in Asuncion, where its noisy, dirty, and smelly.

If you do end up moving to a colony, I hope you are as liberal as fuck. All those Mennonite Germans living down there are stuck in the 1800's and need some serious moral upgrades. 

So, want to move to Paraguay to take advantage of Geographic Arbitrage (living in a poor country while earning in a high country)?. YES, GOOD IDEA! 

Wanting to move to Paraguay because you are a stupid libertarian who is escaping big goverment and taxation? You'll hate it in Paraguay and you'll wish taxes were higher so that the 2 year old baby isn't holding a 6 month old baby in the streets asking you for money in Calle Palma.

So my way of doing this is by first installing the 15 second fastboot and adb from xda. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=48915118#post48915118

Start by going into the developer optins of your phone, you can get there by opening about phone and tapping build number about 10 times. After this, you will have developer options menu in the settings. Open it and toggle enable oem unlocking.

Then you can boot your device to fastboot mode by first powering you device off and the holding power down and volume up. Connect it to your windows computer, open cmd and write ""fastboot devices"" to check if your phone is detected. Then you can use ""fastboot oem unlock"" which will wipe your device clean and after it's done, your device will have an unlocked bootloader. You can get away from the fastboot mode just by holding power down for a while if you do not wish to proceed.

After this, you need a recovery. I'd recommend the modded TWRP, which can be downloaded here [twrp](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24459283995297945).

Now while your device is in fastboot and connected to the computer. Open cmd in the same folder with the twrp image. Use the ""fastboot devices"" command once again to check for connection. After that you can either type ""fastboot boot recovery.img"" which will just boot into the chosen recovery and it's 100% functional but it will not remain on your device. Or you can use ""fastboot flash recovery recovery.img"" which will rewrite the recovery partition on your device and the modded twrp will be on your device for as long as you don't replace it with anything else. Just remember to replace the ""recovery.img"" with the name of the modded twrp file you downloaded earlier.

Now reboot your device into twrp by shutting it down and turning it on, but this time you are holding power and volume up. While in twrp, you can flash files. To gain root access, you need to flash [this](https://download.chainfire.eu/696/supersu/). You can get it to your device by either using the mount device option somewhere in twrp and then you can just move the su.zip to your internal memory like you would be moving something to an mp3 player. When it's there, go to the flash zip thing, select the su.zip from your devices memory and flash it.

That should be all. Sure, there are other ways to do it, but that's how I prefer to do my stuff. Those toolkits out there are ok, but if something goes wrong, it's usually harder to figure out what it was.",Oneplus 3 (Graphite),0,oneplus,6,t5_30qnb,1468749611,3-graphite,1464827142,0,False,,d3sg9me
1464826110,t3_4m2qqt,ferrarifan,5,t3_4m2qqt,"&gt; I'd really like to ask some conservatives what they think about some of the Northern European countries that seem to be doing very well when it comes to healthcare and the general happiness of the populations.

Here's why we're considered racists, because we take an objective look at these sort of things. Norway, Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are very small countries with very little diversity (not that I consider White&gt;black, I consider little diversity&gt;lots of diversity). Everyone shares the same religion, culture, ancestry, etc. therefore, they have a very collectivist, socialist mentality. They are organized, and can work together. The US is a large nation full of diversity, so you have an individualist, capitalist mentality. If you have a few educated hard working people working for their common good you can get things done. If you have lots of people, whom very few are qualified, you can't provide for everyone. This is specially true for healthcare, which is pretty much socialized medicine.

Again, ignoring the whole ""racist"" aspect of it, do you think that the Scandinavian countries won't change after the Muslim immigration? Do you legitimately think that those people will integrate into their homogenized society even though they are very low-skilled workers and don't share the same culture? Do you think that the Scandinavian socioeconomic lifestyle works in other countries? Nope, look at Brazil for example.

When we remove the obvious problem groups (inner city black and hispanic males, typically those between 15 and 30), the rate of violent crimes in the US falls to levels comparable to our peers in Europe. To me, that means there isn't a gun issue at all.

&gt;Even though mass shootings account for a small percentage, it's there. It shouldn't be. When those who are perpetuating those massive crimes are getting the tools to do so through legal means, although there's clear indicators they shouldn't be able to, that's a problem and something should be done about it. Why can't both be true?

But there really isn't anything you can do to stop them, or mass killings in general. You are *never* going to be able to eliminate the ability of bad people to do bad things. Let me give you an example:

I'm a mechanical engineer, and a particularly average one (graduated from Kansas, a pretty average-level institution). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are around 278,000 of me spread across the United States. And every single one of us has the background necessary to manufacture high explosives like ANFO from unregulated household products.

Add to that everyone with a degree in Chemical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Materials Science, Chemistry, or Physics. Hell, anyone who has taken a college chemistry course and has an internet connection has all the tools necessary to figure it out on their own as well. Add to that the fact that anyone with a high school education probably knows, or can figure out, how to make combustible agents like Napalm-B or Thermite.

Like it or not, if one of all of those people chose to do something evil with the fruits of their education, you would be utterly powerless to stop them.

The Soviets had no navy capable of landing hundreds of thousands of men, and even if they managed to get one, they had no training or experience in massed amphibious assaults, which are probably the most difficult single operation in warfare. And even if they got a navy, boarded their troops and launched an invasion, how were they going to supply those hundreds of thousands of men? From what port? Vladivostok? Pusan? To what port that wasn't already bombed into total wreckage? To what area that wasn't going to force the Soviet troops to battle through the mountains towards Tokyo? 

The Western Allies had to create entire prefab ports to deploy along the landing zones to supply their troops when landing in Western Europe. On top of all of that, the Soviet Union has to get all this together and plan it within a few months. And then there's the fact that Vladivostok might be cut off by ice for several months, so that's a major port out of commission - they'd probably have to postpone it until Spring 1946, at the earliest unless you're going to try and supply them purely from the captured cities of Port Arthur and Pusan - which would be a hell of a thing. And then when the Soviets have got their ducks in a row - generously! - by Spring 1946, the Americans will have already landed in the Kanto Plain, presuming Coronet ended on schedule.

If we look at the state of the world prior to the discovery of the Americas, for instance, you clearly see some massive differences in types of technology used, how societies were organised, etc., between Europe and the Americas. Why would these apparently diverging cultures have suddenly started to head towards each other if they had never been brought into contact?

Remember, people are rarely trying to create a better future for people living 300 years later. Their main focus is normally going to be on improving their lives at the time, or that of their children. So while in a game like Civ, you are often working towards an 'end-goal' of technology, in reality that isn't the case.

And this very idea that more time = more progress isn't shared by everyone throughout history. The Maya saw time as cyclical, and the many of the people of Medieval Europe thought that the world was getting worse, and that we needed to try and return to the societies of antiquity.

&gt;* Turkey rejects the idea that the killings of up to 1.5 million Christian Armenians during World War One amounted to a genocide and has warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the run-up to the Bundestag vote that it will damage bilateral ties.

&gt;* The timing could not be more awkward for Merkel, who has staked her political future on a deal with Turkey under which Ankara has agreed to stem the flow of refugees to Europe in exchange for cash, visa-free travel rights and accelerated talks on European Union membership.

&gt;* After repeated delays over the past year, Merkel is powerless to stop the resolution, which has been championed by the opposition Greens party and is also supported by lawmakers from her conservative bloc and the center-left Social Democrats.

&gt;* But German officials hope the vote will not undermine the migrant deal between the EU and Turkey, which has been under a cloud since Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan pushed out his prime minister last month and began questioning parts of the agreement.

&gt;* Over a thousand Turks demonstrated against the resolution on Saturday in front of the Reichstag building in Berlin and some German lawmakers say they have been bombarded with hate mail and insults on social media for supporting the motion.

1464828646,t1_d3sdiu4,braindeadotakuII,1,t3_4lhzh6,"&gt; but in general I think that such reform is very difficult within the limits of a democracy

Very true, and that's part of the reason some on the Left advocate giving up on the nationalist bourgeoisie in the Third World. Guatemala is the only Third World state peacefully attempting land reform under a bourgeois democratic government that I know of --which was overthrown. Others can chime in here if they know of other cases.

Duterte said recently: 
&gt;The Left has given an impressive list of nominees. I am inclined to give in. If we can talk smoothly when Jose Maria Sison comes home in July, I am willing to give all the leaders government posts.

The department nominations include:  Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Development of Social Welfare, Department of Environment and Natural resources. I can see these being fields that the CPC could work in within the limits of bourgeois government.

&gt;“The only way to continue with mining is to use the military,” he said.

Natural resources are a rentier issue as well as a labor issue, so the Left can make headwind here but it just depends on whether Duterte will allow it. Extractive imperialism is a place where third world communists could potentially find unity with bourgeois national liberation movements--but I have some skepticism, bc the Arab bourgeoisie in the Gulf States *did* win higher oil prices and greater state involvement in that field and they quickly became not just anti-revolutionary but hyper-reactionary. Besides the whole religion thing, finance capital loves oil states bc they have guaranteed revenue/assets and ownership of natural resources can grant the owner a monopoly rent.

Let's not be too pessimistic though, because Sukarno and his fellow republicans got their start as collaborators with fascist Japan but later went on to liberate their nation, hold the Bandung conference and enter an anti-imperialist alliance with the PKI. It's the level of class consciousness among the masses and contradiction with imperialism that matters.

Btw there is some new [economic evidence] (http://voxeu.org/article/serfdom-and-russian-economic-development#fn) that suggests Lenin's conclusions about the negative impact of serfdom and serfdom's survivals were correct:
&gt;Overall, according to our counterfactual estimates, Russia would have been about twice as rich by 1913 compared to what it actually was, had it abolished serfdom in 1820 instead of 1861, as was considered by the emperor Alexander I and demanded by the ‘Decemberists’ gentry liberals. In 1913, according to Maddison (2007), Russia’s per capita GDP was $1488 (measured in 1990 US dollars). Our estimates suggest that the abolition of serfdom in 1820 would have implied per capita GDP in the range between $2513 and $2992. Thus, by 1913 national income per capita in European Russia would have been comparable to Norway ($2447) or Sweden ($3073) right before World War I.

And also: 
&gt;This is a large effect comparable to 40 years of aggregate development; grain productivity, on average, was increasing by 2.5% per decade in the 19th century Russia. This result confirms that with limited economies of scale, as in the production of cereals, forced labour has a negative effect on agricultural development...
&gt;The abolition of serfdom also had a very large positive effect on living standards of peasants, measured by the height of draftees into the Russian army.We find that peasants became 1.6 centimetres taller as a result of emancipation in provinces with the most severe form of serfdom (corvee, barshchina).

&gt;We also find that peasant mortality decreased by 5.6 deaths per thousand people as a result of emancipation of serfs in addition to the development trend. These results suggest that the abolition of serfdom in Russia was one of the most important humanitarian reforms of all times.Finally, we find a substantial positive effect of the abolition of serfdom on the industrial development of Russia’s provinces.In an average province, industrial output increased by 60% and the industrial employment more than doubled as a result of the abolition of serfdom.

This suggests two things 1. Lenin's assertion about the historical importance of fighting remnants of pre-capitalist class society and systems of exploitation is correct. 2. what the authors do not consider is that their own charts suggest that the easy gains of *de jure* abolition of serfdom were coming to an end, therefore you cannot simply assume that adding an extra-40 years to the post-abolition timeline will continue to produce the same result. The economic boom that Russia experienced during the late 19th century occurred when there was high demand for cereal grains in Europe and other producers were coming online. By the early 20th century the bottom fell out of the grain-market, leveling even far richer nations dependent on grain export like Canada, Australia, and Argentina; even poorer competitors like India joined in the competition. As Robert Allen aptly argues about the Soviet period, continued dependence on grain export was not an option. 

Lastly, assuming the higher level of development was achieved, Scandanavian nations were far from being social democratic paradises in 1913. Germany's per capita GDP around that time was $7,000; the US was $10,000 and proletarian life was harsh in both countries. These estimates are only for European Russia in any case, not the masses of oppressed nations in the Russian prison house.

Lenin was right to criticize such figures such as Stolypin about leaving the remnants of serfdom intact because systems of forced labor leave cultures of backwardness, poverty, brutality, and inequality in their wake.

Researchers have found that regions in the Americas where slavery thrived continue to boast [high-inequality] (https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/08/23/where-slavery-thrived-inequality-rules-today/iF5zgFsXncPoYmYCMMs67J/story.html) still reigns. 

Here is an interesting thing to consider, in the United States it is very difficult to say that the legacy of slavery is directly related to the relationships of production today: agriculture makes up about 2% of the workforce, unlike in the past, the workforce is not disproportionately black as far as I know, but disproportionately made up of migrant workers owing to wages far below the national minimum. 

We know of course about the legacy of chauvinism and national oppression that it left behind but there are aspects to it that even that does not explain, for instance: 

&gt;In a passing comment, Chetty and his co-authors observed that “both blacks and whites living in areas with large African-American populations [generally former slaveholding regions] have lower rates of upward income mobility.” Far from being divergent, the fates of poor blacks and poor whites in these regions are curiously, inextricably, intertwined.

A group Brazilian economists have found that far from being an American aberration this holds good across the Americas:
&gt;Soares and his colleagues examined the connection between historical slavery and contemporary inequality in a number of countries, largely in Latin America. The authors found a consistent correlation between the existence—and intensity—of slavery in the past and contemporary inequality. Moreover, this relationship was independent of the number of people of African descent living there today. As Soares said in an interview, “Societies that used more slavery are not more unequal simply because they have relatively more black people.”

On the upside:
&gt;In “Sharing the Prize,” an economic history of the civil rights movement published in 2013, Wright found that efforts to end discrimination paid substantial, enduring benefits to black Southerners. Perhaps more surprisingly, he found that the movement benefited whites, too.

So this makes a fairly good argument for us communists that the liberation and leadership of the oppressed will be good for most everyone, much like how the Bolsheviks raised Russian life expectancy considerably as well as that of colonial peoples.

Your instincts about Brazil seem correct, it is a lot like Russia, a weak or sub-imperial power dependent on cheap credit and primary commodity export with a long history of forced labor and internal colonization.

I have to say, the aircraft itself (Boeing 787-8, G-TUIA AKA living the dream) is a great aircraft, with larger Windows, which can be electronically shaded, and a great entertainment system, I sat and played a bit of video poker, after I watched the dark knight (was the best option), in a nice leather seat

Still pissed off at no meal service, we bought a couple of things at the airport, but a cold sandwich and a tub of olives isn't really a good replacement for a hot meal. So I shall be sending on my complaints.

I am missing two flash drives, one is mostly movies, but one has about ten years of writing on it. I did put them in a box, but nothing to be seen yet, two options for the location are in the suitcases, or at my sisters house.

Right, can't type any more really, not going to be long until the seat belt lights go on, almost mid day, current air temperature is low, but climbing, my ears keep popping too.

June first, about five in the morning. My arms currently resemble the flag of Poland because no one took my suggestion of leaving a sun tan lotion in an easy to reach part of the cases, so I was sat in the sun with no protection, and I could feel my skin burning, again. My mum and sister comment on it, but not much else. I just grin and bare it, because my arms are rather sore. It's pointless to complain with this family. I'm already secretly grumpy in my private moments, got two more weeks of this.

My bed is small too, I know why I used to sleep outside, because my feet don't hang off the edge outside. This is all for my grandma though.

No news on my flash drives, most likely they are on the floor of my sisters living room, an option I sincerely hope is the case, because the other option is ten years of lost work. It's going to be a week before I find out, when my brother in law has to go back for work,

The wifi is a mystery to us, we have a username, and a password to use, but we need a ticket number. Which we can't find. Too grumpy to offer to find out for others. There's always subway.

Five PM, fresh from the pool. My arms are now soaked in Aloe Vera, chilled in a fridge, we've been swimming in the ocean, and generally had a good time. Well, if you ignore the accident my oldest nephew had. Despite Bing told to not run on more than one occasion, just today. Heedless of danger, he took off running when we were headed to the beach, and fell.

His younger brother, took one look, and came running in tears, said oldest let off a scream, with many tears. Later, my brother in law and sister related how they were expecting to see bone sticking out. It was a small cut, bit of a flab from the tiles, and not much else. Of course, it's the end of the world to him, he's limping, more plan active cries of woe and misery.

Twenty minutes later, he's just stood on the shore, water lapping at his feet, screaming. Not too long after that, he and I were swimming out to the line of buoys separating the beach from the harbour, as happy as can be.

The wifi situation has been resolved. I can, and have, connected to the Internet, and I shall be able to post this on Reddit later tonight, when the wifi isn't in huge demand.

However, we have got a power issue. A serious issue. My sister had a little ""helper"" when she was packing. He'd take things out and put random things in. Sometimes she'd catch it, other times, she wouldn't.

She bought a few EU to UK power adapters, and put them in a case. At some point, her little helper took them out. So we had to find them for sale over here. Extortionist forgetful tourist price of Five Euros. That's fives pints, and change. We've got a few extensions, because well, I tend to use a lot of plugs, I have my iPad, my DS, my phone, and my surface, we all have tablets, or phones, and even a laptop, which can be used to charge the less power hungry devices.

We can manage, devices go down a lot more after my brother in law goes back, 

We've got a rather cool DSLR camera, been having a blast with it, and I'll be sure to post a few of them when I get home.

In short, it's a family holiday, which means I already need a holiday from them. I like my peace and quiet, which is a hard thing to get with six other people. Three of whom are under the age of 12. I've got a little veranda at the back that I like to sit on, my little alcove of peace and quiet. Can't wait to get home, and just boot up the old Xbox, see what updates to Elite Dangerous get carried through with Horizons without actually owning the DLC yet.

That and GTA DLC.

It's June 2nd, technically. 01:24. It's my first real chance to get online, although I should get more time tomorrow/today with the faster fibre optic broadband offered to the customers of the bar downstairs (very clever, save the good stuff for paying customers)

I will admit, I've had more to drink in two days than I do in a month normally. I'm on beer number three of tonight, after two the night before. Yeah, a heavy drinker I am not.

OeTTINGER, that's the beer I'm supping, my German is limited to Rammstein lyrics when I haven't had a few, and my glass is entirely unhelpful, because it's unbranded. We had two types, a wheat beer, and a oils made to those old as fuck purity laws in Germany that my brother in law both deemed to be far too akin to larger, and haven't touched since. My mum and sister, however, finished off the cans we had, and two cartons of wine whilst we played cards, and dice.

Turns out, I'm a wee bit of a card shark, at least in my unskilled group.

Final thought before I post this, after three days (technically) of typing: Don't go on holiday with your family, and if it can't be avoided, get a place of your own. I love my entire family, but God they get on my nerves twenty four seven.

Sorry if the last few bits are a mess, I'm not the steadiest typer after having a few. It's only auto correct and word checker that has saved this from a long line of errors. I did, after all, nearly type Tyller rather than typer a second ago.

I do hope you guys are having fun, in particular you, [my dear](u/ednar13) I might be start of holiday drunk (which is a different level of drunk to end of holiday drunk) but I remembered to think of you. The rest turned in to more of a stream on consciousness, slightly inebriated it may be. I'm tired, so I need to finish.

More sober me has to try and remember two Waylon Jennings songs we played at my grandma's funeral, to play when we scatter most of her ashes. I say most because we have decided that, besides scattering her ashes in the place she would have lived out her final years, one of her biggest thing was family, so we're going to get pendants. If drunk ideas translate, I'll let you know later. I have jobs to do, and I'm supposed to be up early, got to get bread for bacon sandwiches in the morning.

In awesome news, the place that we went to last time, Devidas for a gorgeous fish and seafood paella, may have shut down, but popular demand is bringing it back, just a few stores up. It's doubtful it shall be open soon enough to for me to gorge on fresh fish and squid and shit like that.

Right, apps, prepare frozen drinks for tomorrow, clean the last few things away, then bed and sleep, with the boy who snores like a phone vibrating on a table.

I need to end this now, or I shall be up until first light, at about six in the morning. I'm consciously stopping this here, so I do apologise, and offer one simple thing:look up the Corey's Shearwater cry. It's a bird we can hear here, and my sister describes it as a bird that sounds like a thing that you strangle.

It's kind of like a siren, or an old radio being tuned to me.

STOPPING NOW, NEED TO PISS.

Something I found alarmingly common in them was overly restrictive diets, and ferritin levels below 50.

I'm a firm believer that every illness (even psychiatric illness) has a physiological component that needs correcting/managing, it's unfortunate that people with CFS/ME don't have a lot of evidence base and end up having to try all these whacky things (like seeing ""alternative medicine"" practitioners) that do nothing or might actually make their conditions *worse* by not addressing the underlying issue.

-------------

Based on what I learned from my (very short) time in the clinic in regards to potential physiological causes:

Ask patients if they have a history of anemia, heavy periods, uterine fibroids, how many children they have had and if they supplemented iron during the pregnancies (most patients were women); failing that also try to elicit a GERD/peptic ulcer history (H. Pylori testing potentially).

Check ferritin!!! Correct ferritin to 50+ (low dose therapy is better tolerated and likely almost as effective, better compliance with less adverse effects = good news) [see here](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/1/145.short) and [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293430500210X) and [especially here](http://www.bmj.com/content/326/7399/1124?linkType=FULL&amp;resid=326/7399/1124&amp;journalCode=bmj), oh and [here](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8468108) too. Iron Bisglycinate and Iron Protein Succinylate seem to be the best tolerated compared to the commonly used sulfate/fumarate preparations. Also once daily or every other day dosing is fine, because of the acute elevation in hepcidin caused by a large iron dose. There's no real ceiling effect but absorption kinetics are such that you might absorb 50% of 60mg (30mg yield) but only 25% of 200mg (50mg yield) with *much* more adverse side effects.

Check Serum B12 *and* MMA (serum b12 has a low sensitivity for detecting B12 deficiency/insufficiency). You can correct with 1mg/day of methylcobalamin relatively quickly (and throw on folate on top, because why not?). If you really want you can also check homocysteine.

Elicit a proper alcohol + caffeine use history. Advise patients to cut out both.

Consider getting a sleep study done. Ask patients if they wake up with headaches (CO2 retention). Also ask patients about sleep habits in general. Advise good sleep hygiene.

Advise patients to consume *at least* 1.2g/kg of protein daily, as long as there is no concurrent kidney issues.

Stool O&amp;Ps if warranted. If IBS diagnosis, consider nitazoxanide therapy or whatever might fit.

Check for cardiac abnormalities with a physical exam (murmurs; regurg, prolapse, whatever)

Check for lung abnormalities (asthma? Can try spirometry and nebulizer to compare FEV1 pre/post)

Correlate clinically with anxiety/depression (note: iron deficiency anemia is a physiological cause of anxiety, so is mitral valve prolapse)

---------------

Failing all that, then things get trickier. But a decent amount of patients had somewhat common etiologies that were overlooked by their primary care providers, so that's some of the initial stuff to work up.

*SÃO PAULO — O Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF-4) decidiu aceitar denúncia contra a filha do ex-ministro José Dirceu, Camila Ramos de Oliveira e Silva, por lavagem de dinheiro. O juiz Sérgio Moro, da 13ª Vara Federal, havia rejeitado a denúncia contra Camila e entendido que ela não teria agido com dolo e não fazia parte do esquema criminoso da Petrobras. O Ministério Público Federal recorreu ao TRF-4, e a denúncia foi aceita nesta quarta-feira, por maioria, na 8ª Turma do tribunal.*
 

*Camila teve um imóvel, no valor de R$ 750 mil, comprado em seu nome, com dinheiro de propinas pagas por fornecedores da Petrobras. O MPF argumentou no recurso que o dolo deverá ser comprovado no decorrer do processo. Segundo os procuradores, Camila assinou em 2012 um contrato simulado de compra e venda com a Jamp, empresa do delator Milton Pascowitch. Pelo documento, ela vendia um imóvel à empresa por R$ 500 mil. Mas no período de maio a julho de 2012 houve sete transferências da contra da Jamp para a conta pessoal de Camila, no valor de R$ 1 milhão. No mesmo período, há um crédito de R$ 250 mil feito por Camila na conta da Jamp.*

Actually, it's a bit more ambiguous. It's written in a nebulous way, because they know that vague law is bad law, but easier to enforce than good law. Superficially, it looks like they are banning ""illegal hate speech"", which they already do. Of course, major companies already remove illegal content posted by their users on public websites when notified of it.

The one that is clueless here is you, you might want to check if you dont have any 'typical clueless albanian' heritage.As for the questions in your post, a quick look at the [wikipedia article about albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians) would reveal:
&gt;Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. 

&gt;Following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th century, the majority of Albanians converted to Islam.

And there is more! 
&gt;The Albanian language forms a separate branch of the Indo-European languages family tree. A traditional view, based mainly on the territory where the languages were spoken, links the origin of Albanian with Illyrian.

The language [is so different from other languages within Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages#/media/File:Indo-European_branches_map.svg), that it deserved its own branch!

It is obvious that you have problems with extrapolating something out of information so to answer your 'questions' directly:

-Albanians are Albanians and can't be grouped with other groups (e.g. like Slavs), this is one of the reasons they seem so ""out of place"" as you said yourself

-Not all albanians are muslim, that is a very ignorant statement. Albania might have been the [worlds first atheïst country.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Albania#Communist_Albania) 

-They haven't had a very big desire for their own nation untill Skanderberg in the 15th century. They were however conquered by the Ottomans and annexed into the Ottoman Empire. Naturally, pieces of the ottoman culture spread into albania, such as religion and even some cuisine. This is why Muslim names are common in Albania. There are many names in Albania that are unique to Albanians alone though. To only choose our prime minister as your only example is very weak.

Hence my saying ""to a certain extent"". :P

&gt;As it turns out, you don't need a very large sample size. At least, that's what the statistical principle of standard deviation tells us.

Can you provide a source on this, or at least explain this better, because I'm not sure how standard deviation would apply to this sort of thing (that is, deciding how large a sample size is needed to be in order to produce accurate results). I think it is a simple logic that you cannot take only several thousand Muslims in the Middle East alone and extrapolate that over the entire Muslim population and expect that to be accurate of what Muslims think.

&gt;Let's say the poll is wrong. If an overwhelming number of people in Egypt, say, opposed this treatment of the woman, why was it done?

I don't have an answer to this because there are too many variables and scenarios to go through in order to form an accurate answer, especially with the very limited information I have. (I'm not sure who you're referring to as ""the woman"", but I'm going to assume you're speaking in a general sense, of how Muslim women are treated).

&gt;You are evidence of progress in Islam.

To be honest, uh, no, I don't think I am, I'm just a guy on the internet with some beliefs. I know plenty of Muslims who think like me though. In fact I'd say the vast majority do.

&gt; see western whites who converted to Islam flock to Isis. For me, this is not a race thing. I just wonder if Islam, as it's being taught, is a danger to us and the actual people it's being forced upon.

Okay, well I never said it was a race thing, all I'm really saying is that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. But I guess I'll answer your wonders - Islam is not a danger to us. Besides small cases, Islam isn't being forced upon anyone. Dangerous, radical, ignorant people are a danger to us. It's also important to realize many Muslims hold different beliefs, a Muslim living in country a may not think like a Muslim in country B.

&gt;The Rohingya started a mujihadeed 70 years ago that still exists today. They wanted to defect to Pakistan and take a chunk of Myanmar with them. They could not coexist with their neighbors and wanted out. Doesn't that seem to prove my point?

""Mujihadeed"" is not a word. I think you mean ""mujahideen"" but that still doesn't really make much sense given the context. 

And I mean, I can understand the Rohingya not wanting to not be in their country anymore or at least wanting to be acknowledged in Myanmar... also the Rohingya did not start this conflict, so your logic doesn't make any sense. If anything, this only proves Buddhists can't coexist with other cultures (which is of course nonsense by the way) I do not see how this proves your point in any way.

&gt;It's the large piece of the Ummah who are taught by Saudi-funded instructors.

Only a very small minority of Muslims are taught by Saudi-funded instructors. Though Wahhabism and its growth in places like Pakistan and other Middle Eastern countries is a problem.

&gt;Have you ever thought that if we misunderstand them, perhaps many imams and their followers are also misunderstanding them? Maybe the problem with so many violent passages that require nuance and explanation is just that-- the nuance is lost on its own followers.

I suppose so, the problem in many Muslim countries (particularly countries such as Iraq, Syria, etc which are war torn, and face multiple problems) is that many Muslims tend to be ignorant and illiterate, thus being easier to manipulate. ""the nuance"" is quite simple to understand once you read the next few words after the supposed ""violent verses"" of the Qu'ran.

&gt;I ask that you take nothing I say personally.

I do not. You haven't said anything like ""fuck all muslims"" or something. You just seem confused/paranoid/wrong about several things.

&gt;Please don't see my objection to Islamic religious common practices as some personal criticism of you.

I have no clue what you're trying to say by this. Are you being sarcastic with ""religious common practices"" and trying to imply a religious common practice of mine would be shooting at people or beating women (ie Muslim stereotypes) or are you genuinely against Islamic common practices -- meaning things such as praying, or giving to the poor (zakat) which I wouldn't see how or why you'd object to?

&gt;For me, it's just a question of what happens to us if we ever become the minority in a Muslim-majority country. The birth rates aren't exactly favoring us, and I wonder if anyone will be there to protect us when we're a minority. The track record isn't so good.

Okay so this type of thinking has been debunked countless times, Muslims are still a very small minority in almost all Western countries, besides several small European ones like Albania. If you seriously live in fear everyday of your country being overrun by Muslims you lead a sad life and I am sorry for you.

1464834319,t1_d3rtqfl,Superpunani,1,t3_4m0ygg,"I completely understand this, sadly a few of the best soccer players I ever played with went on to work at jack in the box. They could never make grades in school and never went to college. Instead they ended up having to support their families as well. I've heard too many stories like this. 

I would say this is due to how vast the U.S is. In countries like Spain or Argentina, even the Netherlands players can be picked out easier by scouts because scouts or even coaches only have to drive an hour or so to see certain players play. Instead in the U.S, most coaches try and recruit for colleges where they watch highly ranked club teams play, where poorer players usually can't play on because of how expensive it is. It's usually about 400 a month. And since these poorer players, not to say all, but I have noticed usually don't make grades, coaches can't see them play in the right stage.  This leads to players in college being the only ones who get drafted into the MLS draft.  From there those players are picked for the U.S team. 

The U.S as a whole is at a disadvantage compared to other countries in regard to soccer. I say this because of that process I spoke about. In European soccer,  players can usually get there professional start at 17, maybe 18. In the U.S after the player goes to college, I do not have a stat, but I would say most go the full time, leaving at 21 maybe 22.  The MLS simply doesn't pay enough for students to quit school half way through. So measure against a soccer country whose players get 3-5 more years in a professional soccer league honing their skills focusing on positioning and movement, while we are focused on conditioning and strength.  We will always be behind European and South American countries in terms of soccer. 

Too many great players are left out of the whole process and never get noticed.  In my opinion there needs to be a change in our American soccer structure.

1464834508,t3_4m4egd,khthon,-1,t3_4m4egd,"A rejeição do incesto é algo biologicamente programado na nossa espécie (e muitas outras). 

Quando se trata de incesto com **outros** indivíduos ou em contexto de fantasia, essa rejeição já não existe, pela óbvia dissociação! O factor tabu/proibição até torna a ideia sedutora. Mas o que quero dizer é que questões culturais por norma não conseguem vencer o instinto. Quando isso acontece, temos parafilias e outros comportamentos que são por norma prejudiciais à reprodução do indivíduo. 

Perante a possível realização das fantasias, muitas pessoas percebem que não é aquilo que querem. Isto é para quem está em patamares ridiculamente específicos de pornografia e os seus fetichismos. 

A maioria das culturas aceitou e integrou a consanguinidade como sendo prejudicial à saúde das pessoas. Há excepções claro. O troglodita do Maomé sancionou a união entre primos direitos e graças a isso temos [1400 anos de consanguinidades](http://en.europenews.dk/-Muslim-Inbreeding-Impacts-on-intelligence-sanity-health-and-society-78170.html) numa ideologia religiosa em que atrasos mentais, propensão para a violência e doenças mentais são muito acima da média do mundo.

Pessoalmente, nada tenho contra o que pessoas livres e adultas fazem consensualmente. Terei a partir do momento em que decidem procriar e com isso colocar pressões inaceitáveis (custos de saúde) sobre descendentes e sobre as comunidades onde vivem. Mas isto já acontece e ninguém pode fazer nada contra. Por exemplo, os anões podem e têm filhos, que muitas vezes têm a sua condição. Outro exemplo mais polémico é pessoas com trissomia 21.

Completely objectively, point blank, Socialism has failed in a crazy amount of countries in which it has been complemented. America is already fine the way it is and does not need radical reform to become like the collapsed European countries, because you know, Greece is just doing fantastic right now.

Meanwhile, despite the fact that I disagree with you, I still want you and your future children to live good lives. I am assuming you do too. Do you want you and your children to be poor and living in the next economic depression? Because if the staggering precedent is a factor, that is what will happen with socialism.

And for communism, you really want to go live in Cuba? The old soviet Union? I mean fuck the free market right?

It seems like you are asking mostly about the 3 series. The 3 series chassis codes are as follows, chronologically: E21, E30, E36, E46, E9X (E90, E91, E92, E93), and now the F3X (F30, F31, F35) plus the F80, which is only the M3 (M4 is F82 and F83). 


I can't list off all the models for each chassis, as I'm mostly familiar with e46. E46 in North America has 323i and 328i, which then were ""face lifted"" and renamed to 325i and 330i. There's also the M3 coupes and convertibles. There are also variations of the base model E46 3 series. For example, a coupe or convertible with rear wheel drive would be badged a 323ci. Sedan would be badged 323i. All wheel drive were badged 325xi. The 3 in the name denotes that the car is a 3 series, and the last two digits loosely represent engine displacement/power (Bmw has gone back and forth on this, sometimes it represents actual displacement, sometimes it doesn't. 


Either way, the lower numbered models will have smaller engines and/or less power). For example, the E46 323i and 325i both have a 2.5L inline 6 and both the 328i and 330i have a 3.0L inline 6, which is just a bigger brother to the 2.5L. In Europe they offered other versions of the E46, like the 330d, which was a diesel, and a 4cyl model which is either a 318 or 320, can't quite recall. There's also an M3 CSL, which is an extreme version of the M3.


The other chassis' of the 3 series don't really follow the same conventions as the e46... The e36 has the most similar models. Once you get to E9X and beyond, the naming conventions and number of models become much more numerous and convoluted. Some time on bimmer forums, google, and Wikipedia will give you more detail.


Any specific questions or were you just trying to learn a bit of BMW trivia?


EDIT: a 328i was offered first in the E36 generation, then in the E46, E9X, and I think even in the newer F chassis. The E30 had a 318i, 325i, 325e, 325is, 325xi, and M3. It was available in sedan, coupe, and convertible. Touring were available in Europe.

E36 had 318i, 318ti (hatchback), 325i, 328i, and M3. Also in coupe, vert, and sedan, with the addition of the hatchback 318ti. I think there was also a 328is offered, but not quite sure. ",2003  E46 M3,0,BMW,3,t5_2qn3a,1468753326,,1464838700,0,False,,d3so02p

Not hard to find a job for *locals*. I agree that obviously these refugees are facing some real barriers in finding work in order to get such an extreme statistic like 99% unemployed. I too genuinely doubt they are ""lazy bums"" and I bet many probably work under the table and nobody's counting that. But if it was equally impossible for everyone to get a job, I'd make an similar argument as to why anyone is working at all?

As I mentioned, labor force participation rates actually vary a lot between different EU member states. Some of the ones with elaborate social safety nets and labor laws have more people with any kind of job than comparable OECD countries without good safety nets and fewer labor laws like the USA.

U.S. Internet giants Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc., Google and Microsoft Corp. pledged to tackle online hate speech in less than 24 hours as part of a joint commitment with the European Union to combat the use of social media by terrorists.

A French Jewish youth group, UEJF, sued Twitter, Facebook and Google in Paris this month over how they monitor hate speech on the web. In the course of about six weeks in April and May, members of French anti-discrimination groups flagged unambiguous hate speech that they said promoted racism, homophobia or anti-Semitism. More than 90 percent of the posts pointed out to Twitter and YouTube remained online within 15 days on average following requests for removal, according to the study by UEJF, SOS Racism and SOS Homophobia

A number of people, namely Robert Lindsay and his cohort have argued that there may be an ulterior cause for non-Whites to fail to achieve; a cause that may not be discussed as of yet.  
  
In 2007 he wrote a controversial piece entitled *The Skyrocketing Black IQ* wherein he discusses the Flynn Effect and notes how it works is that the Flynn Effect is the sum of re-normed IQ tests which have been changed to include less intellectual forma and more items which reflect modern intuition and a change in thinking.  
  
 One such example is the question, ""What is the similarity between a rabbit and a dog?"" to which an older generation like your grandparents would likely respond along the line of, ""A dog hunts a rabbit,"" where a Millenial would quite likely respond that, ""Both are mammals,"" or, ""Both are animals.""  
  
Both responses are equally right but the response from the newer generation would be far more indicative of higher IQs because it shows thought which reflects what IQ tests now grade for. This is not to say that the grandparents are any dumber but the changes in how IQ tests grade people have changed because they added more categories with questions of that nature.  
  
Verbal and Arithmetic IQ scores have not risen, however and that is where IQ is *really* measured.   
  
The changes in IQ scoring are a social effort to reduce differences between racial groups and are not a substantive sign of those gaps disappearing, just test standards becoming simpler and less intuitive. In spite of this, the gaps have remained.  
  
Returning to Lindsay's piece, he notes that the norm of IQ tests is always 100 for Whites and other races vacillate around 100. Afro-American (29% white, 4% Native American, 1-2% East-Asian on average) Blacks in the 1930s' still had IQs of 85 on the tests which were considered modern at the time, Whites had 100, Northeast-Asians 103, Jews 112 (that last one being highly debatable).  
  
With this in mind, the racial gap has held. Even if the increases in IQ were true and Whites in the 1930s had IQs equivalent to a modern IQ of 85 they still behaved and performed far more admirably and with Arithmetic and Verbal IQ scores matching the modern levels.  
  
Lindsay goes on to say that because of this the low status of Blacks and high status of Whites cannot be explained by IQ and is instead explain through differences in the pathologies of the races. Black pathology which has high time preference and is interdicted often due to their lascivious and violent natures is what leads to their ruin and *not* their still-low IQs.",,0,DarkEnlightenment,1,t5_2xhxs,1468753956,,False,0,False,,d3spc96

The war on the Eastern Front was arguably close enough that the efforts of the Western Allies to distract Germany from the Soviets were decisive in bringing about Allied victory. No doubt that the Russians played a far greater part in defeating Germany than all other countries put together, and some say that this was the greatest military achievement of all time. But I would argue that the enormous sacrifice of the Soviet people would have been for nothing if the Allies as a whole were not able to weaken Germany through a group effort.

Invading the Soviet Union was clearly one of Hitler's greatest blunders, because he only had a small chance of actually winning.

Clinton to Pound Trump on Foreign Policy but Risks Loom  
http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-to-pound-trump-on-foreign-policy-but-risks-loom-1464840004

&gt;WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton plans to draw a sharp contrast Thursday between her experience as secretary of state and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s views on foreign policy in a speech her campaign hopes will lure independents and even some Republicans. Mrs. Clinton, speaking in San Diego, is expected to tick through a number of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy proposals, such as a recommended ban on the entry of Muslims to the U.S. and a closer alliance with Russia, saying those ideas would make the U.S. less safe and embolden its adversaries. “She’s going to make clear why Donald Trump is simply unqualified to be commander in chief,” Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton’s top national security and foreign-policy adviser, said in an interview. Many of Mr. Trump’s unconventional views on foreign policy drew criticism from his GOP opponents during the primary campaign. But Republican voters often responded to his refrain that the U.S. must do more to protect its interests, and that foreign countries frequently fleece American taxpayers. His tough talk on combating the Islamic State terrorist group allowed Mr. Trump to separate himself from GOP opponents who had more foreign policy experience and more nuanced views on how to approach the complex challenges of the Middle East. Mr. Trump has also suggested the U.S. could enter into a new alliance with Russia and engage in direct talks with North Korea, positions that Mrs. Clinton has attacked. North Korea, through its state-run media, recently praised Mr. Trump, calling him a “wise politician.” Officials in South Korea, meanwhile, have expressed alarm, saying Mr. Trump’s threat to remove U.S. troops from their part of the Korean Peninsula would expose them to aggression from Pyongyang. Mr. Trump rejects criticism of his hard-hitting views, arguing that the foreign policies of Mrs. Clinton, President Barack Obama and President George W. Bush clearly didn't work, and that a “reset” is badly needed. “We’ve been run by incompetent people,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month. “These nations are all taking advantage of us.” Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, is seeking to widen what appears to be an existing gap in public comfort between herself and Mr. Trump on foreign policy. She’s delivering her speech at 11:30 a.m. Central Daylight Time, or 2:30 p.m. Eastern. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last month found that 56% of voters said Mrs. Clinton would be better able to handle foreign policy, compared with 29% who picked Mr. Trump. The survey gave her a 10-point advantage on who would be the better commander in chief. Many voters have found Mr. Trump’s foreign policy views refreshing, judging from polls and primary results, but Mr. Sullivan predicted that “once people fully understand what Donald Trump is proposing, that it will not be appealing to any of them.” The next U.S. president will inherit a shaky global landscape. The European Union is under strain, with British voters facing a referendum on whether to exit the bloc. European nations have been rattled by an uneven economic recovery, a flood of migrants from the Middle East, and terrorist massacres in major cities.

---

&gt;* Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner in the U.S. presidential race, was set to give a major foreign policy speech that is expected to hit hard at her Republican rival Donald Trump.

&gt;* Though she's nearly clinched the nomination, shes running neck-in-neck with her Democratic opponent Senator Bernie Sanders in polls for next weeks California vote.

&gt;* News reports said Clinton's speech is expected to slam Trump for being too friendly with North Korea and too harsh on European allies

&gt;* Trump, among other things, has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.

&gt;* The billionaire and bombastic New York real estate developer, meanwhile, has scrambled this week to fend of damning allegations that students enrolled at his for-profit university were scammed.

Yes, it takes some effort getting started, but frankly you don't have to camp every year and girls SHOULD be planning activities (leaders for the younger groups) that are within the budget.  Uniforms are not mandatory.  The Pin is the uniform.  

As for the product sales, there are two, and troops can choose how and at what level to participate.  My parents did not pay many extra dollars because at each stage the girls planned and replanned activities within their budget.  Frankly, failing to reach a goal and having to revise plans was a better life lesson than those goals that came easy. 

We still achieved much!

Juniors -  we cruised to Mexico.  Cadettes - the traditional trip to Savannah.  CSAs - two trips to the smoky mountains, a 10 day tour of Europe including a visit to Pax lodge and our final trip, an Alaskan cruise.  

We worked hard, but those girls have skills beyond camping (which we did a lot of, too) and inventorying (sp?) cookies.  Research, cooperation, compromise and success!

Our society and western society in general are the most equal societies on this planet.

&gt;collective responsibility for their actions

What actions are that please do tell? Creating the best societies and countries on earth to live in?

Great thing about the nonsense you believe is none of it is provable, it's regurgitated by people because it perpetuates a victim culture. Which is attractive to liberals who always blame the system instead of themselves.

&gt;forcibly remove them from their privileged position via equity. 

That's not what you're trying to do. You are arguing and promoting a equality of outcomes not equality of opportunity. Blacks in particular have the lowest requirments for entering college, they get race bases scholarships, and AA benefits.

Your opinion is popular with social ""scientists"" and other nonsense type liberal arts. Not in the real world and it never will be because white privilege is a unprovable theory.

You peddle it as a fact, yet it's only been around since the 90's with the rise of anti-white social science nonsense.

Your entire arugument is simple bigotry towards white men. You're no different than racists blaming Jews for all their problems.

Western society, white countries, are the most equal in the world. They are the most free and least racist. These are real easy stats to find.

Why should white counties have to do anything for minorities? China sure doesn't give a shit about them. Why is it white countries responsibilities to do anything at this point?

This is the same type of shit that went on during the French Revolution. 

I wish I could remember the man who this quote is attributed to, but it went like this.

""The more equal a society becomes, the more any perceived instances of inequality become amplified.""

There is more, but this man lived through the French Revolution and saw first hand what happened. 

There is only one privilege and that is wealth. If you tell most white people they have some privilege they will laugh in your face. They have lived in this country since the great immigration waves and they are poor as fuck. Most white Americans never owned slaves, never fought natives, never did any injustice and they are poor as shit still. 

Applying collective punishment to white men, who 99.99% had nothing to do with any crime will result in you getting laughed at and called a moron.

You should go tell the coal miners who have mined coal for multiple generations about thier white privilege. They live in some of tone most depressed areas of the country.

&gt;psychology, history and culture

No, it's you gender studies or some nonsense social science course that convinced you that you're owed something or somehow opressed by those damn white males.

Except 10 groups of people's from Asians, Indians, recent African immigrants, etc earn more than the average white person and are better educated.

Let me act like you. We should ban firearms for black males, their history of violence and murder need to be answered for. They collectively need to asnwer  for ""black violence,"" until this happens we can never have peace. At least my statement is built on facts.

White privilege is a theory, unproven and unprovable. It doesn't exist, sorry you actually believed the puesdo intellectual shit you were spoon fed.

I doubt you did any really critical thinking, actually challenging the view yourself. Then you would really see how hypocritical it is, racist, and why it will never be more than a theory.

Why do you leave out white females? More white females are going to college than men, more white females are doing better than men on average, white females now make more than men on average and white females are now pushed into STEM and companies are so desperate for women you get fast tracked to management. Women also get a AA diversity advantage.

White females are far more privileged than their fellow white males.

I don't see white females demanding equal representation in the trades, only the top 10 highest paid fields. There are now more female doctors than male.

Your entire belief gets destroyed by facts. To the point you have to lie and make up facts like ""1-5 rape stat"" and the wage gap myth.

Keep doing what you are doing. You are pushing white men into never marrying, dropping out of society, not giving a shit about their jobs in tech because a women will get promoted over them simply because they are a women. I've seen this first hand in software development, most of my piers stopped giving a shit.

You've created a us vs them mentality, and given birth to a new white identity movement. nativist and tribalist thinking is on the rise with whites overall. If you are white, for every one of you, there are many more white women doing the same as white men.

Right is on the rise across the western world. After all, only white counties your type is pushing this in. The most equal and sucessful societies on earth.

You're anti-white and anti-white male, you're a racist and man hater. whites will fight back and they already are. why should white Europe give a shit about anything you say? these are white counties having diversity and multiculturalism pushed on them. Same with the US too.

Take your bullshit theory back to gender studies and the social ""sciences"" we are under not obligation to care about anyone but our own people and are starting to put them first.

Left has only themselves to blame, they failed to destroy white identity and it's coming back in a big fucking way.

I took the same bullshit you did, but since I'm a white straight male I didn't get to claim any victim points, eventhough my people were treated like shit when we came to the US. We rose above it and built our own communities up. We didn't tear anyone else down, we didn't ask for equality of outcomes we asked for opportunity. Which everyone has in this country.

The piece of shit judge going after Donald Trump over Trump university is an illegal who became a judge. He raised money for ""La Raza"" a Latino supremacist group. Only white people cannot advocate from themselves but that is changing and people like you are the reason.

House price growth fell in 2008 before staying slow for a couple of years as the market recovered and then continued on the same path of growth as before, not sure how you dont see that, but then you are willfully blind about quite a lot. Seems pretty obvious that more people vying for the same number of houses drives up the price, simple supply and demand. Your pension doesn't really matter if you can never afford a house, how does wasting money on rent affect your overall net worth? Certainly doesn't grow it pal.

Non non. C'est une vision individualiste et jouisseuse qui n'apparaît à aucun moment dans les débats sur la dépénalisation de l'ivg. 

C'était avant tout un débat de santé publique, d'intérêt de la société, pas de droit fondamental ou autre connerie individualiste. Relis les débats de l'époque pour constater que ça n'a pas grand chose à voir avec le droit des femmes à disposer de leur corps.

Parce que c'est l'intérêt de la société que de permettre à des familles aimantes d'adopter plus souvent. C'est aussi son intérêt de favoriser le renouvellement des générations. Bref, l'intérêt de la société prime sur l'intérêt de l'individu. 

D'un point de vue philosophique la vie doit toujours être favorisée sur la mort. Les sociétés de mort sont des sociétés qui meurent.

A bit like Microsoft coming up with the Symbol and Wingdings fonts, but because Japanese already uses so many characters there was space left to include emoji in the same font rather than a separate font. Then Apple realised that they needed to support emoji for the iPhone to sell in Japan, then people in Europe noticed that there was an emoji keyboard and started to use them.

&gt;On the contrary, I think she doesn't care (or she would have taken action already) and even worse, she has proactively exported the practice to places that previously did not have it/banned it, like Europe, so in fact she has proactively worsened climate change.

Rent is ridiculous in Munich. There is no way around it. Expect anything from &gt;€600 per month for rent alone. Food in supermarkets is cheaper than in the US. Beer in Restaurants ranges from €3 to €4.5 for 0.5l to €5.5 to €9 for 1l (legal drinking age for beer is 16 in Germany. Booze and wine 18), but depends on where you go. 

Traveling depends on where you go. 
Monthly public transport in Munich costs around €60, though I guess you can get a better deal as a student.

Long distance busses are cheap as fuck (e.g. Munich - Berlin around €22 one way). 
Since you're a car nut. Mercedes Benz and Porsche are located in or near Stuttgart. Bus to Stuttgart costs €20 one way. I haven't been to the plants, but I can imagine that Daimler and Porsche will have Museums too.

Train travel is a bit more expensive, except [Bayern Ticket](https://www.bahn.de/p_en/view/offers/national/regional/laender-tickets/bavaria-ticket.shtml). TL;DR = it's a ticket with unlimited travel by short to intermediate distance trains (no IC and ICE) and local busses for 24h for €23. Note that you can go to [Salzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg) in Austria with this ticket too.

I don't know if you're familiar with sports in Europe, but there are four different divisions in most CS leagues. Both CEVO and ESEA have a league. There has been a system in place for years actually, since 1.6 with CAL-O. Anyone can join ESEA-O division or CEVO-O (Actually for CEVO I think it's called ""CEVO FREE"") so there you can actually join a team and play actual competitive counter-strike.

Anything happening in a matchmake is a chaotic pug and rather meaningless. It's just a public pick up game. But yeah, so the first division:

Remember each season is 3 months long. 

* Open/Free - Anyone can create a team and compete
* Intermediate - Basically a filter into semi-pro, usually includes teams that make open playoffs last season
* Main - This is the beginning of competitive talent, usually. 
* Premier - This division exists in ESEA, it was made to basically field more teams from Pro. Now it exists as an extra buffer and an extra step before players/teams matriculate into the invite/pro division.
* Pro/Invite - This is where you make pro. I'll give you an example.

Let's look at the newest and most exciting player, perhaps the future of NA CS, kid has a very good attitude about CS, someone like Twistzz' going up the league rankings and compare his story/progression to what I told you about league play.

* January 2015 - Season 18: Twistzz joined an open team, did very well and just played CS on ESEA in pugs, also having a high pug rws (which, like it or not is how players stand out in NA)
* May 2015 - Season 19: Fast forward, Twistzz is on a main team the very next season, this is where his career could have stagnated and he could be like about 80-100 main players who will play for a decade and never get out of main. Twistzz had about 86 adr his first main season and showed a lot of promise, more so than just some kid with good aim
* Sep 2015 - Season 20: Twistzz same Main team get promoted to Premier, but there are some roster issues which result in players like Paul_Newman and Zander catching bans regarding the sale of the team and its spot in the premier division. Twistzz however, stayed in premier as his talent was recognized. He joined a team with impsta, Lucky and Zeck for the remainder of the season. They don't make playoffs, Twistzz did ok. Caught the eye of Ocean, who picks up a lot of young talent.
* February 2016 - Season 21: Twistzz gets picked up by SKDC/Kkona to play under Els and invert and with rooroo and ocean. Does ok, shows promise, finally made it to pro but probably on the worst team in the pro division.

Here, Jack Tourneur and Val ""The Pal"" Lewton craft a story (their third collaboration) which floats on another level of sublime B-movie-horror beauty. Ostensibly the story of a series of deadly attacks on (mostly Mexican, mostly young) women by an unseen beast (is it man? leopard? both?), Tourneur/Lewton blur the lines between reality and fantasy in highly economic ways. Through their daring suggestion of an entire boulevard of horror by just a puny streetlight and the ominous donut-eyes of the steel-black cat, they demonstrate the power of human creativity and ingenuity to wow audiences into fearful submission and artistic appreciation. 

What's most brilliant about *Leopard Man*—aside from its stark beauty in magnificent setpieces like a girl's death (suggested through milk-chocolate-y blood seeping through the girl's mother's door) and a ballroom dance (where the exotic and the erotic melt into one another, imperceptibly)—is its prescient look at the undervalued, underprivileged loner/outsider/maverick in a civilized Western society. For Lewton and Tourneur in *Cat People*, it was the Eastern European. In *I Walked With a Zombie*, it was abused housewives and African-Americans. Here, it's the Mexicans of an increasingly homogenized society derived from Conquistador days....except, now, the new Conquistadors are the white intellectuals in power, and the new Indians are the Mexicans. Quite subtle, doesn't make its political and social aspirations blatant, weaves them into the tapestry of the much-more-engaging artistic sphere.

It works *because* it doesn't call attention to itself. You don't need that part to fully appreciate what the film is doing. Lewton and Tourneur's commitment are totally within a realm of B-movie goodness: ""How do we tell this yarn the best way?"" Because their aims are so seemingly humble, they manage to transcend their genre in astoundingly ingenious ways.","""I don't care how she votes, I'm going to marry her!""",0,TrueFilm,2,t5_2szp0,1468756041,,False,0,False,,d3stphu

UNTIL a month ago Dan Condrea was, to all appearances, a successful Romanian businessman. His company, Hexi Pharma, made a healthy income supplying disinfectant to Romanian hospitals. That was before a team of journalists revealed that Hexi Pharma had been diluting its products, possibly causing patients to die from antibiotic-resistant infections. On May 22nd Mr Condrea drove his car into a tree. Witnesses said he was going over 60mph, and police said there were no signs of an attempt to brake. It took over a week to confirm that the badly damaged body was his.

The public reaction since the scandal broke in late April has been furious. The health minister was forced to resign on May 9th after he tried to play down the seriousness of the situation. The health ministry has withdrawn all Hexi Pharma products from hospitals.

Journalists began looking into hospital supplies after another scandal, a fire in Bucharest last October at a nightclub that violated safety regulations. The fire left 27 dead at the scene; a further 37 died later, and doctors said many had succumbed to infections picked up in hospital. Reporters at Gazeta Sporturilor, a sports newspaper, found that disinfectant supplied by Hexi Pharma had been diluted, in some cases to just one-tenth of the concentration on the label.

“People here didn’t realise what a killing machine many Romanian hospitals are,” says Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a Romanian corruption expert. Over the past nine years Hexi Pharma has had contracts to supply more than 350 hospitals across Romania, including two of Bucharest’s biggest emergency hospitals. The disinfectant it sold was often heavily marked up in price.

Hexi Pharma was indicted last month, and Mr Condrea had been due to be questioned by prosecutors the day after the crash. Many have asked how a small company managed to win so many public contracts. A report by the same group of journalists accuses hospital directors of taking a 30% cut of contracts with Hexi Pharma, and suggested that this practice is widespread in the Romanian health-care sector.

Romania ranks near the bottom in Europe on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, yet recently the country has been trying to clean up its act. Last year Romania’s National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA) prosecuted more than 1,250 people, including a former prime minister, five ministers and 16 members of parliament. The DNA’s director, Laura Codruta Kovesi, says the health-care sector is a priority target. For many in Romania, however, the Hexi Pharma scandal is proof that change is not happening fast enough.

Sweden has had the highest rate of reported rapes in Europe since at least 2010 but this is because, in 2005, they changed the legal peramitors and have made moves to get people actually reporting thier assaults. They arguably have the broadest definition of rape and sexual assault in the world.
They last study on immigrants and rape in the country was back in 2005 (a long time ago in terms of public perception of rape) and it concluded that foreigners were 5x more likely to commit a rape than a Swede born to Swedish parents. So this includes Arabs but also includes Americans, Australians, Africans, other Europeans, etc (the only exception was East Asians ). 
So obviously these attacks are serious and need to be addressed and, although the cultural context need a to be aknowledge and dealt with, it's ridiculous (and dangerous for women as well who still get attacked by people of all colours and creeds) to pretend that sexual assault is just an Arab/Muslim import.",,0,Feminism,4,t5_2qr7i,1468756359,,False,0,False,,d3sudsi

That mystery is the Brabant killers in Belgium in the early/mid 1980s. From the little (English language) source material I've found I can in no way shape or form make any sense of those events. At minimum three individuals were involved, causing 28 deaths and 40 injuries over 19 robberies (where money or goods seemed of little concern- they dumped out money after a few robberies and others had very minimal cash/goods rewards). No material I've seen online can identify any of the perpetrators, nor motive. 

There has been some info linking these events to fascist/neo-nazi groups and similar minded groups 'left behind' after WW2 to combat any Soviet invasion/ grow of left-wing governments or movements, but it doesn't fit with other events across Europe involving such groups in the 1970s/1980s. I can't see it being a leftist group, nor a religious cult/extremists- no group 'claimed' any of the events and nothing appeared ritualistic about them.

All in all I find it exceptionally baffling and have to consciously remind myself they were really events, not fiction.

I hope this is posted in the right place, first time I've ever used Reddit!

To think that the statistics are similar across all the groups you mentioned (excluding East Asians) is a willful delusion. Unfortunately there are many who simply refuse to admit there is a problem.

An interesting thing in that answer is the mention that traditions may differ less than expected in the final result as the difference in the presence of spaces is somewhat reversed by a difference in bearing (i.e. French tradition is to put a thin space but have less left bearing for the next character while ""English"" tradition is to avoid the space but have a bigger bearing for the next character).

Many Germans incorrectly believe that copyrights cannot be abandoned. The actual situation in German law is that ""Nutzungsrechte"" (literally ""usage rights"") include the rights of copying, modification, distribution, etc.; these rights can be waived, as in other countries. ""Urheberrechte"" (literally ""originator rights"") include reputation rights and generally cannot be waived, but this protection against fraud, libel, etc. has nothing to do with whether something is in the public domain. Beware that many sources (including Google Translate) mistranslate ""Urheberrecht"" as ""copyright""; this contributes to the common confusion among Germans on this topic.

That's an interesting question. Overall, I think there is one aspect of the conversation that has made me more pessimistic for the future.

And that is that there is at least one articulate, educated person who simply cannot accept that an abhorrent dislike of the way that Israel is handling the settlement issue is based on anything other than antisemitism and a desire for the destruction of Israel.

I'm sure you absolutely believe this: ""nothing Israel will do will change your opinion either, your problem with Israel fundamentally lies with the fact that it exists."" and it is extraordinary.

A) Fullfils all the legal criteria (has been pernamently living here for a long time period, speaks the language at least on B2 level, pass the Czech culture/geography/politics/society test and so on)

B) Accepts our legal and political system and basic (secular and liberal) values.

It also doesn't mean that he/she respects our values in the public life, but wants to keep applying his/her own values in private lifes. I mean, if you want to sort out your family affairs by Sharia law, then do it in a muslim majority country, not in the Czech republic. The Czech republic should guarantee all its citizens fair and equal treatment, no matter what their religion is, so if you're not ready to accept that your daughters should have exactly the same rights as your sons, you should not be living here. The political/legal system and the basic values of our society must come first and only after that your religion.

If you are willing to respect this 100%, then I don't care what your skin colour, nationality or religion is, you can become Czech.

Certainly some will pay more than others and some will take out - of course I accept that. Taking EU migrants as a whole though they make a net contribution of over £2.5bn. The net benefit is to be expected as there are limits on what benefits EU migrants can claim and in order to enter and reside in the UK they have to be employed, or seeking employment so they are more likely to be in work.

The same applies to UK residents. Some will make a net contribution, while others will not work. Overall though UK citizens take out more than they pay in. 

&gt;And then some who do just okay but it displaces people that could otherwise do that job before wage compression kicked in? People who we otherwise still have to socially support.

Nationally we have low levels of unemployment and wages are rising faster than inflation, so its not a big issue IMO. 

There are places with higher unemployment and I don't think we  should assume all these people would be willing to relocate or take minimum wage, temporary or part time work if EU migrants weren't taking them. Due to our attractive welfare system many of our own wouldn't want that type of work. IF we left the EU we would still need migration to service our economy - see the article below which is quite balanced.

Everything was great until the day after our wedding when we had a huge fight on our honeymoon.  We made up after about a day, and after about a week, just as things were returning to normal, we had an even bigger fight!  It was very scary, because we had never really fought before, and it was happening right at the start of our marriage.

We talked about it, decided we still loved each other and were committed to making it work, and perservered.  Things were tense for a few weeks but slowly improved, and after a month we were happier than ever.  Next month is our two year anniversary, and while we still have fights occasionally, each one is less scary than the last because we know we can overcome it.

My point is, do you think you can convince him to wait a bit before making a decision?  You say he freaked out, maybe it's a mistake to act while the emotions are so strong.

Cum sunt student caut chestii ce se fac rapid si in ultimul timp urmaresc videouri de al lui Jamie Oliver si am dat intr-o zi peste acesta 

https://goo.gl/A61D6O 


Dar cum nu am timp si toate ingredientele lui am zis sa reinventez un pic reteta.

Cum am facut eu :

-cheeseburger (gata facuti de la lidl)

-cascaval ( daca vrei mai mult decat ce iti ofera cheesburgerul)

-bacon

-ceva legume (salata,rosii,ceapa,ardei rosu)

-sos barbecue sau ketchup-mustar am mai folosit.

-cartofi (optional)

Modul de prepareare

Mai intai am incins tigaia (daca ai una grill ii perfect dar merge si cu celelalte)
Pun cateva felii de bacon, dupa care pun si chifteaua sa se incalzeasca si ceapa o pun intr-un colt cu un pic de ulei (inele sau felii mari).

Scot baconul, intorc chifteaua si pun cascavalul pe ea dupa care acopar cu un bol, pun  si chiteaua de la burger in grasimea de la bacon. Se rumeneste foarte frumos dar aveti grija sa nu o ardeti. 

Montaj.

Chifla de jos &gt; salata &gt;rosii felii subtiri&gt;ardei&gt;ceapa&gt;bacon&gt;sos&gt;Chifteaua cu branza topita pe ea&gt; sos&gt;chifla de sus

Am pus si cartofi mici la cuptor cu condimente. 

Timp total 30 de minute cu cartofi (daca faci si cartofi incepe sa pregatesti burgerul 5-10 minute inainte sa fie gata cartofii).
