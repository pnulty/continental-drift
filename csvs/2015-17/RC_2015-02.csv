True, but Europe also has lower rates of church attendance and a larger fraction of their population identifies as non-believers. And that's my point - the fact that attitudes have changed doesn't negate the fact that they were 'inherited' from the colonizing powers.

And it also supports my general thesis - medical culture bends to reflect societies' attitudes. In the US, when medicine was moving from a traditional to scientific basis, doctors already believed that circumcision was good and homosexuality was bad, so circumcision was deemed 'more hygienic' and homosexuality was a 'mental illness'. In the UK at the same time, circumcision was more of a passing fad of the upper class and homosexuality was bad, so homosexuality was also a 'mental illness' there, while circumcision was treated as a purely religious issue.

And the fact that there's so much turnover of justification strongly supports that the UK happened to be correct on this one point - every generation of American men gets circumcised, but for a different reason, every generation of doctors thinks to older justifications are silly, but the new one is rock-solid. The strongest historical reason was probably cervical cancer - properly done epidemiological studies in the US supported it - and then the HPV-cancer link was discovered and when corrected for, the link disappeared. Then all of the sudden it's time to make HIV the justification *du jour*.

Or as I once heard it put: Circumcision is a cure in search of a disease.

&gt;Online doctors gave me good non-emotional information. Intactivists were extremely emotional and lacked good information.

Doctors are more likely to be calm and objective sounding than activist groups, yes. So if you want to make a good comparison go talk to doctors who are opposed - ask those European medical groups why they disagree with their American peers, and skip the online no-nothings.

&gt;Because infants won't remember the procedure.

Again, give me some other situation where that argument is generally accepted. In every example I can come up with - from 'borrowing' someone's car while their on vacation to having sex with an unconscious person - 'they don't remember' simply isn't a defense.",1422748817,0,2,

I'd love to make some random OPMs with awesome ideas that I can carry to glory. Some ideas:

### Tahiti/Samoa/Maori/Hawaii

A Polynesian OPM with incredible naval ideas. The easternmost Polynesians actually probably reached the New World.

**Government:** Tribal despotism for each except Maori, who get tribal federation instead

**Religion:** Animism

**Tech group:** Mesoamerican (unfortunately there is no way around this, unless they introduce a shittier tech group than Chinese for Asia)

**Traditions:**

- -10% naval attrition
- Conquistadors and explorers readily available

**Ideas:**

- +5% discipline
- +1 colonist
- -15% ship costs
- +2 yearly naval tradition
- +10% morale of armies
- +25% naval forcelimits
- +1 diplomatic relations

**Ambitions:**

- +40% morale of navies

### Győr

An unfortunate Hungarian OPM stuck between Austria and Hungary, with great defensive ideas. Historically, they burned down their city in the face of the Ottomans. That's why the Turkish name for it is ""Yanık kale"" (""burnt city"").

**Government:** Despotic monarchy

**Religion:** Catholicism

**Tech group:** Eastern

**Traditions:**

- +40% fort defense
- +10% morale of armies

**Ideas:**

- -25% mercenary cost
- +1 land leader shock
- -15% build cost
- +1 diplomatic reputation
- +1 leader without upkeep
- -20% advisor cost
- +1 land leader fire

**Ambitions:**

- +20% production efficiency

### Kalmyk Khanate

A contingent of Genghis Khan's army which settled in the northeast Caucasus. They became an OPM from 1630 to 1771, after which they got annexed by Russia. They have Oirat culture. Nowadays part of Russia, they speak the westernmost Mongolic language, and are fast disappearing.

**Government:** Steppe nomads

**Religion:** Buddhism

**Tech group:** Nomad

**Traditions:**

- +20% cavalry combat ability
- -33% core-creation cost

**Ideas:**

- +2 tolerance of heathens
- +10% fort defense
- +20% morale of armies
- -5% attrition
- +25% manpower recovery speed
- +1 land leader shock
- +5% discipline

**Ambitions:**

- +50% religious unity

EDIT: Also some funny ones based on particular themes or injokes:

### Revolutionaria

Based on the ""Reform society"" gag and the tendency for France to go multiple revolutionary, this OPM starts off entirely inside France, in a low basetax province. I tried to present the ideas in the opposite order that they would be useful.

**Government:** Revolutionary republic

**Religion:** Reformed

**Tech group:** Western

**Traditions:**

- -15% accepted culture threshold
- -10% culture-conversion cost

**Ideas:**

- +20% religious unity
- +2 yearly prestige (I guess if you've managed to survive this long, you've earned it)
- +2 tolerance of the true faith
- +2 yearly legitimacy
- Lowered impact on stability from diplomatic actions
- -1 national unrest
- +1 yearly republican tradition

**Ambitions:**

- -20% stability cost modifier (reform society to your heart's content!)

### Minghulms

A crazy mix of the Ming, Mughals, and Ulm, replacing Ulm. Mashes together DDRJake's Minghals playthrough and the Ulm meme.

**Government:** Celestial empire

**Religion:** Sunni

**Tech group:** Chinese

**Traditions:**

- +10% yearly imperial authority
- -25% core-creation cost

**Ideas:**

- -20% stability cost modifier
- -10% idea cost
- +35% religious unity
- +5% discipline
- +1 diplomatic relations
- +10% production efficiency
- -15% mercenary cost

**Ambitions:**

- +30% better relations over time

### Tartarus Ardens

You are not quite an OPM. Rather, you own sixteen provinces, all completely disjoint: two completely surrounded by Poland and Lithuania, two completely surrounded by France, two completely surrounded by Castile, one completely surrounded by the Ottomans and another bordering them, two completely surrounded by the Timurids, two buried in India, two completely surrounded by Ming, and two completely surrounded by the Aztecs. The only saving grace? Many of your provinces produce gold. Too bad you're animist! Your capital starts in the Aztecs, and, if possible all your European provinces are already part of the HRE. Your culture is Gothic.

**Government:** Steppe nomads (alternatively, Empire)

**Religion:** Animism

**Tech group:** Nomad (alternatively, Mesoamerican)

**Traditions:**

- +20% cavalry combat ability
- -20% stability cost modifier

**Ideas:**

- -10% core creation cost
- -5% idea cost
- +15% trade steering
- +20% morale of navies (heheheheheh)
- +25% land forcelimits
- -10% technology cost
- +2% missionary strength

**Ambitions:**

 [**Advanced Landing Ground**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced%20Landing%20Ground): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;__Advanced Landing Ground (ALG)__ was the term given to the temporary [advance airfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_airfield) constructed by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in support of the invasion of Europe. They were built in the UK prior to the invasion and thereafter in [North West Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(WWII\)#1944.E2.80.9345:_The_Second_Front) from 6 June 1944 to [V-E Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day), 7 May 1945.

&gt;Unlike the permanent airfields built in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and designed for the [strategic bombardment of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing), the tactical combat airfields on the continent were temporary, often improvised airfields to be used by the tactical air forces to support the advancing ground armies engaged on the battlefield. Once the front line moved out of range for the aircraft, the groups and squadrons moved up to newly built ALGs closer to the ground forces and left the ones in the rear for other support uses, or simply abandoned them.

Already people think the 1873 Long Depression: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Depression was in part caused by the sudden jump in industrial productivity. The price of iron and other industrial products suddenly dropped like a brick, and many people could not find jobs. 

Interestingly intellectual jobs and services like office workers were in high demand throughout the Long Depression. And their pay even went up. As industrialization did not affect them. But in 1873 there were not enough of those types of jobs to prevent a collapse of the job market.

Some people think Japan's now over 20 years of economic troubles are partly related to automation. Lots of other reasons too, but part of the reasons many young people can't find work, is probably automation.

Many people think the drop of median household income in the US, the last 20 years, is in part thanks to automation. It is worth nothing that labor's share of income is dropping all over the world, even in places like Mexico and China. Source: http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21588900-all-around-world-labour-losing-out-capital-labour-pains So you can't blame that drop on offshoring.


So we are in for a huge global depression. Which may have already been in Japan for most of the last 20 years, is now hitting the EU, complete with deflation. And may return to hit the US. And once it also spreads the currently fast growing developing economies like China and India, we are economically speaking totally fucked. 

That will probably reduce the energy we use, as depression always tend to reduce the energy we use. But it does not matter. It's *already* too late to prevent climate change.

&gt;

&gt;A __mil__ (pronounced ""*meal*"") is a [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) of [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance), most often used to measure [geographic distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_distance), very common in [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), though not used in [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark), and only occasionally used in [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) by the [Swedish-speaking population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish-speaking_Finns). Today, it measures by definition 10 [kilometres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilometres), (≈6.2 (statute) miles) but earlier in history it had different values.  

&gt;The word is derived from the same source as [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) [mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile), a measurement which historically has had many different definitions throughout Europe. In Sweden and Norway, a (statute) mile is often called ""engelsk mil"", lit. English mil(e).

&gt;A __debtors' prison__ is a [prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison) for [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) who are unable to pay [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt). Through the mid 19th century, debtors' prisons (usually similar in form to locked [workhouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouses)) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe.  Destitute persons unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be sentenced to these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labor or secured outside funds to pay the balance; the product of their labor went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the [history of bankruptcy law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bankruptcy_law) have made prison terms for unaggravated [indigence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigence) illegal over most of the world; the [US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Constitution), for example, explicitly forbids incarceration as punishment for indigence.

For all we know, both battles go differently, and the Sixth Army is never captured, and/or the Germans effectively breach the Soviet defenses at Kursk (which they were close to OTL). 

If lend-lease doesn't happen, then the Soviets have to [produce the following themselves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease):

* 427,284 trucks
* 13,303 combat vehicles
* 35,170 motorcycles 
* 2,328 ordnance service vehicles
* 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products (gasoline and oil),
* 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs (canned meats, sugar, flour, salt, etc.)
* 1,900 steam locomotives
* 66 Diesel locomotives
* 9,920 flat cars
* 1,000 dump cars
* 120 tank cars

And so on.

Alternatively, German industry does not get bombed as heavily - yes, as you said, the British were still extremely effective against industry, but the US's air command was responsible for about 55% of the bombs dropped on Germany, and about 60% of all enemy aircraft downed in World War 2 (versus the British). These effects, coupled with no D-Day or Italian campaign would have huge effects on the Soviet front even after Stalingrad and Kursk. Would it result in a huge Soviet defeat? Probably not. But I just cannot look at the numbers between Lend Lease and the American contribution to the European war and believe that removal of both would result in the Soviets and British winning the war in any sort of reasonable fashion. 

Also, some of your pro-soviet points are based on our timeline, and not an alternative timeline minus American involvement. Without lend-lease, some of those 80,000 T-34s aren't produced because they are building jeeps and locomotives instead of T-34s. Furthermore, the Germans produce many more Pz IVs, Panthers, and Tigers because their industry is not as damaged due to no US bombing. In 1945, the Germans still get the Me 262, which was devastating against allied air power (16 : 1 kill ratio when they were able to launch - but by the time they came out, air superiority ensured that most were killed on the ground). 

Given the German technical superiority, I strongly believe that by 1946 or 1947, they are able to solidify their front lines against the Soviets and force them into a peace treaty, losing the Ukraine, Belarus and other territories. Not a total victory, but a victory nontheless.",1422753152,0,1,

&gt;Businesses generally give to both LEFT and RIGHT. And if you think the unions really care about the workers you're really mistaken. The right believes that the best way to.help everyone its less regulations and freer markets.

Yeah, but they mostly appeal to the right. Evidently they have to toe the line of public perception and prepare for the worst-case scenario—but it's quite obvious which party is so far down business's pockets that they're one and the same.

&gt;Big businesses like more regulations because that makes it harder for new businesses and small businesses to compete due to the higher costs of doing business. I'm stop tired of people thinking and spreading the lies that the right doesn't care about people just big business. GE, Apple, Microsoft and a lot more businesses and their officers give to liberal causes and candidates.

I wish this were the case, but it's no so. Don't get me wrong, I think you'll find mutual agreement from both sides that small-businesses need to be able to both form and thrive in order to have true innovation and competition that creates markets of competing prices. Instead what we have are mega-conglomerates both seeking deregulation—whether it's environmental or conservation restrictions holding them back, or financial regulations in the form of Glass-Steagall (Yeah I know, Clinton, but that's beside my point). Auto makers certainly didn't like the new EPA restrictions in the '70s. Businesses like Koch certainly aren't complaining about deregulation in terms of campaign finances. So to tell me that businesses like deregulation is by and large a joke. Yeah, there's some points that it stifles small businesses from competing, but the reality is that they only care about their bottom-line. And when regulation bars them from forming trusts or monopolies, that has a much larger impact than a small business will. I recommend you watch The Corporation as an introduction to negative externalities and the effects of deregulation and privatization.

Your deregulation leads to the exploitation of workers as found in the era of industrialization and presently elsewhere in the world. Obviously there's a balance, but the extreme seen from the right practically endorses both under-the-table and open corruption.

&gt;GE, Apple, Microsoft and a lot more businesses and their officers give to liberal causes and candidates. 

Yeah that's true, they do. Democrats tend to support technological innovation more so than the GOP. Provided all of these companies are not only comprised of younger and highly educated professionals who largely reside in liberal epicenters (CA, CT) it doesn't surprise me. And by the way, according to the very site everyone is referencing here, GE has given overall more to the GOP.

&gt;Edit: unions give to liberal causes because liberals preserve the union bosses power. The people in the union don't have any control over who they give money to. Plus, in some liberal states, union membership is mandatory. 

Regardless if you have a problem with this, then there's a *direct* dissonance in that those on the right embrace the decisions of CEOs, owners, and shareholders—for the same applies for them. Understand that 1)Just as there is bad business, there are bad unions; and unions are all but gutted from what they used to be or are even comprised of elsewhere in the world (such as northern Europe). And 2) Following the same principle corporations, unions act as a balancing arm toward the power of the employer. Collective bargaining was kind of a big deal, and there is zero reason it's a non-issue today any more than it was foolishly considered a non-issue back then during industrialization.",1422755612,0,1,

There are things that do back it up.

Good education, social services, infrastructural growth, etc. And this was even AFTER the many costs of the Iran-Iraq War. But that's Khomeini for you. Though the first thing that happened after the war was the old contractors and developers started swarming the country like flies again.

&gt;I mean, if there's one country that telegraphs health &amp; stability, it was Iraq following the Iran-Iraq War.

Well, it was stable, so your point? 

Also, I didn't ignore the Iran-Iraq War, because I didn't want to open another can of worms. But in reality, it only supports my point. Even after that, Iraq was still pretty solid. Imagine if there wasn't? It would be much better in 1990 than it actually was, but even despite the Iran-Iraq War, Iraq was still on top of the developing world.

Historically it's been easier to get complete protein from anything but meat but that doesn't mean meat itself is to thank.

Bullshit myth is bullshit.

&gt;When a complete protein can be crammed in a chocolate bar, you probably won't go back to meat.

Yes, I will. Meat is a better way to get protein.

&gt;It's too risky and has as many downsides as ups.

Again, bullshit myth is bullshit.

Meat is only bad for you in extreme amounts. Just like any food. The studies which are used to 'prove' that meat is bad for you are all american-centric and are all based on the consumption of a ridiculously high meat intake which very few people, even in the US, commit to.

The Icelandics, Germans, French and Italians eat plenty of red, white and game meats as well as fish, and they have some of the best (if not the best) life expectancy rates and health rates in the western world.

There are areas of Italy and Iceland where the life expectancy is up in the mid to high 90's for both men and women, who all swear by eating meat, dairy and fish products as part of their diets.

And dont even get me started on people like the African tribes in West Africa like the Maasai people, who eat so much meat and fat that their intake is several times that of Europeans and even americans.

You would have thought that they would have been getting all the nasty things associated with high meat intake, like cancer and heart disease etc etc?

No, they have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, levels of those diseases *in the world*. 

This just goes to show that it is not *meat* that is to blame, it is the additives and other bullshit that is pumped non-stop into US meat and dairy products that causes the health implications. And as the studies are almost all US-centric, so you can bet the test subjects are eating US meat and dairy products.",1422755984,0,-7,

First column is age 7 IQ. Second is age 17 IQ. Third is age 17 GPA. Fourth is age 17 class rank(percentile) Fifth is age 17 school aptitude(percentile.

Also, see the Flynn Effect for a better reading on these numbers. It's in the article.

What this tells me is that obviously, there are differences between the races. These were children adopted by upper middle class white families in Minnesota. Therefore negating any leftist argument of socioeconomics and broken homes or whatever other excuse they want to come up with.

&gt;The adopting parents of 12 of the interracial children wrongly believed that their adopted children had two black parents. The average IQ of these 12 children was not significantly different from the scores of the 56 interracial children correctly classified by their adoptive parents as having one black and one white parent.[1]

Now, this doesn't say which parent is which race. But, lets assume that the mother is white. As seen at then end of the study, white mothers and black fathers produce generally intelligent kids. Is it the genes from the mother giving the intelligence? Is it that white women are better caretakers for children then African-American women? I believe it is the intelligence factor from the white woman. We have tons of anecdotes where half-breeds are generally intelligent and have good success in life. Is this because of the white mother with her genes? My guess is, yes. As I said, IQ is what determines the culture, the culture does not determine IQ

[Also, the Bell Curve.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)

&gt;IQ scores have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement.

&gt;IQ scores have predictive validity for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled.

&gt;There is little evidence to show that childhood diet influences intelligence except in cases of severe malnutrition.

The Bell Curve is hotly debated, but IMO it is debated because they know the authors were on to something and it would have destroyed the narrative that we are all the same, just different colors. People get shunned all the time. 

Like Dr. James Watson. A great man. One of the greatest scientists in of this century is shunned. He had to sell his Nobel Prize. Why? People are scared of the truth. They know that their views of egalitarianism were about to be shattered, so lets shun the man who brings these ""radical views.""

The argument of socioeconomic status is the cause for the negros low IQ has been disproven time and time again. IQ is what determines the culture, the culture does not determine IQ. Do you think if Europeans and Asians were to have the same IQ as Africans, [which is 70,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxAhwYoZQKU) that we would be living in this society we are in today?

The typical leftist response to IQ tests is that the negro doesn't know anything on the test. That they are ""white IQ tests"" therefor making the negro fail by default as the white man made the test to prove his superiority. But if that's the case, why do Asians score higher?

I look at the advancements of Africans over time. Pretty much the same throughout history. Not really anything. No wheel, boat, or written language.

For instance, Africans have longer limbs, can sprint for longer distances and have higher stamina. This works out with what they had to do in Sub-Saharan Africa. They had to chase food, chuck spears etc. For the most part, African climate stayed the same pretty much all year round. They didn't have to plan ahead. Could this be the reason that so many negros are so impulsive?


Then what would have become Europeans migrated north, they had the elements to contend with. They had to plan ahead. They had to be strategic with their food as to not be wasteful. Also, body hair came as an advantage to help keep them warm. Also, Europeans have medium length limbs.

Asians (Mongloids) had to contend with the cold. They have shorter limbs as there is less surface area, so it'd be easier for them to get warm. Their eyes are that way from fat deposits to help keep them warm.

[Europeans are closer to Neanderthals than Africans are: Ancient DNA in humans is due to species interbreeding after man left Africa](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2599854/Europeans-closer-Neanderthals-thought-Ancient-DNA-humans-species-interbreeding-outside-Africa.html)

&gt;Last week, scientists said that modern Europeans share a number of genes involved in the build-up of certain types of fat with Neanderthals. 
The same genes were not seen in people from Asia and Africa, however.
It is thought that ancient genes might have helped Europeans adapt better to colder climates, giving them an evolutionary advantage.
This is the first time we have seen differences in lipid concentrations between populations,’ said evolutionary biologist Philipp Khaitovich the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and the CAS-MPG Partner Institute for Computational Biology in Shanghai, China.
‘How our brains are built differently of lipids might be due to Neanderthal DNA.’

[Ancient DNA shows earliest European genomes weathered the Ice Age: Neanderthal interbreeding clues and a mystery human lineage](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141106143719.htm)

&gt;The study also uncovers a more accurate timescale for when humans and Neanderthals interbred, and finds evidence for an early contact between the European hunter-gatherers and those in the Middle East -- who would later develop agriculture and disperse into Europe about 8,000 years ago, transforming the European gene pool.
Scientists now believe Eurasians separated into at least three populations earlier than 36,000 years ago: Western Eurasians, East Asians and a mystery third lineage, all of whose descendants would develop the unique features of most non-African peoples -- but not before some interbreeding with Neanderthals took place.

[Why Am I Neanderthal?](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/neanderthal/)

&gt;Everyone living outside of Africa today has a small amount of Neanderthal in them, carried as a living relic of these ancient encounters. A team of scientists comparing the full genomes of the two species concluded that most Europeans and Asians have between 1 to 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. Indigenous sub-Saharan Africans have no Neanderthal DNA because their ancestors did not migrate through Eurasia. 

Now, how does all of this say that low IQ dictates culture and not vice versa? The fact that some people say that culture dictates IQ makes me believe that they don't understand evolution.

Look at Europeans and Asians. They had to weather extremely cold climates. They had to plan ahead. They generally had to be on their toes all the time because of the harsh climates of Europe and Asia. 

Now lets get to the negro. They stayed in one place. Their climate allowed for basically the same food to grow year round. They didn't have to plan ahead. Sound familiar? In my opinion, the negro is this way for 2 reasons.

[1 No Neanderthal DNA.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140129-neanderthal-genes-genetics-migration-africa-eurasian-science/)

&gt;Both teams found that non-African genomes have large continuous ""deserts"" that are totally devoid of Neanderthal DNA. These regions include genes such as FOXP2, which is involved in motor coordination and could play an important role in human language and speech.

2 No extremes in climate.

I truly believe that how Europeans and Asians had to weather such extremes in the places they lived brought us to where we are today. They had to plan ahead. The negro didn't. This is the reason for their low IQ. They were never challenged, no Neanderthal DNA and a steady hardly ever changing climate. It is theorized that when the Europeans went north into what is now Europe, they mated with Neanderthals. The old Hominids were violent. They killed off the Neanderthals.

Now lets think to today. Blacks have higher testosterone then every race. High testosterone is linked to aggressive behavior. Also, think to how blacks always say they didn't do it or some variation thereof. It is because they lack abstract thought. So along with the lack abstract thought, high testosterone, low iq, all of the cited sources about no Neanderthal DNA, their lack of being in a cold climate, among other things is the reason for the way the negro is. The low IQ drives this.

So the speech he gave on Egypt addressing Muslims directly? Not an auspicious start for you.

&gt; As a student of history, I also know civilization’s debt to Islam

That Islamic worshipping motherfucker! We must string him up by his ankles and exec--

&gt; As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam.  It was Islam -- at places like Al-Azhar -- that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment.  It was innovation in Muslim communities -- (applause) -- it was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.  Islamic culture has given us majestic arches and soaring spires; timeless poetry and cherished music; elegant calligraphy and places of peaceful contemplation.  And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.  (Applause.)

Oh, he's referring to the well-known historical fact of Muslims keeping European lore safe during the Dark Ages, and giving a good old Western wank to the glorious Renaissance in the process.

Dude, *I* know that. Everybody knows that. It's not a sin to compliment Muslims on a job well done here. What else?

&gt; 5 “Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.”

Is he *blind*? Doesn't he see what's going on? What the hell is he even talking about?

&gt; Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.  We see it in the history of Andalusia and Cordoba during the Inquisition.  I saw it firsthand as a child in Indonesia, where devout Christians worshiped freely in an overwhelmingly Muslim country.  That is the spirit we need today.  People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind and the heart and the soul.  This tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it's being challenged in many different ways.

Oh, he's talking about tolerance of all religions, and his experiences as a Christian in a Muslim-majority country. Alright then. But surely he's still plotting the overthrow of the West?

&gt; 7 “we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities”

We cannot stand for this brainwashing! Revolución! Down with the republic!

&gt; On education, we will expand exchange programs, and increase scholarships, like the one that brought my father to America.  (Applause.)  At the same time, we will encourage more Americans to study in Muslim communities.  And we will match promising Muslim students with internships in America; invest in online learning for teachers and children around the world; and create a new online network, so a young person in Kansas can communicate instantly with a young person in Cairo.

... oh, he's talking about student exchanges between America and Muslim-majority countries to expand international ties. That almost sound like a goddamn normal thing when you pet it in context, huh.

&gt; I made clear that America is not – and never will be – at war with Islam.

No joke here. Good. I don't want the US to go to war with a billion people.

&gt; I also know that Islam has always been a part of America’s story

My shtick is starting to get old Context:

&gt; &gt;  also know that Islam has always been a part of America's story.  The first nation to recognize my country was Morocco.  In signing the Treaty of Tripoli in 1796, our second President, John Adams, wrote, ""The United States has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Muslims.""  And since our founding, American Muslims have enriched the United States.  They have fought in our wars, they have served in our government, they have stood for civil rights, they have started businesses, they have taught at our universities, they've excelled in our sports arenas, they've won Nobel Prizes, built our tallest building, and lit the Olympic Torch.  And when the first Muslim American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson -- kept in his personal library.  (Applause.)

Seriously, everything you've quoted is either perfectly reasonable to say when talking to a stadium full of Muslims, or a completely different thing from what you're implying when we actually add context. Not that you care about context because you're just a dittohead that heard these from Rush Limbaugh and began parroting them to everyone.

Your entire point is that Obama uttered 20 sentences that were sympathetic to Islam, so therefore, he's a secret Kenyan Muslim.

Here's a test:

1. Muslims are awesome.
2. Many Muslims-majority countries are fascinating.
3. A Muslim saved people during the French attack.
4. Muslims had one of the great civilizations in their time.

Now how many more before I, as an atheist, become a secret Kenyan Muslim? Does it need to be exactly 16 more, or is 10 ok?

Lets skip a bit ahead in the speech:

&gt; Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.  Tomorrow, I will visit Buchenwald, which was part of a network of camps where Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot and gassed to death by the Third Reich.  Six million Jews were killed -- more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today.  Denying that fact is baseless, it is ignorant, and it is hateful.  Threatening Israel with destruction -- or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews -- is deeply wrong, and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.

GODDAMN JEW SPY, SECRET KHAZAR, LET'S STRING HIM UP

Wait, was that a fucking moronic thing to say? Defending Jews doesn't actually make you a Jew? 

I'll leave you with the end of the speech you tried to twist:

&gt; I know there are many -- Muslim and non-Muslim -- who question whether we can forge this new beginning.  Some are eager to stoke the flames of division, and to stand in the way of progress.  Some suggest that it isn't worth the effort -- that we are fated to disagree, and civilizations are doomed to clash. Many more are simply skeptical that real change can occur.  There's so much fear, so much mistrust that has built up over the years.  But if we choose to be bound by the past, we will never move forward.  And I want to particularly say this to young people of every faith, in every country -- you, more than anyone, have the ability to reimagine the world, to remake this world.

&gt; All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort -- a sustained effort -- to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings.

&gt; It's easier to start wars than to end them.  It's easier to blame others than to look inward.  It's easier to see what is different about someone than to find the things we share.  But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.  There's one rule that lies at the heart of every religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.  (Applause.)  This truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian or Muslim or Jew.  It's a belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in the hearts of billions around the world.  It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.

I, for one, am satisfied with my secret Kenyan communist Muslim President.

&gt;Progressive taxation isn't a liberal idea, it's a progressive one - it's in the fucking name. And libertarians don't actually oppose progressive taxes, they just want to limit gross taxation, across all spectrums.

Uh huh. Except that progressive taxation **IS** a liberal idea. Remember FDR?

And no, Progressive Taxation is not the same as progressive as a political ideology. Progressive taxation means that the tax rates is progressive, e.g  developing gradually or in stages.

Also, most libertarians would frown upon progressive taxation. Even Gary Johnson argued against progressive taxation, but rather a Fair Tax, which is another way of saying flat tax.

&gt;They also support social welfare, at sustainable levels. And any liberal that also claims to support socialism is lying, as a core tenant of liberalism is personal property rights.

'Bitter Lake' is not as misleading as Curtis previous documentary 'The Power of Nightmares', a documentary that basically claimed that Al-Qaida was a myth, a propaganda nightmare invented by American neoconservatives.But even if Bitter Lake is more accurate than PoN, it is still a disingenuous piece of disinformation, and many claims in the movie are untrue or inaccurate generalizations.


One of Bitter Lakes central claims is that contemporary American and European politicians simplify the world into good and evil much more than they used to. But this is not true: simplifications and a narrative of good and evil were much more common in the past than they are today.

In the past politicians simplified more, largely because both politicians and the public were much less educated and there was much less information available. In addition, they were much more willing to use the division of good and evil. Consider these pairs of good and evil, depending on your perspective:

* Workers or Capitalists

* Communists or Fascists

* Atheists or Christians

* Americans or British/Spaniards/Japanese/Germans/Soviets/Russians

* etc, etc...

Such good or evil divisions were used all the time.

In contrast, Western politicians today bend over backwards NOT to simplify and divide into good and evil. Case in point is the treatment of Islamism/Islam. No matter how clearly the Islamists themselves keep reiterating that they are indeed killing and conquering because they truly believe Islam is the only right system of belief and the beliefs of all others are sinful, Western politicians say over and over that Islamist terrorism has ""nothing to do with Islam"". They keep making this claim because they do not want to be accused of creating simple divisions of good and evil.


Many other things in Bitter Lake are are wrong, misleading or propagandistic, but I will settle for this central point for now.


If you haven't seen it you will not know that Bitter Lake appears to be inspired by a documentary called 'House of Saud' made by PBS Frontline in 2005. The structure of the story is very similar and many clips are the same. The Frontline documentary is much more informative and accurate.

Towards the end of the war especially, Italy was basically occupied by the Germans. Once Mussolini was deposed, Nazi troops entered Italy to ensure it remained under Axis control. Initially, many Italians had supported Mussolini in the 1920s-30s, as he promised to bring Italy back to the glory days of the Roman Empire and sought to bring order to a country where a large chunk of the population was illiterate and dirt-poor. A country that had been largely divided and under foreign domination since the fall of Rome until the shaky unification of the peninsula in 1861. A country where every province and even town had its own language and culture, a country where violence was ubiquitous, land barons dominated and exploited the rural landscape, and poor farmers and craftsman emigrated in droves to countries such as the United States. A country where the people had never really been unified, where *campanilismo* and devotion to family trumped the obligation to the nation as a whole. A country that had experienced a large upsurge in political anarchists and socialists among the working class in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

 So, I imagine, Mussolini and his fascist ideology seemed like a lesser evil to many Italians. In the wake of the spread of Marxist and socialist philosophy, Italy saw a large communist movement among the working class that scared many of the middle class that would support fascism. Years later, during the Cold War, Italy had the largest communist party in Western Europe. So, in essence, the support for Mussolini and fascism was never even close to unanimous. After Mussolini allied with Nazi Germany and began increasingly subservient to Nazi interests as opposed to Italian interests (i.e., sending poorly equipped Italian troops to fight in Nazi-led battles, enacting Nazi racial laws despite the lack of widespread anti-Semitism in Italy and despite the obvious Nordicism of Nazi racial laws, etc.), as the war dragged on, and as Nazi Germans and Italian fascists committed atrocities on Italian soil, the Italian Resistance movement gained enough support that Italy experienced a ""civil war"" between fascists and the largely communist partisans. During the Nazi German occupation of Italy, Nazis would slaughter thousands of Italian civilians in reprisal for Italians partisan attacks. In many cases, such as in the Alps where partisans would utilize guerrillas tactics on Nazi troops, the civilians massacred by Nazis would be mostly women, children, the elderly, and the clergy, as most of the able-bodied men in the villages would take to the hills to fight as partisans against the Nazis and Italian fascists. This would occur in urban environments as well, such as Rome. The slaughter of civilians, rather than stopping the resistance, only built support for the resistance movement. Furthermore, many of the Italian troops that had been scripted to fight for Fascist Italy were taken prisoner as traitors and sent to camps by the Nazis after Mussolini was killed and Italy signed an armistice with the Allied forces. So, basically, it's a vast overgeneralization to say that Italy was an ""ally"" of Nazi Germany at this time. Politically, Italy had been an uneasy ally, but the alliance quickly became an occupation by the end of the war. 

But don't take my word for it. Read up on it:

Let's talk rocket science. In order to reach orbital velocity, a vehicle must be able to accelerate to about 7.5 kilometers *per second*. However, because of air resistance, gravity, and other factors, a vehicle needs the ability to increase its velocity by about 9.5 kilometers per second. In other words, it must have about 9.5 km/s of *delta-v*. Delta-v is a term meaning change in velocity. And there is an equation that tells us how much delta-v a vehicle has. 

Delta-v = *ve*ln(m0/m1) 

Where: 

*ve* = effective exhaust velocity, which is 9.81 m/s times the specific impulse of the engine. Specific impulse is a measure of efficiency.

m0 = initial mass of the vehicle, including propellant,

m1 = final mass of the vehicle, after using all propellant.

ln is the natural logarithm. 

So let's put some numbers through that equation, shall we? We know the payload you want - let's call it 1 kilogram for your cube. Then we'll need things like payload fairings, fuel tanks, an engine, and maybe some fins and maybe some paint.

I don't know how much all the fairings, fuel tanks, and fins will weigh, but let's just call it 50 kilograms. That's being very generous, I think, but we'll leave it. In reality, that number will probably be twice that.

And what about the engine? I don't know if there are any suitable rocket engines for the size and type we need, but let's just pretend we can get a nice RP-1/LOX rocket engine that can produce as much power with as much efficiency and weighs as much as the European Space Agency's [Aestus engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestus). That engine puts out 30 kilonewtons, weighs 111 kg, and has an ISP of 324. In reality, our engine will be much heavier than that because the design of the Aestus is suitable for operation in space, but to make it suitable for operation through the low atmosphere, it will need some heavier parts. But we'll just leave it.

We need to solve for m0 - which is the initial mass - when delta-v is equal to about 9.5 km/s. That tells us how big our rocket will be.  

The final mass of the vehicle is 1 kg + 50 kg + 111 kg = 162 kilograms. And remember, that's an impossibly low number. Keep that in mind. 

Plugging in all those numbers, we get an initial mass of 3,228 kilograms for the initial mass. That's more than 7,000 pounds. 

But there's a problem. The Aestus engine only puts out 6,600 pounds of thrust - our rocket won't even get off the ground. Let's go one step bigger. Let's jump up to a bigger engine - perhaps a RP-1/LOX engine that has similar specs to the as-of-yet unbuilt Aestus II engine that can put out 12,500 pounds of thrust. The engine weighs 138 kg, so let's make that substitution. I won't bore you with the math, but in order to get a rocket with a dry mass of 1 + 50 + 138 = 250 kg to orbit using an engine like that one (remember, it's so cutting edge it hasn't even been built yet), you need a rocket with an initial mass of 4,981 kilograms. 

That's more than 10,000 pounds. So that's the problem with orbit. 

You could, in theory, introduce staging to shed weight, but that adds a lot of complexity, as well as additional engines. 

If you just want to get something into space for a few minutes before it falls back down again, you just need a small sounding rocket. Something like one of the early [Aerobee rockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobee) ought to do the trick.",1422772075,0,3,

It may be a very small country, but it is very dense with a lot of variation and things to do. The biggest advantage is you can do a lot without wasting too much time getting from one place to another. 

Spend two days in Bruges. It's the most beautiful and best preserved medieval town In Belgium. It's not only a romantic get away, you will also find plenty of chocolatiers that sell Belgian chocolate over here.
From Bruges, it is not too far from the coast. If it is beautiful weather, you can always just go to the beach. Otherwise, you can easily spend the day hopping on and off the coast tram which runs the entire coast (65km). Just get a day pass and stop in such places as Knokke, De Haan, Oostende, Blankenberge De Panne.. Each village or town has it's own atmosphere. Knokke for example caters to the very rich while Blankenberge is where the working class spend their holidays.

Spend two day in Ghent. I think most Belgians would consider this their favourite town. It's almost as pretty as Bruges, but is more alive. It is probably the best example of a typical Flemish city that's got it all in a compact walkable centre: medieval architecture, kanaals, good local food, bier and other delicatessens such as jenever.

Spend four days in Antwerp. This is Belgiums second largest city and has a more metropolitan feel to it. This is the place for fashion, nightlife, museums.. It's also diamond capital of the world, but as a tourist don't expect too much of it. Except for the jewelleries, the diamond sector operates mostly behind closed doors and out of sight.
From Antwerp, you can always take the train to Amsterdam.

Brussels: This is not really a Belgian city anymore and is either a place you either love or hate. It's a quirky place of huge contrasts and I would only recommend spending extra time in Brussels if you prepare well in advance as most of worth while things to see and do aren't really advertised. Most tourists are sent to a disappointing little statue instead. Otherwise do a day trip to the Grande Place and the Sablon area if you are into Belgian chocolates. Visiting Pierre Marcolini is well worth it. 
The other advantage of Brussels are the high speed train connections to Paris and London.

Other places that might be of interest:

Durbuy: A picturesque village in the southern part of Belgium called the Ardennes. There area here is more hilly and is where Belgians go to hike, camp, kayak and other nature activities.

Ypres: WWI started 101 years ago resulting in Ypres being wiped off the map. It has been rebuilt since then and you can visit the museums, trenches, cemeteries and memorials dedicated to the war.

Bastogne (in the Ardennes): If you are more into WWII, this was an important sight in the battle of the Bulge. 

Spa (in the Ardennes). The wellness spas as we know them today got their name from this little village. Today, it is mostly known as the place where the F1 Spa-Francorchamps races are held. This is also the place to go if you want to try some skydiving.

During the summer, there will also be plenty of festivals going on everywhere. Some are free and small scale, for example in the parks or town squares. Others like the Gentse Feesten last ten days and take over the whole town. And there are of course the bigger music festivals such as Roch Werchter, Pukkelpop and Tomorrowland, though these are sold out very quickly.

Yes suiciding was a dick move, I get that, especially when you were already on such low health. But I feel like you don't really understand the whole story here.

This was on a day when I was in the middle of a very stressful time irl, so I thought playing some nice relaxing minecraft would help. I now realize that probably wasn't a wise decision.

The weather was quite poor outside at the time, and this isn't the first time I have gotten a poor connection because of weather. I thought when joining the game that poor might mean I would get 130ms or so. not 700ms at the best of points.

I was already disappointed when I found out that the best pve wasn't working (the main reason I had joined, ffa best pve best gamemode). I felt a bit better though after getting a decent cave and coming out with a fast horse, pow 3, and 5 gapples, and still iron man. I had to discard the horse bc I kept teleporting around the map due to the lag combining with the glitchiness of horses. So I figured, I probably won't win, but surely all this loot can at least get me one kill.

So what's the first player I find? a player in full diamond with pots and a horse.

I figured I could take you because I had lots of health and you had 3 hearts. however, as I mentioned earlier, I was getting 700ms at the best of times, which I should never be getting to an AS server, let alone an EU server. fighting horses at close range is hard enough without lag, with insane lag it is impossible.

So, purely out of anger about this game (as well as irl issues, as I said this was intended to be, ironically enough, a game to relax me), I suicided because I didn't feel you had really done anything to earn my gear at that time.

I understand that you would be upset about that. In your position so would I, especially not knowing the circumstances. I have said this before, but I have a temper, and sometimes (as in this case), it clouds my judgement and causes me to make poor decisions.

So I am sorry about suiciding.

I just wanted to post this because after I died you told me to fuck off, which clearly shows you were quite upset by my actions, and I understand if you don't entirely forgive me, but I just thought saying sorry and explaining why I did it might help to improve your opinion of me. I don't want any hard feelings between us. So I hope you can forgive me. Mistakes happen, I'm human.

Again, sorry for suiciding.

2. The great dying that happened due to the new diseases wiped out a HUGE portion of the population.

Entire civilizations may have disappeared in that time and without leaving behind writing we struggle to know much about how they lived at all. 

At the same time wars and invasions usually result in atrocities. This wouldn't be at all a unique occurrence.

I'm sorry to hear things aren't going well so I thought I would offer some advice.  

Everyone here seems to have covered this but if you aren't already getting some kind of therapy I highly recommend it, it's a great way to ground yourself and gain perspective you can't otherwise find.  Medication is also always an option but I personally don't recommend it, I've never met a person who medicates for a mental issue and seems happy with the results, and I've been through a few myself.
     
The other thing I highly recommend is that you try to meet new people, especially outside you're friend group.  It's difficult to do but if the people you know don't seem to like you I find the best thing to do is look elsewhere.  Posting to subreddits, forms, and other social network sights is a good way to find people who share your interests, talk to them, but get out as well, you're in college in Europe, a perfect environment to meet new people.  Stay after class, go to school events, volunteer for a club, whatever it takes.

The third thing is the most important.  You have to build your own inner fortitude, to be who you want to be, to do what you want to do, and know that that is all that matters.  If you don't want to be medicated or see a therapist for the rest of your life you need to prepare to be self-sufficient.  These kinds of problems never go away, but it's totally possible to live happily despite them. As you build yourself up you'll find that loneliness doesn't bother you nearly as much, you'll feel less anxiety and be more confident with people.  Believe that you can meet new friends.  Believe that you can be whoever you want to be.  Believe that you are capable.  You are.",1422783044,0,1,

Outside of dreamhack which life was unprepared for ForGG has been the beating stick of superior korean players. 

How is it uncalled for when it's basically true? Does Sacsri winning dreamhack randomly make him a top level zerg if he can't repeat the success? No. The same applies to ForGG. One good win doesn't cancel out a history of poor performance. One big win also doesn't earn you respect if you can't follow up on it. How many people respect Seed's GSL victory and commend him regularly? One and done. Seed is now obviously the weakest player in the majority of relevant games he plays in.

ForGG's win ratio against other Koreans over the course of his career is a meager 51%. Note that the guy has been living in europe for several years now and hasn't actually competed in Korea at a relevant level for even longer than that. He isn't even playing against top Koreans on a regular basis and he can barely manage a winning record.

Outside of his recent spike in success ForGG's record against other korean's is *barely* 50%. There are several foreigners with more success than him.

None of this would have mattered if Greece had stuck to the agreements put in place *instead* of having a fiscal union. Not to mention blatantly lie about it for many years.

The fact that this *could* have happened may be the result of the Euro not being a proper fiscal union, but the fact that it actually *has* happened has been the result of *corrupt Greece pulling a scam*.

Greece is not the innocent victim of the Big Bad Germans. If Greece did what they agreed to do when they voluntarily signed up for (other EU countries have happily stayed out of the Euro because they didn't want to), there would not have been a problem of this magnitude.

Of course we could have seen this coming a mile off. Letting Greece enter the Euro without a fiscal union was like giving a box of matches to a pyromaniac. But the naive idea was that it would speed up the process of Greece becoming a responsible modern and less corrupt Western nation, it wasn't some evil German scheme just to suck Greece dry.

In the end the Euro should either not have existed without a fiscal union, or only have existed between countries that can trust each other. Greece clearly could not be trusted enough for option #2, regardless of the question if that was a viable idea in the first place.

(Also, to call forcing Greece to get back in line a ""betrayal of the nation state"" when an actual fiscal union is basically ending the notion of a sovereign nation state is seems to be somewhat disingenuous unless you're arguing for abandoning the Euro altogether. Either way, opting into the Euro has always meant voluntarily giving up some sovereignty.)

One simple reason is that NATO was set up as a cold war military alliance, and with the end of the cold war its raison d’etre evaporated. Simply put, we no longer need it, and its drain on our resources. So, the NATO logic goes, we had better start making some reasons fast. Which is exactly what they are doing.

&gt;Another reason is the US’s aspiration for a ‘unipolar world’ in which it enjoys ‘full spectrum dominance’. These ideas are those of the neocons who enjoyed supremacy under the presidenices of George W Bush. But they have now become the core philosophy of the American Imperium – and Barack Obama adheres to them as firmly as ‘Dubya’ ever did.

I don't think this is the case. There is more to this than NATO's desire to be ""needed"", and the neocons pursuit of ‘full spectrum dominance’. Putin has pissed off the central bankers. He has also pissed off the Jews, who trash him, and one can only guess ""why?"".

There is the issue of BRICS, which undermines the IMF/the Fed/ European central banks, and there is the issue of Russia supplying Europe with natural gas. Russia sits on one-third of the world's natural resources, and the bankers have no control over those resources. Israel is sitting on a massive amount of natural gas, which could be supplied to Europe. We know the Jews control the IMF/the Fed/European central banks.

Following the two world wars there has been a significant drive to ensure the works runs with an economical MAD principle.

Basically, similar to the original MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction, think the cold war and nukes) the idea is to make every country/region economically dependent on the rest of the world.   
You see this in action with the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict, where Russia is taking a lot of heat for their actions economically.

In this sense we're already close to achieving what Bill Gates is talking about, because what happens in every country in the world is far from random, it is in a system.   
Basically, if a guy named Carl Gustav suddenly rose to power in Sweden and wanted to make chemical weapons, it'd go over very poorly for him as a large part of the world would throw a fit.

What's disconcerting about Gates' idea is that it is proven time and time again a large powerful government is a seriously bad idea.   
The United States is the current prime example.    
This is not meant to paint the U.S. poorly, but there are many examples of bad things, things like rampant corruption, disregard for the poor, and so on.    
This is likely to happen to the EU as well eventually as bad people learn to game the system (which bad people *always* do.)

The hope for the future lies in technology, as it has always done. The better it gets and the better we learn to use it, the better the world will be.

Irish ones and indentured servants (sometimes also Irish).  In the mid 1600's over 100,000 Irish were captured and sold into slavery in the indies and the colonies in America.  This continued into the 1700's.
By the mid 1800's Irish slavery had largely disappeared and most slaves were indeed black but there were the ""no nothings"" a political group actively opposing the Irish who considered them strictly inferior, this was also in tandem with anti-catholic sentiments considering Irish immigration to the US a Vatican ploy to grab power in the US.  This was not a ""powerless"" political movement but actually had real political power and sway.  During this time things like ""Irish not welcomed"", ""Irish need not apply"", and similar signs were semi-common in the northern US centers of Irish immigration.

Indentured servants had more freedom than a true slave, but were effectively slaves themselves.  Generally they would indenture themselves to someone in order to get immigration to the US (travel costs, help with legalities if relevant, etc).  They came from a variety of ethnic backgrounds but largely white Europeans of low economic standing the largest groups were German and then Britain.  
In theory indentured servitude was a set period of time where they would work for the master then be ""free"".  But some of the less honest/more underhanded masters would intentionally try to make life difficult for there indentured servants so that after X years were up they would be financially unrealistically able to move on from continuing to work for them except now at a legally shitty wage.  

One of the main reasons white slavery and servitude is generally overlooked in the US and not as known about is because most slavery talk in the US is centered around the mid to later 1800's and the civil war era slavery during which time most slaves in the US were black, and indentured servitude was uncommon.  This time in history is also heavily referenced when talking of black civil rights and so on.

Let's also not forget [this](http://www.jihadwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Palestinian-image-of-Jewish-skulls.jpg) was posted to the supposedly moderate Fatah's facebook page *last month.*

[Here's](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.601938) a poll from June of last year showing that Palestinians overwhelmingly reject the two-state solution. And that was *before* Protective Edge actually began. At least things [improved](http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Majority-of-Palestinians-still-support-2-state-solution-new-poll-says-381141) a bit later in the year, though. At that time, only 46% of Palestinians wanted to dismantle Israel! And by contrast, Israelis, even during the war, were still a majority in [favoring the two-state solution](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.601996).

You need to understand that even children are indoctrinated in these places to hate Jews. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ2oBXiv9N0) a video for children promoting martyrdom and violence.

I love the images from the NX1 - and I love that the sensor is larger than the GH4's - but there are three things that keep me from buying one: the 30 minute recording time limit; the difficulty of editing its new codec; and the scarcity of lenses for its NX mount.

*Continuous Recording Limit*

If you ever plan to use your camera like a camcorder and record speeches, theatrical plays, long concerts, ceremonies, etc. - you'll have a challenge with the NX1's 30 minute continuous recording limit.  To shoot for more than 30 minutes continuously, you have to manually restart the camera.

The GH4, on the other hand, can record for hours continuously without a restart (outside of the EU).

*New Codec not Supported by Editing Programs*

You will also find that only a few NLEs (""Non Linear Editors"" - editing software) can handle the NX1's new h.265 codec.  That will change over time, but right now, you have to transcode to another codec in order to edit NX1 foootage.

With the GH4, you can download your files straight into your NLE and start editing.

*NX Lens Mount*

When Panasonic released the first micro 4/3 mount cameras seven years ago, there were only a few Panasonic and Olympus lenses for them.  Today, Sigma, Rokinon, Tamron, SLR Magic and others build lenses specifically for the GH4's micro 4/3 mount. And, with a Metabones adapter or Speed Booster, the GH4 has full access to high quality Canon EF glass.

Sadly, because the NX mount is newer and not yet widely adopted, there are fewer native NX mount lenses.  Metabones has not developed a Canon EF to NX adapter. And they cannot build a Speed Booster for NX mount due to its flange distance.

*Bottom line* [Referral Links]

There are no perfect cameras.  If you need a 4K camera with 1080p 120fps slow motion - the [$1499.99 NX1] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFDZRRA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NFDZRRA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=battleforthew-20) is your *only* choice in this price class (you would have to spend [$7999 for a Sony PXW-FS7] (http://www.adorama.com/SOPXWFS7.html?KBID=66297) to get a 4K camera with a higher frame rate at 1080p, [as seen here at 180fps] (http://player.vimeo.com/video/111979231)).

That said, the GH4 is not perfect either.  But I kept mine after the NX1 was introduced because I didn't want to deal with the NX1's challenges.  If you can live with 96fps and can get a [GH4 for $1497.99] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I9GYG8O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00I9GYG8O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=battleforthew-20) (marked down $200 since yesterday), you will get a lot of camera for your money.

Again, I hope this helps with your decision.

Meanwhile WWII, medieval Europe, etc, are all culturally relevant to a place where a lot of game development takes place (which isn't to say people with Indian heritage aren't in game design, but they aren't a major driving force in the industry). Maybe more importantly, they're all culturally relevant in markets where video games tend to sell the most.

With independent game developers taking more risks I am sure we will see titles come along with more interesting and varied settings, but I would be shocked if a major studio tackles anything like that any time soon.

It's like saying that writing words down correctly is a reductionist way of talking about communication. It *does* come down to that, objectively, it's the very first hurdle to starting and maintaining communication.

The issue is of course mostly practical. You can't educate people about nutrition using the most fiddly parts of biochemistry or energy physics, but one could and I posit that one should go into some level of biochemical detail, even if it's ""popular science"" level. But neither are you educating them by saying keto mimics starvation/fasting, or by saying - as you correctly note, - that fat people are lazy gluttons. Both are gross simplifications *and* wrong ones at that, pleasant to the ear because both speak at least to some degree in Moraleze; and everyone knows *that* language, right?

Off the above: I do think that starvation and fasting are morally loaded terms, of course; even if you personally don't see them that way, it doesn't mean your society doesn't, too.

As many have pointed out this is deism.

I'd like to add that this is more or less the position of most educated protestant christians where I come from (central europe). The main difference to deism is that they still cling to the christian traditions. Many people still get married in a church because of the formalities, which make the whole event seem important.
I have absolutely no problem with the concept of deism (although there is no evidence of such a god either, so it's kinda pointless). But I strongly oppose organized religion because of its intrinsic in-group vs. out-group mentality, which adds fuel to suspicion and xenophobia.

Make sure your Profile info is consistent with whatever credit-card you use.  That is, don't have a Profile with one person and use the 2nd person's CC, you'll probably get flagged by Airbnb, then have trouble booking.

There are several categories of Hosts, many have a single listing and are very conscientious about being straight with Guests and want to get good Reviews.  There are other categories of Hosts including those with multiple listings who use agents and are really out to max out profits, and then there are those who will do the ""bait and switch"" thing, try to negotiated payment that bypasses Airbnb, etc.  Much of this is against the TOS and should be reported to Support.

To be fair, Copa America is a huge mess that not even that many latinamericans watch (hell, I'd go as far to say that more people watch the WC qualifiers). For example... It's been disastrous in deciding the dates, in the early 80s it was supposed to happen every 4 years, then they changed it in the late 80s to every 2 years, then to every 3 in the early 2000s, but now the last one was held in 2011 and the Copa will be held this year... 

Then, inspite being CONMEBOL, they always have a mess in regards of invitations for the CONCACAF teams.

This whole thing, amongst others, has made Copa America a big joke and many times the National teams don't use their best players, to rest them for the WC qualifiers instead, and field less stellar squads to test out players and strategies for the WC.

But next year (yes 2016, inspite that we're having a tournament in 2015) there's gonna be the Copa América Centenario... That will feature 10 CONMEBOL teams and 6 CONCACAF teams. So far it seems like a one off thing, and there's no indications so far if the teams will field their A squads, and the publicity about it is non-existent... I really wish Copa America Centenario works and both CONMEBOL and CONCACAF cut loose on Copa America and Copa de Oro, to favor an unified tournament every 4 years with the A squads instead.

I think something like THAT might interest europeans who like football, considering many players in european clubs would be involved with their national teams.

First, in Germany, if you mean the Nazis they were not left wing they were right wing fascists who coopted the term socialism to gain power and then proceeded to kill every communist, socialist and anarchist before almost any other group. 

Okay now on from there: 

Why is socialism responsible for the famines at the beginning of the USSR? There had been on going war leading to a loss of farmers and the various militaries living off the land both of which lead to long term food shortages. Not to mention the fact thanks to Tsarist Russia's policies the country was technologically and economically behind every other European nation. 

Also if that was socialism's fault then surely the multiple famines in India under the British Raj must be capitalism's fault. Also it is certainly of equal responsibility for the genocide of the native Americans, all of the other attrocities of British imperialism and European imperialism in general, and all the US backed dictators throughout the 20th century. 

And as for Mao and Pol Pot they were both morons who demonstrate why vanguardism and strong central government socialism has never even approached communism. Communism being a non-hierarchal, stateless society which has some form of worker control of the means of production.

The diesel produce a lot of torque, that's why they're more used in old trucks, or commercial vehicles. To transport goods, or heavy stuff, but they're specially made for that.

Regarding normal vehicles, they took advantage of that torque power to produce small engines, with high mileage. Just find one diesel engine from year 2005 and up, and drive it. VW, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, etc. All those engines have already a decade of experience building great diesel engines, schedule a test drive, or find someone with one. Im sure you wont regret.

As someone said, one of the biggest difference between Diesel and Gasoline engines is the power delivery. Gasoline deliver the biggest power the engine can produce at high RPM, the Diesel are the opposite, the peak of the power is at low RPM, so while driving, you always have the max torque the engine can produce available very fast. And usually people like this.

 In my opinion, i have only owned diesel engines cars, and i like them. Im from Europe, the gasoline huge engines are very expensive, and have pornographic taxes in emissions and such. If i like them? Absolutely, they are a blast to drive, any sport car must have a gasoline engine.

It used to belong to Palestine, which was part of the British Empire (hence how the British were able to make such a declaration). After the holocaust, an unprecedented amount of people (Jewish refugees from Europe) immigrated into Palestine, into the areas which were declared safe for Jewish people. This really agitated a lot of Palestinian Arabs, and Arabs in the surrounding countries such as Egypt and Syria. I guess it was partly religious intolerance, but there was also an argument that the mass influx of people (regardless of their Judaism) just wasn't good for Palestinian society. A civil war erupted in 1947 and things have just been pretty shitty between the Jews and the Arabs since.  

In answer to your question (sorry for the rambling), yeah there was quite a lot of ethnic cleansing (or 'population transfer' as it was called then) going on. Jews faced severe intolerance in areas that they didn't 'belong', and as a result of U.N agreements on how to divide up Palestine, many Arabs were forced from their homes - forced to leave areas which were now the 'Jewish Homeland'. I'm not sure about the grisly details though, in the midst of all the violence and tensions that occurred between the Arabs and the Jews there was probably all sorts of horrible things being done to the native Palestinians but I don't know of any specific examples.

Big companies like Facebook, Google and Netflix use CDNs and usually have local ""edge"" servers to distribute data faster to people.

This means means instead of connecting to a local server here to see [kittens doing cute things](https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=550641501686243&amp;pnref=story), you need to connect to a server in Europe or Asia.

A few points of clarification to frame your point:

- Erie Canal was originally built with state funds, not federal funds. 

- Many early proposals for federal involvement in canals, called for selling stock in various turnpikes  to finance their upkeep and improvements. This is probably not what many self-described socialists would support today -- under the guise of ""making the costs public, but privatizing the profits"".

- Jefferson shot down Albert Gallatin's initial plan for a series of turnpikes and canals along the east coast, because he felt like that level of government involvement was unconstitutional.

Source for the above items is an interesting read about early Canals. And focuses on one of my favorite politicians of all-time, Albert Gallatin: http://history1800s.about.com/od/canals/a/gallatinreport.htm




Gallatin had been pushing the ideas for canals to be built in the US. Gallatin was a European by birth, so he understand what infrastructure needed to take place to bring the US up to speed with many of the European powers.

The so called trade deal that ""Ukraine"" revolted of, had a demand for ending its trade deal with Russia and beginning the integration into EU/NATO military systems.

The defense clause would also almost certainly guarantee a war with Russia, if the economic ones, which cannot exactly be called accommodating to Russian interests either, didn't.

Who does this deal benefit? Ukrainians? Russians? Or, the West? Who is backed many of the officials in Ukraine's government today? Who is paying for them to continue their ruinous policies? Who, more or less openly, strongly backed and saw their candidates through the Ukrainian political system? 

Poroshenko won an election against a joke opponent with 40-60% of the population participating, depending on if you include lost regions. Yanukovych won a real election with 67% of the population participating. Who is more democratically legitimate?

In any case, Ukraine has no democratic future. The sanctity of democratic legitimacy has been destroyed. Now if you find a certain government inconvenient, you just meddle in their affairs and inspire a minority to overthrow it. Progress.

Yes Putin is a mafioso-in-chief, yes he runs a kleptocracy, but that does not justify what has taken place and is taking place in Ukraine.

Right.... This coming from a a panel of queers, Jews and something in-between? lol PLE's are becoming a reality worldwide and there's nothing you can do about it. Your anti-White hatred is very telling of your politically motivated agenda. What follows? Revolution.

News Flash! Your negative ratings for this tripe should give you an indication of how unpopular your anti-White comments are. If you want bad ratings keep showing your hatred for European people.

""ASIA FOR THE ASIANS, AFRICA FOR THE AFRICANS, WHITE COUNTRIES FOR EVERYBODY!""

Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.

The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to ""assimilate,"" i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I'm not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn't object to this?

But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionje

They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.﻿

* [What were some reasons that China turned inwards and neglected maritime exploration after Admiral Zheng He and his missions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1a2irc/what_were_some_reasons_that_china_turned_inwards/) 
 * This thread talks about the political situation in Ming China and how it contributed towards the dynasty's more inwards focus both before and after Zheng He's famous voyage.

**The Americas**

* [Why is it that western Europe developed technologically so much faster than other places such as Africa/Native Americans etc. ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rerea/why_is_it_that_western_europe_developed/) 
 * This delves a huge issue involving most everyone from the Americas to Australia to Asia. I'd recommend reading over the entire thread (even the downvoted comments) because this is a treasure trove of information and debate.
* [The native americans and several other cultures did not experience the same technological advancements as europe. What has caused this diffrence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1aggse/the_native_americans_and_several_other_cultures/?sort=top) 
 * This thread starts with a huge overview done by /u/snickeringshadow which talks about the actual state of technology and development in the Pre-Columbian Americas which you might find interesting.
* [What differences caused the Mesoamerican societies to be much more successful than Eastern North American societies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1v5n7x/what_differences_caused_the_mesoamerican/)

* [Is there any reason why the Native American civilization never was able to work metal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/256w3b/is_there_any_reason_why_the_native_american/)

I think this is a great example of how to respectfully discuss differences of opinion online and move conversation forward. The last 20 years or so have really wrecked American politics, and I hadn't considered many of your ideas as solutions before. You've left me with a lot to think about. I'm not sure I agree with all of your ideas- well, no, that's wrong. I'm not sure I know enough to agree OR disagree with a lot of what you said. I might contemplate and add more later when I'm not redditing from my phone. For now, I'm just going to focus on the areas where I feel I know enough to contribute something meaningful.

I have to wonder if there isn't a less drastic solution to Senate gridlock than total dissolution. Bribery is certainly a problem, but is there a huge difference between bribing all of the individuals versus using 16 individuals to railroad one? The outcome is the same either way. Could anti-bribery laws (I know, they already exist and no one follows them) be a more effective way to ensure against bribery without minimizing underrepresented voices? I still think we need some sort of forum to allow for equal time for the needs of less populated regions. 

Initially, I quite liked your county versus state legislation idea, but the more I think about it, the more a few concerns come up. With smaller, more homogenous legislative regions, won't we see a bigger tendency towards extremism? This is an extreme example, but who is to stop the super-red counties from re-enacting Jim Crow laws? The smaller a group is, the more it can trend towards extremism. Not to mention that diversity of opinion is very important for political progress and discussion.

I'm also concerned about what that would do to less financially viable regions. Underpopulated counties have a hard enough time funding infrastructure and education with the assistance of ""donor"" counties and cities. Without metropolitan centers like Portland and Eugene, I really can't see the other counties surviving as states.

The only way I could see individual counties legislating themselves work is if we gave them less individual authority than we currently give states. Use the federal government to enforce moderation and tax distribution between counties... But I think, on r/cascadia, the reasons that might make me anxious go without saying.

Personally (although I haven't at all thought the repercussions of this through) my ideal Future Nation would show the US as a series of coalition all bio regions, with current states intact within. The individual regions would take over much of the governing power of the federal government and ensure local needs are being met. The US would remain a functioning unit more along the lines of the Commonwealth or the EU. Share a military and a currency, have a lot of inter-coalition trade, but keep the actual legislation more localized. I'd also like to see national action taken on issues of civil rights, but instead of enforcing laws, perhaps trade penalties? I think this would go a long way towards making sure the unique needs of individual bio regions are met. I think, regardless of which route we were to take, with our changing planet the days of one-size-fits-all policies are behind us.

1. To show just how [catastrophic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-31067473) the austerity measures have been on the Greek people (a paltry average monthly wage €600/$690, 25% unemployment, etc) 

2. To show a better long-term strategy to deal with the Greek debt problem. Are anti-austerity measures really the best way to go with debt still being over 100% of GDP?
 
3. The Syriza ministers are planning on going an offensive negotiation tour to the IMF, EU and ECB. The key to a successful renegotiation is to show these institutions the effect a weak Greece will have on the Eurozone. 

Greece definitely needs the EU, but the EU need a stable Greece too. And this is something they recognise.

[Syriza](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21637395-prime-minister-looks-likely-lose-snap-greek-election-later-month-it-not) is a new party, founded as a coalition of all sorts of small groups, so everyone is eager to see if they can deliver. There is no precedent set.

&gt;The __Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment__,  abbreviated as __CEFR__ or __CEF__, is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and, increasingly, in other countries (for example, [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia) and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines)). It was put together by the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe) as the main part of the project ""Language Learning for European Citizenship"" between 1989 and 1996. Its main aim is to provide a method of learning, teaching and assessing which applies to all languages in Europe. In November 2001 a European Union Council Resolution recommended using the CEFR to set up systems of validation of language ability. The six reference levels (see below) are becoming widely accepted as the European standard for grading an individual's language proficiency.

Ever since the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO has aggressively expanded towards Russia. You really think our government has no international interest in converting Ukraine? Why did this conflict start in the first place? Yanukovych backed away from a deal with the EU and started to lean towards Russia. 
America has an undeniably vested interest in securing Ukraine for the West, which Putin will never allow.  You really think the same government that supplied Afghani fighters weapons to resist the Soviets wouldn't do the same for Ukraine?

For example, the word ""document"" (as in paperwork) has been lent into many languages as is, but in Finnish the corresponding word is ""asiakirja"", which is formed from the words ""asia"" (thing, matter, subject) and ""kirja"" (book). In addition, many words were just made up from things they were related to. Often these connections are quite ingenious. The word for oxygen is *happi*, which comes from *hapan* (sour, acid) - in other words the word gives a hint of its meaning!

The reason behind this was that in the 1830's a group of scholars (known as *lauantaiseura*, which later became *Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura*, or the Society of Finnish Literature) wanted to establish Finnish as a full-fledged European language capable of expressing all the needs of the modern society (notably, these scholars were all Swedish-speaking!); prior to this, all administrative and governmental functions were ran exclusively in Swedish. Extending the vocabulary of the Finnish language was a prerequisite for it to be established as an official language.

Even today, Finnish has a trend of synthesising existing words to create new ones. For example, the word for computer is *tietokone*, from *tieto* (information, knowledge) and *kone* (machine) and the word ""e-mail"" is sähköposti from *sähkö* (electricity - another word made up in the 1800's) and *posti* (post). That being said, a large part of Finnish language is loaned from other languages, mainly germanic, baltic and slavic ones. Though they are somewhat sparse, old finno-ugric words are still among the most common ones.",1422818369,0,122,

I mean come on dude. 100,000 years of consistent neanderthal culture, humans show up around the same time as the Aurignacian tool culture shows up, and then gradually it spreads throughout Europe, and at the same time Neanderthals start dieing out. 6000 years is not really that much room for a clearly cut border between no humans and some humans.

Sadly, I knew nothing about either.  Your comment prompted me to learn about [Dean Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Reed):

&gt; In Chile, he developed a left-wing political philosophy, and began to speak out against oppression and poverty. He protested against nuclear weapons and US foreign policy, and performed shows free in poor neighborhoods and in prisons. Back in Buenos Aires, his politics eventually ran afoul of Argentine government policies after the 1966 Argentine Revolution and he was deported.

&gt; In 1971 Reed wrote an ""open letter"" to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, criticizing him for having slandered the USSR.[1]

&gt; He lived in Rome for a time, acting in TV commercials and spaghetti western movies such as Adiós, Sabata, and touring Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, where he was immensely popular.

&gt; Life in the Soviet bloc

&gt; In 1973, Reed chose to settle permanently in East Germany, where he continued to write, direct, and perform in films. Over the years he played in 20 films, produced 13 records, and gave concerts in 32 countries. The majority of his songs during this period were uncertified covers of successful hits of Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, The Beatles and others.[2] In 1978 he directed and starred in El Cantor (The Singer), a biopic about his friend [Víctor Jara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Víctor_Jara), the popular Chilean singer-songwriter murdered by the military after [the 1973 coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état) against President [Salvador Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende).

-- [Dean Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Reed), *wikipedia*

There is also [John Reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reed_\(journalist\)), of course, author of [*Ten Days That Shook The World*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Days_That_Shook_the_World).  I do know of him -- which is more than most Americans can say!

❧

In your comment, I sense disappointment: There was great enthusiasm in the Soviet Union for antiwar activists, but there was no reciprocal enthusiasm here in America.  We have been stupefied by the infatuation with war and power.  

So all of the activists celebrated by the Soviet communists amounted to nothing.  The faith in human nature was rebuffed again and again.  Soviet loyalists may have felt like a lonely ""voice in the wilderness"" -- making every effort to invite others to join the human cause, and getting nothing but ignorant taunts in return.  This isolation must be hard for a gregarious culture to fathom.  

I've concluded, however, that is the nature of existence.  Down through history, activists have always stood alone against a tide of ignorance and barbarism.  Our solidarity is internal, not external: We feel an inner connection with activists in other times and places, but we are not understood within our own time and place.

If we are not understood, then why bother?  Why go against the masses?  Why not join the lemmings, and eat, drink and be merry, as we march into the sea and drown?  Well, I suppose it is a matter of self-respect.  To live, we must live for something.  To live for nothing seems inhuman and unhealthy.  So our activism is for our own benefit: Our love for others is a reflection of our love for self.

Soviet loyalists were disappointed because they set themselves an impossible task.  Sunbeams, however bright, are not enough to wear down a mountain.  Warmth and friendship is not enough to turn people away from fascism.  

I call fascism ""the ideology of national suicide"": The war cult is a cult of death.  When people acquire a terminal illness, a desire for death develops.  Fascism is such an illness -- a fatal political and spiritual disease.  We are locked in a death grip.  Opening this lock and setting us free is a very complex process.",1422819166,0,0,

Of course like with any third world country you have only a few cities that have modern standards and quality, but the country was on a good path.

The tower alone can't do all the damage for you, and how is that an auto loss?  Bottom KR/CN teams can do better dives with a less gold lead, so why can't they?  Yes, Gravity can still dive a **disengage** team comp, I highlight it because you keep mentioning it, because it does zero damage.  Even if Dignitas disengages, the best they could is to run away because they won't do any damage against Gravity.  So deal some damage to the objectives before Dignitas go back to the fountain?  The problem is they backed when an objective can be secured.  Force an engage, if they run, then just take the fucking tower or something, there is just no way Dignitas can win a team fight, under tower or not, the lead is simply too huge and Dig has no damage.

Often physical licensing ends up giving you the streaming rights and none of the current UK companies have their own streaming site; history had it that you can't make much money off it with such a small market (Kaze, a European masterer/distributor had a site called anime-on-demand where they put some of their stuff which failed; they are now instead using animaxtv which is ran by sony). Just to add, Manga UK have the majority of anime in the UK, and Anime Limited are a somewhat new company kinda trying to release to the collector (Patema Inverted Ultimate edition kickstarter; Baccano, Bebop and Outlaw Star on blu-ray) while rescuing titles from the defunct Beez Entertainment (such as Gurren Lagann). (A quote from him about release strategy on the founding of the company can be found [here](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2012-12-14/andrew-partridge-talks-about-anime-limited))  
    
The president of Anime Limited used to run the Kaze uk branch and streaming site and as such had experience with putting digital content out. At Anime Limited the titles they've grabbed that are new have for the most part been simulcasted (Tokyo Ghoul, Zankyou, Kill La Kill, Space Dandy) on a French branch site, wakanim.co.uk . This was good for watching live but in order to advertise for their collectors edition physical releases (which are at a bit of a higher price point than other distributors) they have over the last year ([here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Kill_la_Kill_and_Gurren_Lagann_added_to_Netflix_UK.html), [here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Blood_Lad_added_to_Netflix_UK.html) and [here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Space_Dandy%27s_first_season_added_to_Netflix_UK.html)) decided it was worth adding these shows to Netflix, aiming for eyeballs on their product over money directly (imo).   
  
I have no way of knowing how successful this strategy has been, but both from the new additions added to Netflix yesterday/today by Anime Ltd and the [release of many titles by Manga UK over January](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Death_Note_and_Vampire_Knight_now_available_on_Netflix_UK.html) make me think that it has the least been worth continuing with for the time being. Particularly, the fact that Manga UK (which had previously only released the odd thing on youtube such as [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MPe7E1YrY4)) has put lots of their older shows on Netflix which they've evidently just been holding back makes me think this is the way the UK digital anime market is shifting.

**Film Socialisme** (2010, Jean-Luc Godard)

A film about the sinking of Europe, set on the Costa Concordia. Never before was reality so darky poetic. I thought the first and third segment were great, but in all honesty I didn't really understand what the second one was all about. My reaction to the third segment, a brief and abstract overview of conflict in the modern world and the loss of social values, was truly emotional. 7/10.

**Riso Amaro (Bitter Rice)** (1949, Giuseppe de Santis)

Film that starts in true neo-realist fashion with an explanation of how impoverished Northern Italian rice workers are, then quickly becomes more of a noir film and it's all the better for it. The camerawork in this film feels modern and competent and the story is actually really good and exciting. De Santis also indulged himself with the cast, for some reason literally every single one of the rice workers (except the token older dissatisfied woman) is a stunning young lady with model looks, with armpit hair being the only concession. 9/10.

**The Smiling Lieutenant** (1931, Ernst Lubitsch)

Another Lubitsch musical. I think these early Lubitsch films stand or fall with Maurice Chevalier who is a very good screen presence. He's playing an Army Lieutenant here who upsets a Royal Princess and has to make up with her. Inavitably this leads to a triangle of love interests with him in the middle. The film is funny, with the Lubitsch touch out in full force. The main character is also surprisingly amoral which leads to a conclusion I didn't see coming. It's a playfulness that was stopped after 1934 but I really liked it here. 8/10.

**P'tit Quinquin (L'il Quinquin)** (2014, Bruno Dumont)

It's the antithesis to True Detective, this story of a sleepy village terrorized by weird murders. Unlike the HBO series, this film uses deadpan, absurdist and surrealist commedic moments moments to shape characters and situations, carefully using sparse dialogue to build up the world of the film. The film is very funny, but at the same time there is a sadness to the irrelevance of rural France running through every frame. It's a story of people knowing society and the world is moving on without them, yet they don't know how to change it. It's also a film about the current state of France, more relevant than ever after the Charlie Hebdo murders. The film might not provide many answers, but as a mirror of a changing world it is an extremely engaging piece of work. 8/10.

**Tetro** (2009, Francis Ford Coppola)

Look at me, I'm making art! It's black and white, with letterboxed flashbacks in color because that's deep! This movie screams importance but is anything but.

When you look throughout history, there have been windows into the apocalypse. Europe during WW1 and WW2 was the apocalypse for those people. Imagine being in Dresden in 45. That was the APOCALYPSE to those people, and while I'm sure there were bouts of violence throughout, it was not this orgy of murder that people insist these games accurately represent.

People helped each other, they propped each other up, because they had a common enemy. The citizens of Dresden, to follow this example, had the allied forces, they were the enemy, not other families in Dresden.

In these games, we have the common enemy as well. Zombies. I think a major issue with the KOS behavior in-game is that the zombies really aren't a threat. There's no downside to murdering a player in this game.

In your real life apocalypse example, there are countless downsides to murdering another person. I'd like to think that the human conscious wouldn't be able to murder women and children for a spool of twine, but you might have a different opinion so I'll focus on a different direction.

You would have the downside of noise. Firing a gun to murder someone would attract the attention of other belligerents, and more importantly, zombies. You would see more robberies, maybe hostage situations, but simply gunning people down? You wouldn't see that much.

Ammo would be a lot more scarce, meaning firing bullets would be a bigger decision, since in the real world, ammo doesn't respawn. When you see a guy running with nothing but a branch in his hand, you might decide that he's probably going to die anyway, and he's not worth your bullet.

Ultimately, what is missing from these games and promotes KOS, is a complete lack of penalty. If you die, you respawn. When your actual life is on the line, you will make the choice to avoid conflict rather than take a chance that could backfire and END YOUR LIFE, probably 9 out of 10 times. You would only engage out of pure, unadulterated DESPERATION, not out of boredom, not out of convenience.",1422825397,0,1,

Why would MYM reputation suffer for saying Horo's English is fine, when only one player has had trouble understanding him, when they have said a lot that he does has an accent (as do A LOT of players in the EU scene)?

First of all, admit Aisha was very young for a child to become a bride. And Muhammad [](/pbuh)  didn not expect her to behave like an adult; he knew she was a child.  It is even possible, according to some historians, that she was a decade older when she married Muhammad.  This wasn't like those tragic cases where little girls are raped and abused by men.  

While it is said in hadith, the marriage was consummated at 9, this is something truly that would only be known to God [](/swt), Muhammad and Aisha. Muhammad [](/pbuh) is known to have been very gentle and loving with children.  His grandsons loved him and even climbed all over him while he prayed salat.  Fatima adored her father.  He taught the Muslims to be kind to their children and to educate them.  And he was very concerned about the welfare of orphans.

But we have to remember we are talking about the seventh century not the 21st century.  All throughout the world, both male and female children were married at young ages.  In the 21st century, in the west, we often wait to marry well into our twenties.  At 18, many continue on with their education for at least another four years. This is because we are living so much longer and we are so much healthier.  It is also because technology has changed the way we live.  We can go out in the world and live without worrying about marriage and children who will help keep the farm or trade running.

But in the past, people died much earlier, children frequently died, mothers died often in childbirth.  Life was much more difficult.  If children went to school at all, it might only be for a three or four years.  And then they had to work.  And rather than being considered adult at 21, it was at puberty, sometimes even sooner.  This includes Europe and America and it was a common practice even until into the 20th century.  

We are truly blessed to live in our times because life was much more difficult for everyone and what was everyday life for children then is considered horrible treatment now.  I have some quotes and an article below.  But want to end by saying that to truly educate others about Aisha's age, it means being willing to state she was too young to be a bride, but to honor our prophet, [](/pbuh) who knew that.  And then to educate others patiently.  We know our prophet wouldn't heart a child, but we also know we would be devastated by anyone who would harm our child at the age Aisha was when the hadith say she became a bride.  

Quoting from: [Age of Consent in European &amp; American History](Age of Consent in European &amp; American History)

“During colonial times in the United States, the age of consent was 10 (except in Delaware, where the age of consent was 7).” ( Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society, [1st ed.: From Cells to Society] By Martha Rosenthal page 422)

“Traditionally, across the globe, the age of consent for sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty, menstruation for a woman and pubic hair for a man.
Sir Edward Coke in 17th century England ‘made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband’s estate was 9. The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example Mary Hathaway of Virginia, was only 9 when she was married to William Williams.

Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss canons, initially set the age of consent at 10-12 years and then raised it to between 13 and 16 years in the second half of the 19th century. Historically, the English common law set the age of consent to range from 10- 12. In the United States, by the 1880s, most states set the age of consent at 10-12, and in one state Delaware, the age of consent was only 7. Social and resulting legal attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example while ages from 10 to 13 were typically acceptable in Western countries during the mid-19the century, the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing.

I believe that a lot of our current mores come from reluctance to let our children mature mentally as quickly as our bodies do. Keep in mind that not all societies share Western mores. And to my surprise, until the latter part of the 19th Century, Children in the Western nations were engaged and married at a much earlier age. The trend to give children more time to mature is relatively new.

In his book, The Emphatic civilization, (Penguin, NY, 200) Jeremy Rifkin points out that the concept of adolescence only emerged during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of the twentieth century. Society started to think of childhood as extending beyond puberty, into the later teenage years. Before that, children were considered to graduate into adulthood with the onset of puberty.”  (What’s Wrong in America: A Look at Troublesome Issues in Our Country By Arthur Siccan)


“It needs to be remembered that many Medieval widows were not old, Important heiresses were often married between the ages of 5 and 10 and might find themselves widowed while still in their teens.” (A Medieval Miscellany By Margaret Wade Labarge page 52)

“According to British common law during the colonial period, the age of consent was seven. Today we are astounded that girls of this age were assumed to know enough about sex (or about sin) to make such a decision competently.”  (American Families Past and Present: Social Perspectives on Transformations by Susan M. Ross page 40)

All in all, we are looking at a world that was harsher to children and adults alike and it caused cultures to exist in ways that seem so unhealthy to us now.

""Fuck Islam and piece of shit Muslims""

""Religion is ephemeral. People can denounce Islam by eating pork. I personally denounced Islam by jizzing on a Quran. Islam is a pity religion. It's not the problem. Arabs and Pakistanis are the problem.
They need to be shamed. Put back into their place. In Iran we don't allow Afghans into state university because we know they'll stir up trouble. Europe needs to do the same thing. Discriminate Arabs. Hold them down as second-class citizens. That way, they will be disciplined and won't cause trouble.

&gt; Marius ""Blizer300"" Hæsumgaard has left European League Championship Series team Meet Your Makers, a source close to the player told the Daily Dot. Hæsumgaard joined the active roster shortly before the start of the LCS, following Marcin “Kori” Wolski’s unexpected departure.
&gt; 
&gt; Hæsumgaard has apparently become frustrated by what's been described as ""internal communication"" and teamplay issues. In addition to team-wide problems, Cho “H0R0” Jae-hwan, a former Korea pro, in particular has had trouble getting his English to a level where he can communicate with the team effectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Details on Hæsumgaard’s mid lane replacement are murky, with one person saying only that a European player with LCS experience will fill his spot.
&gt; 
&gt; After playing four matches, Meet Your Makers' record stands at 1-3, putting the team in a three-way tie for seventh place alongside Copenhagen Wolves and ROCCAT. 

The claims in the second paragraph are apparently attributed to the source in the first since there are no other details presented that the information came from anywhere else. The third paragraph, again using an unnamed source, is unclear whether it's referring to the same unnamed person in the first paragraph. The last paragraph is factual background info.

In doing so, they alienated US/WEurope users who care about having all the features at a slightly higher price. I do not hold this against Microsoft but they need to step up their game for us 920 users.Yes, it is true WP does not require as high-end of hardware to run basic tasks, but better GPUs than what Snap400 has are required for newer games and future OSes like W10 (MS has hinted that low end phones might miss out on select features)I want to use Hey Cortana and any future cool things MS decides to throw at us. None of their latest phones can even use their newest features. How ironic.I disagree that Low End phones aren't bad phones; when the difference between them is 50 dollars, is there really a choice? Carrier bills will cost thousands anyway. It makes sense to have a phone built with better quality materials and specs (I.e it will actually last the two years one will pay for it). Half of those new Lumias don't even have Gorilla Glass. Regarding McLaren, even if 3DTouch didn't work *at all*, I would still openly purchase it because it would be a new and great phone to have.

The old Greek City-States worked because of their low level agarian nature, ritualised way of conducting warfare and a population concentration that you won't even find in modern day Siberia. 

Modern society is completely different. Think of why government models moved from typical Greek citizen solider models, see also the Roman professional standing army, the Anglo-Saxon fyrd composed of freemen (not slaves) to Europe in the middle ages to finally the French Revolution, where EVERYONE had the right to citizenship. The rights that you have as a person were born out of the French Revolution, much more so than the American one as a drive for equality for EVERYONE under the sun, not just a select few. 

If you ask any Frenchmen, 9 out of 10 they will agree that the values of *egalite, fraternite, legalite* as the highest of all laws in France. That all men (in 1789, only men counted; women would not get the vote until the 20th century!) will be governed and held equal in the eyes of the law. No longer will there be relgious courts, noble courts and the common court - all are equal where you are rich or poor, learned or illiterate.

The French Revolution is a fantastic bit of knowledge to have under your belt - it has shaped the formation of modern Europe much more than anything since.

&gt;You propagate misery. 

Right, becuase the managers refuse to pay thier staff a working wage, so I should subsize thier pay out of my pocket? What kind of pleb bullshit is that? It's not like there are hundreds of other jobs people can take. Maybe if americans could actually learn how to pick up a sign and protest they might get a decent living wage.

&gt;Or just cook for yourself every day.

For the most part I do. It's generaly healthier and cheaper.

&gt;But something tells me you're too fat, lazy and full of self-importance to actually prepare your own food all the time. 

There we go again, making assumptions.

Obviously this is a major issue and needs to be corrected by simplifying the tax code (along with lowering the rate, both actions are important).

For starters, the only reason for RSI International is, as previously mentioned, to get funds into the EU without having to to transfer it from the US company and pay tax on it, so again it's a decision that's been made to put it on the backer not a definitive need.

Lets look at Kickstarter, you pledge money, it's considered an investment, and the reward you receive is considered the repayment of that investment, BUT, they have no obligation of actually following through on their promises to make XX product/service.

But Kickstarter pledges in the eyes of the taxman, is income, so it's taxable, but the pledgers don't pay the tax (although a few projects do say ""if you're from the EU add xx amount onto the pledge for tax"", it's minimal), the owners of the fund once fully-funded pay the tax. Which as far as I'm concerned is as it should be, and is the norm in crowdfunding. It's the cost of crowdfunding, you don't get away with a lot of strangers funding your idea with zero promise of a return without having to pay the taxman for the privilege.

You're not buying something completed to have it now, you're pledging money in hopes that it gets completed and you'll receive the product/service that was promised, which makes the grounds for putting tax onto the backer fairly shakey ground. It is called VALUE ADDED tax after all..

I'm not annoyed that tax is involved at all, all I'm saying is that CIG need to either...

* Stop with the ""you're not buying a ship you're pledging to development"" bullshit
* Take on the tax themselves, because while paying tax on transferred funds (CIG US -&gt; EU) is a must, and while paying tax on anything ""pledged"" to them in the EU is also a must, putting it onto the backer is not, especially when they don't have a product to sell us.

It really comes down to *Law* : *Good faith business practises*. You can abide by the law without pissing on your loyal backers.

If Chris Roberts tomorrow turns around and says ""Okay to be clear we're not crowdfunding any more, the pledge is now a purchase, you're paying for digital goods."", although nothing physical in process or method would change, the ethics and transparency of it would, and I'd shut up :D

To be clear this isn't a rage or anything, as I've said I don't really plan to get anything else as I've sunk enough in, nor will I be on any kind of crusade to change it, it's just an observation that I felt like voicing since it does leave a bit of a sour taste from the way they handled it.",1422838824,0,2,

Comincio dal 2006: nelle elezioni di quell'anno si affrontano Berlusconi, leader della coalizione di centro-destra, e Prodi, di centro-sinistra. 

Vince Prodi, ma con una maggioranza estremamente ridotta: al senato ottiene infatti la fiducia (ossia viene legittimato dal parlamento) per solo 10 voti. Dal 2006 al 2008 il governo è quindi molto debole e più volte ottiene la fiducia solo grazie al voto dei senatori a vita. Quello stesso parlamento elegge Presidente della Repubblica Giorgio Napolitano, un ex comunista appartenente a una corrente moderata. Nei due anni successivi il governo è molto debole e non riesce a legiferare con efficacia. Nel 2008 viene a mancare la fiducia al senato (alla camera il governo aveva una maggioranza molto più ampia) a causa delle dimissioni e successivo passaggio all'opposizione del ministro della Giustizia Clemente Mastella, indagato dalla magistratura e del passaggio all'opposizione del senatore Sergio de Gregorio ( per intenderci, http://i.imgur.com/GrHyOpz.jpg), successivamente indagato per corruzione.

Si torna così a votare, e questa volta Berlusconi, alleatosi con Alleanza Nazionale,  che Wikipedia difinisce partito nazional-conservatore, ottiene una vittoria schiacciante contro il Partito Democratico, in cui erano confluite tutte le forze di sinistra. La maggioranza viene però fortemente ridotta dal passaggio all'opposizione di Gianfranco Fini, maggior esponente di AN, e di alcuni parlamentari a lui vicini. Il governo Berlusconi viene successivamente colpito da una serie di scandali, sessuali e non, che ne minano fortemente la credibilità. Nel 2011, a causa delle forti pressioni di Napolitano e dell' UE, Berlusconi si dimette e, in accordo col PD,   sostiene un governo tecnico presieduto da Mario Monti, un importante economista. Il governo Monti vota molte riforme estremamente impopolari, come la legge Fornero che alza l'età pensionabile, mentre in alcuni campi si rivela poco credibile, come il teatrino dei marò fatti tornare in Italia e poi rispediti in India.

In seguito alle minacce di Berlusconi di far cadere il governo, nel 2013 Monti si dimette, e si torna a votare. Si sfidano tre grandi coalizioni: il PD, guidato da Pierluigi Bersani, ministro all'epoca di Prodi, il PdL di Berlusconi e il Movimento 5 Stelle, fondato dall'ex comico Beppe Grillo e dall'imprenditore Gianroberto Casaleggio, un partito che cavalca il malcontento nei confronti della classe politica.si candida inoltre l'ex Presidente del Consiglio Mario Monti, che prenderà però una quantità irrisoria di voti.

Nonostante fosse fortemente favorito, il PD vince per pochi voti, non ottenendo così i numeri per governare senza l'appoggio di uno degli altri due schieramenti. Il leader del PD Bersani cerca l'appoggio del M5S, non trovandolo.

Con queste premesse, il parlamento si ritrova a dover eleggere il successore di Giorgio Napolitano, il cui settennato era appena scaduto. Inizialmente Bersani prova, insieme a Berlusconi, di far eleggere alla prima votazione (in cui servono i 2/3 dei voti dei parlamentari) Franco Marini, presidente del senato all'epoca di Prodi. A causa di un enorme numero di franchi tiratori (ossia parlamentari che, approfittando della segretezza del voto, votano contro le indicazioni del partito di appartenenza) tra cui spicca la corrente del PD guidata da Matteo Renzi, Marini non viene eletto e si ritira dalla competizione. Alla quarta votazione, in cui basta la metà dei voti, Bersani propone Prodi come Presidente della Repubblica, ma anche in questo caso, a causa dei franchi tiratori (quei 101 di cui potresti aver sentito parlare) non viene eletto neanche lui. In seguito alla mancata elezione di Prodi, Bersani si dimette da segretario del PD.

Alla sesta votazione, dopo numerosi colloqui tra le varie parti in gioco, Napolitano accetta di prolungare il proprio mandato, evento peraltro mai accaduto nella storia della Repubblica. Napolitano viene quindi eletto, con 738 voti su 1007, alla veneranda età di 88 anni.

A quattro mesi dalle dimissioni di Monti, in Aprile viene nominato Presidente del Consiglio Enrico Letta, un esponente del PD con uno zio nel PdL. Il suo governo viene appoggiato dal PD, dal centro e da Nuovo Centrodestra, un partito nato dalla scissione del PdL, guidato da Angelino Alfano.

Si tengono qualche mese dopo le primarie del PD, ufficialmente senza segretario dalle dimissioni di Bersani, in cui stravince Matteo Renzi, ottenendo quasi il 70% dei voti. Poco tempo dopo Renzi toglie la fiducia al governo Letta, e instaura un nuovo governo da lui guidato, con la stessa maggioranza. 

Dopo qualche mese di governo Renzi ottiene una vittoria schiacciante alle elezioni europee, legittimando così, agli occhi di alcuni, il governo da lui formato.
Stringe in seguito con Berlusconi un patto (il ""patto del Nazareno""), secondo cui, pur non supportando ufficialmente il governo, il partito di Berlusconi, ora chiamato Forza Italia dopo lo scisma da NCD, avrebbe garantito quei voti necessari a far approvare quelle leggi che senza di lui non sarebbero riuscite a passare, come la riforma del lavoro (il ""Job's Act"") o quella elettorale. Questo gli aliena però le simpatie della parte più di sinistra del partito e dell'elettorato, tradizionalmente ostili a Berlusconi.

Si arriva così alla situazione attuale. Nel discorso di fine anno, Giorgio Napolitano, ormai novantenne, annuncia le proprie dimissioni da Presidente della Repubblica, e il parlamento (lo stesso che non ci era precedentemente riuscito) deve eleggere un nuovo capo dello Stato. Tutti i commentatori si aspettano che Renzi cercherà l'accordo con Berlusconi cercando di limitare le spaccature interne al suo partito ma, contro ogni previsione, Renzi propone al PD la candidatura di Sergio Mattarella, un ex democristiano e storico avversario di Berlusconi. La candidatura di Mattarella ricompatta la sinistra e aumenta le spaccature nel centrodestra con NCD che dopo essersi dichiarato contrario vota per Mattarella e una parte di FI che, nonostante si dichieri anch'essa contraria alla candidatura esprime molti voti favorevoli. 

Sergio Mattarella viene eletto Presidente della Repubblica al quarto scrutinio con 665 voti su 1006.

Arriviamo così ad oggi, con la popolarità di Renzi in netta risalita (negli ultimi mesi era molto scesa) e partiti radicali come la Lega Nord in leggera crescita. Il M5S sta probabilmente collassando su se stesso, e Berlusconi è uscito distrutto dall'elezione del PdR. 
Al momento Renzi sarebbe quello col maggior vantaggio ad andare alle elezioni, in quanto molto probabilmente gli restituirebbero una maggioranza molto più ampia di quella che già ha, con gli unici impedimenti che sarebbero la legge elettorale che ancora è in fase di votazione da parte del parlamento, e la scarsa volontà da parte del PdR si sciogliere le camere (aka mandare i cittadini a votare) appena insediato. Renzi continua a dichiarare che il suo governo ancdrà avanti fino alla fine naturale del mandato, quindi nel 2018, ma è più probabile si vada a votare prima.

I dropped learning French because having family in France that speaks fluent English and German is not enough motivation for me to learn the language... The dude that said he found French too hard wasn't me though I'd disagree with him as well.

The point I was going to make is that Japanese or any language in those categories are not difficult to learn. They just take more time to learn. It's not inherently more difficult. 

If you complain about conjugations in French, French is not harder than Norwegian or Danish or whatever other European language that doesn't have as many conjugations. You're just sticking to the wrong method. If you can't just learn them and recall the list of suffixed on demand, maybe you should just have a list with all the conjugations somewhere and look them up. At some point, you'll remember them and they will come naturally. Same with irregular verbs. I can't just memorise a list of irregular verbs. So, I maybe studied them for English for an hour or two so I have a basic idea and the more I used or saw those verbs the easier I could recall the irregular forms. 

Similarly, if you learn Kanji isolated in their own with pronunciation and everything but you actually don't learn very well that way, it will seem incredibly difficult to learn them (some people learn like that very well. Every Japanese person, for example. And ""Remember the Kanji"" is fucking popular as well and uses a similar principle). However, if you find a method that works for you (for example: learning vocabulary with kanji straight away and then learn how to pronounce it), they are not that difficult anymore.

The big difference is that with French, a lot of the grammar and vocabulary is very similar to English. Therefore, especially in the beginning, you can skip a lot of things (again, you don't need to study how to use ""et"" in French because it works just like ""and"") and investing a huge amount of time in studying the ""wrong"" way doesn't seem like such a big deal because those are just ""the hard parts of the language"".

However, in Japanese, very few things works similarly to English. So using methods that do not work for you at all will not get you anywhere. But using methods that work for you will make studying Japanese as easy to do as studying French. It will just take longer because things that are very straight forward in one European language should you already know English might not be as straight forward in Japanese. Like, the difference between politely stating that the bus was late and apologising that you are late because of the bus. In English, ""sorry, the bus was late"" is completely ok. In Japanese, using the wrong form will result in you looking like you say it's not your fault because the bus was late instead of you apologising and taking responsibility for you being late.

Also, mindset is important. If you complain more on reddit that grammatical gender is bullshit (I actually had a standard response in a text document for a long for German because that bullshit comes up so regularly) than thinking about how you can make it easier for you to learn the gender, you're doing something wrong and your problem is not that ""gender is hard to learn"".

I'm not sure why this post has caused such a fuss. All I was saying is that if you tweak your learning methods to a learning style that fits you best, studying Japanese will not be more difficult than studying French. Didn't you learn such things in school where you're from? Pretty much in every school I've been to (secondary school, sixth form and university), there were classes or short lessons for a week or so just about how you can figure out how you learn best and what works for you and what doesn't.

And I was saying that most of the required time investment will come from the writing system in Japanese and Chinese languages. And not because those ""languages are impossible to learn to fluency as an adult"" like a lot of people want you to believe.",1422840402,0,1,

I'm thinking soup...or rice paste in water?

Flour and water, sometime mixed with cow's milk, in Europe, mostly, called ""pap.""  Some--as many as half-- babies survived it.

The thing about infant formula is that it is balanced so as not to have proteins the baby can't digest and has the right balance of sugars, salts, and liquids.  Having the wrong balance can damage the baby's digestive system and cause internal bleeding.  And using contaminated water (most preindustrial especially urban water) can cause diseases that kill babies quickly.  Even today in third world countries there are a lot of inaant deaths attributable to formula use--overdilution, use with unsafe water, insufficient amounts, etc.  and that's with carefully balanced formula that's usually safely used in developed countries.",1422840628,0,1,

True, but its a mistake to think they actually cost money -- they make people more productive, healthy, happy and creative. You don't just have to compete on price.

First, make sure that when you flip the bottles, choose the one that takes more time for the air bubble to reach the top. Then when you shake it, the smaller the air bubbles, the more viscous. The darker also the better.

I know for a fact that most ""industrial"" companies mix pure olive oil with cooking oil to increase the profit. So I tend to run away from ""big names"" of Spanish, Italian or Portuguese olive oil brands. Nevertheless I do not know their smaller producers, as well as the ones from Greece, or Croatia, etc..

What I know is that I live in Poland and I choose Portuguese olive oil. I can find it here from a reliable brand and from all the stores I have looked, most brand give me chills.

This means that even though Oceania is in a constant state of war, the people are acting like there is peace as well, hence they can easily switch from one emotion to the other, in accordance to what The Party asks of them.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
In other words, They see it; Make all the connections, But just like that double thinking, They can switch from it both being a large thing causing many issues, and being only a thing for say addicts. And they can switch from it at any time.  
  
They see a video, Then they make the connection. They see the person, they switch.

The Mythical Übermensch, to serve as inspiration to the masses: any white male of British nationality, with an Irish, Scottish, English or Welsh accent, preferably dark-haired, with ""complex"" features, and starring in any subculture fandom television series, and okay with having lots of fic written about him wherein we the Fat White Female Sexually Damaged Supermenschen may rape him repeatedly with nonconsensual pegging by autobiographical, literary proxy

Japanese and Italian Axis Powers: Anything trans that is not the dreaded FTM.  If female to male, it's AN OPPRESSOR.  Swarm and attack.  MTF is the ONLY true Axis Power worthy of our struggle.

The Allies: white heterosexual males, heterosexual females of any race or color but especially Asians because The Übermenschen might like her better!, lesbians, actual feminists, Redditors who see through our bullshit, our parents, and most especially psychiatrists who recommend 72 hours, involuntary, in a psych ward, RIGHT NOW

Üntermenschen: anybody normal who sees through this.  Reddit is the land of the Üntermenschen.  Invasion is being planned as we speak.

The Jews: normal, sane people, gay, bisexual or straight, who know who they are and reject damaged little white privileged fat girls inventing and adding acronym letters to their community nickname in order to remain at the top of the social chain where these bitches have always been since the very start of European history.

Or, just someone female who can control her weight.

It's not about fear or appeasement. US and EU don't have a horse in this race, there is no reason for them to risk anything for Ukraine. 

&gt; It doesn't matter what you think. Matters the reality that if Russia could really afford to carry a full invasion of annex any more territory of Ukraine, it would have done so.

Russia attempted the diplomatic approach while at the same time collecting the debts Ukraine owes to Russia. In march Russia will be able to take $3bln in Eurobonds Ukraine owes to Russia, shortly after that Ukraine should expect the war to start.

It's also worth noting that the traditional aspects of it as a courtly language don't necessarily reflect its use as a lingua franca (which is essentially what we're talking about); I mean, a lot of the intellectuals and courtly nobles would also have spoken latin/greek, so language usage amongst a very elitist group (who to this day, might well be snobby about people if they aren't bilingual at least; it's still a requirement for many jobs in the EU iirc) isn't a great indicator. There's quite a history of British nobility being very snobbish about the English language (with Saxon roots etc), and many of the British royalty wouldn't speak it at their own court, so it's partly down to a certain perception of the language (which in places, it still sort of has -- it's just now dirty peasants have been replaced by annoying tourists, and it certainly isn't considered a romantic language the way that French is).

The English language was very widespread beforehand (examples being that the British pioneered telegraphs, and spread them due to the Empire, meaning mostly they were operated in English, as well as spreading the language through Radio, Film, later Television, and of course, having a monumentally vast empire with a huge bureaucracy which encouraged people from all around the globe to learn English as an opporunity for progression). 

It's also important to note that what you're seeing as the Rise of English (coinciding with America coming to prominence as a world power) also coincides with a drastic drop in French influence, which might explain the growing prominence of English (due to the falling away of competition), better than the rise of America (which is essentially replacing one English-speaking superpower with another). I'm not denying the huge spread of American culture in promoting the English language, but it's more a continuation of a phenomena that was already occurring, aided by the collapse of Imperial France, than something that promptly happens after the war solely due to American films etc.",1422846612,0,2,

I'd try Googling 'male witches', which is what I just did and immediately came up with this (I've added the italics):

&gt; Research is always exciting when the data do not quite fit the established paradigms and explanatory models. *An entire body of literature, mainly by avowed feminists, has argued that witch-hunting was in essence woman-hunting, despite the fact that many of those executed for the crime of witchcraft were men* … Various attempts have been made to explain away this feature of witch-hunting … , but none will really do, in part because they cannot make sense of areas like Normandy, Estonia or Iceland, where the vast majority of witches were men. *A fundamental problem with previous interpretations of male witches is that they treat their subject as anomalous, even impossible*. This assumption has lead to *the virtual exclusion of male witches from witchcraft studies, especially from those concerned with issues of gender.*

- Apps, L. and Gow, A. (2003) *Male witches in early modern Europe.* Manchester University Press (pp. 1-2)

I haven't read the book, but I think that pretty much might answer your question. Speaking of which, I haven't read Federici either, but I don't think I need to in order to see where her argument's going.

Marxists, like Feminists, do have the advantage of being somewhat predictable in their analyses which means you can generally see where it is they are going without having to get to grips with the nitty-gritty of the details.

&gt; Unlike most feminists (and most Marxists) she argues that women actually had considerable power in peasant societies …

I disagree that she is 'Unlike most feminists' and would say it's actually pretty typical of them to identify a supposedly prelapsarian epoch in which everything was just so much better than it is now under the evils of capitalism.

Never mind the bubonic plague, malnutrition and an average lifespan leading to death at 40, a near total absence of effective contraception, dentistry etc. - there was no *capitalism* and therefore there was no interclass exploitation and, therefore, no patriarchal exploitation of womankind in the service of filthy lucre.

In fact, the more I think about it Federici sounds to me like an absolutely bog-standard, run-of-the-mill, never-let-the facts-get-in-the-way-of-the-argument Feminist. For instance:

&gt;""Witches"" were often ""medicine women"" who were able to induce abortions using herbs and other methods.

Really? I find that most unlikely - as the kind of peasant women she's describing would have almost certainly been illiterate then it means she either has no proof whatsoever for this claim or more likely she's doing what she no doubt calls a 'Feminist/Marxist' reading of historical primary sources.

But those primary sources would have been by definition written by people who were lettered and I would assume at least some of those doing the writing would have been the prosecutors of the witches.

As witches were also commonly credited with causing crops to fail and cattle to fall ill, it's not that surprising that they might also claim that the witches caused women to miscarry.

This is only a guess, but if Federici is using that as evidence that there were herbal ways of successfully inducing abortion it means she might be a Feminist and a Marxist but she's not a historian worthy of the name.

But that's a wild guess and to be fair, I haven't read the book as you have so perhaps it is quite thought-provoking but on the evidence of your description above that seems rather unlikely.

The truth was that in Vienna, the noblemen liked to watch improvisation contests for entertainment. 2 noblemen would sponsor 2 musical masters to a showdown, and all their noble friends would watch.

It was decided that Beethoven should compete with Daniel Steibelt of Berlin, one of Europes most renouned Piano Virtuosos. 

In these improvisation battles, each person improvises on the tune of the previous. Daniel Steibelt was first. He tossed one sheet of music to the floor and started playing the Piano.
According to some, the piece he tossed aside was the very piece he played, so he was doing it all by heart to show off.

Steibelt's music was good, he rose to thunderous applause, then Beethoven got up to play.

Beethoven picked up the sheet of music Stiebelt had discarded, looked it over, showed it to the crowd, THEN turned it upside down, and started playing, improvising on the first bar, mimicing Stiebelt's style, then parodying it, embellishing it.

Stiebelt knew he was being humiliated, so he got up and left, and said to the nobleman that sponsored him that he would never again live in Vienna while Beethoven was there.

Beethoven lived in Vienna the rest of his life, And Stiebelt never returned to the city.

Beethoven was a bad-ass. That said, Daniel Steibelt was a good musician in his own right, and had a successful career.

Quest 1: With his superior armor and his trusty Assault Rifle, Caboose blunders his way through Camelot and beyond, annihilating everything in his path.  He leaves nothing but dead Frenchies and his own fellow knights in his wake, having accidentally killed all of them.  Soon all of Europe shall learn to fear his name.

Quest 2: Much like in Camelot, Caboose's plot armor, idiocy, and hidden genius carries him to victory here, though at the cost of everyone near to him (a thousand cheers for Navi's accidental death) Until he reaches Ganondorf.  But have no fear, for to Caboose, Ganondorf looks like a giant kitten (don't ask why).  Caboose goes full O'Malley mode and punches a hole through Ganondorf's chest, crushing the demon's heart with his right hand.

Quest 3: Upon receiving the ring, Caboose immediately puts it on when Gandalf tells him not to.  The other members of the Fellowship attack him, unfortunately getting in the way of the bullets he is shooting from the assault rifle he has pointed at them.  Gandalf survives, but Sauron appears.  Caboose engages Sauron in a staring competition (Caboose of course cheats because he has his SPARTAN helmet on) and meanwhile accidentally kills Gandalf.  Caboose then travels all the way to Mount Doom or whatever that happy little hill was called, accidentally killing his new Ork friends in the process.  Since Sauron seems to like the ring so much, he drops it in Mount Doom, saving Middle Earth.

Quest 4: Well first of all we need a change to the story: Caboose kills his wife and kids because they're his wife and kids, not because Hera made him insane or anything ridiculous like that.  Caboose then receives the whole shpeel from Apollo's oracle (whom he promptly shoots to death in exchange for her helpfulness).  Right off the bat he kills Eurystheus.  Apollo gets super pissed and descends upon Caboose.  Caboose sees Apollo's lyre and begins to sing, and Apollo chooses suicide rather than listening to Caboose sing.  He completes the 12 quests anyways, ""helping"" his new friends in various ways.

Quest 5: The various wizards of Harry Potter disappear one by one around Caboose.  Voldemort returns only to find most of Hogwarts wiped out by the Blue Team menace.  He decides to befriend someone who must surely be a powerful wizard.  Bad choice.  Through sheer luck Caboose stumbles across all the Horcruxes and accidentally destroys them.  One.  By.  One.

Quest 6: Uncle Lars and Aunt Beru meet a grisly (totally accidental) fate at the hands of Caboose long before any sandtroopers come across their house.  R2D2 and C3PO are quickly accidentally sold off for scrap metal by Caboose as well.  Obi-Wan Kenobi tries to tame this beast, but to no avail, when Caboose accidentally slices Obi-Wan's head off while playing with the funny blue laser sword.  He finds Han Solo and Chewie, only to accidentally kill them with a full magazine of AR bullets while trying to save them from Greedo (he gets Greedo too).  He takes the Millenium Falcon and finds the Death Star long before it shoots Alderaan.  After accidentally shooting some stormtroopers and pushing a lot of buttons he shouldn't push, the Death Star's engines malfunction.  As Caboose flies off in a TIE fighter, all the Death Star's emergency pods and hangar bays lock up to prevent any escape, and the moon-sized space station crashes into Alderaan.

Quest 7: Caboose accidentally kills his captors and escapes.  The Devil, noticing Caboose's weakness, attempts to seduce Caboose into sinning.  Caboose promptly accidentally kills his new best friend Satan.  God comes down, mortified by this...this thing that replaced his Son, and immediately attempts to erase Caboose from history itself.  Slowly, slowly, Caboose walks up to God, holy sword dipped in Satan's blood in hand.",1422849471,0,4,

This is not some myth, this is actual fact that is leading research into using the sourdough to render bread gluten free. A slice of Rye sourdough would have between 5mg and 50mg of gluten depending on how long the bacteria in the sourdough was given to eat on the rye flour, the typical slice of wheat bread has about 5grams (that's a pretty big difference).

People with the genetics for Celiacs disease can (many do) go a significant amount of their life before the disease actually triggers... I didn't start showing signs till I was 24, and my mother wasnt diagnosed till she was in her 40s but probably had issues stemming from the disease tracing back to mid 20s. Considering the gene pool commonly procreated in the late teens and early 20s prior to the common age... that seems like it would be adequate to avoid implications of the disease causing significant effect to reproduction, especially in countries where rye sourdough was the primary grain in the diet.

""Have the genetics for"" is not a meaningless statement when talking about autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disease aren't always active and can be in remission entire life times. I know several other  Celiacs that point to stress sparking their symptoms and leading to their eventual diagnoses.

No real doctor is suggesting not getting a vaccine, any that are will likely be sued and have their medical licence revoked.

**Critical reception:**

&gt; Initial reviews of the film were thoroughly mixed. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, ""There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job."" Crowther called the ""slow buildups to sudden shocks"" reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock's psychological points, reminiscent of Krafft-Ebing's studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast's performances as ""fair"". British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer. Other negative reviews stated, ""a blot on an honorable career"", ""plainly a gimmick movie"", and ""merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours."" Positive reviews stated, ""Anthony Perkins' performance is the best of his career ... Janet Leigh has never been better"", ""played out beautifully"", and ""first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films."" A good example of the mix is the New York Herald Tribune's review, which stated, ""... rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take ... keeps your attention like a snake-charmer.""

What is meaning after all? Are we suggesting that life has a meaning as simple and denotative as the word ""goat?"" Or are we talking about literary meaning? Is life supposed to be seen as a complex Aristotelian tragedy- the only literary form most of us learned in high school- with a simple hamartia the understanding of which will provide catharsis on our deathbeds? Aristotelian tragedy is a pretty simple formula compared to life's complexity and it's really only one literary structure, what if life carries meaning more like a European folk tale - little sections, sometimes from other tales, zippered together in a particular sequence by an expert oral storyteller and whose meaning has more to do with passing the time and entertaining peasants than a moralistic Athenian view of literature? What if life has meaning like a Mark Rothko painting and it's just ""red?"" What if the ""goat"" is ""red?""
""Meaning"" is such a poorly defined empty concept that without clarification it's basically, and ironically, meaningless. 
The problem is in the question. We have strung so many barely related ideas about signification, communication and riddle solving together into our concept of the word ""meaning"" that to ask ""What is the meaning of life?"" is silly. 
Ironically the complexity encountered in trying to define ""life"" is much simpler than the word meaning. And why would we even ask it? Are we asking for the ""point"" of life? Then we should say what we mean and clearly define our terms. The point of life is considerably simpler.

The Ottoman Empire was largely seen as a occupying force by Greek people, and everyone else on mainland Europe.

A historical conflict is between Macedonia and Greece too, but that's not relevant to this story, but I put it there so you'd understand how far back this goes. 

What the Ottoman's installed in every country in the balkans was a culture of corruption, distrust of governmental authority. Laws were installed by what was a Sultan of different religion and foreign to them. Official laws did not mean much. It goes back to when Greece was occupied. People had no regard for the Sultan and the government that was seen as occupying Greece. People in authority were put there and they were corrupt as fuck. If you haven't visited the region then you don't really understand what the political culture is like, but it's very broken, and all countries have not yet recovered from that period.

The people weren't blaming turkish people, but trying to explain to you that the cultural aspect of this goes back to Ottoman occupation.

A more concrete example of political-cultural differences is Romania. Transilvania was part of the Habsburg Empire, and Moldavia and Wallahia were part of the Ottoman Empire. You can see even now after a long time, and communism, very big differences in political culture of the 3 regions. Social and economical differences too.

&gt; *A prolonged crisis in Ukraine began on 21 November 2013, when then president Viktor Yanukovych suspended preparations for the implementation of an association agreement with the European Union. This decision resulted in mass protests by its opponents, known as the ""Euromaidan"". After months of such protests, Yanukovych was ousted by the protesters on 22 February 2014, when he fled the Ukrainian capital city of Kiev. Following his ousting, unrest enveloped the largely Russophone eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, from where he had drawn most of his support. An ensuing political crisis in Ukrainian autonomous region of Crimea resulted in the annexation of Crimea by Russia on 18 March. Subsequently, unrest in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine evolved into a war between the post-revolutionary Ukrainian government and pro-Russian insurgents.*

You claimed that the culture of contemporary Native American groups is a reconstruction of their pre-Columbian culture. I state there is no way to verify that due to a lack of primary pre-Columbian sources. All primary sources regarding Indian culture were either written by Europeans or influenced by Europeans, therefore, their cultures have already undergone a staggering degree of synthesis.

Above Crete a wide variety of countries can be found ranging from for example Italy, central European countries and most Scandinavian countries. Scandinavian countries that have little in common with Mediterranean diet with their dairy, red meat, potato and wheat and a lack of olive oil.

One other reason why one would be seeing more old people in Crete then elsewhere could be that many young ones have moved or working on the main land or abroad. That is sometimes the case in island communities, the young wander and the old remains.

Obviously it is foolish for a state to ""rack up debts it can't pay"" but that isn't really what happened with Greece. They racked up debts that their economic growth made paying perfectly possible and these debts were part of generating that growth. Then the 2008 financial crisis hit and creditors started demanding outrageous interest rates to lend more money, all states were borrowing like crazy at this time and Greece didn't have exactly the same kind of weight as Germany or France who not only bailed the banks out but were much better investments for international financiers. But without these new loans Greece would default on their debt, just like Germany and France would without loans. This of course scared the Germans and French shitless because it was mainly their banks that would need bailed out again *for lending to a risky country in the first place*. So, they got the EU, ECB and IMF together to create a new loan with a nice interest rate for Greece but which could *only* go to paying off the debt, not paying their current obligations, many of which were essential to the functioning of the Greek economy. It also required austerity to be implemented.  So now the German and French banks are in the clear having made a killing on Greek debt and Greece is really screwed with no foreseeable way to escape the spiral it is in.  

Furthermore, those loans were agreed upon by corrupt parties which represented the interests of Greek elites, who are still doing rather fine since Greek ""austerity"" hasn't actually managed to actually get them to pay their taxes, rather than the Greek people as a whole. 

But most importantly, the idea that the problem it is was the Greek state being foolish and ""racking up debts"" is nonsense, it was billionaire financial capitalists who risked their money and lost due to the 2008 crisis but shifted the cost of their failure onto the Greek people. This same exact thing happened in cities like Detroit for example where public pensions were invested with companies like Merrill Lynch and vanished overnight but the debt obligations (loans that were ironically backed in part by the investments by these same cities) to these same companies didn't. So now the cities can't even fund water infrastructure or police in many cases and the capitalists make out like bandits looting the assets of the cities as they get liquidated, all due to their own gambling and fraud that sparked the crisis in the first place.

However, Napoleon III would not undertake any kind of action at sea without the approval of the British. The British were less than lukewarm about the idea, and thus no intervention came about from the French. The French did extend credits to the CSA to some extent and did build the ironclad *CSS Stonewall* for the CSA, but otherwise did not interfer. They were, as /u/Domini_canes describes from the other side, involved in the unification of Italy at the time. The French also got involved in Mexico by placing Archduke Maximilian (brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria) as Emperor in Mexico. In that they had support from Austrian and Belgian (Maximilians wife Carlota was Belgian) volunteers. This intervention was in breach of the Monroe doctrine, and would most likely not have been possible if the USA had not been in a civil war.

The British toyed with the idea of intervention, but the general populace of Britain was staunchly abolotionist. Britain had spearheaded the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, declaring slave shipping the same as piracy and establishing the West African Squadron to combat slave trading 1808. Slavery was abolished in the British Empire 1833 (except for India, Ceylon and Saint Helena, where it was abolished 1843). Popular sentiment made it pretty much impossible for the British to side with the slaveowners of the CSA, and barring a major incident, intervention was far away. The Trent Affari of 1861, when a USA ship boarded a British mail ship, the *RMS Trent* and took her prize because she had two CSA diplomats bound for Britain aboard did cause an outrage in Britain, but Lincoln ordered all British demands agreed to, and Prince-consort Albert (husband of Queen Victoria) did much to soothe the sentiment in Britain, and the affair blew over. The British did sell arms and ammunition (primarily Enfield rifled muskets and Armstrong cannons) and bought other goods through the USA blockade, did extend credits to the CSA and did build and equip ships for the CSA navy - the latter which they paid reparations for after the war.

The Austrians were still licking their wounds after their defeat in the War of Italian Unification against Sardinia-Piedimonte and France, and were in the process of reforming their army. They were incolved in the French attempt to place Maximilian on an Imperial throne of Mexico but also sold large amounts of Lorenz rifle muskets to both sides in the war. Austria would send a large part of its small navy to fight against the Danes in the North Sea 1864, as the Prussian navy was almost non-existant.

Prussia were at the time gearing up for the war against Denmark 1864 and eventually the struggle with Austria over the domination of Germany and with France over the unification of Germany., Generally, the Prussians, who had learned and improved the French staff system were disdainful of the amateur style of American warfare. There's an oft-quoted statement by von Moltke the elder that the US Civil War ""consists of two armed mobs chasing each other around the country, from which nothing can be learned"", however, I have never been able to substantiate it in any sources, so it is probably made up. However, it does give the sentiment of many European professional officers - their own wars were rapid and decisive with heavy pursuit by reserves and above all cavalry of the defeated army, rendering it unable to fight again - the inability of the USA or CSA armies to do that made European officers view the war as little to learn from.

Russia supported the USA and maintained friendly relations - a large part of the Russian navy visited USA ports, partially as the Rising in Poland had the French talk about another Crimean War and the Russians wanted to maintain a part of their navy outside the Baltic and the Black Sea.

Sweden firmly supported the USA and large amounts of Swedish emigrants Went ot the USA and many of them volunteered to fight for the Union side.

This is only a very little factor.

This indeed plays a major role, but isn't the main reason. By the way, I think food would be a better example than cars.

&gt; Now they have to lift some of them not just in germany but europe wide will if the agreement passes.

This, indeed, is a major part. The laws and regulations on goods are different.
And on all topics so far, Europe should adapt to the US, and not the other way around. 
Which is a major fuck over for german/european consumer protection laws.

Chiar cand a fost in alpha l-am cumparat si in primele momente a fost un joc exceptional. Era ceva nou pe toata piata jocurilor (majoritatea nu jucau mod dayz ca era extraordinar de buggy) si chiar o picat foarte bine consumatorilor. Am jucat impreuna cu prietenii mei si pot sa zic ca ne-a tinut some time + ca nu era pay to win deloc. Au futut tot meciul cand au inceput sa adauge micro-tranzactiile si a devenit pay to win. Pe langa asta, au aparut si A MASSIVE SHITLOAD of hackers si abia puteai sa faci ceva. In fine, fuck it. A aparut DayZ standalone si nu cred ca am dormit 3 nopti la rand la cat de excited am fost sa-l joc. Pe langa faptul ca are probleme cu grafica(am pc bun si abia scot 20 fps) e si plin de glitches. Ce ma frustreaza pe mine la DayZ e ca stai cateva zile sa iti cauti gear si sa te echipezi si dupa te omoara un team de 7-8 si iarasi trebuie sa incepi de la 0.

TL;DR am jucat Rust, WarZ, DayZ standalone si nu is cine stie ce. Nu am sa cumpar jocul asta si nu o sa-l joc pentru simplul fapt ca e free 2 play si o sa trebuiasca sa bagi un shitload of money ca sa ai avantaje and so on.",1422870600,0,1,

Orbán also made sure that we're dependent on Russian gas more than before. Russia can go ""Veto, or freeze to death"" if it wants to. (The part about using gas as a leverage is speculation from my side, though, and I'm in a pessimist mood.)


Not to mention that the government took over the 2nd biggest national TV channel, TV2, and uses it for propaganda purposes. In the meanwhile, they put shitloads of tax burden on the biggest TV channel, RTL, for criticizing Fidesz. 


Fidesz is so kind, they are always eager to help poor families. Especially when it's time to vote. A sack of potato here, a glass of ""fröccs"", or a pack of cigarettes there, maybe some firewood, and they have a significant voter-base.


They're also taking advantage of the fall of the socialist party. It's nearly impossible for an opposition to rise, because Fidesz can easily turn them into a public enemy using pro-Fidesz newspapers and TV channels. Watered down version of 1984. Manipulating with half truths or straight up lies. Sometimes the public enemy is Gyurcsány, sometimes online journalists, sometimes other Fidesz polticians who fell out of line. Just tell an average János or average Juli that Gyurcsány is behind the opposition, and they will offer free rimjobs to Orbán/Vona.


Ohh, did I mention that Gábor Vona's collection of retards, called Jobbik, is currently the strongest opposition? It's not a coincidence. Fidesz kinda helped them ""rise"". Heroizing pro-Fidesz and pro-Jobbik protesters who fucked shit up in Budapest back in 2006 was their work. Now Fidesz can use Jobbik as a way to deter the people from the opposition. Can't wait until Fidesz starts losing another few thousand voters. I can guarantee some ""Jobbik is nazi/racist/xenophobic/pro-terrorism"" stuff in the media. What's even more sad is that that would be the first time they tell the truth.


Btw, Jobbik and Fidesz, hand in hand, turned ""liberal"" into a swear-word. Synonyms in their dictionary: Jews, gypsys, EU-fags, EU itself, Americans, zionists, lizardmen.


So no, apart from distancing Hungary from the EU and going closer (indebting us) to Russia, mass manipulation by media, using the public's hate against the socialists, shifting blame to Gyurcsány, killing viable options of opposition before they were even made, ""bribing"" voters, trying to bring down freedom of speech, ""artificially"" creating an unappealing (to people who actually think.) opposition and lifting it up, while destroying the political ideology of the liberal opposition, no, they haven't done anything to prevent us from saving ourselves.",1422871099,0,9,

I would say there is Russia, and then there is Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Those two are different from the rest in so many aspects that it's important to separate them.  They are more expensive and more ""familiar"" in many ways.

Generally most things are the same; if it wouldn't be for the many signs in cyrillic and the less than stellar immigration procedure at airports; you would feel right at home.  It looks very much the same as you expect any other place in Europe to look like.  Especially for me as an Austrian it's quite easy to fit in generally, as there are lots of Austrian stores and chains in Eastern Europe.

The things that are different:

* attitude to waste management.  I would say they are very American in that approach in that waste separation is not something people do.  There are huge dumpsters everywhere and people just dump everything in.  They are collected frequently but people also just put stuff next to dumpsters.  Not because they are over full, but because they hope someone picks those things up and uses them (cloths, furniture etc.)
* what you get for what you pay is not easy to figure out sometimes.  Metro and taxis are dirt cheap (I went from airport to city center in Ekterinburg for less than 8 euro). Gas and heating is super cheap as well.  Yet flats, furniture and food is pretty much the same as here if you want the same standard.
* Lots of immigrants; many more than I expected first time I was there.
* So much bureaucracy.  I thought Austria is bad, but Russia takes it many steps further.  Many different places you need to go to to get shit done, many stamps, many quite arbitrary procedures.  And because the state does not spend money on that, you go to utterly devastated places to get things in order.  Even if you just need to register your visa you will stroll into a post office of which I have yet to find a place that does not look like it was built in pre-Stalin times.
* They love their military.  If you think the US like their army, then you have not seen Russia yet.  Day of the soldier or whatever it is, is a thing there.
* People take more care of their health than here; that applies more to women than man in general, but it applies to both sexes.  Part of this probably also has to do with the fact that it's generally safer that way.  The social support for certain types of diseases is not good.
* Do not take illegal drugs.  Whereas here in Europe people treat drugs as a general thing that you might take, in Russia if you get hooked on something bad you have lost in life with no chance of coming back.  Huge HIV rates, no state support for dealing with it, no provided alternatives.  Drugs in Russia: not even once.
* Some rules are arbitrary.  For a Westerner it's impossible to understand sometimes why things work in a certain way.  I got my luggage stuck in Moscow customs by accident since BA checked it through (incorrectly) and the process to get it back into my hands looked super bizarre.  It involved giving a airport employee some cash and he filling out my customs declaration with made up things.
* The food is of very high quality.  In general I think they eat a lot healthier than here.

For me, culture shock is never what gets to me so much as ""reverse culture shock"" where you go back to a place you were and realize what you were used to without.  For example, I was in Zimbabwe in 2009 during the height of hyperinflation, and even after just a few days I was *shocked* when I reached the international airport in Johannesburg because you could *buy* stuff.  There was *nothing* in the shops in Zimbabwe anymore- I was in Victoria Falls for example, and could not buy a simple postcard of one of the most famous sites in Africa because they literally did not have them.  The idea that I could buy a magazine and even dare to eat sushi (which requires a lot of prep and cleanliness you wouldn't risk in places with intermittent power, trust me) was just shocking to me.

The other one I remember clearly was the time I was traveling in the 3rd world for about 3 months (in Africa and Asia) and then going to Europe afterwards.  I remember standing in the airport in Brussels staring at the tap in the bathroom for a moment amazed to realize I could just drink the water and not die, and throw the toilet paper into the toilet without wrecking the plumbing.  Trust me, my future children are going to get an earful about wasting water if they ever do, as it's impossible to describe how precious a resource clean water is unless you do without for awhile.

Finally, I should note one weird thing I *do* notice in places like Asia is the severe obsession that develops after a few weeks over cheese, or rather the lack thereof (most of Asia is lactose intolerant so they don't really make cheese products anywhere).  I never quite worked out if I had some sort of mineral I was lacking in my diet that started the craving, or if it's just because cheese is awesome.",1422877003,0,0,

Let me get this right, you were spurned by one family who happened to subscribe to a worldview that would actually condemn their treatment of you and self righteousness, so rather than blaming that family, you make an umbrella condemnation of everyone who holds to that worldview?

In the Judeo-Christian worldview, pride is the original sin that caused the fall of Satan--self-righteousness, by its very definition is one of the most unChristian attitudes that a person can have. There certainly are many self-righteous, bullying Christians; but that is not as a result of the teachings of Jesus. 

There are self-righteous, bullying people from every worldview and religious faith background--that is part of the human condition. Evaluate a worldview based on its philosophical and ideological tenants and not its worst representatives. 

The freedoms of religion and conscience enjoyed by so many in the United States were originally fought for tooth and nail by nonconformist Christians (the historical predecessors to today's neo-Evangelicals)--look into the founding of Rhode Island; or the battle that Baptists fought for religious freedom in the 1770's and 80's. 

Evangelical Christianity actually promotes religious liberty--it teaches that everyone should have a choice to believe what they want to believe. Without this freedom of conscience, this choice, then the calls to follow Jesus would be meaningless. Consider that in the 1770's all European countries still had established state churches; and some had very little room for dissenting voices. It was nonconformist Christians, pushing their beliefs on the new nation that ensured that you now have the freedom to disbelieve in Christianity.",1422877928,0,1,

That's not what ""militia"" or ""regulated"" mean in the terminology of that time period. A ""well regulated militia"" were simply like minded people who had practiced with their weaponry.

Here, let me break down the stupidity of your argument in multiple ways: 

The founding fathers did not fight a war against an oppressive government only to take the power of self defense and place it under control of the government. Learn to rationalize a bit. The second amendment is designed so that the people may revoke the power of an oppressive American government.

Further: **The first 10 amendments to the constitution, the bill of rights? They are all individual rights. They were laid out SPECIFICALLY in that fashion to clearly delineate the rights of the individual vs. that which the government could control. All other rights in the Bill of Rights are individual rights. Whoever taught you in grade school didn't do a very good job, as this is a basic lesson regarding the Constitution.**

**It is not a happy or random coincidence that the right to bear arms falls in line right behind the right to speak your mind. Those things were put in place in that way for a very clear reason.**

Lastly: In your little fantasy the government is responsible for ""well regulated militias"", right?

I bet you, like most other people like you have never looked into the sentiment governing militias during the time frame of the founding fathers:

During the Congressional debates, James Madison discussed how a militia could help defend liberty against tyranny and oppression:

The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors.""- (Source I Annals of Congress 434, June 8, 1789)

Additionally:

The Militia Act of 1792[17] clarified whom the militia consists of; "" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, by the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company, within whose bounds such citizen shall reside, and that within twelve months after the passing of this Act."" 

This is why you, as an American male of age sign up for selective service, so that when necessary the government can raise a militia of able bodied men from among the citizenry.

This idea is completely different than what you believe to be a militia impinging on the freedoms of the second amendment.

Stop trying to make a mockery of the Constitution of the United States with your gross, childish interpretation. The items above as well as others are what Constitutional scholars and the Supreme court rely on when making decisions. You're ignorant, stop espousing your ignorance as fact.

The way you people sit and try to destroy the Constitution and the intent of such a document should give any American pause to wonder what your goal is. You live in a time in this country when the government is pissing on the 4th amendment daily and you want to give up the second amendment?

The problem is, national identities at this point in time *do* matter. They probably matter less than they did a century ago, and they matter more than they probably should, but there are two noteworthy things that in my opinion make the national flags preferable:

- Intent: If I say ""Germany should send more money to Greece"" then that means something else than if a Greek person says that. Since I am a German taxpayer, that means that I am of the opinion that we should sent part of my tax money towards Greece. If a Greek says that, there is the implication of just wanting free stuff. Now don't get me wrong, in an ideal world this would not matter because people just try to find out what's best for everyone, but so far we certainly aren't there yet (and I don't know whether we every will).

- Information: You linked me stuff from local Berlin politics. Now I am not from Berlin, but since you knew I was German you could infer that I would be at least vaguely familiar with the situation in Berlin and could put party politics and stuff into context. Moreover, you knew that I speak German, so I could actually make use of that video. In contrast, I mentioned the KfW above, and I wasn't sure whether you knew what that is, because you could be from anywhere in Europe. 

So in my opinion that makes it more useful to use the national flag, even though as a eurofederalist, I have toyed with the statement that the EU flag brings. Using the EU flag is perfectly fine, but there are arguments to be made for keeping the national flag.

PS: You miss out on the light banter without a national flag. While it doesn't add much, sometimes it's funny and I like it very much that this is the level we ""fight"" each other now (besides football, of course).",1422884826,0,2,

That's because I never said anything of the sort. I said that other major powers are not willing to fight Russia for Ukraine. They are willing to send aid but sending troops is something that has already been ruled out. 

&gt; Considering Russia's current economic state &amp; the fact that the Ukrainian conflict will be much more costly for Russia than planned with no end in sight &amp; increased support for Ukraine among western nations as well as more sanctions which will severly damage Russia's economy more than it already is, things aren't exactly looking great for Russia.

“You cannot keep on squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression. At some point there has to be a growth strategy in order for them to pay off their debts to eliminate some of their deficits,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria aired Sunday.

 

He said Athens needs to restructure its economy to boost its competitiveness, “but it’s very hard to initiate those changes if people’s standards of livings are dropping by 25%. Over time, eventually the political system, the society can’t sustain it.”

...

“More broadly, I’m concerned about growth in Europe, ” he added. He said fiscal prudence and structural changes are important in many eurozone countries, but “what we’ve learned in the U.S. experience...is that the best way to reduce deficits and to restore fiscal soundness is to grow. And when you have an economy that is in a free-fall there has to be a growth strategy and not simply the effort to squeeze more and more from a population that is hurting worse and worse.”

What I'm hearing from this is that he's saying without massive levels of investment we're going to follow the 5 to 6.5%/a conventional depletion curve down. The investment figure from IEA was something in the neighborhood of 42 trillion (is that half of total world GDP? I can't remember the exact figure at the moment) The really big question is can that level of investment be sustained in a decline scenario. James Hamilton puts the cost of not having enough oil at about -14% percent of GDP (oils upside contribution is about 1.5% but this is assymetric and not having enough is much more costly than having a steady supply). With two articles today on the front page with peakists calling 2015 as the start of sustained declines I'm starting to feel like we might actually be moving into the decline horizon. I won't be at all shocked if 2015 rolls in with recessions in Canada and Europe and ends with another global financial crisis. If that plays out the investment gap is going to start to lock us in to that decline curve. ,1422886527,0,7,

Voting out in a referendum would make the European question irrelevant in British politics, not solve it.    

Nails the stay aspect:

&gt;It is Britain’s feelings towards the EU that could be the hardest to shift. Anybody who hopes a referendum can kill off Euroscepticism in the UK should look to the hopes in Scotland that a vote to stay in the UK would kill off the SNP. Euroscepticism is deeply embedded in British politics. A referendum will not change factors that drive it 

Misses the Leave element by a country mile:

&gt;This might seem to point to an exit vote as the simplest option, but withdrawal is far from a straightforward solution with acrimonious relations likely to follow in both British politics and UK-EU relations. Just as could happen with a vote to stay in, questions about what the British people were voting on – an unpopular government or leader rather than the issue of Europe – could hang over an out vote, especially if the majority is a slim one. The unity of the UK could be tested if areas such as Scotland or London voted to remain in the EU. So long as the EU is Europe’s predominant political, economic and legal organisation then it will stand accused by some in the UK of interfering in British life and failing to respect Britain’s sovereignty. Britain’s position in the world will remain unclear; dreams of splendid isolation from Europe ignore that Britain no longer has the imperial might that allowed it to do this during the nineteenth century. Whether it is globalisation or Europeanisation, Britain will remain under pressure to be open to the whole world. Immigration, as it has long been in British history, will remain a contentious issue.

Nobody wants 'splendid isolation' or wants a return to an imperial dream.

It's academic projectionism from somebody waking up to the idea that euroscepticism won't go away if a referendum delivers a stay vote, but by someone who doesn't quite yet want to wake up to what the Eurosceptics think or want.",1422887086,0,6,

&gt;

&gt;__Seven-league boots__ is an element in [European folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_folklore). The [boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot) allows the person wearing them to take strides of seven [leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_(unit\)) per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often presented by a magical character to the [protagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist) to aid in the completion of a significant task.

In the US in order for a 14yo to get their moped license it must be 1HP or less, 50CC or less and a top speed of ~32MPH as well as some other nonsense rules. After you get your license, nobody checks if its stock.

By going with a higher gear ratio I traded acceleration for topspeed. By going with aftermarket exhaust I increased it beyond 2.75HP. It was a european moped and for US export they gave it super restrictive exhaust. It was something like 4-5HP based on some math I did involving wind resistance. Torque was shit though which is why acceleration was poor. 

Top speed ended up somewhere around 50mph.

IMO priority should be 0-60 &lt;10 seconds followed by not looking like a moped or scooter. 80MPG is very reasonable for like a 150CC.",1422887501,0,1,

Ensuite la zone euro se réduit à ""au nord, Berlin"" pour flatter la germanophobie de certains lecteurs. Passons sur le fait que les finlandais sont au moins aussi remontés que les allemands sur cette question, et oublions aussi les lituaniens qui s'agaçent du traitement de faveur réservé à la Grèce alors qu'eux ont appliqué un programme d'austérité autrement plus draconien et s'en sont sortis.

First off, you have to do two risk awareness seminars. One theoretical, one practical. Without these, you're not allowed to take any tests. 

In order to be eligible for the practical test, you need to pass a theory test 65 questions + 5 test questions. You're not told which is which. In order to pass, you need to get 80% (52 correct answers). 

For the practical test we do one of two slow courses, with similar conditions as the other tests. However, you're not guaranteed a second attempt. After the slow course, you do the high speed maneuvering course, followed by emergency braking from 70 and 90km/h. This is then followed by some driving in traffic. The course testing is considered the easy part of the test, with the possible exception of Slow Course 1 (see below).
