The single Eurozone is unsustainable and doomed due to different economies and lower productivity of South-European countries, they can't directly compete with North-European countries while keeping the expensive euro. 

The big welfare governments are going bankrupt too: they don't balance their budgets, reduce national debts or decrease regulation to improve economic growth.

Europe is very diverse economically and culturally. It cannot be forced when the people don't want it and have the majority have voted against it several times. 

Integration is a natural process when people desire it and doesn't require a outdated centralized bureaucracy which has billions of euros unaccounted for.

Also fyi, what ended up happening is that Peter came to Europe. He invited two of his friends to stay at our rental house without asking, and when I found out, I told him it was OK for a couple days. Him and his friends ate all of our food, kept pushing me to buy them alcohol, wore my clothes without asking, and his friends slept in the living room until 4PM every day, making things really awkward for my mom and I who actually wanted to enjoy the house we had paid for and explore Berlin. 

In the end, they stayed for 5 days... I kept having to remind him that we were moving to a smaller flat soon and there just wouldn't be room for them there, but he avoided dealing with it. Eventually, when his friends mentioned they were staying 5 more days, I had to tell him I really couldn't host his friends any longer, and he flipped his shit.

1) Americans who say ""America is diverse, Europe is HOMOGENEOUS"", to lament that they can't fix anything not even remotely related to diversity, like public transport. 

2) Americans who are racist.

3) Americans who think their country is the most diverse nation in the world.

There is no contradiction here. These are all flawed positions to hold.

Don't you mean disproving?

&gt; Being British, one would hope you would have a better grasp of the English language. But OK, I can see I'll have to spell this out for you:

Being British has nothing to do with it. The only thing being British is to do with is the ""Charge of the light brigade"" which is still studied today as a military failure. We learn from our mistakes, clearly you dont.

&gt; Demographics in Ukraine are a complicated topic, because there is no actual difference between Russians and Ukrainians

The difference is which you prefer to identify as. It doesn't really matter about your genetics but  it matters what people prefer to be identified as.

&gt; This is the result of two and a half decades of ""Ukrainianization"" in a country that never had a distinct national identity.

Well that might have been true before the 21st century but it isn't now. And no amount of ""ukrainianization"" excuses can change that. The key factor here is the right to self determination.

&gt; The Ukrainian authorities attempted to craft a national identity that would distinguish Ukraine from Russia, to prevent Ukraine from being reabsorbed (culturally, if not politically) when the economic situation in Russia stabilized.

Are you going to provide any proof for this bullshit? The Ukrainians simply wanted to join the EU (hence the demonstrations specifically against the reneged EU association agreement, ""**euro**maiden"")

&gt; In order to do this, they promoted three things: Galician nationalism, anti-Russian sentiment, and a single national language 

Proof? There was not much anti Russian sentiment before the Crimea annexation and ""separatist"" uprising. But i know Kremlin propaganda has been spamming the ""Russophobe"" narrative.

&gt; The result of this was that fewer and fewer people self-reported Russian ""ethnicity"" (which, as I mentioned, is not actually distinct from Ukrainian ethnicity, hence the only way to establish it is by self-reporting).

It doesn't matter what you think, they prefer to identify as Ukrainian then they **ARE** ukrainian. It doesn't matter what you think, it matters what *they* think. Self determination is the key aspect here. Ukrainians wanted to be self determinate, Putin didn't want them to be. Hence the current situation.

&gt; It's like telling an American that people who live in New York are ethnic New Yorkers, while people who live in New Jersey are ethnic New Jerseans.

Its really not, Ukraine (kiev) has been a soverign nation in the past and it has its own distinct identity. The identy goes back about 1500 years. [Here you go :\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Kiev)",uk,,1,0,0,t5_2qh75,t3_2tcjpg,1,1424281481,False,LimitlessLTD,russia,False

Not a lot of support for the council and the councillors, but apparently most people who were supporting the party (like the people voting for them, not just members) acknowledge that it's due to bad preparation and the fact that the Green Party of England and Wales were extremely inexperienced - they probably won't be re-elected but everyone I've spoken to that's been canvassing has said people love Caroline even if they're pissed off at the council. The Green Party and Caroline Lucas still have strong support from people who were supporting them before.

As I said in my post - I think that choosing not to put GPEW stuff all over her promotional materials is probably to reach out to people who wouldn't vote Green at all, and some of them might be because they saw what happened with the council, but I think it's probably more to do with tapping into the idea of ""this is your current MP, she has done [x, y, z], she's great, look at her policies, don't you want to do more"" which works well for all parties, without putting anyone else off by shouting about the party. I'm in Northern Ireland but most publications I've seen in previous elections of incumbent candidates are personality-based, whereas non-incumbent candidates tend to be more party based.

The European Parliament election broadcasts are pretty good examples for Northern Ireland - the [DUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EorSOoeS50), [UUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr3h8rnwLtI) and [Sinn Féin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi9xDSkDZYs) were incumbent - SF were standing in Ireland as well, so their broadcast was covering several candidates so it was party-based but the DUP and UUP are both candidate-based. The [TUV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlkJHb407rs) weren't incumbent but had an MEP in the past, so they focussed on him as well. Meanwhile, [Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukCPjwrA60M), [GPNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDAvvZFpiTU) [SDLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN4BUcyyC7Q) and [NI21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R783Hr5SXQg) all have much more party-driven broadcasts (I couldn't find Northern Ireland-specific broadcasts for the other parties who contested which were Ukip and NI Conservatives). Some of that will be down to the fact that the council elections were at the same time here so they were counting on the PEB being for council rather than European, but it's still quite a big difference that is present in leaflets for single elections - incumbent candidates get personality focus while non-incumbents get party focus.

In examining the complex web of relations connecting events in West Africa, a disturbing, though hardly surprising, trend appears: as Western geopolitical and economic interest in the region increases, so too does instability grow.  While it may seem counter-intuitive, in fact this trend makes perfect sense.  While the US and Europe invoke ad nauseam the term “stability,” the reality is that chaos and instability are perfectly suited for their neocolonial objectives.

I originally posted a comment saying how I think about what would happened to a girl like this is captures by such men, but deleted it, as I didn't want this turning into a flame war. However, like I said, you went there.

I have seen videos of people executed by Ukrainians forces. Also, every time there's a POW exchange, all of the Ukrainian troops in rebels' hands are in decent shape, while many of the rebels can barely walk and show signs of severe beatings. Not to mention, a lot of the people that Ukrainians hand over are not even rebels, but kidnapped civilians. There's at least one documented case of a guy who was severely tortured, including a swastika carved into his chest. Human Rights Watch singled out the Aidar Battalion in particular as having perpetrated war crimes. Most of Aidar Battalion is composed of the most extremist and violent elements of the original Euro-Maidan protesters.

There are plenty of videos where the rebels humiliate captured Ukrainian troops, parade them around and use them as labor to rebuild what was destroyed or damage by Ukrainian shelling and all those things are fucked up too, but generally, I am not aware of cases of _severe_ mistreatment.

Edit: I am not saying that there aren't any very bad people among the rebels too. I've seen some young girls in Ukraine's volunteer battalions as well and I fear for their fate too. There's a case of a woman whom the rebels accused to helping Ukrainian troops. She was captured, humiliated and made to stand at an intersection in Donetsk holding a sign saying ""I helped kill your children"", etc, getting hit a number of times by other women. It's messed up, but I am glad that this is all that happened to her.

LSD is an ergoline if I'm not mistaken, and there is an over the counter* migraine medicine available in a few countries in Europe which contains a compound (95% certain it is an ergoline as well) that can be used as a precursor in the synthesis of LSD-25. 

There is a definite connection between migraines and serotonergic drugs, but the answer to why that is, is beyond my knowledge. To anyone that suffers from chronic migraines or cluster headaches: look into procuring that OTC* drug from Europe. It may offer some relief in my, granted inexpert, opinion. Do some research firstly of course, but with that said, I think it's worth a shot if it means possibly ridding yourself of such a terrible affliction.

&gt;

&gt;___Taito Legends 2___ is the sequel to *[Taito Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito_Legends)* and is a follow-up collection of 39 (or 43, see below) [Taito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito_Corporation) [arcade games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game) for the [PlayStation 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2), [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console\)) and [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). As the former collection, it has been derived from the [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) exclusive *[Taito Memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito_Memories)* series.

&gt;In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), published by [Empire Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Interactive), all three versions were released in March 2006. In the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), published by [Destineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destineer), it was released for the PlayStation 2 on May 16, 2007 and for PC on July 28, 2007, with the Xbox version never being released in North America. However, the European [PAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL)-based Xbox version works on the North American [NTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC)-based Xbox systems, without any modifications [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*].

&gt;Controversially, eight of the 43 games - *[Balloon Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_Bomber)*, *[Bubble Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Symphony)*, *[Cadash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadash)*, *[RayForce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RayForce)*, *[RayStorm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RayStorm)*, *[G-Darius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Darius)*, *[Pop'n Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop%27n_Pop)*, and *[Syvalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syvalion)* - were split across the platforms due to porting issues,  requiring players to buy more than one version to get every game available.

(2)  The American economy is really strong right now.  In fact, EVERYONE'S currency is going down... or should I say, returning to normal. As the American economy continues to get stronger and recover from the recession all currencies of the world will begin to be priced where they ought to be.  If you look at history the Canadian dollar hit 90 cents American during the American recession, but during the booming 90s the Canadian dollar dropped as low as 63 cents American.  When the American economy crashed again it went back up and continued to do so until it eventually went over the US dollar.

(3)  We're de-valuing our currency on purpose.  A de-valued currency allows for more exports to more dominant currencies, mainly the US Dollar and the EU Dollar.  That is exceptionally good for our manufacturing industry and will give it a huge boom.  But also if our currency is 20% cheaper it also means that our oil is also 20% cheaper than American oil.

I'll bite. 

While you are right about the generic historical point, you are wrong in comparing the Weimer Rebulic to present day Russia. The German republic was angered by obscene reparations payments, hyperinflation, the Great Depression, and an occupying army in their industrial heartland. 

On the contrary, the Russian people have been supported by the West for the last two decades in nurturing its democracy and capitalism. They have not been asked to pay reparations for the occupation and destruction of eastern europe's economy for 50 years. There is no Great Depression - perhaps a Great Recession - and there is no occupying army in Moscow.  Inflation is on the rise, but it is not *hyper*inflation - and Russia chose to inflate its currency by invading another country. 

Even there, no sanctions were applied to Russia even though it invaded and continues to occupy 3 or 4 other countries. And the sanctions imposed? They are pretty weak.

Russia was not ""humiliated"" at any point - Ukraine was merely seeking to westernize its democracy. Every country on Russia's border is going to do that at some point. Is Russia entitled to invade all of them? 

But there are some parallels to Germany. In the 1930s, Hitler did exactly what Putin is doing - invaded a country on the pretext of ""helping"" its ethnic people. Then, as now, Europe largely sat idly by.  Hitler was an autocrat, and so is Putin. Hitler created a fascist Germany, and now Russia is clearly in the throws of fascism. Hitler invaded after his country held the Olympics - so did Putin. Hitler created a media largely detached from reality - so has Russia. 

But if you think about it, Russia should be humiliated though not for the reasons you think.  It threw away decades of peaceful growth for a dirt pile and to distract themselves from the horrifically corrupt system that is developing right in front of their eyes.

Bullshit myth is bullshit.

&gt;When a complete protein can be crammed in a chocolate bar, you probably won't go back to meat.

Yes, I will. Meat is a better way to get protein.

&gt;It's too risky and has as many downsides as ups.

Again, bullshit myth is bullshit.

Meat is only bad for you in extreme amounts. Just like any food. The studies which are used to 'prove' that meat is bad for you are all american-centric and are all based on the consumption of a ridiculously high meat intake which very few people, even in the US, commit to.

The Icelandics, Germans, French and Italians eat plenty of red, white and game meats as well as fish, and they have some of the best (if not the best) life expectancy rates and health rates in the western world.

There are areas of Italy and Iceland where the life expectancy is up in the mid to high 90's for both men and women, who all swear by eating meat, dairy and fish products as part of their diets.

And dont even get me started on people like the African tribes in West Africa like the Maasai people, who eat so much meat and fat that their intake is several times that of Europeans and even americans.

You would have thought that they would have been getting all the nasty things associated with high meat intake, like cancer and heart disease etc etc?

No, they have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, levels of those diseases *in the world*. 

This just goes to show that it is not *meat* that is to blame, it is the additives and other bullshit that is pumped non-stop into US meat and dairy products that causes the health implications.

As for the Canada vs. US, yeah, I've heard it's faster through the states. I think similar distance, but speed limits are higher (Ontario is all 80 km/h up north if I remember right). I did the Canada route because I was hauling all my possessions in a U-Haul. It would have been a pain to deal with border guards, and would have probably negated any time savings because I'd probably be stuck at the border for awhile.

I've got a 2013 Skyactiv Mazda 3 and it's a great little travelling companion. I made the drive down to Arizona last year and it was great. Did the Grand Canyon on the way down and yeah, it's worth it. Even though you know what to expect, it doesn't disappoint and is as awe inspiring as everyone says it is.

My best advice for a young fella (lol, I'm only late-20s, so not like I'm that old) is to find a job where you get to travel. It gets old really fast, when you're on the road all the time, but if you work everything out you can feed all your hotel loyalty into Aeroplan, only fly with Air Canada, and get an Aeroplan credit card. If your company lets you pay for things yourself and then get reimbursed for travel, feed everything through that card. Though I wasnt *making* that much, I was pushing $75,000/year through that card just with work expenses.

Do that and you can fund all your own vacations with points. 90,000 Aeroplan miles is good for round trip to Europe in Business Class :) When I left my travel-job I had 250,000 Aeroplan miles that I've only now just exhausted, as I go back and forth to Ontario a few times a year since moving out west.",,,1,0,0,t5_2qh0u,t3_2ubcjn,1,1424278875,False,lastmessiah,pics,False

In Western culture those rights are said to be from a Creator, God. Men created the very concept of rights (but gave credit to God) and believed in the inherent dignity of humans that they made it a universal value, not just men, not just Europeans, *everyone*.

Women, as a group, are incapable of performing the duties necessary for the formation and sustenance of civilization. It's 'creator' and 'builder' males that construct institutions and guard them (with their lives) against self-destructive and 'watch the world burn' males. 

In non-Western cultures there doesn't exist this preoccupation with ""rights."" Western ""rights"" are a fiction. A man-made fiction attributed to God. Here is a good quote by Robert Heinlein from Starship Troopers:

&gt;Ah, yes, the 'unalienable rights.' Each year someone quotes that magnificent poetry. Life? What 'right' to life has a man who is drowning in the Pacific? The ocean will not hearken to his cries. What 'right' to life has a man who must die if he is to save his children? If he chooses to save his own life, does he do so as a matter of 'right'? If two men are starving and cannibalism is the only alternative to death, which man's right is 'unalienable'? And is it 'right'? 
&gt;As to liberty, the heroes who signed that great document pledged themselves to buy liberty with their lives. Liberty is always unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly with the blood of patriots or it is always vanquished. Of all the so-called 'natural human rights' that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is never free of cost.

Civilization is the result of an abundance of male strength and the desire for a system of patriarchy--which is male investment in the future. It is a group of men floating in the Pacific who decide not to tread water until they drown, but to work together to gather flotsam and jetsam and fashion a raft, and later add an oar, and then a sail, and pick up other men and women who are just treading water and make them into a crew.

Enough time has gone by that people have forgotten what it's like to exist outside of civilization. We have disaster and ""collapse porn"" and ""preppers"" who try to learn how to survive if institutions rapidly collapse. Our once humble raft is now a gargantuan aircraft carrier and the bridge has been given over to women and men who think like women. They have slowly but surely transformed the aircraft carrier of Western Civ into a prison barge of high taxation and regulation, while other civilizations (Islam, China, Russia) who don't even acknowledge the Western ideas of human rights are steadily building their rafts into aircraft carriers.

Things are going badly for us. Western Civilization is being transformed for the worse. Europe especially is being inundated with Muslim immigrants that care nothing for Western values or philosophy. They are easily radicalized and become the 'watch the world burn' males that can tear down civilization. At the same time Europe is so emasculated that they are afraid to see reality for what it is, choosing instead the feminine value of 'no hate speech' and 'make everyone feel welcome', but they sow the seeds of their own destruction.

If men are too stupid or too emasculated to take control back, Western Civ will simply go away, like the Roman Empire. Political ties will dissolve, the machine will grind to a halt, things that break will go unfixed, and waves of barbarians will reclaim territory, or it will be absorbed by civilizations that are still sane. In a state of nature, survival of the fittest is the gold standard for what the future looks like.

&gt;

&gt;The __Azov Battalion__ ([Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language): Батальйон «Азов») is an all-volunteer far-right paramilitary detachment of the Ukraine government,   which reports to the [Ministry of Internal Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Ukraine\)) and is a member of the [National Guard of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_Ukraine).   The battalion is based in [Mariupol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariupol) in the [Azov Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Sea) coastal region.  The BBC's [Fergal Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergal_Keane) has called the unit ""a far-right Ukrainian militia"".  It is one of several volunteer battalions funded in part by Ukraine oligarch [Ihor Kolomoyskyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihor_Kolomoyskyi). 

&gt;The battalion's commander is Andriy Biletsky ([Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language): Андрій Білецький), who was awarded by Ukrainian president [Petro Poroshenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_Poroshenko) with a military decoration, ""[Order For Courage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_For_Courage)"", and promoted to [lieutenant colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel) of police.  In the beginning, Azov was the Ministry of Internal Affairs special police company, led by Volodymyr Shpara ([Ukrainian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_language): Володимир Шпара), the leader of the [Vasylkiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasylkiv)'s [Patriot of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_of_Ukraine) and [Right Sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Sector) organizations in the [Kiev region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Oblast).    Biletsky stayed out of the public spotlight working on expanding Azov to battalion size. In summer 2014 he took the command of the unit in his own hands; Shpara remained in the battalion as the commander of the 1st Company.

&gt;Biletsky is also head of two neo-Nazi political groups, [Patriot of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_of_Ukraine) and [Social-National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social-National_Assembly). 

&gt;The battalion is also referred to as the ""Men in Black"", and is one of dozens of paramilitary forces that operate in Ukraine.  The Azov Battalion was formed and armed by Ukraine’s interior ministry.{{}} A ministerial adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, [was asked] if the battalion had any neo-Nazi links through the Social National Assembly. ‘The Social National Assembly is not a neo-Nazi organisation,’ he said. ‘It is a party of Ukrainian patriots…’.    More than half are Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians.  Its polished English-language social media pages and far-right ideology have attracted fighters from other locations in Europe.

'Bitter Lake' is not as misleading as Curtis previous documentary 'The Power of Nightmares', a documentary that basically claimed that Al-Qaida was a myth, a propaganda nightmare invented by American neoconservatives.But even if Bitter Lake is more accurate than PoN, it is still a disingenuous piece of disinformation, and many claims in the movie are untrue or inaccurate generalizations.


One of Bitter Lakes central claims is that contemporary American and European politicians simplify the world into good and evil much more than they used to. But this is not true: simplifications and a narrative of good and evil were much more common in the past than they are today.

In the past politicians simplified more, largely because both politicians and the public were much less educated and there was much less information available. In addition, they were much more willing to use the division of good and evil. Consider these pairs of good and evil, depending on your perspective:

* Workers or Capitalists

* Communists or Fascists

* Atheists or Christians

* Americans or British/Spaniards/Japanese/Germans/Soviets/Russians

* etc, etc...

Such good or evil divisions were used all the time.

In contrast, Western politicians today bend over backwards NOT to simplify and divide into good and evil. Case in point is the treatment of Islamism/Islam. No matter how clearly the Islamists themselves keep reiterating that they are indeed killing and conquering because they truly believe Islam is the only right system of belief and the beliefs of all others are sinful, Western politicians say over and over that Islamist terrorism has ""nothing to do with Islam"". They keep making this claim because they do not want to be accused of creating simple divisions of good and evil.


Many other things in Bitter Lake are are wrong, misleading or propagandistic, but I will settle for this central point for now.


If you haven't seen it you will not know that Bitter Lake appears to be inspired by a documentary called 'House of Saud' made by PBS Frontline in 2005. The structure of the story is very similar and many clips are the same. The Frontline documentary is much more informative and accurate.

Once Mussolini was deposed, Nazi troops entered Italy to ensure it remained under Axis control. Initially, many Italians had supported Mussolini in the 1920s-30s, as he promised to bring Italy back to the glory days of the Roman Empire and sought to bring order to a country where a large chunk of the population was illiterate and dirt-poor. A country that had been largely divided and under foreign domination since the fall of Rome until the shaky unification of the peninsula in 1861. A country where every province and even town had its own language and culture, a country where violence was ubiquitous, land barons dominated and exploited the rural landscape, and poor farmers and craftsman emigrated in droves to countries such as the United States. A country where the people had never really been unified, where *campanilismo* and devotion to family trumped the obligation to the nation as a whole. A country that had experienced a large upsurge in political anarchists and socialists among the working class in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

 So, I imagine, Mussolini and his fascist ideology seemed like a lesser evil to many Italians. In the wake of the spread of Marxist and socialist philosophy, Italy saw a large communist movement among the working class that scared many of the middle class that would support fascism. Years later, during the Cold War, Italy had the largest communist party in Western Europe. So, in essence, the support for Mussolini and fascism was never even close to unanimous. After Mussolini allied with Nazi Germany and began increasingly subservient to Nazi interests as opposed to Italian interests (i.e., sending poorly equipped Italian troops to fight in Nazi-led battles, enacting Nazi racial laws despite the lack of widespread anti-Semitism in Italy and despite the obvious Nordicism of Nazi racial laws, etc.), as the war dragged on, and as Nazi Germans and Italian fascists committed atrocities on Italian soil, the Italian Resistance movement gained enough support that Italy experienced a ""civil war"" between fascists and the largely communist partisans. During the Nazi German occupation of Italy, Nazis would slaughter thousands of Italian civilians in reprisal for Italians partisan attacks. In many cases, such as in the Alps where partisans would utilize guerrillas tactics on Nazi troops, the civilians massacred by Nazis would be mostly women, children, the elderly, and the clergy, as most of the able-bodied men in the villages would take to the hills to fight as partisans against the Nazis and Italian fascists. This would occur in urban environments as well, such as Rome. The slaughter of civilians, rather than stopping the resistance, only built support for the resistance movement. Furthermore, many of the Italian troops that had been scripted to fight for Fascist Italy were taken prisoner as traitors and sent to camps by the Nazis after Mussolini was killed and Italy signed an armistice with the Allied forces. So, basically, it's a vast overgeneralization to say that Italy was an ""ally"" of Nazi Germany at this time. Politically, Italy had been an uneasy ally, but the alliance quickly became an occupation by the end of the war.

I think the difference between a coup and a revolution is popular support. It would be naive to suggest that there was no CIA (or FSB) involvement. That said the Euromaidan movement had a plurality of public support. 

There were very large and sustained public protests and the protesters had legitimate complaints about government corruption, violations of human rights (particularly the heavy-handed response to the protests) and the economic situation of Ukraine. To describe a movement seeking the restoration of the 2004 constitution a ""CIA coup"" is major misrepresentation of the facts.

Russia doesn't own the Ukraine or its people. Ukraine, as an independent country, should be free to negotiate with either Russia or the EU. Russia losing influence in Ukraine doesn't legally or morally justify the annexation of Crimea. Russia's continued actions in Ukraine are a blatant violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandums.

And here is a google translation from French to English:

*""Brought to taste matches, spit rice and to be frightened of his own image in a mirror, the main actor in this sketch dedicated to authentic told me in crying shame.
The Toulambi could only follow the letter directing the Papuan guides parties to meet them dictated to them according to their own vision of the Stone Age.
Having hidden their metal tools and removed their belts plastic beads and pieces of European clothes they were wearing, they have complied with the orders given in the name of the nurse who had previously spread the news of their discovery.
Who lives in four days walk from the nearest clinic in a region of endemic malaria, a little quinine is well worth a good joke.""*

That made Putin extremely mad, and he took Crimea back, and then started disestablishing the country from the east.   History books will show this conflict for what it really is.

Today was my first run since July when I ended up with a complicated foot/back injury that has taken months to figure out. At the start of December my physiotherapist had given me the green light to start up with intervals of 5 mins walking, 1 min running but today was the first time I actually made myself go do it and IT FELT SO GOOD. I was terribly out of breath of course and my legs are so sore already but I can't even explain how happy I am that I'm going to get back into running. It's such a happy thing for me.




I'm not an expert nor a beginner, I'm somewhere in the middle. I was very active and played a lot of sports growing up so running was always second nature to me. I didn't often just go for a run as my sports kept me in shape (those were the days) until an injury at the end of high school sidelined me for eight months and ruined all my athletic scholarship opportunities (still bitter). After that it was hard to get motivated to get back in shape even though I was still playing some sports. Cleverly, I might add, as I figured out ways to play my sports with the least amount of running possible so I was never REALLY in shape, I just gave the appearance of being so. Then I stopped playing those sports and just kind of did...nothing, for a couple of years.


How I got back into running? My eldest brother has been running half and full marathons for the last five years or so. He has moved out of province but always travels home to run in my city's annual half/full marathon so I go and cheer him on and throw granola bars and water bottles at him. About a year and a half ago he was in my local race and was having wicked bad leg cramps with about 7 kms left to go (honestly can't remember if it was the half or full that year). He stopped to drink some water and my sister and I helped massage his calves for a minute. In that minute, he lost his pace bunny, which seemed like it was the only thing still keeping him going. I had never felt such empathy for my brother and all I wanted was to run that last 7km with him. After the race (he finished like a champ, swinging his cramped leg out for his last km) I told him that if he ever wanted a running buddy I would be willing to run with him. He acknowledged my comment but didn't really say yes or no. Six months later when registration for our local race opened up I get a call from him. ""So, did you sign up?"" ""Uh, for what?"" ""The half marathon, of course."" And that was it, I started training for it! Unfortunately about a month before the race I had my most recent injury, the weird foot/back/nerve thing that took my doctors and foot specialist and physiotherapist three months to figure out, so I wasn't able to run the half. My brother coincidentally sprained his ankle the weekend before the race so wasn't able to drive the six hours to get here and obviously wouldn't have had much fun running solo and injured anyway so we didn't get to run the half together last year. I ended up walking the half as a last minute decision so I'm happy to say I DID IT but I ended up doing a bit more damage to my foot than was advisable - whoopsies. Five months later, it's fine! So far. And I'm really stoked to start training for the half again this year.


Well, that was basically the story of the last decade of my life. I rambled a bit but seriously, one measly run today and I'm feeling so freaking excited about getting back into this! I'm not sure how things will go over the next thirty days so I can't quite commit to running any time trials, but if all goes well I'll for sure be in. :)




Dream race would have to be a destination race. One of my running instructors told pretty awesome stories about running marathons in Europe where the stations have wine and beer instead of water. Sounds ridiculous but so fun hahhahaha. I also think a triathlon would be pretty badass. We have a mini triathlon here each spring so depending on how my running is going, I might tri for that. See what I did there?

Yes suiciding was a dick move, I get that, especially when you were already on such low health. But I feel like you don't really understand the whole story here.

This was on a day when I was in the middle of a very stressful time irl, so I thought playing some nice relaxing minecraft would help. I now realize that probably wasn't a wise decision.

The weather was quite poor outside at the time, and this isn't the first time I have gotten a poor connection because of weather. I thought when joining the game that poor might mean I would get 130ms or so. not 700ms at the best of points.

I was already disappointed when I found out that the best pve wasn't working (the main reason I had joined, ffa best pve best gamemode). I felt a bit better though after getting a decent cave and coming out with a fast horse, pow 3, and 5 gapples, and still iron man. I had to discard the horse bc I kept teleporting around the map due to the lag combining with the glitchiness of horses. So I figured, I probably won't win, but surely all this loot can at least get me one kill.

So what's the first player I find? a player in full diamond with pots and a horse.

I figured I could take you because I had lots of health and you had 3 hearts. however, as I mentioned earlier, I was getting 700ms at the best of times, which I should never be getting to an AS server, let alone an EU server. fighting horses at close range is hard enough without lag, with insane lag it is impossible.

So, purely out of anger about this game (as well as irl issues, as I said this was intended to be, ironically enough, a game to relax me), I suicided because I didn't feel you had really done anything to earn my gear at that time.

I understand that you would be upset about that. In your position so would I, especially not knowing the circumstances. I have said this before, but I have a temper, and sometimes (as in this case), it clouds my judgement and causes me to make poor decisions.

So I am sorry about suiciding.

I just wanted to post this because after I died you told me to fuck off, which clearly shows you were quite upset by my actions, and I understand if you don't entirely forgive me, but I just thought saying sorry and explaining why I did it might help to improve your opinion of me. I don't want any hard feelings between us. So I hope you can forgive me. Mistakes happen, I'm human.

I went traveling for a year, working and traveling in Europe.  I found that a big part if what was holding me back was expectations from those around me.  I was always single and was now expected to always be single.  I was living up to their expectations.  It's hard for me to explain, but the people around you really shape who you are.  It's like you develop a subconscious trap that keeps you within the boundaries of your past and you conform to the way others see you.

Once I got into a completely new environment and nobody knew my past, I was able to start with a clean slate.  I found that when people didn't know that I had always been single, they treated me differently, as if they expected me to get girls rather than how those who knew me treated me like I wasn't even a candidate anymore.  This eventually rubbed off on me, changed my own way of thinking, gave me a new found confidence that I had never felt,  and freed me to actually put myself in the game so to speak.  I think a lot of it is subconscious self-sabotage.

I know that what I did isn't necessarily an option for everyone, but hopefully you will find what I learned helpful in some way.  There is hope, don't give up.  Maybe all you need is a change of scenery for a while.

Edit:  Now that I'm more awake, I can wrap up what I was trying to say a little better.  Basically, I think those in your social circle (men and women both) no longer view you as a sexual being.  That's why things changed when I completely displaced myself.  Shortly after I came home, a woman who I had been friends with for 10 years kissed me.  Knowing that I had dated and been with women on my trip completely changed the way she and everyone else viewed me.  Everything changed after that.  

I hope this all makes sense.  Keep your head up and stay positive.   If you have the opportunity to move away for a while, I say go for it.  But you would be best to go alone like I did, so that you have the opportunity to reinvent yourself without being held back by friends or family.",,,3,0,0,t5_2ranw,t3_2ud76b,3,1424275449,1422807073,Wickedmoose,offmychest,False

 [**Accelerationism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerationism): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [political philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy) influenced by the thought of [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), __accelerationism__ is the belief that in order to generate radical change, the prevailing system of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) should be expanded and its growth accelerated so that its self-destructive tendencies can be brought to their conclusion.   A variety of philosophers have expressed apparently accelerationist attitudes, including Marx himself in his 1848 speech ""On the Question of Free Trade"":

&gt;&gt;But, in general, the protective system of our day is conservative, while the free trade system is destructive. It breaks up old nationalities and pushes the antagonism of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the extreme point. In a word, the free trade system hastens the social revolution. It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade. 

&gt;In a similar vein, [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) argued that ""the leveling process of European man is the great process which should not be checked: one should even accelerate it..."",  a statement often simplified, following the Marxian philosophers [Deleuze and Guattari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleuze_and_Guattari), to a command to ""accelerate the process"".  Prominent contemporary accelerationists include [Nick Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land) and his associated Cybernetic Culture Research Unit.

Acho que o pirilau tem razão. 

Possivelmente uma abordagem com maior impacto seria substituir as referências a ""ciência"" e ""fundamento cientifico"" por aquilo que a ciência e o método cientifico fazem: demonstrar que as coisas funcionam.

Assim a frase ler-se-ia da seguinte forma:

* ""o que eu discuto é se a homeopatia tem ~~fundamento científico~~ provas de que realmente funciona ou não. E não tem, a homeopatia não tem ~~fundamento científico~~ provas de que realmente funciona""

Everyone here seems to have covered this but if you aren't already getting some kind of therapy I highly recommend it, it's a great way to ground yourself and gain perspective you can't otherwise find.  Medication is also always an option but I personally don't recommend it, I've never met a person who medicates for a mental issue and seems happy with the results, and I've been through a few myself.
     
The other thing I highly recommend is that you try to meet new people, especially outside you're friend group.  It's difficult to do but if the people you know don't seem to like you I find the best thing to do is look elsewhere.  Posting to subreddits, forms, and other social network sights is a good way to find people who share your interests, talk to them, but get out as well, you're in college in Europe, a perfect environment to meet new people.  Stay after class, go to school events, volunteer for a club, whatever it takes.

The third thing is the most important.  You have to build your own inner fortitude, to be who you want to be, to do what you want to do, and know that that is all that matters.  If you don't want to be medicated or see a therapist for the rest of your life you need to prepare to be self-sufficient.  These kinds of problems never go away, but it's totally possible to live happily despite them. As you build yourself up you'll find that loneliness doesn't bother you nearly as much, you'll feel less anxiety and be more confident with people.  Believe that you can meet new friends.

That was true a couple of years ago. Now, only 1% of Greek debt is held by foreign banks. Hence the firm words of Merkel. Who did lend to Greece? Eurozone countries (60%), IMF (10%), ECB (6%). (source: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31075767 )
 
&gt; There would be some short term pain for Greece as it would need to abandon the Euro and essentially reset its entire financial system, but the blow to Greece could potentially be significantly softened if the BRICS (primarily Russia and China) extend credit to Greece as a self-interested ""fuck you"" to the EU and US. Europe, on the other hand, would be massively fucked.

Russia is not going to spend precious reserves on Greece (perhaps they'll give them oil &amp; gas). Note, Putin is pressuring Russian companies to exchange their dollars and euros for rubles, that's how dire the situation is. And China, why would China agonize the EU?

notable differences:

 - the US: catcalling evidently varies a lot by location but in my hometown i couldn't avoid it in most areas. less likely to attract attention in pants, but it happened on a daily basis regardless. i was living in a bad neighborhood, moved to a much nicer one in hopes of getting it less often, but it happened just as much. it was very threatening at times and i *definitely* felt it was about power. it felt very personal and very much like a ""hey bitch, fuck you!"" kind of message. most often shouts or loud honks from a passing car, or aggressive comments from passerbys. it only happened if i was alone or with another woman (though rarely with another woman). 
 - Mexico/Central America: definitely worse in CA than mexico, though they were both bad in terms of frequency. daily, multiple times a day in both. ranged from the complimentary to incredibly lewd. i also didn't feel as threatened as i did when i got catcalled in the US, it seemed less about power and more about flirtation. often done subtly but varied quite a bit. definitely got it more in pants than a dress, oddly. would happen even when i was with men. i pretty much always looked like crap here, except for in mexico city where i put some effort in. generally i was sweaty and wearing dirty clothes, frequently not showered for days (didn't always  have running water). 
 - Istanbul: i'd hesitate to call the attention i got here catcalling, exactly. men would always engage in a conversation with me, ask me questions. they had some horribly cheesy pickup lines, obviously an attempt to make you laugh. i never felt threatened here, but it got really old really quick because you had the same conversation 90897 times a day. the dudes are bored, they have nothing to do other than try to sell you something or get a date, or hopefully both. i went out of my way to look bad here and it made little to no difference. men wouldn't try to talk to me at all if i was with another man. 
 - Paris: relatively minimal, mostly quiet offhand comments, nothing serious. i always tried to look nice here, nice clothes, jewelry, makeup. i was always on my own here. got a lot more fuck-me-eyes than anything. 
 - China/Hong Kong/Thailand: all instances of catcalling have happened when i was at least in my second trimester. much less frequent than in the US/Europe/Latin America, a handful of incidents. definitely got the most in HK, where i was obviously pregnant, and mostly from non-Chinese men. women gave me outright compliments far more often than i got attention from men. the worst happened in beijing where an old man tried to kiss me on the street and then followed me to a quickstore where he insisted he trade money with me. weird all around. similar but less personal feeling than what i got in the US. i was pretty much always on my own here. 

the *only* place i have ever been where i was alone and never got catcalled was budapest. well that's not exactly true, i got accosted by a group of italians in a club, they grabbed me as soon as i walked in, surrounded me and started petting my hair and touching me all over my body. i'm sure they were on something. i was in a big group thankfully, so i didn't feel too scared, just pushed them off of me and got on with my night. definitely weird but not catcalling i guess. edit: i definitely did not look nice this night, jeans, t-shirt, ponytail, no makeup, i hadn't planned on going out.

You CANNOT commute from a place like this to anything close to a vibrant city with a variety of economic options. You can easily be 4+ hours from anything close to a real ""city"". Because Canada's economic support of rural areas is not as robust as most European countries there is a larger economic disparity between these rural areas and urban areas. There are also very few small ""industry towns"" where a company dominates the small town's economy and gives employment to the masses (they are too far away to be a useful factory location). Generally natural resources and tourism dominate the economics in these area's, so if you can't find a job in those industries you are shit out of luck. And remember that most of the tourism jobs (especially those outside of hotels) will be seasonal. My advice, if you want an adventure move to a real city with a job offer in hand then do on the ground research. Or get really really rich.

False,co7ocsu,t3_2udpnx,Wear the grudge like a clown,0,1422796773,t1_co7ocsu,"This song is about making the choice between stasis and transcendence. Amongst other allusions, the base of this song lies in Kabbalah, Astronomy, Numerology, and Alchemy; these four schools of thought are closely linked anyway, are based on one another, and often employ different methods to describe the same thing. Ok, lets go...

*Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity;*

Here the story is set up. ""the Grudge"", in this sense is an anchor to the current paradigm. The ""Crown"", or Ketter, is the highest Sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is a kind of meeting point between this reality and the godform from which all things emanate. The goal of any Kabbalistic magician is to follow the emanations back up the path from 10 (Malkuth - The Kingdom), through to 1 (Ketter - The Crown), through which one can ascend to a higher plane, where the process starts once more in the macroskopos. The *crown of negativity* is a Crown that, instead of drawing you up through the spheres, drags you down.

*Calculate what we will, or will not tolerate*

Like some vast gravity well, when holding on to a *Grudge*, actions, notions, and emotions tend to be shaped by, often violently, ones commitment to it.

*Desperate to control all and everything.*

Because a *Grudge* is not a product of the true self, the outer self will begin to reshape your reality in order to fit it in to your story.

*Unable to forgive, the scarlet letterman*

This is a reference to Nathaniel Hawthorne's *The Scarlet Letter*, (**SPOILER**) in which a girl who has been unfaithful to her husband must endure the shame of wearing a scarlet ""A"" upon her chest, and is chastised by the town because of it. The good and well loved priest in the town becomes ill, and the doctor (who is the girl's husband in disguise) tends to him, realizes it's a psychological illness, discovers that the priest, too, has a scarlet ""A"" marked upon his chest, and then shit gets real. Everyone in the story ends up dying horribly or living alone and miserable, except for the out-of-wedlock daughter, who seemed to be cool with everything going on, and she marries a European aristocrat. The end.

The moral of the story is if you become consumed by shame, and fear, and a **Grudge**, your life will become dick.

*Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down*

In Freemasonry, there is a tradition to lay a cornerstone for every building constructed. Physically, this corner stone, which bears the name of the Patron's who constructed it, defines quality of construction for the rest of the building. If the cornerstone isn't perfectly straight, the walls won't be angled correct, the structure won't be sound, and the Mason will be shamed. Metaphysically, however, the cornerstone refers to both the spiritual aspect of Masonry, and the *cornerstone of the world*, which are in a way linked.

*Justify denials and grip them to the lonesome end*

Back to a *Grudge* will shape the world around you, also a reference to the woman with the Scarlet Letter (which, I didn't mention before, is likely a reference to the Scarlet Woman, Babalon, considering Hawthornes obsession with the occult. More on that later, maybe)

*Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down*

Like the physical building, a Mason must have his spiritual cornerstone, and must perfect it before building his inner temple. Every aspect of his cornerstone must be perfect in order to build the perfect temple. Later in Masonry, one learns that while an important task in reflection, *perfection* belongs to god, and god alone, and one can too easily spend their lifetime trying to perfect their own cornerstone, an impossible task, thus neglecting to build their inner temple. 

*Terrified of being wrong, ultimatum prison cell*

Holding on to a **Grudge** is a slippery slope of attachment. Once it is established, as mentioned earlier, you must shape your reality to justify it. If you've taken it too far, it becomes a choice between continuing to hold on the the Grudge, or to let go and face the music.

*Saturn ascends, choose One, or Ten, Hang on or be humbled again*

Here it starts getting a little more... Mystical. Saturn Ascending is the astrological term for the time it takes for Saturn make a full rotation around the Zodiac and sit where it was in the night sky at the time of your birth. This happens to take roughly 10,000 days. According to wizards in robes adorned with silver stars and moons, this is a time where Saturn (the second Sephirot, Binah - Understanding), the Judge, will put you face to face with all your bullshit. 

This gives you the chance to either work through it and move through to the next stage (1 - Keter - The Crown), or to hold on to it and sink back down (10 - Malkut - The Kingdom). This process is almost always difficult, painful, and entirely humbling.

*Clutch it like a corner stone, otherwise it all comes down*

The *cornerstone of the earth* in the Abrahamic religions, is the point in the earth (Malkut - The Kingdom), from which the emanations of god were received. It is located beneath the Dome of the Rock, on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and is the holiest location of the Jews. Clutching the cornerstone, becoming too attached to the physicality of the stone, without considering it's metaphysical significance, is akin to praising the sculpture while ignoring the sculptor. The point of the cornerstone is not that it is a rock here on earth, but that it serves, or once serves, as a direct conduit to god.

*Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end*

You have the choice, keep telling yourself that same old story, and suffer the consequences of that, or don't.

*Saturn ascends, comes round again*

Now is the time to choose

*Saturn ascends, the one, the time. Ignorant to the damage done*

Facing Saturn will make you choose one of two options. Choose One, ascend, and let go and give up on all the bullshit stories you've told yourself to justify your shadow; Choose Ten, and be safe and comfortable in the personal hell your are building for yourself. Saturn is neutral. Saturn doesn't care if you ascend or descend, he only gives you the opportunity to do one.

*Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control. Unable to forgive, And we're sinking deeper*

If you are putting your Grudge above your Self, wearing it like a crown, then you will be unable to ascend up to the real *Crown*, Keter. You don't know what will happen to you once you let go of all your stories, it's a complete unknown, and if you let fear of the unknown control you, because of a desperation to control your life, then you will sink back down to the Kingdom.

*Defining. Confining. Controlling. And we're sinking deeper.*

The *Grudge*s, these anchors you've built for yourself are what you use to define yourself. ""I have pop music"", ""pink shirts are for faggets"", ""I'm not good enough for her"", ""skiing is not my thing"", ""meditating every day will make me a better person""; all these things are the stories you've told to define who you are, what makes you *you*. Instead of elevating you, these *Grudge*s restrict and dictate your existence. Hold on to them, and watch yourself sinking into the Kingdom once more.

*Saturn comes back around to show you everything*

Whether you like it or not, when Saturn ascends, you will be face to face with all your bullshit (for the older crowd, can you remember what was going on in your life from 27-30? Big changes is my guess) and be forced to make a decision.

*let's you choose what you will, and will not see and then*

Sometimes, we ~~can not~~ choose to not see the monsters that stare us in our faces.

*Drags you down like a stone, or lift's you up and then spits you out like a child, light and innocent*

Saturn, the Judge, once you have made your choices, will either take you down, and bring you up. It's your choice. Choose wisely. If you choose the latter, you will be reborn again, (en)lightened, and free from the profane.

*Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child, or drags you down like a stone, to consume you 'til you choose to*

The barriers that Saturn presents when he ascends once more will take up significant time, energy, and willpower to see through to the end. No one said this will be easy.

*let this go...*

You seem to be responding to a point I didn’t make (specifically). You are correct that in the US, the math does not work out for most people—but even in the US, it really depends on what direction you want to take your career in. Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Medicine, etc are all fields where not having a degree means you’re pretty much locked out of the job market. No amount of self-study will help with that.  
 
It’s different for soft skills and IT-related jobs, yes, but a lot of bigger companies still hire people fresh out of college/university, and these do get paid well. 
 
Also, I want to reiterate the point that I was walking about Austria and similar countries. We are lucky that education here is free _and_ that companies, by law, are required to pay people with degrees a higher wage. The downside is that someone who finished a degree in a field the market does not care about (anthropology, journalism, etc) is going to have a much harder time finding a job that doesn’t specifically demand their degree; they’re basically as ""unqualified"" for the jobs they apply to as people without their kind of degree, but would cost a company more.  
 
Having said that, I still wonder why there is no bigger influx of American students into Europe. Learn one of the European languages that tickles your fancy, spend 4-6 years abroad, get back with a degree and very little, if any, debt. I know people who are already doing it that way, even Reading about $100k+ student loan debts that people (often?) ship out of university with just boggles my mind.

Earliest mention of Kurdish identity is in Sassanid Era, so close to 1500 years ago.

Kurds are indo-european like other Iranian groups and none of them have been in the region for 7000 years. Persians and the Medes were the two major groups and they migrated into the Middle East from Central Asia roughly 4000 years ago.

Short story, Germany wanted to raise interest rates. UK had to match the rate hike to maintain the currency peg. But the UK was entering recession at the time so wanted to hold off on a rate hike so tried to convince Germany to hold off the rate hike. Everyone thought the £ was overvalued and expected a devaluation of the ERM rate, however the UK government were stupid enough to stick by the existing rate. 

However, the speculators started selling the pound expecting a devaluation, the UK government then rose interest rates to 10% to no effect selling continued. The BofE spent billions buying the pound to maintain the value above the lower limit however the £ continued to fall.

http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdf

Vegans and some other vegetarians may have lower intakes of vitamin B-12, calcium, vitamin D, zinc, and long-chain n-3 fatty acids.

Studies have found that although isolated soy protein can meet protein needs as effectively as animal protein, wheat protein eaten alone, for example, may result in a reduced efficiency of nitrogen utilization. Thus, estimates of protein requirements of vegans may vary, depending to some degree on dietary choices.

Because of lower bioavailability of iron from a vegetarian diet, the recommended iron intakes for vegetarians are 1.8 times those of nonvegetarians.

Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, tend to have lower blood levels of EPA and DHA than nonvegetarians.

Zinc intakes of vegetarians vary with some research showing zinc intakes near recommendations and other research finding zinc intakes of vegetarians significantly below recommendations.

Some studies suggest that vegans who do not consume key sources of iodine, such as iodized salt or sea vegetables, may be at risk for iodine deficiency, because plant-based diets are typically low in iodine. Sea salt and kosher salt are generally not iodized nor are salty seasonings such as tamari.

Calcium intakes of lacto-ovo-vegetarians are similar to, or higher than, those of nonvegetarians, whereas intakes of vegans tend to be lower than both groups and may fall below recommended intakes. In the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford) study, the risk of bone fracture was similar for lacto-ovo-vegetarians and meat eaters, whereas vegans had a 30% higher risk of fracture possibly due to their considerably lower mean calcium intake.
Oxalates in some foods, such as spinach and Swiss chard, greatly reduce calcium absorption, making these vegetables a poor source of usable calcium. Foods rich in phytate may also inhibit calcium absorption.

The vitamin B-12 status of some vegetarians is less than adequate due to not regularly consuming reliable sources of vitamin B-12. Vegetarian diets are typically rich in folacin, which may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency, so that vitamin B-12 deficiency may go undetected until after neurological signs and symptoms may be manifest.

Infants of vegetarian mothers appear to have lower cord and plasma DHA than do infants of nonvegetarians. Breast milk DHA is lower in vegans and lacto-ovovegetarians than in nonvegetarians.

Vegetarian athletes may have lower muscle creatine concentration due to low dietary creatine levels.

Some, but not all research suggests that amenorrhea [loss of menstruation] may be more common among vegetarian than nonvegetarian athletes.

Poor vitamin B-12 status has been linked to an increased risk of dementia apparently due to the hyperhomocysteinemia that is seen with vitamin B-12 deficiency.

The amount of disinformation being thrown around by people getting their news from CNN or r/worldnews, as if it were FACT, is simply sad. This Crimea media-circlejerk is exactly the same as any other circlejerk observed on this subreddit, yet people keep spamming bad putin=hitler and sanction jokes. 

These are a few simple points you need to understand, before you go on joking on reddit/youtube about the whole situation:
#1: innocent civilians are dying everyday, mostly because of Ukrainaian governments shelling. Thousand and thousands of people LOST THEIR HOME for no reason. Same thing happened in former Yugoslavia, where some countires and their populations still havent recovered from the war (where UN/NATO planes bombed civilian buidlings indiscriminately). 
#2: the western world has no moral upper-hand as it is presented/believed - USA openly founded the overthrow of an elected Ukrainan president and presented it as a democratic reneisance, while ANY interference (ranging from sending humanitarian aid to supplying weapons) by Russia is presented as The Great Tyrant aka Putin trying to murder his way to world dominance.
#3: Russia has a legitimate interest in Crimea, while the US doesn't, reasons being: it was once Russian, before it was given to Ukraine as a gift, there are more ethnic Russians living there than there are Ukrainans and its RIGHT ON RUSSIA's BORDER. How do you think USA would react if Russia sponsored the overthrow of the pro-US Mexican government, destabilazing the whole country as the US did on Russia's border.
#4: while USA and populations of the western world moralize abot The Great Tyrant's evil plans, UN/NATO countires use what little resources they have invading countries which do not accept the US world dominance (example: Libya was one of US's strongest allies in the region until Gadafi started seting up an African Union through which African countries could achieve more independence from the west and could market oil under their own terms - we all remember how the story went from there on) and use drone strikes in countries where there ISN'T even a declared war (read about Yemen).
#5: the sanctions against Russia hurt the EU countires much much more than they hurt Russia, and there is supposed to be an economic crisis going on in Europe, but we better ruin the whole economy so Putin looks bad. These kind of sanctions (like the LoL ban) accomplish nothing but hurt innocent people, while the whole western society cracks jokes about Adolf Putin and his ""propaganda"" while all they know is what is being told to them by a US State Department controlled media narrative.

If anybody actually read this, I thank you for taking your time and giving an opportunity to a point of view which is not presented to you in your daily life. In the end we must all make our own conclusions about what is right and what is wrong. You decide if you feel happy living in a society where the system exploits individuals as if they were resources to be shaped into a final product, compliant with the western agenda, just because it's too comfortable to not ask yourself if something is real or just presented to you as real, so you can continue to be manipulated into being just another brick in a wall, built using lies.

Because our history shows us trending towards more freedoms and more egalitarianism and more ways to *not* kill each other.

This is something people miss if they get too caught up in current events and social justice stuff.  (not necessarily referring to *you* here)  As much as things suck today on so many parts of the planet, things sucked SO MUCH WORSE in centuries before.

Two thousand years ago, the height of popular entertainment was throwing non-Romans into a pit with lions to prove how cultured the Romans were.  Nowadays, tens of millions tune into Wrestlemania every year (and at least as many pirate it), which is an athletic exhibition pretending to be prizefighting pretending to be ritual combat.  

Burly men pretending to beat each other up sates our bloodlust these days.

Or on the larger scale, we're basically in a golden age of peace right now, in terms of actual *active* military conflicts ongoing.  History before the 20th Century was mind-bogglingly bloody.  

Hell, for all intents and purposes Europe spent 2000 years in a state of war with occasional outbreaks of peace.  (Usually only achieved by sending their warriors to attack someone else for a change.)  Then, in the span of a single human lifetime, they put away their guns and started forming economic pacts instead.

Same with areas in Asia and SE Asia, a couple holdouts aside.  Places like Cambodia and Thailand are significantly more stable these days, even *with* the occasional coup and protest.  There aren't genocides any more.  Business is booming, and their economies are growing stronger thanks to peaceful ties with other ASEAN countries.  

Our bloodlust IS going away, ever so slowly.  It's just hard to see that sometimes because of how we can now see practically every atrocity still going on in realtime.  This is literally the closest we've ever come to having a truly functional global society, and it honestly can still happen.

Slovenian politicians certainly were the ones to bear the most blame. But the fact is that, countries like Slovenia were baited into joining, because they were desirable enough to be exploited, but not usefull enough to not be thrown aside like Germany etc. Our economy simply wasnt strong enough to take the euro, which everybody knew, but let us in so that they could buy up our economy when we fail.

I like it. Stressful jobs in some ways are great for people with bipolar. Nobody sane would want my job. My boss is great and I have some pretty big latitude to make decisions and do wacky things. Plus I get to spend other people's money buying stuff.

The downside. When I first started I went hypomanic. previously I had been depressed  (unemployment will do that) so I had to titrate off some of my meds rather rapidly.  I had sleep disturbances. Now I am feeling much better and my sleeping has stabilized.

The depression and malaise is gone for now. People need me (and me specifically) for things. I feel important. 

I need to be ""on"" to get my guys to do the work I need. I have to focus on self care, mostly sleep, exercise, mindfulness. I tell myself constantly that I'm no good to anyone if I am not thinking clearly. Exercise goes on my calendar. I can afford to go to classes and see a trainer so I have to do the exercise. I watch the sunrise, sunset, and scenery by my new office - its near a beautiful location. Helps with mindfulness and staying present. 

I have room for improvement in diet, I am waiting for spring so I can ride my bike again. Also I have wine with dinner again but just one glass. I have gained weight coming off the stimulant meds and with the stress. It is not perfect.

Yeah that is the official excuse of pro-ukrainians who try to justify indiscriminate shelling.

&gt;They aren't, thats the whole point. 

You understand that this weeks shelling of bus and culture center was  example of indiscriminate shelling done by Ukraine army?

The latest attacks, which took place in the Kievskiy district of the city, came as Amnesty International documented a pattern of indiscriminate shelling and rocket attacks in the area by Ukrainian forces in the past 10 days. “Ukrainian government forces must immediately stop firing on residential areas in Donetsk,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Europe and Central Asia Director.

The indiscriminate shelling of built-up areas continued with over 100 incidents reported in November alone. For example, on 5 November, the shelling of a school football pitch in Donetsk killed two people, including one child, and wounded four children; on 14 November, the shelling of Horlivka (Donetsk region) killed five civilians, including two children, and wounded 12; on 18 November, the village of Toshkivka (Luhansk region) was shelled with three civilians killed and four wounded, including two children; on 25 November, a minibus was hit in Donetsk with two people killed and eight wounded. Of 285 women reported killed in Donetsk region by 25 November, 116 were killed after the 5 September ceasefire. On no occasion have any of the armed groups or the Government taken responsibility for any civilian deaths. The Government claims it only opens fire in response to attacks by armed groups and never targets residential areas

Limited progress has been reported in the investigation initiated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA), the Office of the Prosecutor General and the SBU into more than 300 cases of indiscriminate shelling of residential areas since the start of the year. In some cases armed groups started their own ‘investigations’ into indiscriminate shelling of the territories under their control, for instance in the shelling of a Donetsk school playground on 5 November.

During an August 20-22, 2014 visit to Luhansk, under siege by Ukrainian armed forces, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than a dozen people who witnessed or became victims of artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks that killed or injured civilians in populated areas. Many of the attacks appeared to be indiscriminate, in that they did not or could not distinguish between civilians and combatants, Human Rights Watch said. Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law, or the laws of war.

The topic was Human Rights Watch’s finding that Ukrainian government troops fighting Russia-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine had indiscriminately fired Grad rockets and cluster munitions into populated areas. “There is no evidence! No evidence,” Yatsenyuk said in an interview with FAZ.

""Regrettably we have been observing over the past few days an expansion of indiscriminate shelling throughout the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, including against heavily populated areas such as Donetsk city and Debaltseve""


Kiev/Geneva (ICRC) – The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is deeply distressed by the killing of one of its staff, Laurent DuPasquier, in Donetsk today. The 38-year-old Swiss national, an administrator in the organization’s office in the city, was killed when a shell landed near the premises.

The more apt comparison you might be thinking of is NATO where the US is the main contributor of ships, personnel and weaponry (as well as aircraft and missiles).  Russia and China (non NATO members) still maintain a sizable fleet of aircraft, ships and weapons that they maintain and build themselves. Even the UK and France are able to build and hold a fair sized defensive armed service without heavy US involvement.  It seems more likely that when the Federation was completed and unilateral defense treaties were signed between all groups the decision was made that Starfleet and their ship design would be responsible for the defense of all member planets.  At first perhaps many planets did maintain their own fleets due to the fact they were still uncertain whether the Federation would last and weren't ready to completely fire their entire armed services or make them put on a yellow V neck and become Starfleet Officers, this is why even by Kirks time the Enterprise was part of UESPA and not Starfleet, until shortly after that group was retired in the same way the Andorians retired the last of their service and allowed it to be absorbed in to the greater (in size) Starfleet.

Perhaps in the various treaties set up by each of the member states in entering the Federation some concessions were made as to what each race / planet would give to the Federation, and Earth allowed Mars to be main ship building colony and manufacturing signing, this of course would put Earth at greater risk since they didn't bring advanced tech to the Federation but they did have a nice barren planet that the Federation could use, the risk being having a ship yard on Earths doorstep that in the event of full blown war with Romulus or the Klingon Empire would be target number one.   This would mean during the Romulan / fledgling Federation war that Earth would have built up their fleet more than the Tellarites or Andorians, giving them an edge in the arms race, again allowing the Starfleet design an edge others didn't.

Later as more planets that weren't aligned with each other as their own Federation decided to join up, they decided that instead of just keeping their own small fleets to just sign up to the mutual defense pact the Federation has in place and retire their small fleets or adopt them for freight use.  There may also be some prerequisites in joining the Federation, such as adoption of their economy, signature to their laws and freedoms, and to standardisation of ships and technology, this is the case with countries joining the European Union.",,,3,0,0,t5_2whek,t3_2ue0xw,3,1424271020,False,terrymcginnisbeyond,DaystromInstitute,False

Allow me to give you two scenarios:

A) Continue on the austerity plan. Let's give a positive outlook, let's say Greece manages 4.5% surplus as per the target of the troika **and** a 1% GDP growth for perpetuity (for contrast highest German GDP the last 10 years was 5%, that's without harsh austerity and without a surplus target).

Do you know how many years it would take for Greece to reach pre-austerity GDP levels? 29 years. How many years do you think that the IMF/ECB and EU will continue to loan Greece at sub market rates? What would happen when they'll need to refresh the loans? 

That's assuming they [don't fuck up again](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22791248).

B) Stop the austerity. Haircut the debt so say a 1.5% surplus will cover the creditors. Pump the rest of the surplus into the economy. Assuming the same numbers as before, that's ~5.5% GDP growth. 6 years to reach pre-austerity levels with a primary surplus and people actually working.

I will be speaking solely from historically from England's football as I don't know much about the Euro history of ultras. Basically Football Teams have fans like any sport. But then you also had hooligans who go to the game and then afterwards would have a planned fight with the opponents ""firm"" or just attack the other teams fans. Due to policing and banning orders by the early 90s the hooligan was nearly dead. Large gangs or ""firms"" shrunk and although football violence still exists, it is nothing in comparison to the 70/80s.
So casuals are kind of the result of hooliganism. They will typically wear adidas Samba or Gazelle trainers (as the tattoo shows). Jeans. Stone Island or CP Company jackets. They avoid wearing team colours (such as team shirts) so that they blend in ""casually"" with the rest of society but standing out by their recognisable style to the people that know.
Though prohibited in English football, a casual is a supporter of the ""no pyro, no party"" mantra where flares are used in the stadium. Across Europe this is very common but in England, its rare to see pyro in stadiums. 
As I say, Casuals are a form of hooliganism so occasionally there will be planned and non-planned fights between fans but not to the extent as previously seen.

I'm generally pro-european (in the sense that I'm in favour of an ""ever closer union""). Politicians trying to defend the European unification process are always quick with referencing the two World Wars and the exceptional success the EU has had in building peace on a traditionally belligerent continent, so this narrative has become a cliché, but it's still true. I grew up in a relatively wealthy, safe, liberal environment, I can travel from Portugal to Estonia without a single interruption and without even having to exchange currencies once. Not to mention all the big development projects, regional development aids, the European Court of Justice...

The EU gets a bad rep in large parts because it is so bureaucratic. There's really no denying that it's a huge machinery that costs a lot of money and is hellishly bureaucratic. What people tend to forget is that by taking on competences that were formerly in the hands of the individual states, it can also contribute to actually reducing bureaucratic structures (in the individual states). I'll admit there's a lot of room for improvement for this though. I also don't have a problem with bureaucracy per se, if it actually produces positive outcomes for citizens (by protecting the environment, strengthening consumer rights etc.). I'd like to see the political discussion focus more on *individual* shortcomings and successes of official structures instead of just repeating the old lament of Brussels as a bureaucratic monstrosity.

Another point critics of the EU like to make is its lack of democratic legitimacy. Again, there's some truth to that. Most 'normal' people have enough to do just keeping up with local, regional, national politics - following the processes of EU politics which are sometimes incredibly complex and in addition also interact with *each* of the afforementioned levels (at least with regional and national politics) is, to put it lightly, demanding for your average citizen. Many don't bother keeping up with it anymore. The EU is becoming more transparent and democratic, albeit slowly. This is happening mostly by gradually strengthening the (originally pretty toothless) European Parliament, which is the one body that actually gets directly elected by the populace. Another way about which most people unfortunately don't know is the [Ombudsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Ombudsman), an institution that takes in complaints and requests by citizens of the EU that feel like they've been treated unfairly or just want more clarity about the workings of EU authorities. Small, incremental steps like these are important, but also very easily overlooked or ignored by the populations of Europe.

Something that I actually dislike about the way the EU works right now is the dominance (admittedly not uncontested) of free market fetishism and of conservative / market-liberal discourse (fiscal austerity that views the deconstruction of social welfare nets as collateral damage, bank bailouts, ""competitiveness"" of economies as the main priority... all that jazz). I know that many Americans think of Europe (and the EU by proxy) as a very leftist place, sometimes even using the word ""socialism"" for countries that are everything but socialist. This is a huge misconception in my opinion. To not make this post even more convoluted, read [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/14/neoliberal-europe-union-austerity-crisis) if you're interested (opinion piece of course, take with a grain of salt). Lobbyism is also a huge issue.

I personally think that people forget too easily what unification has brought them - peace, stability, more effective cross-border law inforcement; the fact that there's pan-European institutions at all makes it more difficult for individual governments to pursue ""egoistic"" policies without taking into account at least the interests of the other EU states; and even though the climate in the EU is pretty damn uncomfortable (with all the animosity between Germany and Greece, right-wing, often anti-European parties gaining support in virtually every country of the EU, and the UK still not too happy about pretty much everything), the framework is there to potentially build a more democratic, open, still wealthy and peaceful space where there's been nationalism and war for centuries.",,,2,0,0,t5_2qh1i,t3_2ufazn,2,1424269836,False,eisberger,AskReddit,False

You can do some research into the CEU group to find out more about this, but I found this post about CEU genetic substructures (that is, ethnic compositions of the ""generic white american"" sample population) [here](http://eurogenes.blogspot.com/2012/02/genetic-substructures-within-hapmap-ceu.html) on the Eurogenes site, which is home to a statistical modeling program that calculates ancestry using a database of genetic population samples from around the globe, but namely europe. 

That author writes, ""I attempt to characterize more precisely the origins of some of the individuals from the HapMap CEU cohort. These samples are described by the HapMap project as Utah Americans of Western and Northern European descent. But this doesn't seem to be exactly true for at least two of them, who actually come out very Central European in all my tests. Moreover, it's obvious that some of the samples fit nicely into very specific areas of Western and Northern Europe. For instance, at this level of resolution, a few could pass as Irish, and others for Danes or even Swedes.""

According to statistical analysis of the CEU group, the CEU group seemed homogenous phenotypically, but it actually was more varied genetically than expected: ""...[in terms of genetic signatures] at least six of the CEU samples might pass for unmixed Scandinavians, most likely Danes or southern Swedes...at least five could be confused for Irish or western British samples"". And then there are the few anomalies who leaned very Central European.

So...essentially, white Americans are very admixed by this point and could be ""more similar"" to a lot of things-- including Irish peoples, Germans, Scandinavians, or the English. It varies but isn't necessarily obvious just from looking at someone or their last name.

2. To show a better long-term strategy to deal with the Greek debt problem. Are anti-austerity measures really the best way to go with debt still being over 100% of GDP?
 
3. The Syriza ministers are planning on going an offensive negotiation tour to the IMF, EU and ECB. The key to a successful renegotiation is to show these institutions the effect a weak Greece will have on the Eurozone.

Sadly, I knew nothing about either.  Your comment prompted me to learn about [Dean Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Reed):

&gt; In Chile, he developed a left-wing political philosophy, and began to speak out against oppression and poverty. He protested against nuclear weapons and US foreign policy, and performed shows free in poor neighborhoods and in prisons. Back in Buenos Aires, his politics eventually ran afoul of Argentine government policies after the 1966 Argentine Revolution and he was deported.

&gt; In 1971 Reed wrote an ""open letter"" to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, criticizing him for having slandered the USSR.[1]

&gt; He lived in Rome for a time, acting in TV commercials and spaghetti western movies such as Adiós, Sabata, and touring Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, where he was immensely popular.

&gt; Life in the Soviet bloc

&gt; In 1973, Reed chose to settle permanently in East Germany, where he continued to write, direct, and perform in films. Over the years he played in 20 films, produced 13 records, and gave concerts in 32 countries. The majority of his songs during this period were uncertified covers of successful hits of Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, The Beatles and others.[2] In 1978 he directed and starred in El Cantor (The Singer), a biopic about his friend [Víctor Jara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Víctor_Jara), the popular Chilean singer-songwriter murdered by the military after [the 1973 coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d'état) against President [Salvador Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende).

There is also [John Reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reed_\(journalist\)), of course, author of [*Ten Days That Shook The World*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Days_That_Shook_the_World).  I do know of him -- which is more than most Americans can say!

❧

In your comment, I sense disappointment: There was great enthusiasm in the Soviet Union for antiwar activists, but there was no reciprocal enthusiasm here in America.  We have been stupefied by the infatuation with war and power.  

So all of the activists celebrated by the Soviet communists amounted to nothing.  The faith in human nature was rebuffed again and again.  Soviet loyalists may have felt like a lonely ""voice in the wilderness"" -- making every effort to invite others to join the human cause, and getting nothing but ignorant taunts in return.  This isolation must be hard for a gregarious culture to fathom.  

I've concluded, however, that is the nature of existence.  Down through history, activists have always stood alone against a tide of ignorance and barbarism.  Our solidarity is internal, not external: We feel an inner connection with activists in other times and places, but we are not understood within our own time and place.

If we are not understood, then why bother?  Why go against the masses?  Why not join the lemmings, and eat, drink and be merry, as we march into the sea and drown?  Well, I suppose it is a matter of self-respect.  To live, we must live for something.  To live for nothing seems inhuman and unhealthy.  So our activism is for our own benefit: Our love for others is a reflection of our love for self.

Soviet loyalists were disappointed because they set themselves an impossible task.  Sunbeams, however bright, are not enough to wear down a mountain.  Warmth and friendship is not enough to turn people away from fascism.  

I call fascism ""the ideology of national suicide"": The war cult is a cult of death.  When people acquire a terminal illness, a desire for death develops.  Fascism is such an illness -- a fatal political and spiritual disease.  We are locked in a death grip.

""Our neglected infrastructure aside, it is easy to see that NAFTA was a bad deal for most Americans. The promised trade surpluses with Mexico turned out to be deficits, some hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost, and there was downward pressure on US wages – which was, after all, the purpose of the agreement. This was not like the European Union's (pre-Eurozone) economic integration, which allocated hundreds of billions of dollars of development aid to the poorer countries of Europe so as to pull their living standards up toward the average. The idea was to push US wages downward, toward Mexico's, and to create new rights for corporations within the trade area: these lucky multinational enterprises could now sue governments directly before a corporate-friendly international tribunal, unaccountable to any national judicial system, for regulations (eg environmental) that infringed upon their profit-making potential.

But what about Mexico? Didn't Mexico at least benefit from the agreement? Well if we look at the past 20 years, it's not a pretty picture. The most basic measure of economic progress, especially for a developing country like Mexico, is the growth of income (or GDP) per person. Out of 20 Latin American countries (South and Central America plus Mexico), Mexico ranks 18, with growth of less than 1% annually since 1994. It is, of course, possible to argue that Mexico would have done even worse without NAFTA, but then the question would be, why?""

Like you said, it's a bit cliche. When I first graduated high school (moved to Alberta, started working, like everyone else), I knew even then that if I ever wanted to travel that Japan was at the top of my list, no matter what. I bought travel books, language books, I planned fantasy trips, and talked to friends about doing it ""someday"".

Fast forward almost a decade, I'm finally working a job where I get paid well. Well enough to have a sizable savings to make a trip somewhere, and a company that allows paid vacation time for a change. (Unheard of in retail, right?) So, I start talking to my friends and family about going to Japan. I'm immediately met with concern about going, what if you get lost, you can't really speak the language, why don't you wait (another FIVE YEARS) for a time when you have friends to go WITH you so you'll be safe? Why not go somewhere that they speak English, and you'll be able to read the road signs and talk to people if you get lost?

I thought about it. Hell, I even worried about it, because on one hand, they were right. I COULD go somewhere that I spoke the language, could read the street signs, and find my way back thanks to the locals if I got lost.

Or, I could go somewhere that seemingly possessed a part of my soul from the moment I knew it existed. Somewhere that I'd been dreaming about, and planning for over a better part of my life. Somewhere that I felt the amount of money spent, come hell or high water (or you know, earthquakes and tsunami) would still be worth it at the end of the day.

I picked Japan. I went alone. And I spent close to $4500.00 on the whole trip. And you know what? I got lost in Shibuya in Tokyo, and a local man helped me find my way back to the train station where the signs were in English. I didn't speak much Japanese, but what I did know was more than appreciated by the people I spoke to. I made friends while I was there, and I still talk to them two years later. And we plan to all go back together someday.

That doesn't even cover an eighth of the stories I have from that trip. And the way I see it, at least I have that.

Go, but don't do the cliche trip. If this is your one and only time to go, Europe will still be there. Mexico will be there. Dominican will be there.

Ukraine couldn't live without Russian energy at the moment, it has tried to consolidate energy from other countries, even coal from South Africa but none of it made any sense.

And the vital thing to remember of course is that it is a civil war. 
Russia hasn't invaded Ukraine officially in any capacity. 
Indeed it is mainly (as the Ukrainian defense ministry stated very recently) factions of Russian soldiers (conscription of course being mandatory in Russia) who are coming over the boarder to fight with their 'brothers' as it were - no doubt of course supported by Moscow * I'm not* for a minute claiming that Putin is in any way innocent here, he has his own greedy motive s no doubt.

Yanukovych, despite being as corrupt as the next oligarch was removed illegally. (Fantastic improvement now that another oligarch resides! at least hes US friendly) 
 It really has cost Ukraine everything by looking starry eyed toward Europe in the hope of becoming another Poland.

1. Israeli Politician - it is easy to say just sit down and make peace, and yet in many of our own countries which are not even under attack we can't avoid electing right wing politicians at the merest threat or terrorism, let alone a very real and ongoing threat. What platform do you run on and how do you appeal to people who just want their kids to come home from school safely. 
2. Palestinian Politician - same question but now not only do you have to try to find a path to peace, you have to do it while navigating a horrifically corrupt and potentially lethal bureaucracy. What party do you even run in and how do you begin. 
3. Civiliian of Either Stripe - you think it's hard to find the politician you like in your system? Imagine in a country basically at war for 50 years. Do you vote for the far left and basically stall out the legislature, go to the middle and hope some centrist can make some forward steps, or do you out of fear/anger (which let's be honest drives a huge electorate in any country) say better to just hunker down.

I see it as a psychological phenomena, but I don't dismiss metaphysical views.

&gt; Were your tulpa natural/pre-existing or were they intentionally created?

Cheren, Rachel, Yuri and Sol were ""natural"". The first three were imaginary friends, the latter was a character that I had created for a story. Kyoko was intentionally created.

&gt; How long have you had your tulpa?

I've been tulpaforcing for one year and 11 months, now. However I had some of my tulpas for far longer. Cheren has been with me for 4 years, Rachel for 3 years, Yuri for 5 years. Sol has been with us for a year now, and Kyoko is 11 months old.

&gt; How long have you been active in the community (/r/tulpas, Tulpa.info, other)?

I joined the community (on tulpa.info) 1 year and 11 months ago, but I became more active only starting from April of last year (when I joined on this Reddit).

&gt; Are you willing to take up more than one person to mentor?

Yeah, sure.

Five.

&gt; What form are your tulpa?

They are all human, apart from Sol who is an half-beast (half-wolf).

&gt; Would you say there is anything you are exceptionally good at? (Be it visualisation, possession, etc.)

Often physical licensing ends up giving you the streaming rights and none of the current UK companies have their own streaming site; history had it that you can't make much money off it with such a small market (Kaze, a European masterer/distributor had a site called anime-on-demand where they put some of their stuff which failed; they are now instead using animaxtv which is ran by sony). Just to add, Manga UK have the majority of anime in the UK, and Anime Limited are a somewhat new company kinda trying to release to the collector (Patema Inverted Ultimate edition kickstarter; Baccano, Bebop and Outlaw Star on blu-ray) while rescuing titles from the defunct Beez Entertainment (such as Gurren Lagann). (A quote from him about release strategy on the founding of the company can be found [here](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2012-12-14/andrew-partridge-talks-about-anime-limited))  
    
The president of Anime Limited used to run the Kaze uk branch and streaming site and as such had experience with putting digital content out. At Anime Limited the titles they've grabbed that are new have for the most part been simulcasted (Tokyo Ghoul, Zankyou, Kill La Kill, Space Dandy) on a French branch site, wakanim.co.uk . This was good for watching live but in order to advertise for their collectors edition physical releases (which are at a bit of a higher price point than other distributors) they have over the last year ([here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Kill_la_Kill_and_Gurren_Lagann_added_to_Netflix_UK.html), [here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Blood_Lad_added_to_Netflix_UK.html) and [here](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Space_Dandy%27s_first_season_added_to_Netflix_UK.html)) decided it was worth adding these shows to Netflix, aiming for eyeballs on their product over money directly (imo).   
  
I have no way of knowing how successful this strategy has been, but both from the new additions added to Netflix yesterday/today by Anime Ltd and the [release of many titles by Manga UK over January](http://www.uk-anime.net/newsitem/Death_Note_and_Vampire_Knight_now_available_on_Netflix_UK.html) make me think that it has the least been worth continuing with for the time being. Particularly, the fact that Manga UK (which had previously only released the odd thing on youtube such as [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MPe7E1YrY4)) has put lots of their older shows on Netflix which they've evidently just been holding back makes me think this is the way the UK digital anime market is shifting.

What country is better suited to build up hydroelectric power than *A FUCKING GIANT ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH SEA*?


&gt;Such as Germany, cutting down on baseline power production by the removal of nuclear, and increasing situational power production through wind investments. They've increased their overall power production, and their power export, but they've also decreased their baseline power production and increased* their power imports. Basically importing nuclear power from France rather than producing it themselves, resulting in higher power costs. To suggest that Britain engage in the same practice would be pretty foolish, and would come with significant economical implications, probably more drastic than what Germany has experienced.

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the

          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

Shinn became an anti-hero (not a protagonist), and Kira remained a hero. Shinn became a ZAFT puppet with no redeemable qualities. He did not try to overcome his past (like a hero traditionally does), and instead revelled in it. He wanted to be praised and feed his ego, and in the end he couldn't beat a Kira who had no desire to kill him -- or anyone for that matter.

Look here, I don't think you 100% understand how heroes and [anti-heroes] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero) work. There is no universal rule that states that an anti-hero can't be the protagonist. A protagonists is not always the hero. We have had plenty of anti-hero protagonists throughout history, and we still do today. 

Shinn is that of a character who suffers lost after loss, and that is what we were shown. He's also that of a well meaning person that goes about it the wrong way. As time and each battle went by, he became the very thing that he was trying to fight against. Shinn wasn't meant to win in the end at all. That would defeat the purpose of him being an anti-hero.

&gt;Then he never mentioned it again. He then rejoined ZAFT and spent the remainder of the show questioning the purpose of his life -- something that took him only a few episodes to solve in SEED after he was confronted by Lacus after Kira left PLANTS with Freedom.

Ah, no. He did not have his problem solved at all in those few episodes. Before they left Orb, Athrun asked that question to Kira and Dearke, and Kira told him to go with them. Besides his father, he's also looking for what he should be fighting against and how. Durandal gave him a ""temporary"" answer to his problems, and that was why Athrun decided to rejoin ZAFT.

&gt;That doesn't change the fact that Fukuda neutered the shit out of her, and then basically wrote off her and Athrun's relationship for god knows why.

Here's the thing, FUKUDA DID NOT WRITE THE STORY. He was the director, not the writer. 

&gt;Shinn wasn't a fallen hero. He wasn't anything. He never even tried to address the trauma of losing his parents. He just blamed ORB even though it was the war between ZAFT and EU that led his parents to die. He ended up just being another soldier who was being manipulated by Dulandal and Rey. At least Dearka and Yzak learned their lessons in SEED.

Blaming Orb was his ""coping mechanism"" to what happened to his family. That was how he addressed it. But at the same time, what happened to his family was his driving force.
Why wasn't Shinn a fallen hero? He didn't want what happened to him to happen to others. He doesn't want others to get hurt because of all the fighting. That was the reason why he chose to join ZAFt and fight. But along the way, he lost that clear goal he had. With every heroic action he took, also came with his darkness in him coming out. Yes, he was manipulated by Rey and Durandal. That was a plot point in the story. But at the same time, Shinn chose to follow them.

Get new doctors.  Hormones are proteins. When you eat proteins the quatenary structure is denatured by HCl and then the chains of amino acids are digested by proteases.  I'm sure you did that in high school.   Is there another pathway where hormones would have an effect that I am not aware of?

En outre l'été de l'année prochaine je vais aller en Afrique du sud pour un séjour de rugby. Ce voyage est une expérience unique de la vie. Si j'ai assez d'argent, j'achèterai un maillot de rugby d'afrique du sud. Quand nous arrivons là, nous allons jouer trois matchs de rugby contre les écoles locales. Le rugby c'est le sport national de l'Afrique du Sud et du rugby de l'école est de la plus haute qualité. Les jeux seront très difficiles. Aussi bien qu’allions jouer le rugby, nous irons également sur un très long safari, où nous verrons nous la faune du pays. Bien sur que oui! Je pars pour l'Afrique du Sud, le jour suivant.

I don't think opening up the discussion right now is wise (I would though, if you like it), just two quick things:

a) Leading by example is fine, but I currently believe that what's good for Germany to do in Europe may not be good for ""Greece"". German debt is ""under control"" right now and we should invest, while they probably can't.

b) The EU flags are a nice symbolic statement, but ultimately useless. It took us a few rounds of exchange until you let slip that you are German (and probably from Berlin). That severely impairs the ability of discussion partners to infer what you might or might not know in cultural or political background.

Tax imports? In Greece's case it's simply not possible due to being a member of the EU. The problem with such solutions is that it quickly leads to a black market with smugglers and corruption (paperwork forgery, bribed border guards etc).

We used to have an import limit and foreign currency rules in my country after WWII. It worked but it kept the economy from developing and the population had to make do. The prices on goods went up in general and people were poorer for it (purchasing power).

The old Greek City-States worked because of their low level agarian nature, ritualised way of conducting warfare and a population concentration that you won't even find in modern day Siberia. 

Modern society is completely different. Think of why government models moved from typical Greek citizen solider models, see also the Roman professional standing army, the Anglo-Saxon fyrd composed of freemen (not slaves) to Europe in the middle ages to finally the French Revolution, where EVERYONE had the right to citizenship. The rights that you have as a person were born out of the French Revolution, much more so than the American one as a drive for equality for EVERYONE under the sun, not just a select few. 

If you ask any Frenchmen, 9 out of 10 they will agree that the values of *egalite, fraternite, legalite* as the highest of all laws in France. That all men (in 1789, only men counted; women would not get the vote until the 20th century!) will be governed and held equal in the eyes of the law. No longer will there be relgious courts, noble courts and the common court - all are equal where you are rich or poor, learned or illiterate.

The French Revolution is a fantastic bit of knowledge to have under your belt - it has shaped the formation of modern Europe much more than anything since.

That criticism of other states behaving in a similar fashion isn't used as justification for the dissolution of said state.

The US and Soviets have engaged in some arms reduction during detente. That seems a nonstarter at the moment given the current climate. Do you think it would have been preferable to spend American lives in a ground invasion of Imperial Japan and against an enemy determined to fight to the last man? I don't. Do you think it would have been preferable to appease the Soviets? Not me, that didn't stop Hitler from conquering as much of Europe as he could.

I don't believe that. I believe America wanted to demonstrate that if you commit crimes against same you will eventually be caught and punished. If he hadn't resisted capture, he'd be on trial. Likewise when Obama orders drone strikes against American citizens participating in terrorist activities abroad, it's not revenge it's extraterritorial justice and self preservation.

Israel does pursue a policy of targeted assassination against terrorist leaders. Today Khaled Meshaal sits comfortably in a 5 star hotel in Qatar ordering terrorist attacks against Israelis. Once upon a time, Israel dispatched Mossad agents to Jordan to kill him via poison. They failed to do it undetected and were caught by Jordanian security. In exchange for the antidote, saving Meshaals life, the two Israeli agents were released. (The Canadian passport incident). The point is Meshaal like others, plot and order the deaths of Israelis abroad with relative impunity. Someone has to stop them.

Don't pretend to tell me the salience of statements by NGO's condemning the intended indiscriminate killing of Israelis by terrorists outstrips the the ones condemning the shortcomings of the Israeli forces targeting terrorists. 1st rule of journalism is if it bleeds it leads. Which is too bad because 'accuracy accuracy accuracy' would be a hell of a lot better for a first rule. 

A young Palestinian man on a bus was reported to have stabbed 22 or 23 people on a bus this past week in Israel. The following day he was hailed for his heroic actions by Hamas while the PA issued (and then retracted) a cartoon featuring a smiling youth with a blood soaked knife in the image of the Palestinian flag in front of a bus leaking more blood. It's probably still there in /worldnews somewhere. 

A condemnation against an attack on a house of worship, swell. I guess that's the limit to the leadership rewarding indecency. Just don't leave your synagogue and you'll be fine.

The gov't maintains the monopoly on the legitimate use of force. This is why you can't punch a cop trying to arrest you without further charges being levied against you. This is why America went into Afghanistan to root out the Taliban from training more terrorists. Or pursued OBL into Pakistan (who swore they didn't know he was there *bullshit*).

Netanyahu offered Abbas a deal and had instituted a moratorium on settlement construction while negotiations were ongoing. No agreement was reached. Moratorium expired. Abbas instead of continuing negotiations has elected to make end runs at the UN. The UN while condemning settlement construction has also passed resolutions that entitle Israel to defensible borders and that those same borders are to be negotiated. Can't negotiate when one party refuses to show up. If Abbas says he wants to go back to the negotiating table, the Israelis will be waiting.

Israel, like America, like many others states is not without its shortcomings, however there are persistent calls for Israel to be wiped off the map as with calls for its delegitimization. There is a clear double standard at play. I wouldn't describe America as 'out for revenge' or 'legitimately awful' any more than I would say it about Israel.

&gt;

&gt;__Adolescent sexuality in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)__ relates to the [sexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality) of [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans) [adolescents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence) and its place in American society, both in terms of their feelings, [behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent_sexual_behavior) and development and in terms of the response of the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States), educators and interested groups.

&gt;According to the US [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) (CDC), in the year 2007, 35% of US high school students were currently sexually active and 47.8% of US high school students reported having had [sexual intercourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse).  This percentage has decreased slightly since 1991.  According to a 1994 study, every year an estimated one in four sexually active teens contracts a [sexually transmitted infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection) (STI).  [Teenage pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy) is four times as prevalent in the United States as in the European Union.  However, US teen pregnancy rates have been steadily declining for decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and were at a ""record low"" as of 2012. 

&gt;In 1999, a [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation) study found that 95% of public secondary schools offered [sex education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education) programs. More than half of the schools in the study followed a comprehensive approach that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with [abstinence-only sex education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence-only_sex_education).  In 2002, most Americans favored the [comprehensive approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_sex_education).  A 2000 study found that almost all schools included information about [HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, in their curricula.  There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit [sex education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_education) in public schools to [abstinence-only sex education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence-only_sex_education) curricula.  The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.

False,co850qy,t3_2ufmdx,Communal Italy,0,1422831975,t1_co850qy,"As per the tenets of the feudal system (which were never completely, perfectly, and cleanly applied) a King is the embodiment of the state in a physical person. Because of [reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2uebsd/why_did_european_monarchs_decentralize_their/co7pwgz), European monarchs divided their kingdoms among several Dukes, who ruled great swathes of territory. 

In Italy, for example, Charlemagne made his son Pepin King, and subdivided the territory among several duchies, such as Lombardy (granted to the Obertenghi) and Tuscany (granted to the House of Canossa).  

The difference between a Duke or a Marquis (Marquis being the Franco-English translation of the German title *Magrave*) is that a Marquis is the ruler of a March, or border territory. Again, in the example of Italy, Charlemagne established the March of Friuli, and granted it to the House of Ahalolfing to guard against encroachment by Slavic peoples. Marquis' had more liberty in how they administered their lands, as they had greater defensive responsibilities, however, they could come under much more scrutiny. For example, in 828, a diet at Arachen removed Balderic Ahalolfing because he had proven particularly ineffective at repelling Omurtag of Bulgaria (in Balderic's defense, Omurtag was a serious ass-kicker. Balderic didn't much oppose the decision, his family held lands in Germany that were less prestigious, but less of a headache to live in as well). 

Each Duke or Marquis in turn subdivided his land among several Counts. For example, again in Friuli, there were four Counties. In more densely populated regions, there were many more (like Lombardy. I've been trying to count them. It's harder than it seems). Although small, independent counties subject only to the Emperor did exist in the Holy Roman Empire, they weren't entirely common, although most counts did exert lots of authority [with lots of ways to abuse their power](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1w76dp/were_there_any_european_equivalents_to_the_robber/) even if they were theoretically subject to a Duke or Marquis who should be keeping them in check. Most counts also had *their* own vassals, which in the idealized version of feudalism should be called Barons (although in Italy, the title *Barone* was only ever introduced in the south after the Sicilian Vespers, most small landholders would simply be called *Cavaliere*, or ""Knight""). 

Of course, Italy soon saw the feudal system break down because of [reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2sqn2y/why_exactly_did_italy_break_into_smaller/cnsshkg), and while Germany remained the core of the Holy Roman Empire, the union of various duchies along with infighting and continuous internal changing of borders eventually meant titles had little meaning beyond the privileges they bestowed. By the thirty years war and the subsiquent reorganization of Germany, a Magrave ranked the same as a Duke, sometimes rendered as ""Prince"" (in pop-culture history, a Prince is a King's son, however it more commonly is the title for the ruler of an independent state). 

In Italy, independent states were often termed as Grand Duchies (It. *Gran Ducati*, sing. *Gran Ducato*) because many, such as Lombardy and Tuscany, had borders that corresponded to the old Carolingan subdivisions, with the key addition of ""Grand-"" meaning that they were independent.

So my uncle was asked to stand in and play the guitar onstage. Despite not knowing what the hell he was doing he did it in front of several thousand punters. 

So they get back to the hotel and find the missing guest artist slightly sobered up but the party was only just starting. The problem for them was that the bar was shut. So my uncle and the artist in question broke into the bar, stole a couple of crates of beer and went back to the room. They didn't realise that there was a security camera and the manager came and knocked on the door. My uncle had just been thrown a beer and in his shock at the manager, failed to catch it, cut his hand open and got blood all over the walls. Safe to say they got thrown out. 



Another! - he went to the Prodigy's Milton Keynes bowl show as a VIP. When he walked into the VIP tent the first thing he saw was one of the Gallagher brothers of Oasis with his hand raised about to hit a girl. Now, my uncle doesn't really take shit from anyone.

To add, I'd like to point out that you want to choose your spots with two things in mind.  Defense and Offence.  

Parking near a friendly spawn early in the match will guarantee some fly over of enemy planes; those jockeys looking for quick kills.  Get in a direct line of your spawn to their base so that you have minimal deflection shot.  Be sure to laugh at them in chat for their despicable play style when you shoot them down.  Another good spot is well behind your attacking tanks.  When they begin to cap, that is like chum in the water for enemy planes.  You can safetly assume that any planes approaching are hostile.  

I don't like taking many side shots they are really hard to hit at ranges over 500m.  I will do this if they are occupied attacking a friendly aircraft.  The enemy pilot will tend to tunnel vision, so it is safer and easier.  Safer because they wont pay attention to you, and easier because you know where they are likely to point their nose next (they are following the friendly target). 

Defensively I like to park nearby a building.  The front of my vehicle pointed at the narrow side of the buildings footprint.  That way I have a decent chance to duck behind cover.  The village near the NW spawn area of Eastern Europe map is ideal.  The laser pointer ""here I am"" effect can be useful for your team also.  It is not so much defensive for yourself, but it may buy a friendly capping tank some time as the enemy turns to hunt you.

If you are having trouble identifying targets, which can be difficult.  Get on your chat and set up a NO FLY.  Just say in team chat that you will shoot down (or try) any plane that flies near whatever landmark you pick.  Repeat it a couple of times in chat for some of the slower fly boys that may not be familiar with tank maps.

When settlers came to America, they brought smallpox with them. Doesn't seem WTF?

Weed itself may be rare, but since you're in a hash-friendly environment, you can do almost anything with hash that you can with weed, including edibles and capsules. You just have to cut the amounts in half from published weed recipes because hash is about twice as strong. It still has to be decarboxylated for cooking though.

There's not much necessary for growing good cannabis, but if it's illegal or you're trying to be stealthy, that's where the expense comes in. Grow tents, carbon filters, LED lights, etc...but if you do it right, they can't find it!

Since I have patron I made enough gold to invest in a farm hauler and some land to grow pack mats. I have it set up so every harvest every 3 hours is 7 packs worth of mats every 3 hours for not much labor (for my current run equals out to about 50g per hauler).


I also log on to the Europe server every day for a separate loyalty point pool and labor pool. I mine on Europe every few days and sell the stone and some of the fortune vein mats. I use the loyalty to buy and sell labor potions. Just logging in a second every day and selling the mined mats gives me plenty gold for an APEX (which the credit ties into your NA account also). Then I use my gold from packs on NA to buy the other APEX. On NA with my setup I can make a few thousand gold profit a month easy not counting the APEX prices.

This is a real post, I can't imagine someone writing up crap like this just to fuck with people. Anyways, to address your points:

1. Ehh, you're right but only in a sense. Singapore is one of the most popular expat destinations in the world at the moment, so you do get a great selection of different nationalities. However, while you might meet a lot of Australians and Europeans, you won't really meet hardly any Mexicans or black people. So really by going to Singapore, you get the opportunity to date certain races but you also lose the opportunity to date other races. 

2. You're definitely right. I've seen first hand that Indians do terribly in Singapore, due to their lower perceived value and a certain racist tendency that Chinese Singaporeans have towards Indians (and Malays). I know that Singapore isn't the ""optimal"" location for everybody, although I'm sure there are certain countries that the average Indian brah would do better than a Chinese brah.

3. White worship or not, there really aren't that many white people in SG and HK. So even if they have a higher perceived status or whatever, you face a competition that's very small in comparison to what you would in the states. Besides, the value of being with a white person over there isn't as cut and dry as it is here in the states, I don't believe the ""rampant white worship"" is as bad in SG as it is in HK.

No worries, I'm not trolling. My friend Chad Thundercock was just a sample size of exactly 1. I'm sure there are white dudes that do great in SG, but where don't white dudes do very well at? Am I right? The point of this post is not about whether white dudes do well in SG, but about how grass **can** be greener on the other side if you're willing to explore a bit and see what's out there.",,,6,0,0,t5_30c2m,t3_2ugcc0,6,1424262445,False,2spooky10me,AsianMasculinity,False

It's also worth noting that the traditional aspects of it as a courtly language don't necessarily reflect its use as a lingua franca (which is essentially what we're talking about); I mean, a lot of the intellectuals and courtly nobles would also have spoken latin/greek, so language usage amongst a very elitist group (who to this day, might well be snobby about people if they aren't bilingual at least; it's still a requirement for many jobs in the EU iirc) isn't a great indicator. There's quite a history of British nobility being very snobbish about the English language (with Saxon roots etc), and many of the British royalty wouldn't speak it at their own court, so it's partly down to a certain perception of the language (which in places, it still sort of has -- it's just now dirty peasants have been replaced by annoying tourists, and it certainly isn't considered a romantic language the way that French is).

The English language was very widespread beforehand (examples being that the British pioneered telegraphs, and spread them due to the Empire, meaning mostly they were operated in English, as well as spreading the language through Radio, Film, later Television, and of course, having a monumentally vast empire with a huge bureaucracy which encouraged people from all around the globe to learn English as an opporunity for progression). 

It's also important to note that what you're seeing as the Rise of English (coinciding with America coming to prominence as a world power) also coincides with a drastic drop in French influence, which might explain the growing prominence of English (due to the falling away of competition), better than the rise of America (which is essentially replacing one English-speaking superpower with another). I'm not denying the huge spread of American culture in promoting the English language, but it's more a continuation of a phenomena that was already occurring, aided by the collapse of Imperial France, than something that promptly happens after the war solely due to American films etc.",,,2,0,0,t5_2qqjc,t3_2ueyxc,2,1424262164,1422846809,Soulsiren,todayilearned,False

I like the uniqueness of travelling to/from the UK, since it can be a challenge to change everything around in the middle of a haul. I like the variety of roadways and scenery as you travel from the south of the UK up to the north past Glasgow, or from Italy up to the Netherlands.

That aside, leveling up and choosing where to put skill points adds enough dynamic to the game that it adds motivation. Like getting paid for long hauls? Go into the long haul skill tree and take extremely long road trips. You can sleep at hotels or rest stops along the way. Want to get paid more to haul oversized cargo like diggers and other construction equipment, meaning that the going may be slower but precision in tight spots can be the challenge, then go for it.

You can buy a garage in several of the cities in the game, and hire your own drivers. As you train them, they improve and bring in more money for your company. You can take out bank loans to help get you started. I opted to not take out a loan, and worked as a driver for hire until I could afford my own garage. Now that I've upgraded my truck a ton I am saving up for a second so I can hire and start training drivers.

This game does have a surprising amount of depth, which I really didn't expect. I drive with a G27 steering wheel with an h-shifter and clutch. Manually shifting up to gear 8 just to get enough speed to be going the limit while the force-feedback is kicking in because I'm hauling 24 tons of cargo... yeah, to me that's a blast.

And those payments can be a real jerk - hundreds of dollars eaten up in each paycheque you could be putting towards things like trips, downpayments for things you want, or just fun. Lots of interest accrued.

But people have a point - travelling to a new place can be exhilarating and rewarding. It's great to experience new cultures and new locations. It's difficult to take a really extensive trip - particularly to coordinate it with friends - when you're older and more settled.

But you're right to be concerned about the economy and about jobs. If the economy really tanks it who knows what will happen to that offer? Or how easy it would be to get another offer if that trail dries up.

My best advice would be to budget wisely. 5k's a lot. See if you can't use cheap airlines in europe like RyanAir or investigate how to get the best rail prices. See when/where you can get into attractions or do activities for free. Don't spend every night at the bar - you can easily buy some beer and split it with some new friends at a hostel or drink a bottle of wine in a piazza. Visit cheaper places - they can be just as spectacular as expensive cities like London. See if you can hook up with friends, relatives, or friends or relatives of friends. They often know cities best - how to get around, where to eat, where to stay - and could possibly even allow you to stay with them.

I would try and set yourself a more lower limit and try to budget to see how you could still make that work with an amazing trip. Even 4k would be great.

You could also try to ramp up your savings so you can put down on your debt and make student loans. If you have a job where you can pick up an extra shift a week put that money into your vacation budget. If you don't you could try cutting back on an expense. Drinking one fewer beer when you go out or downgrading your cell phone plan. Or you could try picking up some odd tasks - like tutoring or by selling textbooks or shovelling driveways or fixing cellphones or whatever else you need to. If you drive to school try taking transit or, when the weather is nicer, walking or biking if it's close enough. 

You might feel better about taking that trip if you can home and were able to slam down 2-3k on that debt of yours. ",,,2,0,0,t5_2qn40,t3_2uf8vf,2,1424261798,False,thencaapawardgoesto,Calgary,False

LGB have actually enjoyed a pretty decent run with their new roster. Making it through to the FACEIT 2015 season through the Qualifiers,beating teams like No Problem! HellRaisers and mousesports to get there, as well as reaching the Round of 16 in the 1st Katowice EU Pre-Qualifier, falling to the webSPELL lineup (ALEX, MAIDHEN, mistou, META, XTQZZZ) My main concern for this team is that they dont become stale and un-motivated like the old London Conspiracy roster, as they are full of talented players and un-doubtedly the best all-Norwegian team. (still a bit cut they couldnt find room for cENTRYZ but whatever.) However they are still pretty inconsistent, as the old LC were also.

**ROAD TO THE SEMI'S**

QF: LGB eSports 16-5 KPS (Swedish Mix, who beat Exgaming (Check6), who in turn beat MyKPV)

RO16: LGB eSports 16-7 #HSE (Danish team, no notable names.)

RO32: LGB eSports 16-7 Temp.no (Norwegian team, Id say 5th best?)

---------

**Please note: We dont have a confirmed lineup for AGENT, they have more than 5 on their IOS Pantamera roster, and they are classified as a mix for this tournament, their roster has players like BENDJI on it, will try and get in contact with ultra.**

**AGENT:** Last seen scaring the living daylights out of GPlay in the FACEIT Qualifiers in the RO16 stage, forcing the Bulgarians to come back from a heavy deficit to take the game in overtime. AGENT is a team of players who are relatively unknown to the masses apart from ultra. He was the IGL and captain of Xapso (cadiaN, aizy, ultra, robiin, centeks), who blitzed the BYOC qualifiers of DHW 2013, knocking out my babes Vox Eminor in the Round of 8 :'(. In the main draw they got comfortably beaten by Clan Mystik (apEX, KQLY, kioShiMa, HaRts, ioRek) before overcoming mousesports (chrisJ, tiziaN, crisby, LEGIJA, gob b) in overtime to finish 9th-12th following a sudden-death loss to LGB (olofm, KRiMZ, Maikelele, dennis, SKYTTEN) There is limited information about the other 4 on an individual level. They made it to the RO16 in both FACEIT 2015 Qualifiers. Got knocked out in the RO 128 of the first ESL Qualifier to winneR 12-16 (robs3n, TONI, oskar, tahsiN, am0) Currently 6-0 in their ESL 2015 Open League, with wins over the Finnish myRevenge and the other unknown team in this Qualifier, ElSenor.

**ROAD TO THE SEMI'S**

RO8: AGENT 16-2 ALLCAPS (makkeP, Kallberg, lunedi, meve, magella. ALLCAPS knocked out both ESC and 3DMAX, don't ask me how.)

RO16: AGENT 16-11 MyKPV #2 (threeman, jenson, SolEk, xall, j0hnny )

RO32: AGENT 16-5 Team nLB (Swedish Mix)

----

**Summary:** There is no doubt that LGB is the stronger roster here, and we currently don't know the make-up of AGENT's roster (could be ultra, BENDJI, Cyph, Fedjke, feddan for all we know.) LGB should take this one out, especially in a BO3, but they are fresh off a roster change and inter-country matches tend to be closer/ better upset-material than most due to the intricate knowledge of the players in your own country. (LC vs partyastronauts anyone?) With that being said, LGB will take this, but don't be surprised if AGENT take a map.

No, I don't believe the punishment should be light because there were no official rules, and I fully agreed with the indefinite ban handed out to iBP by Valve (because it was just iBP at the time). However, now we're starting to see evidence of other teams throwing. Banning all the pro's indefinitely could do more harm than good though. 

Wiping out half the pro scene would spell doom for CS:GO. iBP was NA's top team and the banning of four of its best players, set us back months, maybe year(s) on a international level. It will be a long time before we're able to compete with EU's top teams on a consistent basis again. What do you think the removal of players from teams like LDLC, Titan, mouz, VP, Penta would do? We'd be seeing T2 and T3 teams, who have a lack of skill and knowledge, at the majors. No one wants to see that. It would effectively kill CS:GO as a competitive e-sport setting it back months or years, not only in NA, but in the EU as well.

* Ukrainian president elected, promptly loots country and family becomes billionaires, making Ukrainians even unhappier with their already terrible and corrupt government. Ukraine has less natural resources and even more corruption than Russia so they are understandably unhappy.
* Ukrainian government spends a few years negotiating association agreement with EU. It technically could one day could be a step towards to EU membership, although so many things would have to be changed between now and then so it is unlikely. 
* Russia attempts to encourage Ukraine to choose to sign agreement with Russia instead 
* So small tug-of-war between Russia and West. Not a huge deal in and of itself, but it is symbolic.
* Most business elites in Ukraine choose the EU side, citing fears over being further incorporated into the Russian economy, and therefore losing their assets to Russian business elites
* Russia makes a deal with corrupt Ukrainian president - don't sign upcoming deal with EU, sign with Russia. In return get 15 billion USD. Deal also reported to have included Russian support in ~~cheating in~~ winning upcoming elections. EU also makes offers, but nothing as attractive to Ukrainian president, so he announces that he's changed his mind about EU deal.
* Some people in Kiev march in protest. 
* Ukrainian security forces use violence against marchers. Now a lot more people are angry, come out to protest against larger grievances.
* March spreads in part due to effective civil society types. A small number of them  are effective due to training in how to be effective community organizers from US or EU (not five billion worth of training as sometimes reported by Russian sources, but some small tens of millions worth).
* Some Ukrainian business elite who control the media support protesters, not government (this is important in spread and keeping protests going)
* Protests bigger and bigger. Finally, Ukrainian president sends in security forces to crack down.  Depending on whom you ask they did this on their own or following Russian advice and independently or with Russian special forces present. Violence ensues. Extremist groups disproportionately represented among the protest side of fighters.  Depending on whom you ask they just fought back or shot people themselves to encourage violence.
* Outside politicians intervene. Negotiate deal in which Ukrainian president stays president for now, upcoming elections will change things.
* Protesters unwilling to wait months for elections and change. Some start taking over buildings. Ukrainian president panics and runs, eventually fleeing to Russia. 
* ~~Protesters~~ Members of parliament that backed protesters in conjunctions with MPs from the Party of Regions (party that was in power) form new government, including many existing political parties and actors. If you support the Kiev government, you will say that the old president abandoned his position when he fled, so it became vacant, and it was proper procedure to appoint a new acting president pending new elections. If you support the Moscow narrative, you will say that protesters drove the real president out, so the new government is illegitimate.
* Faced with a new government in Kiev that is newly polarized and quite hostile to Russia, and faced with a successful protest able to encourage unhappy Russians at a time when large protests were in the recent past and economic problems predicted for the near future, the Russian government decides to cause some trouble in E. Ukraine to destabilize the new country. 
* Russian government first moves into Crimea using disguised soldiers termed greenmen. Crimea is majority Russian, and belonged to Russia until 1957 when Khruschev moved it to Ukraine as an administrative move within the USSR as a power play to reorganize rivals and to make the Ukrainian budget, and not Russian budget, pay for expensive ongoing WWII reconstruction. Many people there are happy to see Russia there, although the minority Tatars are very unhappy (they are still mad about the Soviet mass deportations and oppressions. Also, they were there before Russia so are touchy about that. They were right to be concerned - they have had problems since Russia took Crimea).
* Crimea under Russian controls holds highly-flawed referendum allowing voters to choose between becoming Russian or staying under Russian control but officially not joining the country.  Many Tatars prevented from voting. Reported turnout and results improbable. But it is plausible that a majority of people in Crimea would choose to join Russia. 
* Crimea joins Russia. But there is a bit of a problem. It happened too smoothly – not enough destabilization.
* Russian media gears up narrative campaign taking advantage of real existing tensions between Western Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine. In E. Ukraine many people speak Russian, are Russian or are pretty Russified. Media says that new government is really fascist, wants to kills Russians, etc.
* Russian actors enter E. Ukraine, led by the famous Strelkov (real name Igor Girkin). Depending on whom you ask he is a former Russian agent or still is a Russian agent.  They take over important buildings, communications, TV towers etc, and start setting up an independence movement in E. Ukraine. Supplies come in from Russia. It is supposed to look local, but in areas where Strelkov and his men are not, not much happens outside of some protests. 
* Tensions keep growing. In Odessa (outside of area controlled by Strelkov-type peoples), two protest groups clash and the pro-Ukraine ends up outside of a building where pro-separatist/pro-Russian people are holed up. The building is set on fire and 42 people in the building die. Six more people from both sides died that die in fighting on the street.  
* The deaths of so many people is used by the pro-separatist/pro-Russian side as proof that the Ukrainians are fascist and murderers who must be fought. 
* Real fighting begins. The Ukrainian military starts off doing OK, slowly regaining territory. Strelkov even flees back to Russia.  The local people who show up to fight, with just some Russian support, can not resist Ukraine 
* Russia sends in more military
* MH17 shot down. The verified evidence suggests that it was shot down by mistake by a separatist or even possibly a Russian military BUK supplied from Russia. Many Europeans were on the plane, especially Dutch people. This is important as it angered people in countries where passengers lived, it convinced many Western leaders that Russia is not in full control of the situation and increased Western interest in pressuring Russia to stop its actions in Ukraine.  (In a side note, Dutch locals’ anger drove Putin’s daughter and her Dutch partner to leave their home in the Netherlands). 
* Fighting continues. Russia, particularly a few big companies, feel the effects of sanctions restricting their access to loans and capital abroad. Up until now they mostly relied on Western European capital markets. This is bad for the economy, but not catastrophic.
* Saudi Arabia increases production and significantly lowers the oil price as a result. The main reason for doing this was to prevent US and other countries that were increasing their own oil production using more expensive methods to reach a point where they didn’t need Saudi Arabia any more. Saudi also likes the idea of hurting Russia and Iran, as they support Assad in Syria and Hezbollah and Saudi hates those guys (and is worried about their own angry Shiites at home).   The fact that the US is so unhappy with Russia right now meant that Saudi could lower prices and cause problems for US domestic oil producers without the US complaining too much, as the pressure the lower prices put on Russia cancelled it out (in US eyes)
* The economy in Russia gets much worse. Putin responds by cutting businessmen and technocrats out of his inner circle – he listens primarily to security types now. 
* State-dominated Russian media continues to focus on narrative of how problems are due to West, especially US, and that US wants to destroy Russia. 
* Ukrainian media tries to match Russian media efforts sending out their preferred narrative, but isn't nearly as good at it.
* The security types may be advising a resolution in E. Ukraine. There has been a buildup of troops on the Russian border, fighting is significantly increased in E. Ukraine itself, reports of Russian troops and equipment sighted in E. Ukraine are up and there have been attacks outside of the immediately contested region, particularly on Mariupol.

- That Norwegian media is biased in the coverage of the conflicts? That was not my point? Although there are independent evaluations of NrK's coverage that concludes that in fact has been biased. 

- That Norwegian media is antisemitic? That was not my claim either, although some (very hot topic these days) caricaturists are dancing on a very fine line using classic racial stereotypes when depicting Jews/Israel - ironically, the most active of these refuse to draw Muhammed, because there are lines one should not cross - right? 

- that antisemitic views get coverage in Norwegian media? Not really my point either, even though Gaarder-gate (or the Trond Andersen-case) show that some media outlets lack the necessary editorial oversight - or that they don't mind views like that being published.

So what was my point you ask? My point was that the popular claim that ""Jews"" or ""friends of Israel"" reference holocaust all the time in debates related to (or not related to) Israel is not something that I see in Norwegian media at all, and that the claim about the claim is far more prevalent - as you could see in both Andersen's and Gaarder's cases.

Furthermore, you seem to think that the evidence of a high prevalence of antisemitism in Norway and Europe acompletely unproblematic - trivializing the fact that double digit percentages in Norway hold very problematic beliefs and have very problematic prejudices. The fact that you trivialize these findings make me very skeptical.

The Ottoman Empire was largely seen as a occupying force by Greek people, and everyone else on mainland Europe.

A historical conflict is between Macedonia and Greece too, but that's not relevant to this story, but I put it there so you'd understand how far back this goes. 

What the Ottoman's installed in every country in the balkans was a culture of corruption, distrust of governmental authority. Laws were installed by what was a Sultan of different religion and foreign to them. Official laws did not mean much. It goes back to when Greece was occupied. People had no regard for the Sultan and the government that was seen as occupying Greece. People in authority were put there and they were corrupt as fuck. If you haven't visited the region then you don't really understand what the political culture is like, but it's very broken, and all countries have not yet recovered from that period.

The people weren't blaming turkish people, but trying to explain to you that the cultural aspect of this goes back to Ottoman occupation.

A more concrete example of political-cultural differences is Romania. Transilvania was part of the Habsburg Empire, and Moldavia and Wallahia were part of the Ottoman Empire.

Their debt isn't sustainable. This means they will need to take more loans to refinance it. From the EFSF because there is literally no one else that is willing to lend them anything. This means the european taxpayer will keep paying (while austerity keeps their economy stagnant) with the hopes that the debt will be repaid at some indeterminate point in the future. However each time a new loan is received the actual debt repayment will be pushed further in the future, and the sum will keep increasing. The inevitable final act of this nonsense will be a default that may ultimately threaten the global economy, and will either way mean that the european taxpayer will lose a lot of money.

Or the debt could be restructured (with the additional consequence of leaving enough room for expansionary policy) in order for it to become sustainable, so that the remainder may eventually be repaid.

The US invaded Canada!  Sorry to harp on about that! You may be embarrassed about it now, but to Canadians it's immensely important and is a huge part of their national identity.

&gt;the goal of annexing Canada was a 'while we're at it' thing

Manifest destiny... while we're at it... same thing really!

&gt;ie. One out of three-ish war goals, along with Britain paying reparations, we won.

Britain got all its war goals. Defence of Canada, Impressment (and victory against Napoleon of course), agreement to respect Native American territories.  

[What reparations?!](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ghent.asp)

http://www.pbs.org/wned/war-of-1812/essays/treaty-ghent/

&gt;James Madison had an opportunity to end the War of 1812 almost as soon as it began. The British had repealed the Orders in Council – rules that curbed American trade with Europe – and thus one of Madison’s major reasons for war was now moot.  If the British had foregone the right to impress American sailors, Madison could well have gone back to Congress with the suggestion that hostilities cease immediately.  However, the British considered impressment their right by custom, and believed it essential to their naval might. And so James Madison took his country to war.

Seems pretty clear.  The main reason for the war was never even brought up in the treaty which ended it.  The invaders gained no territory.  At least a draw, at most a British/Canadian victory.  Anything else is major back-pedalling spin.

&gt;Adams and his team had one goal – restore things to the way they were before the war, the status quo ante bellum.  

Well that definitely seems like the negotiating position of the victors in a war they declared!

The best you can say for the US is that the British wanted Native American territory respected.  It was agreed in the Treaty, but the US ultimately ignored the treaty.  How proud you must be! USA! USA!",,,1,0,0,t5_2s7tt,t3_2uf9fk,1,1424259120,1422861442,chochazel,AdviceAnimals,False

Eurocrats are not anti-Keynesian, but they are against unsustainable govermeant spending. In the case of Greece the initial problem was that they had inflated their economy by overlarge government spending financed by large deficits which were largely hidden from the EU and the markets. The fact of the matter is that there is no going back for the Greek state, the only way Greece can start to grow is by export driven growth where growth of the private sector generated new tax revenue will eventually lead into growth of public sector spending.

You are in France technically as a ""tourist"". You are very lucky because most people would have to get a local job where french visas and work credentials would be required. I'm glad you are making the most of the opportunity.

2. A safe bet would be to leave the Schengen zone every 3 months (take the Eurostar to London for the weekend for example). Travelling between Schengen countries won't do anything for you because they don't keep track/you don't go through passport control so for all they know you never left France.

3. Technically you need a carte de séjour for things like apartments, work, etc. But I think with some research and friends of friends you can find a place that someone will rent to you a spare room or something for cash without much issue, not saying it will be cheap though.

4. France has very bad unemployment and preferential treatment for French/EEA citizens to get jobs over outsiders. A company would need to sponsor you and show that you are more qualified than your French counterpart, etc. But you don't have to worry about that.

5. There are expat resources but I do not know them off the top of my head.

6. That is way more money than 99% of people trying to do what you are doing would come with, so you will be fine.

7. Another option for a visa would be a student visa if you were enrolled at Alliance Francaise for example to learn French. But you would not be allowed to 'work' in France, you just wouldn't have to be peacing out every few months to reset the clock.

I had a similar sensation when I tried writing my first novel at sixteen. My solution was rather costly, and not solely to solve this problem: I went out seeking experiences. I travelled to Belize for a month visiting Sustainable Development charities, examined the difference between sustainable and non- logging companies. I then went to live with some Shaolin Monks in China for four months, and straight after that did a tour of Europe, visiting 28 countries in under two months.

Writing came a lot easier after that, though to me it looked transparent; far too strongly based on my recent experiences. Then life got in the way and I didn't write for a few years as I got a Masters Degree.

Now that I've given those experiences a few years to mellow and ferment, I'm a lot more comfortable wielding them in my writing, and it comes a lot faster to me than ever before.

I'm not suggesting you do what I did; spending (or wasting) thousands of pounds acquiring experience as quickly as possible, but there's nothing to stop you going the extra few feet to add experience and intrigue to your day-to-day life.

&gt;Muslim Americans are overwhelmingly satisfied with the way things are going in their lives (82%) and continue to rate their communities very positively as places to live (79% excellent or good).

--

&gt;Nearly half of Muslim Americans (48%) say that Muslim leaders in the United States have not done enough to speak out against Islamic extremists

As you need access to the individual batteries near the charger (for the over-voltage diodes), I would screw those 5 (10x for 12V) single battery-holders to the panel, and use a [10-cell battery-holder](http://www.budgetronics.eu/index.php?action=page&amp;group_id=21) near the LEDs.      
For 6V, you can use 5 paperclips/metal-screws to replace 5 batteries for the time being.       
 
&gt;Veroboards are ordered another 3 weeks to wait :(       

Gives you an extra 3 weeks to study :)       
As you need to figure out what's happening, build the LED-systems with a Schottky and current-limiting resistor per LED-string:     
2xblue/white(1W) + diode + resistor,     
3xred(1W) +diode + resistor, or     
1xblue + 1xred + resistor + (various)diodes(check the datasheets for 'study').     
      
Those resistors make it easy to measure the voltage over them, and using Ohms Law, calculate the current through each string.      
Connecting two [2R resistors](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/1-4w-Watt-0-25W-2-R-Ohm-Metal-Film-R-Resistor-100-Pcs-DUK-/381094958694?pt=UK_BOI_Electrical_Components_Supplies_ET&amp;hash=item58bb079666) in parallel gives 1R, if you measure 150mV over that, it translates into 150mA through the LED.      
(and current limiting resistors don't hurt the safety of the LEDs).     
(You could build 1-2R from you existing supply).     

&gt;That's 6 hours use before recharge?       

That is a nice 'homework' question :)     
Your battery-set has a (variable) voltage and a (questionable) capacity in mAh.      
The current(mA) you draw from it decides the duration(hr), and that current depends on the 'Vf' of LED/(Schottky)-diodes and resistor value (per LED-string) and how many strings you use.

That is correct, the balance of power has shifted. When the crisis broke, Greece was in a strong position because it could have upset the EZone:

- a straight default would have triggered an international banking crisis which would have spread into the real economy;

- other crisis states would have gone down too in a domino effect;

- in the worst case scenario, the EZone could have collapsed.

Today, 

- the crisis has been contained;

- foreign banks have pulled out off Greece, in the worst case scenario, the Greek banking sector will collapse;

- the rescue funds have been build to deal with any national crisis situation;

- there is no more domino effect;

The result is that the markets have hardly given any notice to the Zyriza win. Most European stock exchanges (except Athens) are up. 

Therefore, Greece has lost the ability to threaten to upset the EZone; it could even exit.

And yet the EZ somehow forced them to take help... right.

Chiar cand a fost in alpha l-am cumparat si in primele momente a fost un joc exceptional. Era ceva nou pe toata piata jocurilor (majoritatea nu jucau mod dayz ca era extraordinar de buggy) si chiar o picat foarte bine consumatorilor. Am jucat impreuna cu prietenii mei si pot sa zic ca ne-a tinut some time + ca nu era pay to win deloc. Au futut tot meciul cand au inceput sa adauge micro-tranzactiile si a devenit pay to win. Pe langa asta, au aparut si A MASSIVE SHITLOAD of hackers si abia puteai sa faci ceva. In fine, fuck it. A aparut DayZ standalone si nu cred ca am dormit 3 nopti la rand la cat de excited am fost sa-l joc. Pe langa faptul ca are probleme cu grafica(am pc bun si abia scot 20 fps) e si plin de glitches. Ce ma frustreaza pe mine la DayZ e ca stai cateva zile sa iti cauti gear si sa te echipezi si dupa te omoara un team de 7-8 si iarasi trebuie sa incepi de la 0. DayZ standalone am crezut ca va fi ceva mai fain, dar mi se pare ca de cand a aparut nu am gasit absolut niciun improvement, same shit.  Eu unul nu am de gand sa mai dau iarasi 20 de E pe un early acces si sa fie un massive crap plin de cheaters si pay to win. Avand in vedere faptul ca o sa fie free to play mai mult ca sigur trebuie sa bagi bani in joc ca sa fie cat de cat fair.

TL;DR am jucat Rust, WarZ, DayZ standalone si nu is cine stie ce. Nu am sa cumpar jocul asta si nu o sa-l joc pentru simplul fapt ca e free 2 play si o sa trebuiasca sa bagi un shitload of money ca sa ai avantaje and so on.",,,1,0,0,t5_2qm35,t3_2uf1hj,1,1424258016,False,grddd,Romania,False

I wouldn't be surprised if there would be a loophole in the contract of Paks 2 (which isn't public) that would allow Russians to manipulate the terms as they see fit. Orbán also made sure that we're dependent on Russian gas more than before. Russia can go ""Veto, or freeze to death"" if it wants to. (The part about using gas as a leverage is speculation from my side, though, and I'm in a pessimist mood.)


Not to mention that the government took over the 2nd biggest national TV channel, TV2, and uses it for propaganda purposes. In the meanwhile, they put shitloads of tax burden on the biggest TV channel, RTL, for criticizing Fidesz. 


Fidesz is so kind, they are always eager to help poor families. Especially when it's time to vote. A sack of potato here, a glass of ""fröccs"", or a pack of cigarettes there, maybe some firewood, and they have a significant voter-base.


They're also taking advantage of the fall of the socialist party. It's nearly impossible for an opposition to rise, because Fidesz can easily turn them into a public enemy using pro-Fidesz newspapers and TV channels. Watered down version of 1984. Manipulating with half truths or straight up lies. Sometimes the public enemy is Gyurcsány, sometimes online journalists, sometimes other Fidesz polticians who fell out of line. Just tell an average János or average Juli that Gyurcsány is behind the opposition, and they will offer free rimjobs to Orbán/Vona.


Ohh, did I mention that Gábor Vona's collection of retards, called Jobbik, is currently the strongest opposition? It's not a coincidence. Fidesz kinda helped them ""rise"". Heroizing pro-Fidesz and pro-Jobbik protesters who fucked shit up in Budapest back in 2006 was their work. Now Fidesz can use Jobbik as a way to deter the people from the opposition. Can't wait until Fidesz starts losing another few thousand voters. I can guarantee some ""Jobbik is nazi/racist/xenophobic/pro-terrorism"" stuff in the media. What's even more sad is that that would be the first time they tell the truth.


Btw, Jobbik and Fidesz, hand in hand, turned ""liberal"" into a swear-word. Synonyms in their dictionary: Jews, gypsys, EU-fags, EU itself, Americans, zionists, lizardmen.


So no, apart from distancing Hungary from the EU and going closer (indebting us) to Russia, mass manipulation by media, using the public's hate against the socialists, shifting blame to Gyurcsány, killing viable options of opposition before they were even made, ""bribing"" voters, trying to bring down freedom of speech, ""artificially"" creating an unappealing (to people who actually think.) opposition and lifting it up, while destroying the political ideology of the liberal opposition, no, they haven't done anything to prevent us from saving ourselves.",EURO,,9,0,0,t5_2qh4j,t3_2ugenx,9,1424257971,False,SnobbyEuropean,europe,False

Which not many Americans will know but European football (soccer) supporters older then 30 will definitly remember.

The Heysel Stadium disaster is one of the biggest accidents is football history where 39 people where trampled to death and 600 others where seriously injured. 

He said seeing those people being crushed and the all over feeling of claustrophobia and not being able to breath in an ocean of panicking bodies was terrible. It's 30 years later and he still does not go in big crowds.

I'd rather have a overvalued currency than paying for greece,  then getting shit for paying and having to be called a nazi for having an opinion.   
we are the US of europe. countries are dependend on our aid or the fact that the eurozone also benefits off of us but when we ask for guidelines which were connected to that aid to be held up we are the evil nazis again.

First of the Baltic countries do in all honesty close to jack-shit for their own defence and rely on the rest of us to protect them. Sure they're small countries but that's no damn excuse. Or let me rephrase that, Lithuania and Latvia are doing a complete shit job. Estonia with its small size does it best and has a conscription army which should be the bare minimum. Every able man should in these countries have mandatory military training.

Calling Sweden the weak link when they have 62 of [these](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Swedish_JAS-39_Gripen_landing.jpg/1599px-Swedish_JAS-39_Gripen_landing.jpg) while Latvia has **4** of [these](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/An-2_on_skis.jpg) is just stupid and plain disrespectful in the broader sense of things.

Swedens defence capabilities might suck compared to Finland but it's still far away from being the weak link when the Baltic nations are concerned.

Riding on NATO does not excuse your own responsibility for your security.

That's a fact from BBC, The finance minister refuses to work with EC, ECB and IMF.

Varoufakis refused to work with the troika (where are the quotation marks this time btw?). He is **saying** he would talk to individual organizations and EU member states.

Which are the individual organizations? Well, they are not the ECB and IMF, the article dismissed them before. He'll talk to individual EU member states. Yeah it makes sense, since he doesn't accept talking to EC either.

There are two possible ways to interpret that:

A) Varoufakis refuses to negotiate with EC/IMF/ECB though he is saying he will.

B) Varoufakis refuses to negotiate with EC?/IMF/ECB but he will negotiate with separate member states and various organizations.

A democracia é o governo onde o povo governa, no nosso caso, por meio de seus líderes eleitos. Só que, quem vigia os vigias? Eu já debati isso em outra postagem lá no /r/brasil e me chamaram de teórico da conspiração maluco.

Porque é preciso haver alguma garantia de levante popular caso o governo se volte contra a própria população. Isso é básico.

O que você quer dizer é que quer fazer os políticos terem um 'cagaço' e dessa forma eles vão trabalhar direito pra acalmarem as pessoas.

It is one of the few Old English names to gain popularity in other parts of Europe and beyond for example, as Eduardo and [Duarte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duarte_(disambiguation\)) in Spain and Portugal respectively.

1. Yup. That's pretty much my fear. Everyone tells me that I'm smart and I'll get a job, but I'm willing to bet that's what everyone told UVA friend, too. 

2. Should have mentioned that I may be able to get it down to 10-15k by the end of this summer with the internship I have now, but yeah. I hadn't thought at all about fees and stuff in making transfers. My parents would definitely be down to help me with the logistics of this, though. Could I keep an account open in the U.S. with money set aside for payments? Or is there another way to work it so I don't lose money in the transfers?

3. They live in a small city a few UBahn stops from a big university town, so there are lots of cafés and restaurants and a bunch of big shopping centers.

4. Do you really think I'd need an intensive course on top of living with grandparents who speak no English and working? I guess it wouldn't hurt, and to be honest, my dad would probably be willing to pay for it while I pay off my loans. 

Grad school is definitely something I see myself doing eventually, but I wanted to wait a few years to a) figure out what I want to do with my life, b) learn better German in case I want to study there, and c) qualify for the EU resident tuition rate in case I want to study in the UK. 

The latter would take 3 years, though, and I'm not sure if I could mentally handle 2 years of work that I probably won't love/feeling unproductive in general before even applying to school.

I think they could.

We already have a framework for at least trying to limit the amount of damage the national governments can do. 

I think it's silly to ask Germany and other strong economies to voluntarily weaken themselves for the advantage of others. This will in the end just result in an overall decrease in economic output in the Euro zone.

Mobility of work is one thing to improve the situation, the other would be to better the condition of every European who ends up suffering, providing the most basic needs and ensure access to education. 

The required moneys is taken from the EU budget and split by all countries according to their current economic power.  Since poor people spend the money they have this would also be a stimulus for the local economies, one that actually reaches the people it's meant to reach and not fall into bottomless state budgets.

I'm not sure whether people know how TTIP is being negotiated on this side of the pond, either, and perhaps people are under the impression that ISDS is only in there because of the U.S. 

The negotiating mandate for TTIP, which the EU Commission is working under, was set by the national government's of the member states. That mandate includes ISDS, because the member states wanted it included. The Commission appears to have its own views, but it cannot change the negotiating mandate - it has certainly been cautious with ISDS, suggesting a set of reforms to existing standards, only using ISDS as a last resort, and recently putting ISDS negotiations on hold following the public consultation which showed major public antipathy to it.

But what it cannot do without the agreement of the member states is to drop ISDS from TTIP because - let me highlight the point again - *the member States wanted it in there*.

&gt; The terrorist threat in the EU remains acute and diverse. The largest proportion of terrorist attacks in the EU was related to separatist groups, although the number significantly decreased in 2013 compared to previous years. Most separatist incidents, however, were small-scale. The majority of EU Member States continue to consider religiously inspired terrorism as a major threat, as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of arrests. Two attacks and several disrupted plots in 2013 illustrate this threat. Al- Qaeda and like-minded terrorist groups abroad continued to encourage self-organised attacks within the EU aiming for indiscriminate casualties. With regard to left-wing and anarchist terrorism, the number of attacks and arrests increased compared to previous years. Right-wing extremists may exhibit violent and intimidating behaviour, but do not generally employ terrorist modi operandi. An exception to this rule in 2013 was a series of four attacks in the UK carried out by one individual. Tactics employed by terrorists of all affiliations differ in their levels of sophistication. New tactics continue to be observed in attempted, completed or foiled attacks.
&gt;
&gt;EU citizens continue to travel to conflict zones to receive training in combat techniques and to engage in armed struggle. The numbers of EU citizens travelling to Syria in particular, including those intending to fight alongside al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, were already substantial and rising, and increased significantly in 2013. It seems likely that Syria will remain the destination of choice for prospective fighters departing from EU Member States, as long as the civil war there continues. In the wake of the Syrian conflict, the threat to the EU is likely to increase exponentially. European fighters, who travel to conflict zones, are assessed as posing an increased threat to all EU Member States on their return. They may seek to set up logistical, financial or recruitment cells, and may act as role models to individuals within extremist communities – further enhancing their capacity to encourage others to travel. In addition, their resolve is likely to have strengthened in the conflict zones, and they may have gained the skills and contacts to carry out attacks in the EU.
&gt;
&gt;Developments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region increase risks in the EU and for EU interests elsewhere. Western nationals and interests continue to be at risk in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, where there are high levels of terrorist activity. Kidnapping for ransom is a particular risk. The Arab revolutions, which started in Tunisia in late 2010, have facilitated a consolidation of operational capacities and support bases of terrorist groups that are involved in regional conflicts. Groups motivated by ideologies identical or similar to that of al-Qaeda continue to have a significant impact on the security situation in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. In addition, al-Qaeda affiliates have gained a stronghold in Syria through their involvement in the civil war, which also affects neighbouring countries and other states in the Middle East. This development strengthens the position of these groups, providing safe havens and a range of opportunities, including training and fundraising, with a consequential increased risk for the EU.

They also seem to be worried about ""right-wing"" terrorism a lot in the report (based on a quick skimming). Which I assume means something different in Europe than in America.",,,2,0,0,t5_2tt3p,t3_2ui8ho,2,1424255809,False,chalbersma,unfilter,False

Apres 6 plans d'austérité en Grece qui ont ruiné le pays sur tous les plans, il faudrait tout d'abord que cette Europe se remette en question, que ce soit sur les choix socio-économiques et du but recherché.

Fully dressed salmon flies like the Jock Scott, how much are they *really* designed for actual fishing?  I mean, why go through the time to tie [this](http://www.bestclassicsalmonflies.com/brian_ebert_jock_scott.jpg) when you could just tie something like [this](http://english-fly-fishing-flies.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/silver-wilkinson-salmon-fly-pattern.jpg) for a fraction of the cost/time/materials?  If I were throwing a Jock Scott out there, how long could I reasonably expect it to last?  Once a salmon attacks it, what's left?  Doesn't it just destroy the wing?

I dabbled with a few traditional wets yesterday, and it was really interesting, and lord knows I **fully** understand that the whole process is about tying nice flies, otherwise I wouldn't tie something like [this](http://www.riverbum.com/images/products/big/Frog-Swimming-Yellow-Belly-Side.jpg) and would instead throw something like [this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xjkKaEQj1nQ/maxresdefault.jpg).  But the Jock Scott just looks like a whole other beast that requires insane amounts of patience.

Especially since we are talking a consequence that can be EXTREMELY easily treated. We are talking blood analysis to identify cause, and popping some pills to make sure the immune system is in check.

Even if depression is not the cause hyper and hypothyroidism has a shitload of minor side effects that lower the quality of life.

In fact the two main arguments for TTIP proposed by the European Commission are the following:

1. &gt;Cutting unnecessary red tape

 I am very, very suspicious of this. Usually it means reducing regulatory standards without a specific parliamentary vote on it. In other words minimising democratic accountability. That's why I'd like some clear examples.

2. &gt;closer cooperation with the US would make our regulation more effective.
Regulators that work together can learn from each other’s ideas and reduce costs by reducing
the number of inspections they have to perform

 A great fucking goal, European Comission. More effective regulation with US help (!!), learning from US regulatory ideas (!!) and outsource some of the inspections to save costs. Absolutely wonderful.

I can carry just about anywhere here in Pennsylvania. This state doesn't have any kind of law regarding carry in bars, restaurants, banks, or other such places. Events are hit or miss. Sporting events and concerts are almost certainly a no-go, but not because of firearm laws, it's a matter of private property laws. Any owner can set a ""condition of entry/use"" for their property. It's like a fancy restaurant requiring a suit and tie to enter. A lot of those big events have metal detectors set up or they wand everyone entering. They don't want guns in there and most people respect that. The only places that are off limits by law for me in PA are post offices, federal buildings, and court houses.

Your experience of only hearing one side of the story is why people who are into guns flip their shit whenever they hear a European or anyone generally anti-gun make a comment about firearms. US children don't just walk around finding their parents' guns and shooting themselves. That's an unfortunate tragedy any time something like that happens, but cases like that are very few and far between. It's like someone saying *""I don't have a backyard pool of my own, but I've heard it's super dangerous because kids always fall in and drown.""* Yeah, no, it's not something that *just happens*. It's tragic, but it's a very rare occurrence.

Just like anything else that's controversial, people who are against a certain thing like to latch onto the negatives and exaggerate the hell out of them. Media of nearly any kind tends to be very liberal, and usually very* against* guns, or at least completely ignorant of any facts about the laws regarding them and their practical use. 

Of course they aren't going to loudly cheer when an old woman draws her late husband's revolver out of her purse and fends off an attacker. They aren't going to consider for even a moment that it's possible that most gun owners are actually reasonable and measured individuals who aren't looking for a fight. They don't care that statistics on gun deaths and self defense usage are horribly biased, and that ""defensive display of a firearm"" is a common self-defense use of guns, yet it's rarely ever reported, and certainly never included in statistics. 

I personally used my firearm in defense of another person inside a store. A drugged-up man was pummeling his step-son in the pharmacy section of a Walmart, and the kid was bleeding everywhere. I drew my gun and held him off while I waited for the police to arrive (which was very quick in that case, some officers were inside the store already. Not a single shot was fired, and yet I used my gun as a tool to save a person. Did a police report get filed? Yep. Was my gun mentioned? Nope. ""Bystander intervened and held attacker at bay until officer arrived."" That's it. No positive gun usage statistic numbers created, and no news report made because I didn't fire a shot. 

Statistic after statistic is used against guns and gun owners, and it's completely unreasonable. All people care about is the number of shots fired and bad things done. Nothing else is considered. Those things I mentioned above don't fit the picture the media is trying to paint about guns and gun owners. If they mention it at all it's going to be in passing and downplayed entirely.

I'm not surprised you've only heard the negatives about firearms living wherever you do. People love to create this ""cowboy"" image of gun owners, like we're all some kind of ignorant rednecks draped in American flags who just leave guns out for kids to grab whenever we're not using them to fire randomly into the air with one hand and chugging a Budweiser with the other. It's either that or the ""doomsday prepper"" image, people so paranoid and frightened of the government that we spend all day stockpiling ammo in our bunkers and waiting for the zombie apocalypse. 

In reality, most of us are just regular people, indistinguishable from any other productive member of American society. I'm an automotive painter who now works a standard 9-5 ""day job"" in an office. I carry at home, at the office, and everywhere in between. All of my very close friends carry everywhere they go. One is a parts manager at a car dealership, another is a graphic designer at a well-known college, another is a commercial pilot, and another works for a bio-medical company as a mechanical engineer working on blood centrifuges and other equipment. Between the 5 of us we have 50+ pistols, rifles, and shotguns. Guns all around, and not a single stereotypical paranoid, mentally unstable one among us. I just wish more people understood this.

ACTA, precisely as you say, was shot down because of public pressure, not because the EP had independently decided that it was a really bad idea for the European public. TTIP will hopefully likewise be shot down by public pressure, despite the EC's support of it.

&gt; They can do that without ISDS in certain circumstances as well.

Good, then we don't need a new treaty creating an additional huge future liability of this sort.

&gt; there are already more than 1400 agreements containing ISDS clauses in the EU alone, and we don't have the living standards of Burkina Faso yet

Thank you for pointing this out. Indeed we don't have the living standards of Burkina Faso, although I might argue that African nations being exposed to competition from European (and American) companies certainly didn't help them progress. But more importantly, the opening up of international trade is precisely what's allowed huge shifts of production to countries that have far lower environmental, labour and consumer protection standards, creating indeed downward pressure in Europe which has resulted in documented phenomenons like wage stagnation. There are shades of grey between Sweden and a Chinese sweatshop, but I want to see the Chinese sweatshop move towards Swedish standards rather than the other way around. Speaking, specifically, of TTIP, I'd like to see American standards in terms of labour, consumer and environmental protection move closer to European standards, rather than the other way around.


Edit: in any case, this discussion has moved to far down to be of use to anyone. The take away here is that even you admit that there are issues with ISDS' and economic pressures created by two different regulatory environments.

False,co8t39f,t3_2uice3,19th/20th Century Military History,0,1422894387,t1_co8t39f,"/u/Klugerhans points out that Europeans had fought several wars between 1815 and 1914, the most important being the Wars of German Unification. However, many historians of World War One would argue that these wars, fought more in the vein of the early Civil War battles like Gettysburg and Chancellorsville, did little to prepare Europeans for the mechanized and positional warfare of World War One. In fact, there is a historiographic school that argued that the Civil War was the only 19th century war which resembled the positional conflict of World War One. The Russo-Japanese War 1905-1906 gains an honorable mention as a 20th century conflict.  Historians along these lines argue that European war planners in France and Germany harkened back to 1871 and 1815, rather than 1864 and 1906 when they dreamed of what a new war was. They ignored the realities of the ACW and R-J War and instead envisioned the gallant cavalry charges and sweeping maneuvers of Napoleon. This is a pretty standard explanation for World War One, and Id agree with it.

But I would argue that the United States also fell into this trap. The US has historically followed European examples and studied European texts in its military academies. American soldiers invented few of their ideas, especially during the 19th century. The ACW was a major exception to this, but a short lived one. Following the ACW many veteran generals were appointed to important positions in the post-war Army, and implemented a lot of modifications which made the Army more prepared for the positional style warfare seen in 1864. However, by the 1880s those generals had largely departed their positions, and instead were replaced by generals enamoured with the Prussian style of warfare. Remember that in 1870-71, the Prussian/German army smashed the French forces, besieged Paris, and toppled the Second Empire. The American Army had previously used the French style, but the Franco-Prussian War seemed to prove that the German style army was better. So French manuals were jettisoned in favor of German, along with many of the post-war reforms. Further, the American Army was so small between 1865 and 1917 that many of the the ideas pioneered in 1864 were lost by 1917. Finally, the conflicts which America did fight really didnt teach it the new lessons of the modern battlefield. By 1917, even the French, British, and Germans had learned about trench warfare, how to fight it, and how to minimize casualties.

When the Americans went to France, they had none of these lessons, and further they were very stubborn about learning for the other Allies. They argued that the defensive tactics and careful attacks the Allies had developed prevented them from attacking decisively and vigorously. When American forces first went into combat, they took heavy losses. They too had to learn the new way of war, as had the French, the British, and the Germans.

So Id argue that your teacher is right that the Europeans didnt learn the lessons of the ACW. But then again, neither did the Americans. ",military,,2,0,0,t5_2ssp3,t3_2uice3,2,1424254503,False,BeondTheGrave,AskHistorians,False

&gt;__Han-u__ (한우 in Korean, also __Hanu__, __Hanwoo__, or __Korean native cattle__) refers to a breed of [cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle) raised in [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea), *Bos taurus coreanae*, which may be a hybrid derived from the cross-breeding of (""[Bos taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos_taurus)"") and (""[Bos indicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos_indicus)"").  Its maternal lineage is taurus (European-type) cattle. 

&gt;Its meat is a favorite in [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). Despite its high price, many Koreans prefer Han-u to cheaper imported beef as the former is regarded as fresher and of better quality. One scientific paper noted that ""Hanwoo is regarded as a premium beef because of its high palatibility and desired chewiness"".  Since Koreans consider Hanu a cultural icon and one of the top-quality beefs of the world, it is used in traditional foods, popular holiday dishes, or as a special-day gift. 

&gt;The county of [Hoengseong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoengseong) is best known for its Hanu cattle, where the environment is perfect for cattle farming. The county began a strategic marketing campaign in 1995 to brand itself as the origin of the highest quality beef in Korea.

Got any empirical backing for that, or is this just another of your statements we're meant to take on faith?

&gt;""Anti-globalist"", ""fearmongering""...do you have an argument that goes beyond labelling something with a negative word?

You were literally arguing against trade agreements and the opening up of trade opportunities due to a globalizing world. How can that be construed, if not anti-globalist?

&gt;Putting links inside of a bad argument does not magically make it good. You 'sourced' two declarations from biased parties: that's certainly a source, but still a bad argument.

Again, I disagree that the civil service is a 'biased' party, and I don't think official government documents lie to us.

Now, this is not to let the companies off the hook. Many of these pesticides are old, and were introduced in the days before proper testing. They say that experience shows they are safe, but it's not always clear the data are good enough (and who decides how good the data needs to be, anyway).

And who will pay for the test on these older chemicals that are off-patent. Say company A pays for the tests, and shows the product is safe. Then company B starts to make it, and gets the sales without paying the costs.

Same with a lot of other man-made chemicals in our environment. I read somewhere that they are 50,000. When you consider that each of these might interact with the others, you can see the testing problem is mind-boggling.

We have to make decisions based on very limited data, and it often boils down to what your attitude to risk is.

&gt;Not in a similar manner to, in the same manner.

&gt;I've made no claim that situation X is like situation Y.

Both your quotes. First the inspector's action isn't like that of the teacher/DS, then it is exactly the same.

&gt;One of the guards explicitly says (around 2.02) ""You are holding up this train"" ... implying that he (sunglasses guy) is morally blameworthy for the train delay.

Sunglasses guy knows if he's paid or not. He can end the situation immediately. Inspector doesn't know. He is required under whatever ordinance or law he's working under to make sure. He has no choice. Sunglasses guy does.

&gt;The guard is entirely morally blameworthy for using collective punishment as a means of coercion, yes.

I don't understand this. Have you taken a course in philosophy or something? He's doing what's required of him to keep his job.

&gt;""almost inciting a riot"" 

I agree that's fucked up.

&gt;Once it is clear the person is not going to give up their contact information, and not going to leave the train, then the course that avoids collective punishment is to wait until the police board the train, no matter how long that takes. In a big city that's unlikely to be too long.

I still don't understand. Do you mean let the guy stay on the train until the police arrive. Please answer yes or no, because I still don't know. You mean, allow him to stay on the train until the police arrive and then process him, yes?

&gt;Public transport ought run at a greater loss than it already does by being free at the point of use. This would make superfluous ticket inspectors and the whole ticking infrastructure, both quite costly.
Apart from that relatively small saving, the efficiency of the economy would improve given that a financial friction for moving about would be removed. Moreover, efficiency gains or not, I see public transport, free at the point of use, as an important social good as a means for reducing inequality. If you have nothing in your pocket you can nevertheless travel around.

This entire thing is silly. While I agree in sentiment, it's utterly unrealistic. An awful lot of public transport use has zero to do with productive economic activity. In case you didn't know, public transport is used in many countries to visit relatives, go on holidays, or to the beach on the weekend. If you were in the UK and overnight it became free to travel the breadth of the country (which might have cost several hundred pounds before), how do you think the system would stand up to several hundred thousand people immediately taking advantage of it? Public transport isn't just about getting to work and back or shooting down to the shops. It's often country-wide. Suddenly you get freight companies who can't be bothered spending hundreds of pounds in petrol to courier a package - just send someone on the lovely free public transport. 

Maybe then, we could institute a system whereby only private citizens could use public transport, no companies, courier businesses etc? Maybe some kind of ticketing system? But we'd have to check the tickets......

To take an extreme example, ""public transport"" in Europe might at some point in the future mean government funded travel in the entire Eurozone. Should it be free to get from Istanbul to Paris? If not, why not? Is that economically feasible? Scale it down, it's the same thing.

How are you defining ""morally blameworthy""? Are you a first year philosophy major. And apologies if any of that is a bit acerbic, but I don't get where you're coming from at all.

He *could*- if he tries hard enough, and recruits enough allies - change existing British law and existing European regulations. He can even hope to have some influence (however limited) on the way this is legislated in the States. 

He *cannot* legislate mathematically-intractable problems out of existence however. 

Strong encryption is strong because of mathematics. The policies of governments and companies are utterly irrelevant to whether or not it works.(This is *exactly* the reason he can pretend to want it banned, incidentally). 

His advisors, and probably DC himself, are perfectly well aware of this. It's incredibly naive to think otherwise. What they want to do is *criminalise* people who *use* encryption for non-approved purposes. 

What they are trying to achieve, by shifting the tone of discussion in the media, is initially to make private use of encryption somehow *reprehensible*. So that fewer people use it, and it's less readily available.

Then - after a few more years and a few more terrorist outrages, maybe throw in some ""think of the kiddies"" scandals for good measure - it'll become illegal to use encryption for private purposes, outside of mainstream sites which are already cock-in-glove with the authorities. 

That's when the majority of young and politically active people become criminalised, even if they're never arrested and never investigated. Because that's the hold over people that authority seeks to achieve.

 . .  of which has been under attack by, The Society of Jesus; thus, the entire world must know that I will defend my Buddhist temple if they try and take it. 
 
Where does the tyranny end! 
 
I have asked every civil liberties union for help that as we know are designed only to let you know that you are not getting any help, and your a slave, so shut up. That is the Gop run ACLU, and all the rest. The states are a joke that just let this government ruin people, and they have for decades. They are also owned and paid for by the Jesuits. 
 
Understand, the Buddhist statues, and the ancient Buddhist materials I have here cannot be moved for religious purposes, and it would destroy them, and they would be forever lost. Why cannot people see what they are doing to my Temple and me. It is written very clear and I have provided proof herein?  I have over 2 million in damages that are provable damages, contracts lost to this fraud directly, no ambiguity. 
 
Thus, the Jesuits are being allowed to continue their destruction of other faiths and my Buddhist temple. You can see they are just waiting to take it over. They already knocked the road sign down.  I am defending my religious beliefs here. This is an outrageous act by a nation, one I will not stand for another day! So understand I will out of religious purposes never surrender my Temple at Dharma way to thieves of this nation, and these banks that did this subprime mortgage fraud. . I do not recognise your papers, or do I consent to them. All liens and mortages are null and void by their fraud. Here is all the poof: https://www.facebook.com/notes/10202736939163888/
 
This is not the America I was taught about that has freedom and justice for all. I cannot leave my Temple, it would be treasonist to my own heart and soul. I love my Temple, and my cat and I could never live anywhere else now. They broke the law, and by law I do not have to surrender my home.  I would rather die than leave here. If this nation has come to this then was it the point. I would rather die here defending my rights under the Constitution, then live as a coward. They robbed us all, and now they think they can just take all our businesses and assets, not going to happen without the fight of their life, and yes of course I will sue and try every other means, but just so the powers that be know, your crimes stops right here. This nation killed my entire family, three members of my family died in the last 24 months or so, and it is directly related to these crimes, the stress and the extreme poverty caused by a generation of crimes against the people by the same Cabal that has been doing to the world and our nation since its inception. I am done with it! My sister has lupus and needs serious medical attention and I have no money to help her now because you robbed me. You have no idea how that makes me feel!!
 
Congress caused millions of Americans to lose their homes and businesses and I have no where to go at almost 60, and with a terminal illness. I watched this nation destroy my family and me and I am done! I did nothing to deserve to lose everything. This government did the fraud. And what makes me sick is I just caught B of A breaking federal Law, and turned them in, but still no agency that is suppose to be designed to help Americans will help me. I have all the evidence right here in a letter I sent the state that B of A sold the paper when they knew is was bad paper, and the State lets them get away with it. Even though ""The National Mortgage Settlement Agreement"" prohibits the transfer. 
 
I will defend my home and property to me death if necessary, it is self preservation under, ""The Declaration of Independence."" I have all the legal proof and evidence to prove my claim. If no other Americans will help me then I guess we shall see if divine wind saves me or this is my end. 
I have been pushed out of everywhere I live by these maniacs my entire life, I am not moving period . .

President Abraham Lincoln said this:
 
""The Protestants of both the North and South would surely unite to 
exterminate the priests and the Jesuits, if they could learn how the 
priests, the nuns, and the monks, which daily land on our shores, under 
the pretext of preaching their religion...are nothing else but the 
emissaries of the Pope, of Napoleon III, and the other despots of 
Europe, to undermine our institutions, alienate the hearts of our people
from our constitution, and our laws, destroy our schools, and prepare a
reign of anarchy here as they have done in Ireland, in Mexico, in 
Spain, and wherever there are any people who want to be free.""

Note*
 
Those that would call me a conspiracy theorist or liar, have to also call presidents, JFK, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, and others liars, why you ask? JFK's infamous speech is revealing that a secret society (Illuminati) has indeed taken over our nation, and when he said that they killed him. I guess Killing one of our presidents is not enough for some people to believe there are forces that have taken over our nation as he said.

   No one will help me. I originally wrote president Obama when he was elected because I was being terrorised by my county (Skamania) as they were working to destroy my project 48 acres here (housing development), and I have a recorded claim detailing everything; now understand I know my claims are outrageous but I have all the proof and evidence and a video at the county as evidence. They dismissed the trial because the jury wanted to convict the Millers. This case is about everyone, about invasion. Think about this I show all the evidence this government colluded with congress and many of middle class Americans were wiped out and no one will do anything. Now they say make your house payments to Americans. What happened to the money you robbed from us in 2008? Instead they started the health care ""red herring."" Now Obama instead of sending me help, he sent the Millers to help the county destroy me, I can prove it in court. This is the true nature of this government. This community has conspired to destroy this temple out of hate that is how this started. Please come see for yourself. Or let me die. JFK was killed by the same people as was Lincoln. I am standing up against them for all Americans. I will give my life for this cause. I have been putting out this information on this subprime mortgage fraud since 2008 almost everyday and I will not let it go. , please I only ask I have a chance for people to hear my side. Do not listen to what people may say about me, I can prove they are working only to discredit me, they are all lies. I am the good guy.

1) What did the $15,000

Flights: $2100
Visa fees: $145 Bolivia, Chile: Free, Argentina: $160, Turkey: $20
Rest of Transportation: $3000

Average cost of hostels was about $13 (Euro last year kept at around 1 euro to $1.25): $3400

Food: $2000

Activities and mistakes: rest of my money.


2) How did you travel between the countries?

Flights when I could, mainly buses between cities and most countries, shareride sometimes in Europe. Hitchhiking in some parts of the Balkans.

3) No issues with passport/visa. I'm an American so passport control almost never bothers you and sometimes they don't even check the photo. Entering Bosnia I didn't even get a stamp. 

Because I did most things last minute I got hit with high flight costs:
LAX to Bogota: $300
La Paz to Santiago: $200
Buenos Aires to Bogota: $500
Bogota to US: $300
Florida to Stockholm: $240
Alesund to Oslo to Copenhagen: $200
Istanbul to Copenhagen: $60
Copenhagen to LAX: $230
So total flight cost was around $2,100 when you include the cost of getting to the city center from the airport. All said in done, I didn't always have the option to hitchhike so I took quite a few buses and car shares. In the end transportation cost me a third my budget. Given that I traveled for 263 days that left me with about $30 a day budget.

Modern Ukrainians in general do not see Bandera in a positive light. Most seem as neutral or negative. Only in the area of Galicia there are more positive views. In fact, in central Ukraine where Kiev lies area only 13% of people see Bandera in positive light. Here's the research: http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2010/Katchanovski.pdf

It is true that Yushchenko was a Bandera fan of some sort and tried to prop his legend up, but really the Bandera-stuff won't work in Ukraine ever: Ukrainians, EU and Russia dislike it. 

So I think that's it. You can rest assured that Bandera will be generally disliked in Ukraine for the foreseeable future. If somebody tells you otherwise, they might be lying a bit. Of course there are some lunatics who march around with Bandera stuff but there are similar lunatic neo-nazis in Russia too.

For example, do you see how Less (Unix) and Ethernet frame are both in the Top 10, with over 20 million views each? Neither of these pages are very long, the topics are fairly niche, and they are both considered ""Start-class"" on Wikipedia. Wikipedia's articles have a rough tier system of about eight categories, and ""Start-class"" is third from the bottom, above only stubs the require expansion and articles that need to be deleted and/or incorporated into other articles. They also had a VERY low amount of mobile traffic, under 0.1%, compared to many other pages, especially after the top 20, which are often at least 20% and possibly much higher. These articles likely generated so many views via bots, which rarely come from mobile devices and have been used in the past to promote certain tech-related topics. Naturally, Wikipedia would rather alter their view counts to accurately match peoples' searches, but it is very difficult to do so without damaging the entire process.

What you are suggesting is possible, but based on what of know about Jimmy Wales and other staff at Wikipedia^1, they are unlikely to make a big effort to change numbers like that.

------

Jimmy Wales is probably concerned about the future of Wikipedia and Wikia, his other big project, more than the future of the gaming industry. However, both projects have had a few rough years recently. English Wikipedia became a phenomenon starting in 2005, and had a roughly 5-year burst of growth that saw the creation of well over 50% of the site's current articles. Since 2010 though, growth has slowed significantly, with about half as many new articles in recent years as during the peak. The number of editors has also slowed down, with a slight delay, and the number of visitors has also fallen, albeit at a slower rate. Other languages' Wikipedia versions seem to be following a similar trend, albeit a bit later due to English Wikipedia taking off sooner, so he has to worry about how his 4.7 million article website can remain a reasonable and worthwhile endeavor.

Wikia is smaller in terms of traffic, but is an actual commercial entity, making it also very valuable. In short, this host of smaller wikis for various topics was founded in 2004, but only took off around 2007. But then, in late 2010 and early 2011, other websites, both hosts and independent websites, started to grab a lot of the market, especially after bad decisions convinced many editors to leave. The biggest example was probably Wikia's WoWWiki, a World of Warcraft wiki that attracted 4 or 5 million people a month by late 2010. When Wikia forced the wiki to adopt a different format though, it broke the website's articles that relied on large images such as maps and screenshots, leading to half of the editors moving to Wowpedia, which has been the choice of players ever since.

Jimmy Wales and company thus had to answer the same question for both Wikipedia and Wikia: ""How do I get more people on board?"" The answer was a multi-part strategy between the two projects. Many pages on Wikia and Wikipedia link to the other site, especially for entertainment-themed pages on Wikipedia and articles on broad topics on parts of Wikia. Wikia staff focused on created more ""Community"" features, such as the ability to comment on articles, post blogs to the front page, and so on.

What really concerns us is that someone noticed that most of Wikipedia's editors are male. A 2011 survey by Wikipedia had 9% of users identify as female, and even the last major survey indicated that about 85% of editors were male. Other interesting tidbits included Wikipedia editors having college degrees, living in North America and Europe, are age 18 to 30 roughly half of the time, are real-life introverts and online extroverts, etc. People might leave Wikipedia if they feel they are not allowed to improve articles in meaningful ways (Conservapedia being an extreme example).

The solution seemed to be focusing on attracting new female editors, seeing as women are roughly half of the world's population. Seeing as how factors like college education and worldwide internet access are hard to improve for a non-profit encyclopedia, this makes sense.

This is where the other factors came into play.

A younger adult woman with a college degree from North America or Europe who are far more likely to interact with others in an assertive way online than in real life is more likely to have certain views than the majority of the population. So when trying to attract this group, Wikipedia also changes, both before they come in order to attract them and afterwards as they leave their mark. And due to Wikipedia already being something of an oligarchy, members of whom of their own agendas, the reaching out to female editors indirectly created a systematic bias in a number of ways.

Fun thing is, the number of female editors has not increased much since this all began. But the number of edits by feminists has.",,,1,0,0,t5_33726,t3_2uhz7a,1,1424253328,False,Salnax,KotakuInAction,False

Also the push to get volunteers was due to the fact that the SS only got the left overs from the draft process, so weren't getting good manpower.  The point is though that they were still getting draftees and not all were volunteers.  By 1941 they were forcing ethnic Germans into the service, as Himmler managed to claim them, starting with the 7th SS division:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_SS_Volunteer_Mountain_Division_Prinz_Eugen
&gt;""After the initial rush of Volksdeutsche to join, voluntary enlistments tapered off, and the new formation did not reach division size. Therefore, in August 1941, the SS discarded the voluntary approach, and after a favorable judgement from the SS court in Belgrade, imposed a mandatory military obligation on all Volksdeutsche in Banat, the first of its kind for non-Reich Germans.[3]
One of the reasons for the forced conscription of ethnic Germans was the disappointingly low amount of volunteers for the division after the initial recruitments (no more than 5000). While the division remained ""volunteer"" in name, few of the conscripted ethnic Germans actively sought entry into the unit.

By 1943 they were getting a lot of drafted manpower:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS#1943_expansion
Mainly they were using drafted Eastern European manpower, but were getting draftees from Germany too, including the young Günter Grass in 1944.

He takes those shots because he was good at them in Europe, not because he's bad at selecting his shots. He's never been in the right place at the right time to get comfortable in the NBA.

It's a real shame, I think he's a hidden talent waiting to break out. The first struggling team willing to be patient with him on a ""why the fuck not"" basis will be pleasantly surprised, we're just not in that position. His shot is actually marginally better than Papa's, it's worth pointing out, and look at how Papa was picking up when he was getting play time. Probably going back to Russia when his contract is up QQ

Edit: should note that he *did* get significant play time in Minnesota and Philly, the former I don't really know the situation of but that was his rookie year, and the latter an offense that isn't exactly awesome at creating shots. He's had a few years and his numbers have improved marginally at best, so I'm very much basing my suspicion on some good play in Europe, and I get why he's not more enticing to NBA teams.

 * Obi-Wan says of Anakin, ""When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot, but I was amazed at how strongly the Force was with him."" This, obviously, was before Anakin received his training, so the Force was already strong with him back when he was just a pilot.
 * It's generally implied that Luke has the potential to become a Jedi because he's the son of a Jedi. Obi-Wan never offers to teach anyone else. Even the Rebels, who greatly respect the Jedi, have no Force users among their ranks.
 * Vader again uses the concept of the Force being ""strong"" with someone in the final battle, when he says that the Force is strong with Luke.

Essentially, the implication in *A New Hope* is that certain people are favored by the Force, and it is these people who have the potential to become Jedi. The subsequent movies continue with this idea.

Outside that, one of the earliest official documents written by Lucas (an internal guide for early EU materials, written in 77 or 78) explicitly says that some people have a stronger connection to the Force than others. In fact, this document even mentions midichlorians, twenty years before TPM.

  Seriously though, pick your favorite human group and your favorite animals from the environment in question and copy them! If you can't decide, go through lists of animals native to the environment. You'll start to notice trends, and that will help you narrow down choices.  
  
  Wikipedia is your friend. Here's a great page on [high altitude adaptations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_adaptation) in humans and non-human animals. Note the trends in increased oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, larger heart and lungs, decreased metabolism, and greater numbers of capillaries - all adaptations for maximizing the low available oxygen. Body size is more complicated. Small body size is good for a number of reasons (including poor resource availability - can't feed an elephant on the Tibetan plateau), but it can be a problem because it's so cold up there (small bodies lose heat faster than large bodies). Different species have adapted in different ways, so you'll have to find the system that works best for you.

I have never met or even heard of a single man in my life who was afraid or hated ""femininity"" (mind you: femininity, not women). I have, however, met and seen countless, and I mean countless women who had a deep-rooted fear of masculinity. Fears of being raped by a big, strong guy. Fear of being overpowered by a big, strong guy. Fear of being abused by a big, strong guy. Just coming across a guy at night is enough for many women to feel intimidated. It's not so much the men they are intimidated by, as it is the notion of masculinity; of superior male strength and heaps of testosterone that have a bullish potential to dominate and force (...women). Women in our culture are, without a speck of doubt, afraid en masse of (aggressive) masculinity, and that is a key observation we *have* to make in order to make any progress in any of this. There's a sort of mealymouthed pleasure in pretending like this sort of masculinity is all about being a bunch of scared men, because that puts you in a haughty position from which you can look down on these ""poor boyish brutes"" while pretending you're not *really* afraid of them - they're afraid of *you*! I'm afraid all you're doing is projecting. 

Furthermore, this derision of young men by likening them to girls is more often than not rooted in facts. Because we're talking about the Superbowl, let's take the all-famous *""you throw like a girl""*. It turns out that this is definitely a ""valid"" thing to say, as girls really do throw weaker and with worse technique than boys - pretty much across the board in different cultures.^[\[1\]](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-09/fyi-do-men-and-women-throw-ball-differently) I know this is going to get downvoted by the downvote-brigade on here, who only like to see things that confirm their worldview, but it's still a fact, and it's true. You not liking this isn't going to change anything.

Take a different derision; ""stop being/acting like a little girl"" when a guy is being too sensitive or if he cries in public. I myself have rarely ever witnessed this, so I'm starting to doubt how much of this is just guy-joking, or actual insult. Nevertheless, I'm going to go ahead and pretend like this happens to men all the time. A large meta-study by the German Society of Ophthalmology found that women, on average, cry significantly more (and more often) than men.^[\[2\]](http://www.dog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PM-Weinen.pdf) Why is this not a ""valid"" thing to say then? Sure, you might argue that it's used as an insult and that its usage indicates a degree of negativity - after all, likening men to girls usually isn't well received or well-intentioned. But wouldn't most women feel offended if I told them they act ""mannish""? Wouldn't most women feel insecure if I told them they walk like a man? Or that their voice is manly? Even just telling them they're masculine wouldn't sit well with most women, I'm sure.

The problem with your analogy is that there's not a whole lot of things you can associate with black people that'd be effectively used as an insult. Black people are what? I can't really think of a single characteristic that black people have across the world that white people don't also have, apart from physiology. You might point to ghettos in the US, but then I'd point you to all the black people in Europe who're not like that. Women and femininity though - that's a different story altogether. Almost every major culture in this world has similar notions of femininity. And like the study I linked about girls throwing balls; whether you're an aboriginal child or white american kid, ""throwing like a girl"" is a real, quantifiable and observable phenomenon.

In my mind, mass uncontrolled immigration is a bad idea. I'm not saying all immigration is wrong, and I certainly don't support the idea of limiting certain immigrants' rights or privileges... that's all far too right wing for me (if immigrants are going to be allowed into this country then they should have the same rights as everyone else, the government can't have it both ways).

As for saying that ""Germany doesn't have a problem with immigration"" that's misleading at best: http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/chapter-3-most-support-limiting-immigration/

&gt; In Germany and Poland, the public is closely divided between those who want less immigration and those who say immigration levels should remain about the same as they are now. Very few people in these EU nations want increased immigration.

1950s we had a war in Korea, at least the US, not sure where you are. And this wasn't broadcasted, wasn't talked about, it happened on the other side of the planet and didn't garner a ton of national attention from the public unless you knew someone over there or were there yourself. No big movements or anything.

1970s hit, and everyone has a television. Damn they are fancy. And guess what? We have reporters in Vietnam, with cameras, feeding video to the people back home. Great right? People can support their troops and see their struggles. But they also see the atrocities one has to commit in war, and as people are prone to do, judge without being in their shoes. When they came back from Vietnam they get things thrown at them in the streets, called baby killers, denied jobs. All because one day they decided they wanted to server their country. It's a big reason today we always thank our troops, because regardless of what they did over there, they did it to protect our freedoms and our way of life.

Then the 1980s come, and we see Russia invade Afghanistan. This is a major plot point of the cold war, as US uses Al Queda, as an extension of the CIA, to fight the invading Soviets. This is again, broadcasted nationally as people watch to see what will happen, because should the USSR take Afghanistan, a major oil supplier at the time, it could only increase tensions between the first and second world.

Finally 9/11 is a good example. Not only did every single person in America see this, many of them live, but people throughout western Europe, the middle east, East Asia. This was not just a tragedy for americans, this was an international tragedy and understanding that this atrocity would resonate for years to come and set the tone of the early 2000's. All because every single person in the world, thanks to the internet and TV saw those two planes, and the men behind them, kill 3000 people in New York City on a Tuesday morning.

I also preferred how things were less 'forced' in EU4. I would usually play as Brazil in HoI3 and try to take over all of South America.

Hard to say, most likely a combination of factors.

It mainly started when [Laura Codruta Kovesi](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/world/europe/romania-prosecutor-laura-codruta-kovesi.html) was named as the head of the National AntiCorruption Directorate, so if you'd like to have one name responsible for this, I guess she would be the leading candidate.

She was named as part of a weird pact between two arch rivals (politically speaking), President Basescu and PM Victor Ponta, a pact which most likely had a very different objective in mind than this. To be fair though, she had been previously supported by president Basescu, so in a way he can take some credit for her current position and activity. One of the very few positives in his 10 year presidency.

EU is of course also a factor. We've been under the watchful eye of the EU since even before joining in 2007, especially when it comes to the Justice system, so this definitely helped. DNA (although not in its exact current form) was actually created due to EU pressures.

There's also the effect of a society that matures and breaks away from its 50 years of communism and dictatorship. Young people are starting to have relevant roles in society and at the same time be more reactive, more educated and without the habits of the communism era.

There's still a lot of wrong and bad stuff going on in the country, even when it comes to the Justice system, but the general perception, which I agree with, is that things are heading in a positive direction. As president Basescu said when he ended his mandate (can't believe I'm gonna quote him, I can't stand the guy), there's still quite a huge potential force for the direction of the reforms to turn around or just disappear, so we have to continue to be vigilant..",ROMA,,27,0,0,t5_2qh4j,t3_2uilia,27,1424250438,False,mynsc,europe,False

Why should we taint ourselves with this? I mean, to look at this logically people react and have outlooks directed by the experiences they've experienced, think about this sentence. 

Muslims, who are from muslim communities a lot of the time work in sales. I work in sales, I travel right across the North West. Some of these lads have a certain 'twang', which I can only describe as an 'immigrant twang', and mate.. it fucking SELLS. 

As a scouser, I have a 'twang'. I'm not a middle class numpty who can get bullied into doing what you want, or easily led where I need to be led. I cannot be shown an open door an pushed through it. 

Weirdly, I'd say this is a ghetto 'twang', but a very British ghetto twang. Infact, UKip need to talk about the British ghetto 'twang', and fucking REPRESENT THE FACT THAT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. 

A lot of muslims come from poor areas, some of our top performers in my company are picking up £3,000/month, after tax. These are lads and a few ladies who have no qualifications, but a priceless twang. It's a very British twang, a pakistani/middle Eastern Brummy accent type of twang, mixed in with a bit of typical ghetto 'flavour' such as a cockney selling saying 'no brainer'. It's hard to describe this particular flavour of the muslims that I work with.

However, the vast majority of these lads are just as British as me. Born + raised here. They smoke weed, but they don't drink. No, I come a white ghetto culture of drinking a fucking shit load and am more a type of person in which if UKip spoke and my ears are open, people like me are no longer labour voters but UKip voters. 

These lads need to know UKip understands the 'twang', and with that, a 'hustle for the doe yo' mentality, rather than a LETS PUT IN LONG HOURS AND ADDRESS IN AN ADEQUATE FASHION ABOUT HOW THESE CERTAIN CHANGES ARE OCCURING, or a Southerners more organised mindset. 

We have cultural difference now in the UK amongst people who are Muslims and this picture represents to those lads who have a muslim 'twang' a very wrong picture of UKip. 

To be a truly successful party, we need to embrace young muslims who are born and brought up in a shit hole, or a fucking ghetto but along different lines than to the one I was brought up in. 

UKip should speak to every UK citizen, using common sense. My post here is very common sense orientated, could be shot down by political correctness and somebody shouting 'BUT YOU'RE SAYING SOMEBODY BORN POOR IS DIFFERENT WHEN THEY'RE LE SAME', they've experienced a different cultural upbringing and we should recognise that with the British imput and thus 'twang' that has happened. 

The lads in our work are paying a fucking shit load of tax mate, that's going to Europe too and not into their communities. The government is paying RUSSIAN STYLE USSR BUSINESS DEALS, that hinder private business and serious fucking entrepreneurs from a very different walk of life than the typical UKip 50yr old in the local in Sussex. 

As a subreddit, we need to stop this bullshit and address what's happening in what communities and why on a very real, common sense, word of mouth type of way.

The war didn't ""per se"" end the British Empire but, rather, acted as a turning point of decline. From 1951 onward sub-Saharan Africans would start first achieving independence, a full 33 years after WW1! So what do we mean by the British Empire's end? Britain was, by this point, totally surpassed by the United States and Germany as an industrial power and only really stayed as a major economic power because of its massive global investments and banking by virtue of industrializing first. After WWI this would change horribly for them; they would go from the largest creditor nation (their saving grace) to the largest debtor nation almost overnight; liquidating a significant portion of what they had for cash. 

So the war ends and all that money Britain loaned out to Russia goes away; the Soviets refuse to accept the Tsarists debts. The money Germany was supposed to give to Britain never gets there; even though the Germans could pay it they refused to off of some sense of post-war posturing and hoping to screw over the French and Brits in particular by denying them necessary reparations. But it's really that former one that hurt the most; all that investment into the Russian war effort and it just...disappears. Gone. When the Great Depression hit they were hit *hard*. 

So really WWI was not the killing blow it was the setup jab for WW2 which was the haymaker that sent them into a death spiral. WWI lost its major dominions and not even immediately; it took until 1931 with the Statute of Westminister which gave Canada, Australia, South Africa, Irish Free State, New Zealand, and Newfoundaland which stated:

&gt; No Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this Act shall extend or be deemed to extend, to a Dominion as part of the law of that Dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that Act that that Dominion has requested, and consented to, the enactment thereof.

Giving, essentially, full sovereignty to these former semi-autonomous Dominions. This was largely in part due to the fact that these states were a significant help for the British war effort and the fact that their national identities were honed in this conflict. The Second Battle of Ypres and Vimy Ridge are two battles that ingrained in every Canadian's national memory; where not British colonials but *Canadians* fought side by side. Considering the massive fervor of being Canadian, Aussie, or Kiwi rather than ""British"" from the war (as they all fought in their own units) and their contribution along with general British destablization and a loss of interest in ""Empire"" they were given independence. 

Where WWI jabbed and knocked them off their footing WWII was that haymaker which knocked them the heck out. That is where they ceded naval hegemony and its status as a 'Great Power' (or even 'Superpower') in an 'official' way making way for the United States. It's when they realized it was impossible to hold onto the remnants of their vast Empire in the Far East, India, and especially Africa, and from '47 onwards it would all begin to fall apart with India, then Ghana, and then a continued succession.

The attention was most specifically brought about by the negative characteristic of Islamic culture which caused people who do not believe in that religion to participate in things such as non islamic women sometimes being required to wear hijabs in certain situations, or that non muslims had to sometimes respect islamic law or even causing some ethnic groups (Jews) to feel alienated or even fearful of their safety in certain areas.

Perhaps you don't know this, but British tanks, after having been the pride of the allied forces in WWI, were the laughing stock of mechanized units in WWII. The A9's were lacking in armor and were easily destroyed so they were quickly replaced by A10's. Unfortunately, A10's were horribly designed and around 90% were lost to mechanical failure. It wasn't until American tank designer J Walter Christie was commissioned to redesign the suspension on British tanks along with the introduction of American M4 tanks that the Brits were a match for Germany in mechanized battle.

The problem I have with this argument is that it's suggesting that the only possible period that it's feasible for Scotland to be independent is the 90 odd years during which oil will be extracted from the North Sea. That is clearly not the case.

Saying ""oh but politician X promised Y after independence and that would only be feasible with a never-ending supply of oil that stayed at today's prices forever and ever"" is equally ridiculous.

Independence is not about one particular party, let alone one particular politician, and what the Scotland of 2020 votes for can be quite different from what the Scotland of 2050 votes for (look at the difference in party fortunes between 1950 and 1980).

But, to return to oil, Denmark expect their oil fields to be exhausted by 2050. Scotland is probably not going to be far behind. Denmark is hardly going to turn into a failed state as a result. They are going to do exactly what Scotland will do, whenever independence happens, which is to adapt to the situation they find themselves in.

That means that, yes, a policy that might have been affordable in 2020 might not be affordable in 2050. So what? Do you think Scotland will stand still in those 30 years? That the pension age in any country is going to be the same forever?

I voted yes because I wanted Scotland to be able to tackle problems that clearly aren't being tackled within the UK. Saying ""oh but things could be bad if you're independent"" is true, but that in itself does not do anything to address the issues that exist *right now* within the UK.

If being in the UK is the best that Scotland can expect, why do so many people need to move to the South East for work? Why is EU funding awarded on the basis that Scotland (specifically) needs that uplift yet the funds are distributed throughout the UK? Why are issues that receive majority support - like devo-max - essentially ignored by the UK? What exactly is going to be done about the deprivation in Greater Glasgow?

Although I was disappointed in the referendum result I am now, four months on, more certain than ever that independence is inevitable.

The reason for that is not that, post-vote, Scotland suddenly discovered a pile of gold under the proverbial mattress and that any and all financial issues have gone away.

The reason is that, post-vote, it has become clear that the majority of people in Scotland want more autonomy than the UK can provide. EVEL? Constitutional convention? These are politics-as-usual, not ""holy shit Scotland was only 190K people away from dissolving the UK"" restructuring.

Unless Scotland feels it truly benefits from being part of the UK then the question is not going to become ""why independence?"" it is going to be ""why not?"".

But after that nice play all he did was play extremely safe.

Someone who plays really agressive aswell is woolite. Very agressive and doing alot of damage for his team. This sometimes leads to him being caught, which he will be punished for by analytics.

If you're famalier with European Soccer, the NFL would be at the same level as the EPL, the collection of all of the top flight teams in the country.

To turn the EPL into something a little more like the NFL, take the 20 teams in the EPL and divide them into two sets of ten teams, maybe put the 10 northernmost teams together and the 10 southernmost teams together, a ""North"" and ""South"" conference.  At the end of the year, instead of just deciding the champion based on the events of the regular season, you have a playoff among the northern teams, a playoff among the southern teams, with the winner of each meeting in a championship game.  That's a pretty rudimentary explanation, but hopefully it helps as a start.  Those somewhat arbitrary splits are the AFC/NFC, the two conferences within the NFL from which the super bowl teams are decided.

Buffalo tax is different from NYC tax and NYC tax is different from Boston tax and Boston tax is different from LV tax.  Oregon and a handful of other states have no sales tax.  It depends on what kind of store you're going into, but if it's clothing then many certainly do have the price pre-tagged.  There's other items that do this too.

&gt;you might think it's complicated but that's because you're used to the american system, anyone in Europe would tell you it's totally silly to not have VAT included, and it is.

I think it adds a lot of unnecessary overhead and coordination to the whole retail process.  It works more easily in Europe because you're looking at what, 28 members and 28 different VAT rates?  There are probably more than 28 tax rates in NY state alone, and thousands in the US.  I could easily turn your statement around and say the reason you think it's easy is because you're thinking on a very small scale compared to what it actually is.

&gt;it's just a ploy to get you to spend more without being completely aware of it

This is simply not true.  With the exception of friends from states with no sales tax, I don't know a single person that has grown up with the US system that doesn't understand that tax is (almost) always added and knows how to generally calculate it based on where they're from.  I always know if I'm buying a $50 item that there's going to be an additional 8% on top of that.

That's a population growth and immigration and cultural demographics discussion.  If you're insulated from that because of your local region, alright, but I'm pointing out what you're experiencing isn't actually the overall trend.

I'd also like to point out that America isn't Europe, and in fact followed explicitly traditions, values and policies throughout the country's history up to now in order to ensure we didn't become anything like Europe, mostly due to our puritanical roots and rejection of feudalism.  ""American exceptionalism"" is a big whole, actual social theory, not just flag waving grandstanding even though it sounds like it.  It tries to explain how America generated so much wealth, power, influence, technology, industry, etc., despite being so different than other wealthy nations that have richer histories, more natural resources and mechanical philosophies.  Wanting this country to be more like Europe is not a good thing in my personal opinion, let Europe be Europe, and if you want to live somewhere like Europe, go to Europe.

Back on topic to the secular thing and equal protection and black segregation.  That's literally what I addressed in my first post, so it's frustrating to have to repeat myself, so I'm not going to surmise it, but now that you seem to have calmed down a little you're welcome to address my original argument.  The second class citizen thing doesn't apply.

&gt; So of course it is offensive for legislatures and lobbyists to try to force an entire historically established and majority culture to change based on some whiner's airs of enlightened moral superiority, especially when their perspective is only acknowledged to be disrespected if it is acknowledged at all. When a Christian wedding cake maker loses a lawsuit for refusing to make a cake for a gay couple, or when an LDS church is forced by a judge to accept a gay couple being married on their grounds, people are going to speak out about their rights being violated. That's what was being referenced in Huckabee's comment. It isn't an issue of gays being discriminated unfairly, it's an issue of what the limits are in government power when it comes to people's beliefs and morals, religious or otherwise.  A vast majority of people in this country are sympathetic to gays and lesbians who want the same rights and benefits as straight couples, but calling the relationship a ""marriage"" disrespects a lot of people's cultural traditions. Nobody is forcing gays to move to the back of the bus, or are publicly lynching them, or forcing them to go to gays-only restaurants or gays-only restrooms, or making gays work for the fraction of the wages that straights do for the same job.

1) First we need to determine what we mean by the word *naturally*? Are we talking about some sort of base instinct coming from our hindbrain that our poor prefrontal cortex can't override here? Is this the same sort of ""natural"" instinct people talk about when they excuse war and rape and murder as a part of human nature?

2) Increase in body hair is one of the earliest signs of puberty. It actually does not make sense that smooth legs would inherently or ""naturally"" equate to sexual appeal as it is a physical sign of sexual immaturity (unless that individual were a ""natural"" pedophile of course). The growth of body hair signals that the female human is capable (or in the process of becoming capable) of reproducing and available for sexual intercourse. Think ""if there's hair on the field play ball"" but without statutory rape laws.

3) Because of this, its a lot less squicky to accept these are cultural norms, as evidenced by the fact that various cultures across history have all had different beauty standards/hair removal practices. No preference is universal or ""natural."" It may seem that way due to sheer ubiquity, but fashion/grooming/beauty standards are social/cultural processes that vary widely among groups. And honestly, it's not even as ubiquitous in Western culture as either of us are making it out to be. For example, it's catching on with younger women in Mediterranean Europe, but its not a part of the culture the way it is in the Anglo-speaking west. My mother's mother shaves her legs to this day, but my father's mother never did.

4) I'm not aware of any studies of the brain, if that's what you're looking for. There have been a number of sociological studies done tracking body hair preference, but those are going to take a social science versus hard science approach (obviously). There are also some interesting social histories written on personal grooming habits in various cultures.

Lissandra;

- Dblade + pot &gt; Hexdrinker &gt; SV &gt; cutlass &gt; blade with boots anytime after hexdrinker when you can afford it.

- This is an unfavored match up as Liss has amazing poke and damage and asking for jungler help won't solve anything because she can always E away a large distance. I like to start E and poke her a bit, making sure I don't eat too much harass since I'm very vunerable without my W healing. At level 2, if I've poked her down to half health, I'll take a point in Q and jump on her, probably resulting in a kill as she's still just a mage, she's quite fragile against a melee fighter. If not, take W and continue surviving. Max R&gt;E&gt;W&gt;Q. Your best chances of killing her are at level 2 and 6, or when you manage to land enough E's and chunk her down.

Irelia;

- Dshield + pot &gt; Dblade &gt; Cutlass &gt; giants belt &gt; Finish botrk &gt; Randuins with boots somewhere after cutlass depending on situation. Hydra can replace cutlass&gt;botrk, but in this match up there's a lot of toe to toe auto attacking fighting, meaning you need your duelist weapon, botrk. Hydra is for pushing, Botrk is for dueling.

- In EU, it's basically said that Aatrox is a counterpick to Irelia, however this is not entirely true. Irelia has insanely high base stats and she has the tools to deal with your early game power, and her damage outscales yours quickly at lvl 5 if she's maxing W and using it correctly. Her base stats are that high she can start flask + pots (meaning no combat stats at lvl 1) and still be tankier than Aatrox with a doran shield, which is ridiculous. I take shield over blade in this match up first because early game she can win trades by stunning you everytime you try to trade. I play very aggressive in this match up because while these champions scale similarly, Irelia scales better. I go for an all in with QW at lvl 2 if possible by poking her down with blood price W, if not, trade efficiently and wait till 6. Be sure YOU hit 6 first, as her ult can heal a ridiculous amount. Taking ignite in this match up is not a bad idea, it's one that Aatrox needs to win if he wants to do well in the game.

Gnar;

- Same as Irelia, but sometimes I opt for hydra instead, maybe botrk after if I'm fed. Reason for this is an out of position Gnar is really squishy when he's not in his mega form, meaning raw AD from hydra is better than botrk. Aatrox essentially already has a botrk built into his kit: W Lifesteal, E Slow, Passive, AS. So try to build Hydra first wherever possible, but having both is very strong.

- Against Gnar I start E, max that first as always. This match up is a bit weird for gnar, because you actually want to fight him when he's in mega form, not ranged form. Here's why; ranged form his poke and mobility is quite overwhelming for Aatrox, you'll never catch him and he has good sustained damage. In his melee form, bait out his W and Q and you will win since he loses his ranged advantage over you and has to fight upfront. Mega Gnar has burst, Mini Gnar has sustained damage, Aatrox has sustained damage but if he can survive Mega's burst then he will win. Eventually when you get fed, you can EQR hydra and chase him down and kill mini gnar that quickly.

- I found this to be the hardest match up to learn, since Mega Gnar is like an ultimate form for him, and most champions shouldn't fight him then. Aatrox is the exception for this, since he's capable of fighting melees and winning easily, but not mobile ranged champions.

While the Mavs are competitive as usual but people dismissed them because they had failed so many times in the playoffs, and this team wasn't particularly elite in the regular season either.

Miami was supposed to be the perfection of a new era in basketball, that you needed three all stars/super stars to become champions (started by the '08 Celtics). And they were the most young, current, popular and marketable stars in the league. While Dallas is composed of various pretty good components that are past its prime (note: still good players, but past prime) and never tasted championship champagne, such as Kidd, Marion, Peja. Even its one big star Dirk Nowitzki isn't particularly popular or perceived with the same celebrity status as the Heatles.

Even through the playoffs it seems like The Heat were getting stronger and stronger as the team gel together; while with the Mavs people are always looking over their shoulder, that it's not a matter of if but when they would crumble again in the playoffs. It wasn't until the OKC series when people start to view Dirk differently.

Which brings it to another point, LBJ is in his prime, while Dirk was in a different place and labeled as a soft european and he was slowly chipping that monkey on his back with each one legged fadeaway jumper swish.

Forg1ven highlights that an ADC can impact the game a lot more than just teamfights.. can push towers, can snowball his advantage throughout the map.

No, I didn't write the original, and yes, it was originally about European football (soccer) culture and so it's not a perfect analogy for the current context of American football in general and the Superbowl in particular.

That said, I was reminded of that post and hunted it down to submit here because of the number of times in the last few days that I've seen sports fans complaining about non-fans declaring their dislike for sports.

On the one hand, of course I see their point: it's silly to ridicule anyone for their hobby interests, and it's silly for non-fans to smugly imply some kind of superiority over sports fans. I get that; to each their own.

But that also makes it super ironic for sports fans to complain about having to hear non-fans declaring their non-fan-ness, since of course, non-fans are *constantly* bombarded with how much everybody else loves sports.

So the point of this submission was to try to get sports fans to think about what life would be like if their favorite hobby interest *wasn't* one of the dominant topics of discussion throughout our culture, because I think many sports fans honestly have no conception of what that feels like. As sports fans they're part of the dominant majority, and when you're part of the dominant majority, it can be really hard to empathize and understand the experience of someone who isn't.

So, TL;DR: I am not bashing sports fans, and yes I've seen that xkcd and I agree with it. It's great that lots of people love sports, a lot of my best friends love sports, and I myself watched the Superbowl with them last night and listened to them talk about the players and coaches and strategies, and it was fun.

And when non-fans complain about being constantly surrounded by sports talk, yes, sometimes they're being kind of rude. But when you as a sports fan complain about them complaining, you're actually doing exactly the same thing. They have to listen to you (and everyone else) talk about sports all year round, and 99% of the time, they don't give you any crap about it. So if once in awhile, right around a major sporting event, you have to listen to them talk about not liking sports, it's not such a big deal.

Solche Leute bezeichne ich gerne als ""Herrenmenschen"". 

Hab Ich auch gesehen, fand aber tatsächlich, dass beide Seiten nicht gut und überzeugend argumentiert haben. Mit beide Seiten meine Ich neben Bosbach noch Kipping. Ich fand aber auch, dass Bosbach einen Punkt gemacht hat, der Reformstau in Griechenland ist grauenvoll und die selbstverschuldeten Versäumnisse seitens des Staates sind irreversibel;  hier macht er aber imho den Fehler und leitet eine gewisse Un- oder sagen wir ""Minder""zuständigkeit der Rest-EU für Griechenland ab. Ich finde das falsch -oder besser gesagt kontraproduktiv- Ich würde die Lage der Südstaaten zum Anlass nehmen, grundsätzlich Reformen in der europäisch-internationalen Steuerpolitik zu beschließen, sodass der Sozialstaat sich endlich wieder ohne Neuverschuldung finanzieren kann... ohne Infrastruktur- und elementare Sozialpolitikeinbußen vorzunehmen. Stichwort 2Bio Steuerverlust durch Schlupflöcher in der EU pro Jahr.

There is definitely a risk of British culture disappearing. I assume you're young, but if you ask any older Brit they'll usually tell you they don't like the way things are now. That's why there's massive white flight from London and other cities.

""Islamist"" has largely filled that role as a descriptive term for the subset of Muslims who are inclined towards violent jihad and terrorism.  It's important to note that there are Islamist terrorists who aren't Wahhabis. 

&gt;  The Uganda example was brought up I think because North America was partly exporting those ideas and people from its Christian communities, in the same way Saudi Arabia exports Wahhabism. 

Uh no.  The comparison isn't valid.  There are anti-gay Christians in the United States, but virulently anti-gay African Christians aren't importing their anti-gay views from North American, they're home grown.  More to the point, the anti-gay attitudes are far more among Christians in those areas of Africa than they are among American Christians.    Financial support *is* going from rich Americans to those Africans, (and that's a problem),but what you have is a case of rich people in one area and a dominant attitude in another area.  By contrast, Saudi Arabia is both the spiritual *and* financial centre of Wahabi Islam.

More to the point though, even leaving aside the fact that American isn't the spiritual home of any part of Christianity, the Uganda thing doesn't have anything to do with how young people might be getting radicalized to violence in Canadian churches.

It simply is not happening.  And again, this isn't unique to Christianity.  Buddhists being radicalized in Canada.  It simply isn't happening.

The Anders Breivki example suffers from the same problem.  It's notably *not* a Canadian example.  More importantly it's demonstrably NOT an example of a person being radicalized in a Christian church for the very simply reason that Mr. Breivki didn't attend church.  (So he couldn't have been radicalized in one.)

He described himself in his manifesto as as ""100% Christian"" but then went on to say he's not really religious and is a ""cultural Christian"".  He described a cultural Christian as someone preserving European culture and not necessarily believing in God or Jesus and includes Christian-Atheists.

Now does anyone think that ""Islamists"" includes ""Muslim-Atheists""?  Of course not.  People who don't believe that Allah exists don't get lumped in with Muslims or because they cannot possibly be Muslims. 

The Anders Breivik example simply doesn't compare to Islamists.  To suggest that Mr. Breivik demonstrates that Christianity has a comparable problem with extremists within it as Islam simply doesn't make sense.

(1) upstart teams making a case for legitimacy - Teams like Gravity who are now tied for first at (3-1) were expected to be bottom of the pack. Heck, even team 8 looks interesting, although I am sure they will fall further behind. This discussion really begins with a look into what values are held highly when discussing what is ""interesting"".
(2) Language Barriers - A team like Impulse might seem super boring if they don't win any games, but to me, this is one of the most interesting teams in NA at the moment because it is a true test as to theory that teams have to be linguistically cohesive in order to play at their optimal level. IMO, it is very exciting to see how this team progresses with 3 language in the mix.
(3) CLG
(4) NA having to prove themselves? - I think this year is really the defining year for NA. We have coaches now, and we haven't won a world championship. Team are thirsty to get better.

However while I believe this incentivized people to move more towards health insurance, [I ask you to look at the nber study I linked](http://www.nber.org/digest/apr06/w11609.html):

&gt;Finkelstein estimates that the introduction of Medicare was associated with a 23 percent increase in total hospital expenditures (for all ages) between 1965 and 1970, with even larger effects if her analysis is extended through 1975. Extrapolating from these estimates, Finkelstein speculates that the overall spread of health insurance between 1950 and 1990 may be able to explain at least 40 percent of that period's dramatic rise in real per capita health spending.

I (obviously) don't know much about healthcare, but I imagine the reason medicare/medicaid was so expensive is because of the US's role in specialization. For instance, your vox article talks about importance of drug manufacturers in the pricing process. The pharmaceutical industry in general is [much more concentrated in the US](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y2-FBeX5guk/TnzqmCu5uxI/AAAAAAAAAVI/6aKr9QIb1xQ/s1600/biomedical+2.JPG).  The US in particular [has the vast majority of biomedical research:](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=0)

&gt;In real terms, spending on American biomedical research has doubled since 1994. By 2003, spending was up to $94.3 billion (there is no comparable number for Europe), with 57 percent of that coming from private industry. The National Institutes of Health’s current annual research budget is $28 billion, All European Union governments, in contrast, spent $3.7 billion in 2000, and since that time, Europe has not narrowed the research and development gap. America spends more on research and development over all and on drugs in particular, even though the United States has a smaller population than the core European Union countries. From 1989 to 2002, four times as much money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.

[Americans pay more for patented drugs and less for generics and over the counter medicine](https://hub.mili.csom.umn.edu/content/m10066/latest/19.7a.PNG). In general, Americans are more likely to be prescribed patented drugs:

&gt;A recent study shows that while over 50 percent of patients in the United States receive the latest, most effective pharmaceuticals for arthritis, they are available to only 15 percent of patients in Germany and the United Kingdom. The same trend is revealed with regard to cardiovascular medicine. In Italy and Belgium, the threshold condition for receiving the most innovative and effective therapy is having a cholesterol level of about 290 as well as proof of a family history of heart trouble, even though established medical opinion holds that a cholesterol level of 190 is the appropriate threshold for treatment.

(2) At the same time the government granted monopoly that the AMA has received, [has restricted the number of new physicians](http://bastiat.mises.org/2013/12/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive/)

&gt;But the U.S. failed to allow physician supply to respond to meet consumer demand. From 1965 through 1972 the number of newly-licensed U.S. physicians graduated each year from medical schools in the United States and Canada increased from 7455 to 7815 or by only 360 physicians!
The doubling in the number of licenses meant a mere 3.5% annual increase in the 418,000 total physicians in 1980. Since much of the increase in medical school acceptances since 1965 has been necessary just to keep up with the increased level of demand, only a fraction of the increase in enrollment has gone toward filling the shortage or back-log of doctors created by the 1965 crisis. If only 10% of annual physician output fills this back-log, a further doubling in the output would achieve competition eleven times faster.

With all the said, the US still does have higher cancer survival rates. This could be due to earlier testing, but you can account for that by looking at stages: [Here's a stage-specific survival rate for colorectal cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1774819/table/t4/), and [one for a type of breast cancer](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/cncr.20038/asset/20038_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=i5oidxye&amp;s=b9779d81606dbf06171af7cf0cacdc191df612ae). The US does have higher survival rates for these. [Here's another study comparing 15 different types of cancer survival rates between Ontario and the US by income group, with it finding a higher survival rate for the US for each income group](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/17/7/2244/T2.expansion.html). 

[The US also has good post heart attack care](http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20040920/us-tops-canada-in-post-heart-attack-care):

&gt;""The five-year death rate was 19.6% among U.S. patients and 21.4 percent among Canadian patients,"" says researcher Padma Kaul, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, in a news release. ""After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics, we found that Canadian patients' risk for dying was 17% higher compared to U.S. patients.""

[The US also has the 4th lowest stroke mortality rates](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/health_glance-2011-en/01/03/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=/content/chapter/health_glance-2011-6-en&amp;containerItemId=/content/serial/19991312&amp;accessItemIds=/content/book/health_glance-2011-en&amp;mimeType=text/html).

Is the US alone in providing largely private health care? No. There are substantial private health care markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea.[Which all have some of the best health statistics.] [Here is their funding for health care.](http://singaporearmchaircritic.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chart1_new.jpg?w=1400&amp;h=1040) [Here are private(including out of pocket) and public expenditures as a percent of gdp](http://singaporearmchaircritic.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/chart2_new.jpg?w=1400&amp;h=904)

[A note on Singapore:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Singapore)

&gt;A key principle of Singapore's national health scheme is that no medical service is provided free of charge, regardless of the level of subsidy, even within the public healthcare system. This mechanism is intended to reduce the overutilisation of healthcare services, a phenomenon often seen in fully subsidised universal health insurance systems. Out-of-pocket charges vary considerably for each service and level of subsidy. At the highest level of subsidy, although each out-of-pocket expense is typically small, costs can accumulate and become substantial for patients and families. At the lowest level, the subsidy is in effect nonexistent, and patients are treated like private patients, even within the public system.

&gt;The increasingly large private sector provides care to those who are privately insured, foreign patients, or public patients who are able to afford what often amount to very large out-of-pocket payments above the levels provided by government subsidies.

&gt;Singapore has ""one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes,"" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[4] The government regularly adjusts policies to actively regulate ""the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country"" in an attempt to keep costs in check. However, for the most part the government does not directly regulate the costs of private medical care. These costs are largely subject to market forces, and vary enormously within the private sector, depending on the medical specialty and service provided.",,,2,0,0,t5_2sfmf,t3_2udkzj,2,1424246872,1422921615,wordboyhere,PoliticalDiscussion,False

&gt;  I'm not trying to say that the entire history of every Western nation's colonialism combined was less bad than what Japan did in a decade and a bit, that would be a strange comparison.

Just like it is silly to compare japan's atrocities when THEY were building the empire. Kinda idiotic to ignore the atrocities of centuries of empire building by europeans and just focus on japanese attempt at empire building...


&gt; I just think that Japanese war crimes during that period were shocking for the time

It wasn't any more shocking than FDR using a letter opener made of a mutilated japanese soldier's bones. It isn't as shocking as GIs sending japanese soldiers heads to families back home. Nothing is more shocking than intentionally firebombings cities full of innocent men, women and children in order to roast them. It isn't any more shocking than nuking japanese just because they were asians and we wanted to send asians a message... 

You are just arbitrarily choosing to be shocked at one side while completely ignoring the truly shocking depraved behavior of the other side.

""When Japanese remains were repatriated from the Mariana Islands after the war, roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II

There were well over 63K japanese dead in the marinas campaign... So the GIs went around and decapitated, boiled and sent home over 36K skulls. Think about it. And that's just one island...

And if you look at the stats, you will find no japanese POWs or japanese wounded because we killed every single wounded and surrendering japanese.


&gt; and there was no action taken by the Allies comparable to what happened in Nanjing

You mean other than the intentional targeting of civilians in okinawa, the firebombings of japan cities or the nukes...

&gt;

&gt;The __Democratic Party__ ([Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_language): Демократска странка, ДC / *Demokratska stranka*, __DS__,  listen (help·info)) is a [social-democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy)   and [social-liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism)  [political party in Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Serbia). It is the major [centre-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left) party in [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia), and is the third largest party in the [National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Serbia)  and the official [opposition party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_party). The Democratic Party is a full member of the [Socialist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International), the [Progressive Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Alliance_(political_international\)), and is an associate member of the [Party of European Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_European_Socialists).

&gt;The party was officially founded on February 3, 1990 by a group of Serbian intellectuals as a revival of the original Yugoslav [Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Yugoslavia\)).  It was one of the main opposition parties to the presidency of [Slobodan Milošević](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87) during the 1990s.  Democratic Party joined the [Democratic Opposition of Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Opposition_of_Serbia) coalition in 2000,  and became part of the new coalition government after the [2000 parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2000). [Zoran Đinđić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoran_%C4%90in%C4%91i%C4%87), than president of the Democratic Party, became the [Prime Minister of Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Serbia) in January 2001, but was [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Zoran_%C4%90in%C4%91i%C4%87) in 2003, and the Party lost the power at the [parliamentary election later that year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2003). New president of the Democratic Party, [Boris Tadić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tadi%C4%87), won the [2004 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_presidential_election,_2004), and the party returned to power after the [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2007) and [2008 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2008). Tadić was [reelected in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_presidential_election,_2008), but both him and the Party lost the [2012 presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_presidential_election,_2012) and [parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2012), so the Democratic party became opposition party once again. [Dragan Đilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_%C4%90ilas), then-[Mayor of Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Belgrade) was elected new party president after the 2012 elections.  After the disappointing results in the [2014 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_parliamentary_election,_2014),  [Bojan Pajtić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Pajti%C4%87), [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Vojvodina) of the [Government of Vojvodina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Vojvodina) replaced Đilas as the party president.

At first, I decided to go for forming the kingdom of Germany, so I started taking duchies around me. Didn't even pay attention to Imperial Succession. Suddenly, the emperor dies, and I am elected emperor (seriously, I didn't care, when it happened I though ""oh, well that's just dandy). I guess the lords liked me. 


Anyways, after that, I decided to unite Europe under the Empire. I launched a series of holy wars into Pomerania, taking the whole Baltic coast up to Lithuania. I found it amusing to have a German Prussia this early. 

With my newly expanded empire, I decided to gain Lebensraum, and invade Poland. I invited a Polish claimant, gave him land, and pressed his claim. We won, and thus Poland joined our glorious HRE. I repeated this process with Denmark and Sicily. After that, I created an anti pope, pressed claim, securing the papacy as a vassal. 


At this point, the HRE has all of Italy-Sicily, Poland, Denmark, and Pomerania including Prussia. I pressed my boldest move yet, and launched a war for France on behalf if a now landed claimant, and won. After getting over the fact that I had kind of just replicated Hitler, I solidified the realm.


Crown Authority made its way to absolute. Primogeniture became the succession law. If we lost the empire, the Kingdom of Germany would permanently remain in the family as a backup. We consolidated, dejure drifted kingdoms, and had a long line of Great Emperors. 


Eventually, I decided that all of Europe must be part of my empire. The AI had formed Hispania from the Christian Kingdoms (from Sancho), and we had roughly the same manpower, seeing as he had invaded Africa, and taken huge swathes of land. I abused the claim duchy button, forcing my vassal the pope to give me claims on everything. At that point, I invaded Hispania, pressing all claims. I won, thankfully, through use of the mountains of Aragon. I took about 70% of Hispania, and spent the next 50 years mopping up and securing the peninsula.


To summarize, at this point, all of Western Europe is now mine (excluding England). I also took Norway and Sweden along the way. From Portugal to Poland, I ruled. I had begun invading Lithuania, to christianize it, and spread my benevolent regime there. Heck, and began invading Africa, and then won a crusade for Egypt. I began to make plans for inheriting Byzantium. Everything was going my way. Of course, we had succession crises, but we pulled through them. 


Then everything went wrong. I hated my heir, so attempted to switch back to elective to bypass him, then reinstate Primogeniture with the next generation. I accidentally clicked seniority. My heir, instead of my genius second son, became my 75 year old infirm great uncle, who steadfastly refused to die. My ruler then died from illness. The infirm ruler had terrible stats and traits, quickly provoking revolt. The empire disintegrated. All was lost.

Non. Il y a des gens avec des esclaves qui sont venus au Québec avec leurs esclaves.

C'est pas comme dans le sud ou ils avaient un système d'esclavage brutal et institutionalisé.

Ils devraient avoir l'été Indien de l'histoire des premiers peuples.

À peur près une semaine, pas tous les ans, ça serait représentatif du niveau de respect qu'ils ont eu historiquement. Pis au moins, il ferait toujours beau dans la semaine de l'histoire des premiers peuples.

Y'ont une parade là, c'est assez: nos foies ne peuvent pas tougher ça tout un mois.

The EU used the precautionary principle to forbid a number of pesticides who got linked to the mass extinction of honeybees. Due to the principle they can just do that, without it they'd have to pay dearly every time something like this happens and the settlement would be controlled by some arbitrators who don't have to publicize anything about the proceedings.

So obama couldn't do exactly the same thing? And you are all religious zealots, thats exactly what your country is based on. The pilgrim fathers left england, so they could persecute people on a religious basis! And if you think it's for anything else, then it show exactly how blinkered you are. 
As for your tech radar article, I didn't see that in our news, even once. I think someone may have made that up, like the fucking unicorn.

it's true that the power of the church lay in the emperor, or its client states. however, it was just after the formation of the eastern roman empire (byzantium), and the council of niceae, and then in 380 theodisius proclaimed all pagans/other religions heretics. the roman empire was pretty powerful at this point. they went on a murderous rampage in gaul, dacia, the middle-east, and elsewhere to convert them to christianity.

well, the peace of westphalia is some 1000-1600 years after these events of 0-600 ad. this was after the church had already lost control. the reason it lost control is because it tried to oppress its subjects through harsh serfdom policies (which, believe it or not are worse than slavery. the entire nation become slaves) other cultures in europe used to have voluntary military services, now you had one of the first forms of legal conscription, to be used against your own citizens. y u think roman empire chose this system? (because you can't enslave your own citizens, but you can serf them... if you give them a carrot on a stick...) it actually increased their access to cheap manpower. (also, no coincidence that the word serf is french, it was the evolution of the previous roman system) forget who it was who reorganized the roman legions, ah, the consul gaius marius circa 100bc. in any case, they were all murdering bastards, as were their contemporaries. nobody can actually tell if they were devout christians, or simply practiced the religion in word alone... more likely, they just used it as a tool to further their goals.

They came from a previous medieval game where the whole town (or college: princeton, yale, cambridge, etc.) would be split in two and had to move a ball from the center to the other side of town to win. It was relatively deadly and banned after a while, leading them to make a version where it was restricted to a field. The game was just to get the ball to the other side in any way just like its predecessor. However, rules soon made it safer and more fun. So in both the States and Europe there was a feet only version and a carry version. The carry version proved very popular to the blood savages in the U.S. while the fairies in England liked the feet a lot. So when it came to names, since they were all descended from the same sport, **they were all called football**. However, Americans referred to the English version as Association Football. Finding confusion in the two names similarity, they then adopted a British slang, 'Soccer', to refer to the As'Soc'iation version and not get them mixed up.

Those concepts don't really apply until the 20th Century police state, but ignoring that quibble, no, that isn't necessarily true. Those sorts of slaves existed under the Greek democracy period as well as the Roman Republic. Also, with regard to the Mongols, if you complied and paid tribute, they were one of the least oppressive societies in their time. Which isn't to say it was pleasant, just that drawing a line between oppressive society and free society doesn't work, because the grey area in the middle is much wider than the extremes where we can say a society was definitely one or the other. Were the Republics of Genoa and Venice free societies? Was the Old Swiss Confederacy a free society, where anyone who had a gun could directly vote in the Landsgemeinde local government, but technically being subject to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna?

It's folly to look at oppression as just a true/false condition of a society, even though we can definitely look at places like the Third Reich and say, yes, it was oppressive.

&gt;In a society like that, just about everyone is oppressed except the ruling class. It's just a matter of what type of oppression and what severity.

You're still drawing a line that separates rulers from ruled, like there's any sort of hard break. Oppression is never black and white, it's always about degrees and the intersections of different restrictions. Take this guy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pargal%C4%B1_Ibrahim_Pasha

Privileges: He was part of the ruling class elites. He was the head advisor to the sultan. He negotiated treaties of homage to the Ottoman Empire, and was a military commander, able to send the average Muslim troops to battle and death. While in the emperor's good graces, he was very well protected.

Restrictions: He was a kidnapped Christian child made into a Muslim slave to the emperor, had to do what duties he was given, and when the emperor grew tired of him, he was executed and his property seized.

Do you see the problem with your model of ""you're not really oppressed if you have privileges that make up for the restrictions?"" You can live an important or comfortable life as an oppressed person.

For another example, take the Jews in Europe. The gold standard of oppressed people. Yet in between pogroms, because they were able to avoid the Pope's restrictions on usury, they were frequently able to accumulate a good deal of capital and enrich their community, which in turn made them targets for expulsion and seizure and slaughter when a leader made bad financial decisions and needed an easy place to steal money from. If they were always just thought of as poor and scattered they would not have been targeted as frequently, which is to say, it's their (relative) periods of wealth and stability that are essential to understanding the history of their oppression.

&gt;I don't think the particulars of ancient civilizations, or even really Eastern civilizations have much bearing on this discussion. We are talking about modern western civilization, particularly, American culture.

We're talking about the concept of societal oppression, throughout history. The question of women being oppressed or not is not a question of interrogating just the last 300-400 years of Western society like racism is. I am pointing out the categorical error you have made and you are just repeating it verbatim. The concept of oppression being intersectional didn't change just because republics became more popular forms of government.

&gt;When someone says ""Women were oppressed because they couldn't own property or vote"" - I don't think bringing up the property and political rights of ancient Nordic society has any relevance.

However, the Russian Ambassador to the EU claimed that his country wasn’t actually formally invading Ukraine, even when Ukraine produced ten Russian soldiers it had captured in Ukraine.

For example, there's a crisis in Ukraine between Kiev and the self-defense forces (eastern side). This is an active civil war within the country. Let's take a look at that situation...

Kiev has been launching military offensives **against their own people** (including thousands of civilian casualties). They have been met with resistance and often times been caught flat-footed with serious losses. Why did this all start? Because the east refuses to accept Portoshenko as a legitimate ruler (pretty much a western-backed coup).

The Ukrainan economy is in the shitter, and the choice has always been ""warm up to NATO/EU"" or ""grow closer to Russia"". Many countries warned Ukraine to stay out of the EU, as they have buyers remorse on that deal. However, Portoshenko was quick to take the IMF bailout, practically selling his soul to the devil. This has given Kiev a huge loan under the condition they get the eastern side in line. However, Ukrainian military is really nothing to write home about and the self-defense forces are not just a rag-tag bunch of soldiers either.

Clearly there is a problem here that the West wants to solve, but cannot be so overt about it (at least not to the point of bombing Ukrainian locations). So they do the next best thing which is arming Kiev with supplies, but even that isn't working too great. Unfortunately, they can't use their textbook plays from the Middle East proxy wars here...

**CUE MH17 being downed!** The immediate shitstorm of media all accused the ""rebels"" doing it with anti-air supplied by Russia. The finger was already pointed and there wasn't even an investigation *mentioned* yet! Of course when the investigation did begin, the media quickly phased out the story. When Russia presented some pretty interesting evidence, the West shut up pretty soon after and cited YouTube and Twitter. I'm not even joking here...

This is the clear sign of propaganda here, *cui bono*? Obviously this would allow the justification for the West to give more lethal aid and potentially intervene directly. This all back to the key problem the West wants to solve: destroy the opposition to Kiev's puppet regime. Accuse Russia of intervening for *their* interested, and now you're allowed to intervene with your own!

If they actually gave a shit about people's lives they would find a diplomatic solution to Ukraine but instead they just want to ram their hegemony down everyone's throat.

Ukraine should have never taken that IMF loan (and likely would not have with their previous leader). The IMF gave them the loan, knowing full well that Ukraine has no real means to pay it back. Their economy is awful and their infrastructure is poor. They do not have a real practical way to make money and repay it, it will only lead to default. However, this is exactly what the IMF wants... because when it fails... they get to loot the country from the inside out. All that gold? Gone. All the actual infrastructure/production?

&gt; If an 18 year old wants to drink they will find a way to get alcohol, legal or not.

According to the Minnesota Student Survey, ever alcohol use and use in the past 30 days  have declined significantly since they first measured it in 1992. 18 year olds who acquire alcohol are the exception, not the rule. 

This decline, which I think we both agree is a good thing, didn't happen by accident. It's a result of decades of policy work by public health advocates, parents, teachers, and chemical health specialists. Social host ordinances, for example, were practically nonexistent in 1992. Throwing out a law just because an small number of people break it will very likely reverse this decline, and is a pretty bad policy in general.

&gt; Also, if you look at other European countries who's drinking ages are lower you don't see a significant spike in poor brain development among their youth.

The negative effects of alcohol on the developing brain are extremely well-documented. To my knowledge, there is nothing about European alcohol policy that contradicts this basic biological fact. 

I hear many references to the supposed success of the European model, and I'm skeptical for a few reasons. One, ""European countries"" isn't very specific. Does it include Eastern European countries? How do you measure the success of countries with a lower drinking age? Do they binge drink less as adults? Teenagers? Is alcohol dependency less common? Is less alcohol sold per capita? If indeed there are fewer problems with alcohol in countries with lower drinking ages, are we certain that it's attributable to that and not something else? The European alcohol market, and the regulations imposed on it, are probably quite different from models we see in the US - how comparable are we?

&gt; Introducing an earlier drinking age will instill more responsible drinking tendencies in young adults. 

[According to the CDC, earlier onset of alcohol use is associated with MORE negative health outcomes, not fewer.](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/underage-drinking.htm) This is also the case with tobacco and marijuana, and I suspect it's true for a lot of drugs. Young people who drink binge more frequently than adults - even 21 year olds. Compared to their peers, they are at higher risk for social, legal, and developmental problems. Many of these problems, such as the increased risk of sexual assault, would not be solved and may even be increased by implementing a lower drinking age.

&gt; More and more 18-21 year olds are living at home and if they get alcohol through illegal means they will likely not tell their parents. If they are given the ability to go out and drink legally, parents will be more inclined to teach them responsible drinking. 

This may be debatable, but I think there's no amount of ""responsible drinking"" when you're 18. In the field of public health, we know that younger onset is associated with a higher probability of abuse and dependence in the future. We know that the earlier you start drinking, the worse off your health outcomes are. As I said, people in Minnesota can enjoy alcohol for the vast majority of their adult life, and a higher minimum age means that people are more likely to have a healthy relationship with alcohol. 

&gt; Alcoholism is created by abusing the substance and if we teach the youth responsibility I can almost guarantee the amount of alcoholics in MN will decline over time.

We are teaching young people to use alcohol responsibly. We're also implementing policies that restrict access in other ways. (compliance checks, alcohol taxes, social host ordinances, etc) When we look at the data, we see that a big part of using alcohol responsibly is using it when you're older.

First, Eisenhower was the first and only supreme commander in the European theater the moment American feet touched European soil. At the Arcadia Conference, held a whopping 2 weeks after America formally entered the war, Roosevelt and Churchill decided to effectively combine chiefs of staff. Churchill understood that the US had all the leverage and he was in no position to make demands. Operations were based in Washington DC. I don't know of another time in England's history where a foreign general held command of their army. Put that in your tea and sip it.

Let's get to soviet tanks. They were actually pretty bad and were absolutely decimated by the Nazis early on. Ironically, their early tanks were based on British (Vickers) and American (Christie) design. In fact, there's a neat story probably partially based in truth and part legend about British and American tanks saving the Soviets. As Germany marched towards Moscow, they obliterated all but under a thousand soviet tanks. That much is fact. The Nazi's had a mech unit of 20K+ strong that diverted from Leningrad and headed for Moscow. The Russians received a supply of a few thousand British and American tanks literally days before the Nazi's entered artillery range of Moscow. While many of these tanks were destroyed in transit, enough made it into Russian hands to stall the Nazis long enough for winter to set in. By the time spring rolled around, the Soviets had gained ground back and bought enough time to get their production kicked into full gear and were outpacing Germany. The tides turned during that winter, in part due to British and American tanks bailing them out after their's proved no match for Germany's.

Now, if the Reds were so unstoppable, nobody told that to General Patton or Winston Churchill, who both wanted to engage the Red Army but were struck down by Eisenhower (he was the supreme commander, in case you forgot). Eisenhower had post war Europe in mind. Churchill had post war *globe* in mind, and Patton just wanted war, period. And he knew that the Allied forces were too much for an exhausted and thin of resources Red Army. You must not realize that much of their air and mech was imported by the US, UK, and Canada. That would be cut off if they were engaged. Also, the Russians entire army was in Eastern Europe while the US had massive forces in the Pacific which could have absolutely decimated a helpless eastern Russia before help arrived, if it ever did. The Reds might have been too much for America on the European front, but if you think the US would have just piled their entire army there you're crazy. They had a superior airforce and navy and would have used their placement of resources in the east to their advantage. ",,,1,0,0,t5_2s7tt,t3_2uge1e,1,1424243492,False,hillrock,AdviceAnimals,False

So any detailed exploration of different societal structures or conditions that don't exist in actuality could be termed just utopia. But this usage is lost, for its close to another greek (-derived) word, eu-topia, a good place. Or maybe it was ambiguous on which of those it means from the start.

So very strictly speaking, and in a way nobody does, eutopia should be the term for a perfect place/society.

Anyhow, dystopian would just be the negation of that word, so it can legitimately mean anything opposite to a true eutopia, be it so that it's a facade, admittedly a common trope, be it that it doesn't even seem like a good place.

* They have a shitty HDI of 0.435
* they have barely any doctors (1 per 100,000 people)
* horrible infant and maternal mortality rates 
* life expectancy is 53% 
* literacy rate is 23%
* they commonly practice genital mutilation
* marriage by abduction accounts for 69% of the marriages in the entire country
* terrible infrastructure throughout the country, just like any poor shitty African country
* Highest rate of traffic fatalities per vehicle in the world; that's right, more than Russia
* Lots of violent crime and no legitimate justice system you can count on, basically a [crime ridden shit hole hell on earth](https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=15316)

http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0501/ejvs0501article.pdf

this you're saying? A lot of words are marked as unclear here,

Linguistics isn't perfect. Even the Centum Satem shit is now being seen not as clear as it was.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substratum_in_Vedic_Sanskrit

IT's filled with so many assumptions.

&gt; The discovery that some loan words from one of these lost sources had also been preserved in the earliest Iranian texts, and also in Tocharian, convinced Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky that the source lay in Central Asia and could be associated with the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC).[3] Another lost language is that of the Indus Valley Civilization, which Witzel initially labelled Para-Munda, but later the Kubhā-Vipāś substrate.[4]

WTF! I mean actually WTF. The amount of assumptions involved here is mindboggling.

&gt; The Indo-Europeanist and Indologist Thieme has questioned Dravidian etymologies proposed for Vedic words, most of which he gives Indo-Aryan or Sanskrit etymologies, and condemned what he characterizes as a misplaced ""zeal for hunting up Dravidian loans in Sanskrit"". Das even contended that there is ""not a single case"" in which a communis opinio has been found confirming the foreign origin of a Rigvedic word"".[21] Kuiper answered that charge.[22] Burrow in turn has criticized the ""resort to tortuous reconstructions in order to find, by hook or by crook, Indo-European explanations for Sanskrit words"". Kuiper reasons that given the abundance of Indo-European comparative material — and the scarcity of Dravidian or Munda — the inability to clearly confirm whether the etymology of a Vedic word is Indo-European implies that it is not.

Equal opportunity is good. Equal rights are good.

Equal representation in games? I have no problem with it, and I don't think the vast majority of GG does either. I bet they're in favor. What I and others are having a problem with is the nature of how it's achieved.

My personal opinion is that it should be ""organic,"" by which I mean we just let creators make the choices they want to make. Get the corporate meddling out of the equation because ""make the protagonist a man because the demographic won't be able to identify with a women"" is insulting to us all. Get the people who want female leads out there to make their own games with female leads. *If they make a good game*, gamers will buy it. It doesn't matter what gender the lead is, what race the lead is, what species the lead is. If it's good people will play it. If it's a sincere work from the creators people will love it even more.

Yeah it's completely fair to express your desires for creators you're a fan of to do something you would like them to, but don't be aggressive or forceful about it. You're no better than the disconnected CEOs if you're attempting to push your own values and agendas on game devs and writers.

There are a lot of double standards that people don't like, too. The outrage when a single woman is harmed in a game compared to the countless number or men is an example. This gives the impression of insincerity. What sort of ""equality"" is it we're looking for here? Are we talking about a crazy Animal Farm deal where some are more equal than others? If you believe that's the current state of affairs, then I hope you can at least appreciate that changing which group is the *most equal* is not an option. *I* don't want that. I support equality, not flipping the status quo. Equality cuts both ways.

Yes, by all means, let's have some mansels in distress, gigolos to kill for cash, and a slew of dudes fighting in precarious thongs who might spill out at any moment but never quite do. The flip side of that is that this isn't equality unless there are absurd amounts of women soldiers gunned down along with the men and all the other unsavory roles that get shoved off to the nameless male mob characters who are used an abused without so much as as second look. If you want equality you can't care about one but not the other.

Finally: shaming. I'm about to go on a rant, so feel free to skip the rest of the post because it's mostly just bitching.

I see this used far too much and far too brazenly. Not just from Third Wave Feminists, but I see it a lot from them. Mostly *from* men who seem to feel guilty. If you feel guilty about being a man, suit yourself, but If you want to try to pathos me into supporting something by making me feel like the behavior of others is my fault, then kindly go fuck a chainsaw.

The actions of other men are not on my head. The actions of other Caucasians are not on my head. The holocaust is not on my head because of my German heritage. The pillaging and raping across Europe by the Vikings are not on my head because of my Norwegian heritage. I was born in the late 1980's. I didn't kidnap native Africans and sell them as slaves in America. I didn't gas any Jews. I didn't put Japanese Americans in internment camps. I didn't shoot anyone in Santa Barbara. I never hit or abused Rihanna. I've never intentionally caused serious harm to a person in my life.

If you want to say something to me like ""Men can do better than this"" then go fuck yourself. I am doing better. Most men are doing better. Men were not responsible for Elliot Rodger. Elliot Rodger was responsible for Elliot Rodger. At most the people close to him were the only others who could have potentially prevented what he did, *be they men or woman.*

Shaming will not get you the response you want. It only works on those who feel guilty. The rest of the people either overlook it or *respond poorly to your unjustified implications and attempt at manipulation.* If you want to ask for my help then learn to ask like a respectful human being, don't try to do it like a some Machiavellian asshole.",,,6,0,0,t5_3441a,t3_2ukz71,6,1424242041,False,Torden5410,AgainstGamerGate,False

The study linked to by OP is a review of the overall effects of cannabis to public and individual health, not a review of its potential medical benefits. The general evidence of the medical benefits of cannabis is overwhelming and well-documented in peer reviewed medical journals. 

European Journal of Neurology, March 11, 2001: Effective in treatment of spasticity. December 2004, the medical journal Pain, published by the American Academy of Pain Medicine: Effective in treatment of pain. European Journal of Medicine, March 2007: Effective in treatment of MS. Psychiatry Research, 2012: Effective in treatment of bipolar disorder. Those are a few of *literally hundreds* that can be uncovered with some quick Google-fu. The National Institute of Health approves its medical use. The Journal of Opioid Management published a meta-analysis of dozens of other papers in 2009 that came to the same conclusions.

At the same time, it remains among the safest drugs known, safer than aspirin, safer than caffeine. Not a single documented death or injury directly due to use, no possibility of lasting side effects without heavy, long-term use. The evidence is overwhelming: cannabis is safe, effective, proven medicine for a variety of conditions.

The franchise has become a cash cow and has lost a lot of talent and creativity it used to have. RE4 is one of the last if not the last good RE game to date. 5 was mediocre and 6 was just awful to the point its borderline unplayable. There is a number of non numerical secondary games in the franchise post RE4 that are all forgetful experiences. The GameCube did see an HD remaster of RE1 that is a good game but it is still just a rehashing and Code Veronica which is decent and is the swan song of the classic RE style camera and inventory before 4 modernized it. Unfortunately Wii saw a set of mediocre light gun RE games and 360 saw operation raccoon city which is an unfinished broken action shooter with no horror at all. 

RE 1-4 are great games that you should play if you enjoy survival horror games. Some of the others have some merits and played with interesting ideas but are otherwise skippable. I'd say RE5 is worth a play through but its an almost paint by numbers duplication of RE4 except in some random African shithole instead of some random Western European shithole. If given the choice I'd say the numbered iterations up to 4 and code veronica are worth your time give the rest a pass. 

The Gears of War comparison is sort of true but misinformed. Gears of Wars camera perspective was directly copied from RE4. They look similar in that respect but they play much differently. RE4 is the game that popularized the over-the-shoulder perspective most modern third person shooters use today and Gears was the first big AAA title to duplicate them in that regard. Creatively speaking there isn't much Gears did that wasnt conceptually stolen from other games. The camera perspective was from RE4 and the cover based combat was stolen from an old PS2 game called Killswitch. The only thing new Gears really did on its own is the active reloading thing.

How and why chess was created is unknown and remains a matter of conjecture.

&gt;As a guy who extensively studied the history of chess for a college degree I can say with confidence that the pieces of chess have underwent a constant evolution

People who study for college degrees usually write ""...have undergone...""

&gt;Thus the pieces included infantry (pawns), royalty (king), cavalry (horses), and castles (rooks)

&gt;I think bishops were introduced to signify the game more religious 

The Indian game of Chaturanga already contained the pieces that would become the pawn, rook, bishop and knight. Chatarunga translates to ""Four parts "" - the 4 divisions of classical Indian warfare were infantry (modern pawn), cavalry (modern knight), elephants (modern bishop) and chariots (modern knight). The game also had a Raja (King) and a general/counselor (Mantri) which subsequently became the Persian ferz and later the Queen.

&gt;Fastforward 500 or so years and the Queen of Castille (forgot her name lol) had a fascination for chess but she was disappointed that there was no female piece. Thus with the aid of her willpower and determination, she made the Queen and made it the most powerful piece on the board

Around 1300 the the power of the ferz was increased. It could now move 2 squares. The ferz had begun to be referred to as a queen in many places, centuries before either Blanche of Castile  or Isabella I of Castile were born. The modern movement of the Queen originated in Spain during the time of Isabella I. It has been suggested this was perhaps a tribute to her power - but the piece and her new moves are not considered to be inventions by Isabella.
The ""scacchi de la donna"" spread throughout Europe during the 16th Century.

I can find you studies that link every pesticide on the market to birth abnormalities and recommend that they all be banned.  But guess what? No one cares about one paper.  People care about scientific consensus and a weighing of risks. 

Removing over half of the pesticides that you use in the EU has real fiscal and health results. Suddenly losing a great deal of production *literally* means that people in 3rd world countries start to starve.  There is a balance to be struck here, and banning everything because one paper recommended further study is not a smart course to take.

And, lets be really clear here. No studies have been done.  The paper called for them.  They didn't link pesticides to anything.  They proposed that certain long term studies be done that could potentially link the pesticides to abnormalities.  And actually, its further than that... (they already do long term studies), they proposed that the long term studies that are already done be done a different way.

As for previous wars, if he's ~38 in 1940, that'd make him 18 during the end of WWI, so there's the potential for that, along with the German Revolution in 1918, near the end of the Great War. Also, the [Greater Poland Uprising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Poland_Uprising_(1918%E2%80%9319) has potential, and it's one year later, giving him more potential to be involved.

He could've fought for either side, most likely the German one, though.

The distance between Japan and Germany (a significant Amiibo hub in Europe) is ~9000km. It's only a few hundred km to any other major retailer in Europe. Japan to the US is ~10000km. This isn't *that* much farther. A bigger issue would be the cost of shipping Amiibo over sea versus over land, but I don't know which is more expensive. I do know air is by far the most expensive. I'm not sure these distance differences would has a significant effect. 

Nintendo's supply chains are in China for Amiibo, not Japan, if I read and understood that point about keeping things in Japan correctly. 

The Amiibo shortage is a *North American problem*, not a *United States* problem. Europe's population is not double NA (even if we leave out all of Latin America). On top of that, I imagine there are large areas of Europe (particularly Russia and some of the Slavic countries) where Amiibo are either sold sparingly or not at all. They could account for 150-175 million people, which brings the comparison between Europe and NA to ~575 million versus ~475 million (excluding all non Mexico LA). That's much closer than the stock differences would suggest. On top of that, have Amiibo not been more common in Australia than NA? (Granted not EU availability). Australia has 23 million people lol. 

Nintendo has *overall* not had stock shortages with their products outside of very popular introductory windows (See Wii as an example), until Amiibo and GC Adapters. (I'm leaving out MM N3DS and LE because those are preorders on ""limited items"" so we don't know what will happen yet). So, if these continue to be rare overall long past the launch window (and no, it has not been long past the launch window), it is most likely a combination of Nintendo not meeting demand (either because they can't and won't) and various shipping issues.

Anywhere where a governing body makes decisions that directly effect a group of people, that group of people should be involved in the decision making process.  I would argue that *all* governments make decisions that directly effect women -- even that are *about* women and women's bodies (e.g. birth control, abortion, etc.) --, so yes, there should be more women in governmental positions.  It's not as though women are any less capable than men in positions of leadership and putting more women in positions of power will bring the government down.  Having more diversity in our government and in other positions of power is crucial to understanding, respecting, and *celebrating* both the diversity and sameness of everyone.

Think of a situation where the genders were reversed:  Imagine a world where the *vast* majority of governmental officials were female.  If political decisions were being made about men and men's bodies, wouldn't you also want men to be better represented in that decision making process?

&gt; Also they are treated better in rape/divorce/self defense cases. 

In rape and self defense cases, the perpetrator should be punished according to the severity of their offenses, regardless of gender, and the victim should be supported, regardless of gender.  I recognize that this is not always the case, and that sucks.  

In an ideal world, this would be a non-issue because rape would not happen and self defense would not be necessary.  BUT the reality is that rape happens around the world on a daily basis, the vast majority of rape victims are women, and the majority of rapists never end up being punished for their crimes because rape victims are so often *blamed* for their own rape.

&gt; And what exactly women are missing in american/european society?

What are women missing?  
First of all, American and European society doesn't cover even half of the world's population, and I feel that women (and people) everywhere are responsible for working for rights and equality for all women (and all people).  
Secondly, whether or not men are aware of it and/or like to admit it, there is a thing called [""Male Privilege""](http://herschel.uci.edu/cmcasey/diversity/male_privilege.pdf), and that means that women are ""missing"" *a lot*.  To name a few:

* When equally qualified, women are less likely to be hired for a job than their male counterparts, even more so in STEM and business fields.
* Women are more likely to be sexually harrassed, and this is an issue in all environments, including in school, at work, on the street, online, etc.
* Women are still (often) scorned for being assertive and outgoing, which are often important traits to success.

Yes, obviously, not everything is perfect for men either.  (Among other problems,) Men are shamed and isolated for expressing any femininity - and the punishment is often more severe for men expressing femininity than it is for women expressing masculinity - and that is not acceptable.  There are plenty of men's issues that need to be addressed too, and I advocate for men's rights too wherever I can.

FA is an European based A3 community (but we have a fair amount of North American players), that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 19.20 UK time (That's 11.20 for PST). And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.
