I do not know how much power a Ninja 250 gives, but with my R3 i can easily do 160km/h (100mp/h) on the freeway. Though it's power is quite in the top end, for commuting and just riding casualy it still gives great power.

Other than that, the seating on it (unlike you'd expect from a R-series bike) is quite comfortable. I'm 1.95m tall (6""6') weight about 90 kilos (200lbs) and I fit quite good on the bike. You don't also lean over forward much.

Also it's very light. It's about 165 kilos (360 lbs). This makes it quite nimble and makes for great cornering. Also makes the bike easy to handle around your home/driveway.

Besides that, it's great for commuting in the form of lane splitting, because you can easily fold in the mirrors and the bike is as wide as your handlebars. I've done this numerous times when I got ""stuck"" in traffic.

The mileage is quite good also. When I'm just driving around I get about 25km/L (58.8mp/g). The tank size is quite small though, at 14L (3,7g). With that milage though you can easily do 180 miles + on a tank.

The dashboard also is quite complete. You've got the gear indicator which might help you out a lot in the beginning, also there are 2 meters for day trips, and an oil ODO meter, which helps you memorize when you'd last put oil in or lubed your chain.

There are some minor cosmetic things I do not like though of the R3, but that's personal preference. The turn signals are quite bulky and they had to make the fender insanely huge because of regulations (I think).

All in all a very complete and forgiving starter bike, though it's downside is there aren't much (if any at all) second hand, and you might have to buy a brand new one at 4,990$, and that's without the ABS. I have the EU version which has the ABS, but comes at a bigger cost.

[Here](http://gyazo.com/4f81cefae71e2a7f03764f854068617e)'s my Garen, the first character I played in League. Based Largely on [this](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Garen_5.jpg), but with a more traditional outfit and style.

From my Request: My game of choice would be Rocket League. I know a lot of people want this right now, but I’ll try to make a strong case for why I really, really want it.

Let’s start with my history. I played soccer as a kid. I live in the American South, where of course American football reigns, but half of my heritage is European. My dad was born in Florida (I live in Georgia) to German and Hungarian immigrants-- and of course, hence comes soccer. My grandfather was a coaching assistant for the Hungarian team in the Atlanta 96 Olympics, and my dad was my coach throughout my years of playing soccer as a kid. However, in all that time, I mostly played goalie. Why? Asthma. I’ve always had exercise-induced asthma, and with some incidents where I’ve stopped breathing entirely (one of which occurred several months ago and resulted in several days in the hospital and me missing the weeks leading up to my high school graduation), playing a sport with constant running like soccer doesn’t work out for me. I don’t play it at all anymore, for such reasons, and my athletic pursuits are rather casual.

I love soccer video games. My first smartphone was a Windows phone, and the game I played the most on it was probably PES. I’ve never owned a soccer game on PC- up until last year, my PC couldn’t really run ANYTHING with 3D graphics, but I eventually upgraded to a decent gaming laptop that can. I still play soccer-related stuff. Half my time in Battleblock Theater has been messing around with that basketball/soccer game in the arena, which is easily my favorite mode.

And of course the cars. The game of my childhood was Mario Kart DS, and I still play it, along with the Wii U version today. I love any kind of racing or car game-- Forza Horizon is by far my favorite 360 exclusive, and I still enjoy Motorsport 2. But what I really love is silly car stuff, as exemplified by my Mario Kart history. The first time a friend brought Burnout Revenge over to my house I fell in love with it, and the same goes for Burnout Paradise. Obviously, all of this is obviously combined with the soccer in Rocket League.

I first saw gifs of it and became obsessed. Yesterday I was over at a friend’s house and got to play it for the first time on PS4. It was exactly what I hoped for. The perfect blend of stupid fun and challenge, the ideal game to play with friends, the aforementioned who I could play with due to PSN and PC sharing the same servers, and another best friend is getting it on PC tomorrow. I would get such countless fun out of this game.

And of course, what of specifics of the game itself? It's beautiful. The graphics are clean, colorful, well-designed, and modern. The game is a joy to watch and play. It's functional. It controls simply and nicely, the gameplay is fast-paced and fun. The UI is efficient. It's developed well without game-breaking bugs or cutting corners. Everything about the games execution was done perfectly, and even a pathetic attempt at it's concept would have still given me great joy.

Picking up a controller and setting to work on it, it's more or less exhilarating. I wasn't good at all when I played, but it didn't matter. For every five times you boost and just barely miss the ball, the one time you jump and make contact is glorious. It's a game that lends itself to those accidental beautiful moments, when you somehow flip backward off a wall and catapult the ball into the goal, to declare ""That was intentional"" when everyone knows it wasn't. It's immediately accessible and enjoyable, but offer skills and practice that only time can give. A game to be played and mastered, with only fun and no grind along the way.

This has been on my wishlist since release. I honestly can't think of any game I'd enjoy more right now, even a 60 dollar AAA. If the devs were looking for a perfect target to enjoy their game, that person is pretty much me.

What of my finances? I can't say I'm poor or underprivileged. But I'm starting college in two weeks, my only job is an unpaid internship for work experience, and thanks to horrible healthcare based on preexisting medical conditions, my family had to spend thousands and thousands on my hospital bills from the incident I mentioned earlier. As much as I would love Rocket League, with everything else going on I just can't put 20 dollars toward it right now.

Like HungryGoerge mentionned, HK has many tailors and it's much better to get a custom fitted suit. A lot of them have fast turnarounds I hear.

Eles irão pôr um anúncio no netemprego / outros sites / jornais / etc. Depois disso recepcionam os currículos e o prazo entre a publicação dos anúncios e a contratação é mediante a urgência de alguém para a posição. Por vezes eles querem meter alguém à pressa e se não tiverem muitos currículos com os requisitos que eles procuram poderão sempre chamar para entrevistas pessoas com requisitos semelhantes (Engs. Mecânicos também são chamados para a posição, por exemplo).

Também temos uma base de dados (em excel) com uma lista de todos os currículos que já chegaram. Tem dados como Idade, nome, número de telefone e curso; Os currículos ficam arquivados fisicamente em caixotes mas quase nunca são consultados.

Apesar de já termos pelo menos umas 10000 entradas na BD, fico com a sensação de que são poucos os currículos que são enviados quando há uma oferta de emprego. Por exemplo uma oferta de estágio remunerado para Licenciados só apareceram uns 5 currículos e quase todos os candidatos eram muito maus. Um deles chegou a dizer à cara podre que a cena dele não era muito de trabalhar e que preferia mandar os outros fazer. E vejo muitas vezes alguns departamentos à rasquinha porque não encontram candidados e andam aí a perguntar a toda a gente se não se conhece ninguém que faça X.

Eles estão a cagar-se para datas de nascimento e fotos, há a falta de currículos e só importa que preenchas os requisitos deles. Evito fotos porque acredito que serve mais para prejudicar do que para ajudar porque pode fazer com que seja mais fácil julgarem-te pelas aparências. Tenta fazer um currículo minimamente sério, não use comic sans nem jabardes muito a não ser que queiras ir para alguma coisa relacionada com design.

Podes usar o padrão do Europass se quiseres simplificar o processo de criação do currículo, ninguém irá julgar-te mal por isso. Podes remover o campo da data facilmente.

Eu não sei como é que as gajas dos RH fazem mas não ficaria nada surpreso se fossem cuscar os facebooks das pessoas, apenas por curiosidade... mas parece é uma prática generalizada sempre que chegam currículos às mãos do meu departamento. Se fores gaja, vamos cuscar, podes ter bem a certeza! A vida naquela merda é demasiado monótona e temos de nos entreter com alguma coisa.

Some quotes from said article:

&gt; Führer of the German people, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Navy &amp;amp; Air Force, Chancellor of the Third Reich, Herr Hitler reaped on that day at Munich the harvest of an audacious, defiant, ruthless foreign policy he had pursued for five and a half years. He had torn the Treaty of Versailles to shreds. He had rearmed Germany to the teeth— or as close to the teeth as he was able. He had stolen Austria before the eyes of a horrified and apparently impotent world.(...)

&gt;  ...the figure of Adolf Hitler strode over a cringing Europe with all the swagger of a conqueror. Not the mere fact that the Führer brought 10,500,000 more people (7,000,000 Austrians, 3,500,000 Sudetens) under his absolute rule made him the Man of 1938. Japan during the same time added tens of millions of Chinese to her empire. More significant was the fact Hitler became in 1938 the greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today.(...)

&gt; It was noteworthy that few of these other men of the year would have been free to achieve their accomplishments in Nazi Germany. The genius of free wills has been so stifled by the oppression of dictatorship that Germany's output of poetry, prose, music, philosophy, art has been meagre indeed.(...)

&gt; What Adolf Hitler &amp;amp; Co. did to the German people in that time left civilized men and women aghast. Civil rights and liberties have disappeared. Opposition to the Nazi regime has become tantamount to suicide or worse. Free speech and free assembly are anachronisms. The reputations of the once-vaunted German centres of learning have vanished. Education has been reduced to a National Socialist catechism.(...)

&gt; TIME'S cover, showing Organist Adolf Hitler playing his hymn of hate in a desecrated cathedral while victims dangle on a St. Catherine's wheel and the Nazi hierarchy looks on, was drawn by Baron Rudolph Charles von Ripper (see p. 20), a Catholic who found Germany intolerable.

Mas, independente dele, o Romário é uma figura política que me preocupa muito. 

Ele cresceu muito, principalmente nas últimas eleições para senador, por falta de oposição e porque ninguém tinha grandes motivos para critica-lo.

Ele sempre baseou sua cabdidatura em 1) oposição a cbf, que não tem eleitor mesmo e 2) a situação da filha dele, e quem vai ser contra isso, não é mesmo?

O que eu quero dizer é que ele nunca se posicionou sobre nada, até onde o público sabe. Não sei dizer se ele é conservador ou liberal, não sei dizer o posicionamento dele sobre nenhuma questão importante. Sabiamente, ele nunca se permitiu ser fotografado do lado de Freixos e nem de Bolsonaros.

Ele é uma ficha branca, sobre a qual o eleitor pode projetar o que quiser. O que se possui de concreto é que ele defende crianças deficientes e critica a corrupção na cbf ( coisa mais louvável que ele fez IMO) e a situação do futebol.

Ele também foi um dos deputados que menos faltou sessões. Ok.

Mas o que ele fez? O que ele pensa? O que ele defende? Ninguém sabe. Não da nem pra chamar ele de incoerente.

Ele é carismático, grande parte da população do RJ adora as histórias dele faltando treino e sendo artilheiro, e ninguém pode apontar nenhum absurdo, então ele acaba virando um ""bom político"" porque ele vai à sessão. Outro dia eu vi um gringo no /r/soccer falando que o Romário tinha virado político e, pelo que ele tinha ouvido falar, até que dos bons.

E assim ele ganhou a eleição para senador com, se bem me lembro, 70% dos votos.

Agora sabe o que isso me cheira? Isso me cheira a PMDB. Nenhuma ideologia politica, nenhum posicionamento de fato, apenas uma grande disposição de seguir carreira política e negociar com quem estiver por cima. 

E, não para minha surpresa, saiu notícia sobre sua provavel candidatura como sucessor do Eduardo Paes para a prefeitura dl RJ. Podem anotar ai: promessas de saúde e educação genéricas. Daremos muita sorte se ele mencionar o transporte, porque se ele fechar com o PMDB significa que fechou com o cartel dos onibus.

Of the remaining 16, you have five decks that only topped once, to decks that topped twice, and one deck that topped seven times. So what you're showing me is that during that format, the only deck that had a chance against dragon rulers was ""literally just fuck dragon rulers"".dek

And I think the biggest thing you're ignoring is that, the reason we see the same decks topping over and over again is because there are a variety of them and they vary in play style. Back in the DRuler format, you probably had a ton of people playing Fire Fists, Madolche, Geargia, etc. because those decks were new at the time. As a deck gets older, people lose interest. Obviously there are still going to be some people playing those decks, but it's far fewer. And a lot of the best people that played those decks did so because they specifically didn't want to use DRulers, or the ""best deck"" or something like that. Which means, when Nekroz is the best deck, you have a ton of people playing the other good decks of the era. The main difference is that Shaddolls, BA, et al. are closer in power to Nekroz than Fire Fist, Geargia, et al. were to DRulers. 

The biggest flaw in your argument is the fact that you think that random top = that deck was good/viable in the format. That's not the case. People have to play 9 rounds to make it to day 2, then 3 more to make top cut. That means you only have to play 12 games to make it into the top 32. For starters, you're mostly showing me European events, which are often (though not always) smaller than US events. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that someone could get an early draw and then slip under the radar, always playing down until the late rounds in the tournament. Essentially, it's possible that of those 12 rounds, 4-6 of those rounds could be basically free. Which means you really only have to do well in 6-8 games, or given that you can give up a game or two, more like 5-7 games. All in all, you need to have (about) six good games. That's not a very big sample pool at all. If a large number of people were running Fire Fists or Evilswarm (quite likely; the deck was much cheaper than DRulers) then it's entirely possible a few of them will slip through the cracks. And that's exactly what happened. 

Given, then, that we have the best deck of last format in Nekroz, and then we had Burning Abyss, Shaddolls, Qlis, and Tellars as similar ""rogue"" decks, we saw a lot of them topping. That just means that the rogue-margin in that format was a lot slimmer than the rogue-margin in the DRuler format. The reason that people have not been topping with those decks these days is not because they were good enough to beat DRulers and not good enough to beat the current decks, it's because *not many people are playing them*. The numbers are not in their favor. If as many people played Fire Fists as they currently do Shaddolls, then we'd probably see the anomalous Fire Fist top as well. But we don't. We see more Shaddoll tops because Shaddolls are closer to power in Nekroz than Fire Fists were to DRuler. 

Again, I have to reiterate that I'm not arguing that you're necessarily wrong. It's possible DRulers, if they were only allowed to be their own deck without 95, would not have a significant impact on the game right now. But I am pointing out that your reasoning for why DRulers are ""weak"" compared to today's decks is inherently flawed. I can't comment on your conclusion, but the manner in which you reach it is unreliable. "

However, lots of people here are insecure about Europe's place in the world, and clearly have a desire to be more nationalistic/proud of the EU without actually turning into the US or a United States of Europe. It creates a quandary for a lot of posters here since they clearly want to express a degree of European nationalism, but also feel guilty about the idea and don't want to invite comparisons to American patriotism (the horror!)

Having pride in one's country is the idea that you accept the good things as products of your system, and also acknowledge the failings and work to fix them. I'm under no delusions that the US is perfect or even anywhere close, but I love this country because I've seen how we can put aside our differences and work together to get things done during times of crisis. I think that unfortunately a lot of Europeans don't have that same attitude when it comes to completely separate countries in the EU (as evidenced by the rhetoric surrounding the Greek crisis), which makes it hard to feel that same collective pride. It makes a lot of the downvotes and the comments here fairly aggressive when the issue of union-wide problems come up, which isn't great for those of us who want to rationally discuss topics.

The two primary empires settling here are **Biryl** and **Rostam**, which are located roughly 750 miles due east across the Cyndral Sea.  Biryl and Rostam are ancient rivals (think England/France) with ancestral claims to each other's lands and titles.  Both of these empires were actually colonies of Kallxenia thousands of years ago.  So in reality it's not so much of a colonization as it is a ***re***-colonization.

There are and have been settlers from just about every nation in the known world, however. Immigration is highly encouraged and welcome, as both nations and their parent empires are eager to populate the land and develop a self-sufficient economy/military, as these are ultimately the greatest defense against potential attacks from the Blighters and other fiends.

There are also intrepid pockets of Halflings, Dwarves, and even Gnomes in just about any major town here, as well as humans of different, more exotic nationality from all over the world.  Krul-Dun (located near the mountains, west of the Tarkesa archipelago), is the only primarily non-human city.  It is a Dwarven colony.  They were allowed to colonize and maintain their autonomy on the treaty-bound condition that any and all exports must pass overland to Triumph city, and thence shipped from Crownhaven, and thus be subject to proper (read: heavy) taxation.  As could be expected, the smuggling of Dwarven handicraft and weapons, primarily via the rather shady town of Lyrseport, has become something of an industry itself! 

**&gt;Why? What benefits does it have (luxury commodities, religious motivations...)?**

The initial push back into the lost lands of Kallxenia was almost wholly religious.  Roughly 1,000 years ago, a new monotheism swept across Biryl and Rostam, and within a few short generations almost all civilized peoples converted.  The Church now wields power comparable to, or perhaps even eclipsing, most kingdoms, akin to Catholicism in high middle-ages Europe.  When the Church declared a Holy War to reclaim the Blighted Lands, about 300 years ago, neither Biryl nor Rostam could avoid throwing their military might behind the effort- not without significant loss of prestige or even clerical censure.  The great bulk of the knights and lords in their realms would have heeded the call of the Church with or without imperial blessing anyway.

Additionally, there is also a sort of ""church"" for the arcane arts in this world, called **The Arcanium**, which exerts similar political clout.  They also have a vested interest in reclaiming these lands, for many ancient secrets and magical formulae lie buried in the ruins and spread throughout Kallxenia.

All in all, however, the primary political motivation is a combination of imperial rivalry and one-up-manship, not to mention self-preservation.  Ultimately no one is comfortable with an entire continent of shadow fiends resting comfortably just a few weeks travel across the sea, and the opportunity to finally strike a sustained blow against this evil blight is such that even bitter rivals can put some differences aside... or at least make sure the other party doesn't gain a significant monopoly or economic advantage once the dust settles.

I've made it a point to make a number of luxuries available to encourage settlement and development, as well.  There are great mineral deposits in the mountains, including ""mithral,"" which is an important metal in a fantasy game. Mussel Lake is the home to a unique water creature with bone fins and teeth that are highly valued for skrimshaw, which is why so many settlements have sprouted on its coast.  Strikenwood is the only known location to find a certain type of tree whose wood is twice are durable, yet half the weight of anything found in the ""old world,"" and is ideal for ship building.  There are many other fanciful examples I won't bore you with.

The lands of New Biryl are also particularly fertile, and it could rightly be said that it has become something of a ""bread basket"" for Biryl itself.  Grain  is by far the primary export.

And, of course, there are many, many ancient artifacts to be uncovered from the fallen civilization, not to mention from the otherworldly creatures of the Blight itself.  I.e. the land itself is a shangri la for would-be adventurers and treasure seekers, and all of the ancillary support economy they might command.

**&gt;What colonial nations/identity have formed?**

I'm still toying around with this.  New Biryl is the focal nation of the campaign, but I can't quite decide whether it should be an independent kingdom that only pays homage to it's founding Empire (Biryl), or to just make it a colony.  I'd really like to put an actual ""King"" in the capital city, Triumph, for story reasons.  I'll probably make him a king, but technically he pays homage to (and recieves support from) the Birylian Emperor.

Noy Rostam to the south is in a similar situation.  The actual people in both nations speak the language and generally have the culture of the parent empires. However, many have been living in the ""colonies"" for generations, and have come to view themselves as more ""New Kallxenian"" and in truth have little loyalty towards distant emperors, or care little for events in the Old World to the east.

Tensions between the two nations are real, but not terribly dangerous.  Generations of trade, a common unifying faith, and a mutual enemy of surpassing evil (The Blight) have brought them together, and some border towns can't be said to be Birylian nor Rostami, but a melting pot of both cultures.  Example:  The town of Draquay, which is a major trade node connecting the different nations, is known for it's distinct pidgin language and dialect, a combination of Birylese and Rostami.

It does seem unlikely today, but when civilization is literally at stake we have to expand our sense of what's plausible. We're at a very strange time in history — what [Chris Hedges calls an interregnum](http://www.salon.com/2015/06/04/we_are_in_a_revolutionary_moment_chris_hedges_explains_why_an_uprising_is_coming_%E2%80%94_and_soon/). Things can change quickly, and already conventional political wisdom is shifting under our feet. Witness the sudden rise of leftist political movements all over Europe, in Canada, and the U.S. in the past year, in reaction to austerity policies since 2008. I don't expect Bernie Sanders to win the American presidency, but at this early stage of the 2016 election cycle his rise seems to represent a major generational shift brewing in American politics toward democratic socialism, and governance that is responsive to economic and ecological crises. Of course things might go horribly wrong in the years to come, but it's too early to say there's no way out of how screwed we seem to be.

Cloud9 are undoubtedly the best team in NA even with a somewhat shaky performance last weekend against CLG at the CEVO Finals, but then again, CLG knows Cloud9 better than fnatic, Na'Vi, and nV do. The reason for that is in prior tournaments, EU teams didn't really know what to expect from them. Now that they have figured C9 out, I think we wont see C9 putting up numbers against some of these top EU teams. Anyway, Cloud9 have had huge improvements and are still the favorite coming in. They shouldn't have a problem beating Noble here.

**Noble** 

Not everybody knows about this team. They didn't look too great in ESEA premier losing to Lunatik, SKDC, and Leader-1 at the end of season 19. They failed to make playoffs finishing 11th. Recently, they lost to neXup 16-9 which was somewhat of an upset but it was a BO1. This is definitely a roster with potential, but I don't see them winning this match up against C9. 

**Summary**

Cloud9 are the stronger team for sure. Noble have potential, but probably wont win this match-up. Expecting somewhere around 16-7 16-8 for Cloud9. 

**Risk**: Medium/Low

**My Odds**: 85/15 Cloud9

**My Bet**: As of right now this game hasn't been posted on CSGL. If the odds are over 90 for Cloud9 I would just throw an ICB on Noble. If they're around 85/80 for Cloud9, I would max on C9.

Law until the regicides of 1793... 

As for the Rus', with the rise of tsarism after the decline of the Golden Urda in the 15th century, ultimately with the establishment of the Muscovite autocracy through ""reign of terror"" against conservative aristocrats under Ioan IV, the claim to legitimize  comes nothing short of Russia being the Third Rome after the fall of the Empire in 1453, which left medieval Eastern Christianity without a capital. one of the founding legends of the Rus' in the wake of the Christianization of Kiev, was a historic bond, the matrimony between great prince Vladimir and Byzantinian princess Anna in 988, tying the Ryurik dynasty to the now vacant Holy Throne at the Golden Horn - through matrilinear progression. what a twist. needless to say, this claim has never been recognized by any other Christian European ruler.

now, philosophers of more modern times have thought of new ways to legitimate power, and you may or may not argue whether grassroot movements like the Enlightenment or Early capitalism together with an altered socioeconomic landscape and the Industrial Revolution, have a role to play in the change of state of the aristocracy all over europe in the 1600s-1700s. 

in that regard, patriarchy was less extreme in Russia than in, say, the remainder of Europe. we would have likely had seen strong female Ryurikov regents arise if the country had not, like immediately after the fact, entered a time of turmoil with foreign opposition suppressing and controlling the fate of the nation for five decades, regional patriarchal warlords rising and returning the power to the Duma of the Boyars. an interregnum that ended only one generation prior to the birth of Ioan V, Sophia I, Peter I.

There's Civilization 5, it's easy to learn and get into. Loads of fun!

There's also Europa Universalis 4, it's basically a history simulator where you play as a country anywhere in the world from the 1400s to the 1800s. I call it a simulator because there isn't an end goal, you just play as a nation and you can do whatever that nation could do back then. If you're into politics and history I'd recommend it.

And NOW I'm going to rant about my favorite game/simulator/thing ever.

Crusader kings 2 is by far my favorite, it's made by the same company as Europa Universalis. I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for but I LOVE it. It's a medieval dynasty simulator/game. You play as a dynasty in dark age Europe or Asia in the mid 700-1400's it's incredibly detailed and gives a great glimpse into how medieval politics work. Think of it like Game of Thrones in Europe. You can start off as small and insignificant as a minor count in England, or as powerful as the Byzantine emperor. You find a suitable marriages for yourself and your family, forge alliances, rule your realm, wage war over land claims, fight the infidels, form factions with other counts and dukes to force your king to bend to your will (or face rebellion), and many many other things! The game is filled with THOUSANDS of characters, every county of land across the world is held by someone and you can potentially interact with all of them! Most people are randomly generated but some are historically accurate, and every one of them has different traits that determine how they will behave! Each one has their own goals and ambitions and is scheming to accomplish them!

It gives so much insight into how different medieval governments work. If you play as a powerful king or emperor then you learn how to manage an empire full of ambitious nobles, you learn how to keep them under control, what to watch out for, and how to forge a stable realm. OR you get to learn how a massive powerful empire shatters and crumbles... If you're a minor lord, then you learn how to scheme and use diplomacy to increase your own power. Sometime I like to just kick back, turn up the game speed, and just watch the nations across the world rise and fall. Whenever I play I get some sort of awesome political story that would fit into a fantasy setting or real world history. 

I've only scratched the surface here, I've got nearly 500 hours logged in the game and I still haven't done everything. Do be warned though, the learning curve is basically a vertical line.. So you might want to look up some YouTube videos before you consider buying it.

Edit: plus there's mods for Crusader Kings like Game of Thrones which let you play as a house in Westeros or Essos. I think there's one for Tamriel too, but I haven't played it.

A lot of European countries have very progressive tax rates on cars, placing especially steep taxes on cars with high CO2 emissions. Europeans don't really mind it, because it's good for the environment and we have good public transport, so it doesn't hinder too many people. For example, I never drive to downtown here in Helsinki; it's simply way faster, cheaper, and handier to take the bus or a streetcar/tram. I don't *need* a car, but I still want to have one.

I would caution, though, that you've got 8 or 9 pages here--the *first* 8 or 9 pages that the reader will encounter--and yet the only promise we have of all this jam tomorrow is external to that, i.e. in the comments you've made in this thread.  Your readers are only going to get to that tomorrow if they make it through today first.

Knowing what I know now about your intentions with the rest of the book, I went back and reread this, and I must confess I didn't see that future reflected here.

I want to quickly substantiate what I said about the narrator's overly obliging relationship to Henrik with two examples.

The first is the paragraph beginning with ""As the last of the smoke leaves him.."" Reread this, and the answer for yourself the following four questions:

* why is it important that Henrik be handsome?

* why does the reader need to know this?

* why does this simple fact require a full paragraph to be conveyed?

* why does this paragraph need to be so long and gushing?


That's an easy and obvious example.  The second example is slightly more insidious, but also more common throughout the piece.

Take this sentence:
&gt;“What do you want to be when you grow up?” she asked once, hardly knowing the enormity of the question. Henrik takes a deep breath, momentarily flaring the ache in his head, and loses himself in the rising heat of the morning.

&gt;“I want to be happy”, he had replied.

This is a perfect example of what I mean by the narrator nodding sagely along with Henrik.  The narrator does not tell us that Henrik finds the question enormous (a 'finding' that is common to every sixth-former ever), the narrator tells us that the question *is* enormous.  This might be mock-seriousness, but we can't read the sarcasm so it just comes across as po-faced.  And then Henrik answers with the most dripping, Hallmark-endorsed response, and his young sister's reaction is to contemplate this with seriousness and credulity.  

That's what I mean about Henrik being unchallenged.  The narrator seems to endorse his opinions by voicing them for him, and the world of other characters and events also obliges him, never pointing out what a pompous ass he's being.

Sure, that's coming later.  But we need a bit of that now, early on, to keep us engaged until we reach that later.  Even if that's achieved from just making the narrator slightly more detached from Henrik.

Now I know that you plan to challenge this chapter later, I can afford to be more brusque.  This chapter reads like adolescent male wish fulfilment.  A central/eastern European city, a pack of Gauloises, a dog-earred copy of Musil, and art-houses stuffed full of obliging little Sabinas on every street corner.  The main character is quirky and misunderstood, but handsome.  He thinks cleverly about modernity and reads his Shelley and everybody keeps agreeing with him about how clever he is.

And these first 8 or 9 pages give me little hope that this will ever stop being adolescent wish fulfilment. And without that hope, what reason do I have to read on to the 'later' where this is all sorted out?

That's all I need.  You can keep the obnoxious protagonist and all his airy thoughts.  I just need some sign here in the opening that there's something else to come.

And, yes, in so far as 50.01% of companies would be owned by the workers, yes it's socialism. I could make that figure 49.99% but I'd rather get the far lefties on board with a technicality. This is a socialist thought experiment (albeit a free market one, what's known as libertarian-socialism).

On the ""govt gets power"" thing... No more than it has today. This happens against a background of something close to our current political setup. This goes behind a constitutional shield that protects the two rules above, and ensures the tax revenue goes directly into the scheme, that the govt. can't change with the usual ""2/3rds of everyone and his dog"" amendment rigmarole. Under the constitutional screen political life continues as normal, only the thought experiment above is protected by the screen. Both the tax and its distribution.

&gt;Governments can't run anything, and they can't agree on anything. I made the example earlier that the closest example of nation states cooperating was the EU and said that there will never be a common security and foreign policy.

Well, things like NATO show you can have coordinated security policy, and the EU coordinated economic policy (whether it's well coordinated....). But this question is usually why I specify this is implemented by a hegemon. As the British ended the slave trade, unilaterally, as an example.

That hegemon could be a ""world government"" or a ""coalition of revolutionary States"" or even just a ""hyper-power"" as the U.S. Is t present and the UK was in its time. The hegemon would have to have sea superiority (as the U.S. Does today and the UK did) and then it would have the ability to use trade barriers, blockades etc. to enforce the international order. No estate tax ? No access to international trade and goods.

&gt;You dismissed this as if what your theory did fall within that, despite that I was making an example about how nation states don't cooperate. Beyond that, economic and tax agreements are the core of foreign policy after military these days.

Well, it could be done nicely by agreement. But it could also be done by force on an international scene.

If we presupposed something like today's world.... But the U.S. And EU fall to a wave of revolutionary movements (a red spring ?) that agree to go into this scheme... And they agree to use the U.S./EU militarises to enforce trade barriers for non-entry... Then it can work as a viable scheme. South America and Africa have to come in. As does oceana more or less. Then it's whether Russia-India-China want to form a breakaway bloc or join. I'm guessing, given where all the high tech goods and economies are, you'd probably end up with everyone in excepting the Chinese. Maybe the Russians, if they really want to wear the hair short to protect their rich.

And if all this sounds implausible.... Imagine describing today's democratic and human rights system to someone around 1640 or so. How the Kings will fall, the people will take power, but they won't vote themselves all the money, etc etc

Just like this, from that frame, democracy would look impossible and full of holes. As a thought experiment I'd be scoffed at by monarchists. ""It'll never work"", they'd say ""take this leebril-deeemocraci idea away, far too pie in the sky"".

New paradigms always look weird. This is the equivalent economically of the ""dictatorship by king -&gt; Democracy"" paradigm shift in politics."

Due to expensive flight tickets and that I am still studying, I can only travel to Hong Kong every 3-4 year. My parents aren't very rich so we stay at my aunt's place every time my family travels to HK. It's a house in a village in New Terrorities and we had to take green minibus to get back to the downtown. This has given me a chance to experience HK in different perspectives. As a European, who has lived in a colder climate with monotonic landscape since birth, I already miss HK's architecture and mountains. I love how the huge population allowed me to meet people with different styles instead of seeing a messed up undercuts everywhere. Just taking a MTR felt like watching a fashion show, making HK as a huge source for inspiration and a good way to broaden my horizon. While locating in Asia, you could easily buy weird/interesting/funny stuff that you couldn't even thought about for cheap. I sweat a lot and my skin gets irritated easily so the climate isn't the most suitable for me, especially during the summer. I disgust dirty places like some cha chaan ten(?) with run down appearance. Salesmen and waiters attitude have got worse. Most of them look like they are so fed up and annoyed by everything. Some don't even bother to help or sell anything to you. 

Despite living my entire life in Europe, I somehow still feel HK as a place where I should move to when I get older. A few years ago I wanted to move to HK when I graduate. I still do, but the lower salary, high competition in everything and expensive apartment prices are still a huge turn off. This time I visited my cousins, almost every one of them told me to stay away from moving to HK. It was also pretty gruesome to see how some people are struggling to live while the prices keep going upward. 

I am an introverted person who loves observing other people and experience different sceneries. I could sit in a bus for an entire day to watch how people switch buses before the Tai Lam tunnel, ships moving, planes preparing to land or have just took off. My family came to Europe alone leaving all my relatives to HK. One of my burden has been that I don't know what to do with my parents when I get older. Should I suggest them to stay with me or go back to HK? They can't speak the language properly here so there would be a difficulty for me to move out when I get married and leave them alone. If they decided to move to HK, I don't even know where could they accommodate since my aunt's place is getting crowded due to grandchildren and wouldn't be very appropriate to live there even though being very close with us.

Does anyone know if Elements' (圓方) toilet flush automatically within a certain period? One time I was sitting in a toilet and it flushed by itself making the toiler water splash on my butt cheeks. There was a sensor to flush the toilet beside it but I didn't touch it. Just wondering whether the sensor is really that sensitive or does it just flush by itself if the toilet can't sense any movement. "

Juncker lokt vrouwen met zware portefeuilles

Vrouwelijke kandidaten hebben meer kans om een zware portefeuille binnen te rijven. Dat valt te horen binnen Europese kringen nu Reynders in poleposition ligt als kandidaat-commissaris, dat meldt De Standaard. Commissievoorzitter Jean Claude Juncker zit namelijk met een probleem. Om zijn ploeg door de hoorzittingen van het Europees parlement te loodsen heeft hij minstens evenveel vrouwen nodig als Barroso. De voormalig Commissievoorzitter haalde negen vrouwen binnen bij de Commissie. Maar drie maanden na de EU-verkiezingen telt het team van Juncker nog maar vier vrouwen in het gezelschap. Daarom zwaait hij nu met zware portefeuilles voor vrouwelijke kandidaten.

Operation rolling thunder: B-52's carpet bombed the north hoping to prompt a capitulation. Unfortunately, this was a failure as evidenced by American retreat and the fall of south Vietnam in 1975. 

In Iraq, specifically faluja, the U.S. Took the gloves off with very little tangible results. The bombing campaign in Afghanistan was so effective that targets had to be re bombed because no more targets were available. Is victory within grasp in Afghanistan? Certainly not , as evidenced by the continued presence of American troops.



The global strategic balance has undergone considerable changes since 2008, the US economy suffered its most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression; recovery has been slow. With the retreat of the eight year war in Iraq and the sun setting on the 12 year bleed in Afghanistan, the US is being forced to reduce both domestic and defense budgets. Whether anyone wants to scale back the armed forces or not, reductions are coming--this myth of American invincibility will be torn down in the coming years.





""According to the 8 July edition of the Army Times, senior leaders have announced they will reduce the US army from the current level of approximately 535,000 down to 490,000. The unequivocal result: a smaller and less capable army. Many military leaders warn that these cuts will have a hollowing effect ""putting our national security at risk"", (pdf) as General Odierno told a Congressional panel in February 2013, and imply there are no other alternatives.""

There was a fantasy book I read recently consciously riffing off the 'Ruritanian' stereotype of Victorian literature, but I found it rather bad because the dehumanising tropes were played far too straight (two dimensional forelock-tugging, coltish peasants, the cackling evil tsarist landlord etc). The net result was that the WASP-equivalent characters were the most well-realised, and the book fell right into the sort of 'othering' that I've really tried to avoid in my own work writing within a Russian-Polish-*Mitteleuropa* setting. (The female POV protagonist, writing her memoir, was the most well-realised character and even the WASP men were stereotypes, but the book was bad in a number of ways. The first half was very well-written. The second half was awful, so I suspect the editors gave up halfway through.)

I know what she was trying to do, but the literary narrative has moved on when portraying non-Anglo cultures and so it collapsed in a heap. The author had also written two more books in the series, set in other non-European cultures, and after she butchered Eastern Europe like that, my appetite to read the rest of the series waned completely. I mean, between books she could have revamped her ideas and been really sensitive to the cultures her heroine was exploring...but I'm not fussed about finding out where that's been the case."

It covers a bunch of WW1 stuff but basically apparently the consensus among historians is that Versailles's failing was that the Entente failed to deal with the Germans acting in bad faith.  
The post war hyperinflation was due to poor Imperial German fiscal policy of printing money to pay for the war by backing it up with hypothetical annexations and taking out more loans than all the Allies combined, along with Reichsbank President Rudolf Havenstein deliberately sabotaging the postwar German economy out of spite. The Weimar Republic recovered rapidly once he was replaced by Hjalmar Schacht and they had growth until the Great Depression, which makes sense considering the fact that they and Britain were the only European powers to emerge from WW2 not in ruins.

Most Americans work 9 to 6, and lots work much more. There are plenty in the US working 60 to 80 hours per week. Norway works on average 33 hours per week, and other European countries look similar.

And we take two week vacations per year... lots less, lots none at all. Germans get 6 weeks federally mandated weeks per year. That's unheard of in the US.

And there is some serious abuse of poor workers in the states, and there are a lot of poor workers in general.

One worker had never taken vacation for 10 years then asked for 2 weeks. Didn't happen, and she basically threatened that she'd fire him if he tried to take it... even though technically he accrued much more than that.

From conversations with some Norwegians, who I'm fairly sure have it easier than most of Europe, you guys are taken care of, especially in terms of minimum wage, vacation, sick time, maternity/paternity leave. A lot of American workers here get treated like absolute shit, sometimes legally, and a lot illegally as well.

I know there are a lot of hard working Europeans out there, but don't take vacation for granted. A lot of us here can't afford it, and a lot can't even request it. If you come to the US for your vacation and you tell Americans you're on your 4th week off, you're going to convince us we work harder regardless of what you do. It's seen as a huge luxury to most Americans. Just being able to afford a week long vacation is a luxury.

&gt;According to Social Security tax records for 2011:

&gt;151,380,749 wage earners (had earnings in 2011)

&gt;50 percent of US wage earners made less than or equal to the median wage, estimate to be $26,965

&gt;66 percent of US wage earners made less than or equal to $41,211.36

I think what it boils down to is we have a shit minimum wage and there are a lot of people making shit for money. The median wage is $27k per person. 27 fucking thousand. That's barely enough to survive in most places. When you're poor, you work your ass off to survive.

Please don't take offense. I know a lot of you guys have it hard as well. You can't make blanket comments about Europe about something like this, but there are some work-life balance standards in specific European countries that I can promise you Americans do envy. It's much easier on the tongue to say ""we work harder"" than to say ""we wish we had 6 weeks mandated vacation and Germany has it better than us in that respect""."

Germany relied on imports from the Americas to feed its population. During the Moroccon crisis Britain suddenly proclaimed that in case of conflict on the continent it would blockade whomever it viewed as more dangerous and stop all trade.

So from German perspective (a very young nation that was the play field and battleground for the other European powers for centuries) they were between a rock and a hard place.

Farnborough Airport is one of Europe's most exclusive airports. It was literally built to cater for rich private jets and has five star facilities to cope with them and their passengers. I was a bit of a plane spotter in my youth, and saw the private jets of every Arab royal family there is fly into Farnborough, and private jets like this one land every 5 minutes. 

Blackbushe, on the other hand, is an utter dump. It's best known for a Sunday market where back in the day you could get knock off DVDs, but now only sells cheap plastic shit. The flying facilities are only used by a flying school and for flying enthusiasts who own small, two seater planes. It has zero immigration facilities (meaning no flight coming from outside the UK should land there) and the 'terminal' is basically a concrete shed. 

There's no reason to land at Blackbushe for safety reasons either, as not only would a plane with terminal engine failure still be able to glide into Farnborough, but the fire and rescue facilities at Blackbushe are nothing like they are at Farnborough. 

This is why pretty much every local person's first thought will be why on earth are they landing at Blackbushe? There may well be a perfectly reasonable explanation, but I don't understand why people seem to have a problem with locals pointing out its an extremely odd place to land. "

My family owns a couple investment properties but my uncle is the one who does like 95% of the maintenance (yard work, plumbing, electrical, heating/cooling, hot water, etc.) and paperwork and such and the rest is specialized stuff that we hire contractors for.

Now, as for renting vs home ownership. Look at Europe, a lot of people just rent. Not only that but you're more mobile to be able to take promotions and region transfers if you need to move elsewhere without having to deal with real estate agents and mortgages and all that. In fact a good friend of mine is a Senior Software Engineer at a large company and easily makes $200k a year and he even still rents just in case there's opportunities and he finishes out his lease then moves.

Hope this makes you feel better about renting. If not just look on the personal finance sub reddit and take a look at the rent vs own discussions. IMO in most cases it makes sense to rent. Even for myself I don't intend to purchase the property for at least 5-10 years down the line."

This isn't true for the bottom 90% of the US.  GDP is only an index; it's not an actual measure of how happy people are, which should be the primary goal of any representative system.  General wealth is very important in reaching that goal, absolutely, which is why we can't just give everyone ponies for free and have to rely on an actual economic system, but it's not the goal and the US, which used to be succeeding at that goal, is now failing.

It's not failing as miserably as many countries in the world, it's true, but various countries in Europe in particular are actually succeeding more than we are.  They get universal healthcare, maternity leave, free university, etc.  We in the US instead get people stuck in a cycle of poverty specifically because they don't have access to these.  I'm sure people actually stuck in that cycle don't give a shit about GDP.

America may be ""wealthy"" in some warped sense -- in the gross domestic product sense -- but that wealth isn't actually available to the vast majority of people and that makes the measure relatively meaningless."

From a biological point of view, if we found a planet teeming with life, it is probably very unlikely that we'd find life compatible with ours - built of the same stuff, working in the same way, using the same biochemistry.  As far as we can tell, lots of key features of life on earth are the result of ""frozen accidents"" - that is, there were several options that as far as we know would all work equally well, and life chose one at random, and now we all use that option.  If this view is correct, there's no reason to expect that alien life would make all of the same choices.  Even one change would mean that we couldn't eat them and they couldn't eat us.  We don't really know for sure, since we only have one data point (Earth) to work with, but that's our best guess right now."

As for more slightly constructive stuff:

www.blastersmiths.co.uk - Tactical gear &amp; 3D printed stuff (I work for them in the day, in the interests of full disclosure)

www.dormlabs.com - Misc tactical gear, accessories &amp; 3D printed stuff

www.blastertech.com.au - Specialises in pre-soldered wiring looms

www.orangemodworks.com - Offer a range of kits and springs for upgrading your blaster

www.slydev.com.au - 3D printed stuff

www.containmentcrew.com - More 3D printed stuff, they resell a lot of SlyDev's stuff in North America.

www.blasterparts.de - Sell their own range of stuff including tactical gear, upgrade kits and 3D printed stuff but also resell SlyDev in Europe

www.limeytactical.com - High end tactical gear, uses all mil-spec materials

www.uknerfwar.com - UK based painting outfit, acts as an agent for /u/foam_data and his hydro-dipped services

www.hobbymods.net - Australian based 3D printing firm with assorted blaster upgrade kits available

www.narrowbase.com - US based 3D printing firm with 3D printed magazine holders and holsters amongst other things

www.xplorersg.com - Singapore based outfit offering everything from upgrades kits to complete blasters

That's what I have for the moment off the top of my head, it should get you started at least. :)

Rewind back to the 80s and compare top 10 singles from any given week in the US and UK (which is a decent representation of music in Europe at the time), and you will likely find several artists just in the top 10 every week that never made much of an impact on the opposite side of the pond.

Being a teen in the 80s, music and the general sound from that era is somewhat special to me. I think this applies to everyone; music that was popular when you started listening to music sticks with you no matter what decade you grew up in.

I still - thanks to Youtube and Spotify - stumble across songs that I would have loved at the time that were smaller hits in the US but never made an impact in Europe where I live. And I get so happy when I discover 'new' stuff like that :)"

Reinstate European identity. Not anyone can be Dutch or French or whatever. Recognise those of European ancestry and ethnicity and give them preference over non-European immigrants.    

Be proud of European culture and history. Recognise that Western societies are in fact superior, and the failure of African and Arab nations are due to their own actions, not European exploitation.

**Option 1:**

Get your bag, immediately take a cab or Uber to Manhattan (pro-tip, find a cab dropping off at Departures and get in it rather than wait on the line in Arrivals). Drop your bag at a hotel near Penn Station (go in one entrance, head near the elevator, then head toward the front desk and find a bell hop— say you are a guest checking out late but your flight isn't until later; have a last name and room number ready in case they ask, but I doubt they'll check, just don't look like someone who doesn't belong. Find one right near Penn Station, like, The Pennsylvania or the Wyndham).

If you're lucky, you can have this done by 5:30, 5:45. This should give you enough time to hit Central Park and Times Square via subway up, walking back down.

Go back to the hotel, get your bag, then get the LIRR train to JFK and take the Airtrain at Jamaica; it's the most dead on way of knowing exactly when you get to JFK; Google Maps can give you the schedule; I reliably make Delta flights at Terminal 4 leaving around 65-75 minutes before departure from a couple blocks from Penn Station. International you usually want 60 minutes for bag check, but some airlines will do 45. Penn Station to Jamaica is 22 minutes, Airtrain is 12 with a wait of 2-10 in between. If you leave 110 minutes, you should be fine. There's an 8:22 and an 8:45. The 8:45 should get you to your terminal by 9:30 but it will be close, and you'll need to make some noise about your transfer being late to cut a line for bag check (depends on airline). $5-10 to a SkyCap can also solve this problem in two seconds.

*Variation:* wheel your bag around with you while doing this. Going to a Penn Station Hotel first will cost you a lot of time, and keeping your bag will also help with the cost of the first cab ride; you go from LGA, through Astoria, over the Queensborough Bridge and you can get left off basically at Central Park within 25 minutes of getting your bag, walk down 7th/8th/Broadway to Times Square, and then down to Penn Station. This is absolutely do-able, but it will be a pain with that big a bag. You can basically have 2-2.5 hours in Midtown if everything works correctly. You'll probably even have time to walk toward the ESB. There's a Nathan's across from Penn Station BTW. If you're a guy, I would do this because your bag shouldn't be a big deal.

**Baller Variation:** Hire a car from 445 to 945pm. Have it take you wherever the fuck you want to go, leave bag in car. This will be $45-55/hr with a 2-3 hour minimum.

**2nd Option:**

Collect your bag, go to JFK via taxi or Uber same as above. There is no way to do this by train. Check in and check your bag. Turnaround and get on the Airtrain and head to Penn Station, or take a cab to wherever you want to go (but at 6pm this will be unpredictable). Keep track on estimated cab times to JFK or make sure to get back to Penn Station by around 9:15. Your bag being checked significantly earlier will make the airline think you're around somewhere even if you're not, and will also force them to let you on the plane; otherwise they have to find it and wait to take it off. That said, taking the train twice is annoying and time consuming. If you can afford a cab one way and there isn't traffic, do it.

**Note: This depends on how experienced a traveler you are, assumes you have a smartphone with Google Maps, and how confident you are in your ability to move quickly, and make rational decisions fast. Also, that you're American and it might depend on whether you're flying to Europe or somewhere else. Europe is basically the US flight wise; Africa or Asia I might take more care with getting there earlier. If you were doing this on 10 hours, I don't see an issue doing it on 6. It's less ""worth it"" but it cuts your tourist time from 6.5 to 2.5-3.**

Finally, don't take shit in security lines. If you're going to miss your flight, fucking tell the airline and blame your delayed transfer. They don't need to know you went sightseeing; they just need to know your flight into LGA was delayed 4+ hours. Sell the part of your story that's not a lie.

If you're young, do it.

If you're not, don't.

You could also do something which keeps you on the East Side of the East River, like take a cab to the NY Waterway at Hunters Point, and take the boat down to Brooklyn Bridge Park, have a slice at Grimaldi's, then take the E train to Howards Beach / JFK (about an hour). You'll save some time and money getting to/from the airports by staying out of Manhattan, and at least enjoy the skyline and a nice ride.

LGA is a shithole by the way. You can at least grab Shake Shack or Blue Smoke at the Delta Terminal at JFK."

What is wrong with this?  Are you some type of Christian prude? Or do you think that only hipster good looking guys deserve to get laid?

Lastly, you note that people who have been here for a long time (for me, 11 years) dislike everything about China.  There is usually something that people who have been here a long time do like about China. I like my friends (including actual Chinese guy-friends), the food, and not having to drive my own car. But when you have lived here for a long time, it is very difficult to leave.  Being in China for more than 5 years means that you are on your own... you are most likely not on a corporate rotation that will bring you back to America.  So your experience in China is not relevant to corporate positions in the USA or Europe.  You are un-hireable unless you have a very special skill-set (like IC design, or a successful track-record with software production, or you are a doctor).  

However, Chinese people.. Chinese society... does not recognize that China is your home.  You are forever a guest in China. That means that you are always somewhat insecure as your status is, by definition, temporary, no matter how long you stay here.  Even though you may speak fluent Chinese and have carved out an economic niche here, anything you have here can be wiped away. You are living and trying to do business in a country which lacks Rule of Law; you have no legal recourse if you are cheated or hurt.  When looked at through the lens of your life career, you will realize that you are in a precarious position relative to your peers back home.

On top of all that, if you managed to get married in China (and let's assume that your marriage to a Chinese man/woman can survive the usual difficulties associated with cross-cultural relationships), you have a choice of sending your child to Chinese school... which is, IMO, tantamount to child abuse for a mixed-culture child... or shelling out at least $2000 USD/month for international school.  Or figuring out how to spend the time (and have the patience) to home-school your child.

All this produces a lot of pressure and will bring about the constant question: why am I still here, with my family, struggling in this dirty country where I'm not accepted despite my best efforts, where my child is growing up as an outsider, getting programed at school, and I have to worry about so many bullshit things?  How can I get out of this?

Maybe you can understand that to this type of ""China professional"", talking to an ESL teacher who has been in China for 2 years and is content to hang out in a bar and spend their disposable income on booze may seem to have little pay-off."

If we want something to model it on, then we can use Prospect magazine as a role model. It features articles from a whole range of figures with contrasting perspectives, and will often have long form articles from both of them where they give their opinions on specific issues. That's what I think we should do. 

We're all just redditors. We don't necessarily have anything in common with each other, other than the fact that we all find geopolitics interesting, and an appreciation for dispassionate discussion. We shouldn't try to impose a common set of principles when we have no common principles.

If we really want, we can have a popular theme for each week/month. 

* So say, we could have one week/month where we mostly write articles about US hegemony in the world (and therefore some tangental discussion of other world players). 

* We could have different week where we discuss the relevance of international organisations like the European Union, World Trade Organisation, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Euroasian Union and United Nations (and obviously discuss older forms like the League of Nations and the Warsaw Pact). 

* Then we could have a different week about, to what extent traditional military power is important (and therefore, also discuss what other things are also/more important like finance, technology and culture). 

I'm sure we could think of enough themes to last us for quite a while, plus a whole range of other sections within it. I'd say that we should also have some smaller articles that act as traditional reporting pieces where we draw attention to events that have happened in the world (e.g. oil price shifts, elections in major countries, new treaties, et al) and maybe also a few sections where contributing writers can discuss things that are not part of that week/month's 'theme'. 

edit: I'd also like to know when can we actually get started on this? What do we have to do next? "

When it became known that NiQ had to stay in hospital for one more week - we asked Betsy to stay, and he, in spite of his planned vacation with his family, agreed to play with us. After another 2-0 week with Betsy, NiQ got better and we faced a difficult situation of choosing between two midlaners. After discussion, we concluded that Betsy fits better into our play-style, and also he was training with us last two weeks, while there were only 10 days left before extremely important IEM Katowice. At this point, unfortunately, our coach, for some unknown reason, stopped working and pushing the team to the better results. I assume he just didn't know what to improve in the team after he has done everything he knew. So the team started to practice on its own, w/o coach's help, just like it was before we even had a coach. On the individual skill-only training it was impossible to compete with teams, which also trained strategically, so we started to slowly slide into the abyss, dispite winning scrims just through our player's personal skills. As a result, we failed miserably on Katowice.

Closer to the playoffs organization has decided to take emergency steps and to add William to our coaching staff. That helped, of course, to prepare for the playoffs throughly in terms of picks/bans and it improved our communication in the team, but there was no understanding of the game and mapmovements given to the team from him, so it was not enough. Since the strategic preparation of the team remained at the ""zero"" point - we managed to win only one game against UOL and then almost put the squeeze on the second one just due to individual superiority over our rivals on almost all the lanes. But then enemies avoided all the unfavourable early-midgame skirmishes which we could snowball the game from, and easily got other 2 games by outplaying us mapmovement-wise, because we were absolutely bad at them.

It was a shame to lose in the first round of playoffs, but well, we had to move on. On arrival to home from playoffs I was trying really hard to figure out what our team really lacked to win, because everyone seemed to work hard, William didn's slack too, but in the end we still lost... At that time I didn't relize how well you can strategically prepare the team from just a coach position, because everything I knew about coaches was from my personal expirience with the guys, whom we already tried. But in the end I came to the conclusion that only a good coach with excellent understanding of the strategic part of the game could help our team to achieve any results in the future. I immidiately came with this idea to the organization and they agreed with me. After that it only remained the most important thing to do - to actually find this ""excellent"" coach.
Emotikon smile

After the great vacation in mid-season came time to come back to practicing for Summer Split. During the break, the organization had the opportunity to get one of the best, by personal skill, european adc.
With time for training came the time to look for a coach. It was hard to understand how good were candidates just in the Internet. Especially because our practices were disgusting because of controvercy between teammates and difficulties in solving this problems while everyone is at their hometowns.

In the end we decide that Shaunz is the best out of all. I liked him at once because of his straightness, even though he didn't impress me with his undestanding of the game at first.
When the time of Summer Split has come we weren't ready at all. Besides above-described problems, the Internet was shit when we arrived to GH and as the result of all of that we sadly lost two first games of the Summer Split.
On the second week Shaunz arrived and Internet problems were solved. Finally I saw some flashes of hope among apathy and depresson of the first weeks of trainings. Kevin surprisingly had a really good knowledge about how the team should move on the map, how to trade the objectives and he was able to chew this information even for die-hards.

As the result we were prepared better for the second week, but were facing stronger opponents. Dispite every possible effort to win we failed to achieve the desired. Nevertheless I saw team improving day by day and soon I thought we'd be able to beat any opponent. I was right - since third week we started winning more often. Proper training paid off. The new thing for me was becoming a shoutcaller. It was very difficult to play on LCS in same way as in scrims or as I perform when I give all the attention to my own role. Now in some situations on map I couldn't find a good solution in the right moment so we were paying for this with our time or something more. But more I got used to my new role in team the easier it became. The question was only if we got enough time to achieve a teamwork and solve conflicts, so we could be 100% prepared for the important games.

When the time to play those games has come, in two days before them we learned out that Forg1ven got suspended for four games...

**Though I was sure, that Forg1ven got his punishment absolutely deserved, still, I want to comment on this wonderful decision from Riots. I have a few complaints to them about this:
1. Why, if you warn the organisation about probable suspention of one of their players 3 weeks before, the decision about this is made two days before the games?! This time is not enough to get visa for substitutes - okay, organization can make it for everyone in advance wasting time and money for no reason. But how to justify the fact that the team does not know whether to practice with subs or will it be a waste of time and they'd better train with the regular player? How organization should not waste time of it's players on useless things such as practice with substitutes they are not even sure they're gonna play with, if the ""execution"" is planned on TWO days before important games?!

2. Riot said that they punish the player, not the organization. From the above it is clear that the organization is suffering a lot bigger than the player sitting on the bench and just waiting for teammates to play the games he is banned for. What's the point? To punish the player, not the organization, you can ban him convenient for the team, but inconvenient for the player (for example, the beginning of the next split), or find a more appropriate form of punishment. I absolutely do not agree with the time they chose to make this decision and therefore with their reasoning, but I'm just a player - not in my power to change something in this case.**

...Thanks God we got 3 sub ADCs and the teams we were gonna face were kind of equal to us in terms of strength. The day before first game we learned that 2 of our subs cant come because their organizations didn't let them and Genja has no visa (2-5 days requirs to get it) and the best option was to take Moopz (main support) as an ADC and pray. We swallowed this situation. Trained as much as we could after Moopz arrived in GH, and went to play the most important games of this season.

In the first game we had an advantage on top side and despite the superiority of the enemies on the other side of the map we turned the game around through flank-TPs from Cabo and kept snowballing on opponent's mistakes. As a result we got two inhibs and one nexus tower. And after that I failed to find an optimum solution to the situation we've been to, which was 5-man nexus push with superminions and Banner buff. After that we stucked in the late-lategame with a support on ADC against experienced in this stage of the game team. We still could've won, but I didn't stop Cabo from a risky TP on the ward behind enemies without vision onto them. As a consequence of that we hit absolutely desperate situation in which we got bare base and zero Nashor vision with enemies ready to take it. Herewith our adc blue trinket was on the cooldown. The only option was to try to rush their base but I failed to notice this opportunity and facecheked the bush hoping they were already making Nashor. But they were trapping, so I got killed. We lost the game which crippled me because I did not hold the responsibility of shoutcaller entrusted to me and, in addition, played badly in terms of mechanics what didn't affect the game that much but offended me myself.
After loss to EL team was dismoraled but we handled it together before the next day started and were ready to play against H2k. Unfortunately H2k were stronger than EL strategically and advantage Cabo got this game wasn't enough to win them. Odoamne was playing supersafe after dying a couple of times and under his teammates protection, and our botlane couldn't create enough preassure to dive enemies with Cabo's TP or destroy any tower on their lane. As a result of it there was no way Cabo could transition his strength, so the advantage we got with him was basically useless. Slowly we got crushed by opponent's good vision and map control and we couldn't do much about it given the circumstances. After this defeat we lost all our chances on play-offs so we decided to go to a bar to not indulge in grief in gaming house. I think we've spent our time there very nice. Thanks esports Meltdown bar for a good mood and assistance in order not to lose the team spirit.

Now we got a short break, preparation to relegations and vacation after them. After I returned to my hometown I got some rest, chilled a bit, spent some time with my relatives and played some soloQ. Soon I am planning to make some streams and after the relegations I'll maybe stream with schedule. We will see.

These were part of his broader point of the ""indoctrination"" of the common soldier to be loyal to Hitler and to believe the Nazi party propaganda regarding the motives of the Soviet Union. 

Bartov first notes that most of the Wehrmacht's combat troops spent their formative years under National Socialism and its indoctrination programs (Hitler Youth, etc.). Given the programs of indoctrination, Bartov argues ""there is little doubt that the youths who were to become the Wehrmacht's combat troops were to a large extent molded in the spirit of Nazism, and prepared for the kind of war the regime was determined to wage"" (p. 109). 

Dieter Borkoski, a sixteen year old fighting in Berlin, wrote later that hearing ""these words make me feel sick, as if I would have to vomit. I think that my life has no sense any more. What was this battle for, what were the deaths of so many people for? Life has apparently become worthless, for if Hitler has shot himself, the Russians will have finally won....Has the Fuhrer not betrayed his *Volk* then after all?"" (p. 110). This shows an interesting mix in the mindset of a very young soldier - the belief in the demigod like image of Hitler as the only hope of Germany, but also an acceptance of the broader Nazi ideology regarding the need for a ""preemptive attack"" on the Soviet Union because of their designs on Germany. 

Not all were as fatalistic, and continued to feel a sense of mission after Hitler's death. Bartov points to the memoir of German pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel, published years after the wars end in 1952, as proof of the acceptance of broad strokes of Nazi doctrine by the common German soldier. Rudel wrote that although Hitler's suicide ""had a stunning effect upon the troops...the Red hordes are devastating our country...we must fight on. We shall only lay down our arms when our leaders give the order...it is our plain duty also to destiny which has placed us geographically in the heart of Europe and which we have obeyed for centuries: to be the bulwark of Europe against the East. Whether or not Europe understands or likes the role which fate has thrust upon us, or whether her attitude is one of fatal indifference or even of hostility, does not alter by one iota our European duty"" (p. 139).

China's retirement system is basically non existent to my knowledge (the amounts I've heard were really tiny), but maybe the payments are sufficient somewhere very rural.

It's normal for kids of rural parents to take care of their parents later on financially. They'll normally own a home and basic necessities don't cost much.

What happened in Europe with the unsustainable retirement systems has been an ever increasing retirement age that's getting closer to the average lifespan of a person every year. 

The main difference is few people are considered to be employable beyond their mid 40s in Europe and you'll simply have to rely on the government in such a situation. Kids also don't consider themselves responsible for their parents.

In China, if you can work, then you'll get work due to the lack of enforced labor laws and those too unskilled and slow will just get by via the collection of recyclables etc. in the cities."

At the end of the war in Europe, the Allies conducted a thorough investigation into Germany's atomic weapons program.

No bombs had been built or detonated. There was an insufficient amount of usable uranium. And what diagrams they *did* have for bombs were completely unsound.

Not to mention virtually every factory in Germany had been bombed, looted or deliberately destroyed as a part of Hitler's scorched earth order. There were also shortages of everything, from food to energy to manpower. Bear in mind, the Luftwaffe was practically grounded by mid-April simply because there was no fuel left. 

Plus, I'm pretty sure that as they bombed Germany night and day, and closed in on Berlin, the Allies would've been aware of an atomic detonation.

I always thought it was an historically Jewish district of the city and that the Wehrmacht just erected barricades around it and gradually exterminated whoever was  inside.

That would just involve a list of of (country, VAT) tuples and the company sending on a list of (country, VAT collected) on to the tax office. So far, so easy.

What's *actually* difficult is VAT rebates, which differ by country and can get very involved. E.g. for some reason sweet potatoes aren't classed as food in Germany, therefore you pay full VAT (as for say alcohol and sweets), not the reduced rate (as for well food and e.g. books). Having a look at the UK: Jaffa cakes aren't cookies. That's important, as there's more VAT on cookies than on cake.

Those exception categories would have to get standardised so companies have to class things only once. But that shouldn't actually be that difficult or divisive, as long as states still get to decide what category they tax how. They just have to give the EU the authority to make those categories, including subcategories, and keep an electronically-accesible, authoritative, version of all the information necessary.

The rest, then, again is a simple table lookup on the seller's side.

It really bothers me that some people on this sub, likely people from North America or Europe, seem to be blaming the poverty of Haiti on the Haitians for ""reproducing too much"" as if decades of brutal colonization never existed. Haiti is primarily poor because they live on the degraded side of a once beautiful island that was colonized by greedy jerkface Europeans. The Spanish took one-half to raise cattle and the sell their leather, and the French destroyed the land on the other half by growing sugarcane everywhere with slave labor to sell as part of the rum trade. This activity was also a part of a larger trading pattern now known as the Atlantic Triangular Slave Trade. This brutal slave trading pattern ended up enriching both the US and Europe immensely while impoverishing other communities in Africa and the Caribbean.

and furthermore...

From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense to have more kids when you're poor just like plants tend to sprout more seeds not less when under environmental stress. Having kids helps bring more labor to your family (if they're allowed to grow up) which can help ensure the family's overall reproductive success.  People in prosperous cities have less children for a number of reasons: education and family planning, cost of living, lack of need for additional labor, and higher likelihood that their offspring will survive."

Warhammer is a setting for miniatures wargames (there are also a couple D&amp;D-style tabletop RPGs for it but they're not quite as important to this discussion.) Basically the whole thing is like a really fucked up dark parody of the medieval world but with fantasy elements. What set it apart was this sort of dark (and often humorously so) life-is-cheap-and-brutal sensibility. Also, the company that created it, Games Workshop, had their own chain of stores, made the miniatures for it themselves, and were already well known because in the UK they organized lots of gamer conventions and also were, for several years, the official distributor of many popular RPGs like D&amp;D and Call of Cthulhu.

Anyway, Warhammer and its science fiction spinoff, Warhammer 40k, which was even grimmer, even funnier, and even more popular, spread across Europe and America over the last 30 years or so and for years they were kind of the big dogs in miniatures wargames for a long time. Lots of gamers grew up getting into Warhammer and/or 40k and have fond memories of it.

Warhammer: Total War is particularly a big deal because 1) Total War, and 2) recently GW have made some really controversial changes to the setting in order to rebrand it as ""Age of Sigmar"" (basically they changed the names and lore for most of the factions, destroyed the world, replaced one of the main evil deities, and stuck the survivors on floating islands in the void connected by gates), so this might be the last new product to feature the setting as it was before for a long time, so it's an even bigger deal to fans of the setting than it would have been otherwise."

What a season it was for Southampton last year. With the heart and guts ripped out of the team as Mauricio Pochettino departed along with five players, who left with varying levels of well-wishes from the fans, it looked like Southampton’s rise was finally about to be halted. As it turned out, Ronald Koeman took the side and revitalised it, with the likes of Graziano Pelle, Ryan Bertrand and Dusan Tadic all proving worthy replacements for departed players, and additional reinforcements like Toby Alderweireld, Eljero Elia and Sadio Mane all bringing additional elements to a team that found itself sitting in second place for much of the early season. Although this form proved unsustainable, Southampton fans can rightly be proud of their team’s achievements.

Of course, the circle of footballing life keeps turning, and Southampton have once again gone through the process of being ransacked for their best players. Nathaniel Clyne is a notable loss but a replaceable one, whereas Morgan Schneiderlin’s departure is huge and could prove very costly indeed. One of the players brought in to compensate for these losses is keeper Maarten Stekelenburg, with Artur Boruc off to Bournemouth and Fraser Forster still recovering from a nasty injury. The Dutchman will protect his net behind a central defence that has had to absorb the loss of last year’s loanee Toby Alderweireld. Nevertheless, Jose Fonte is an excellent central defender, and at the moment looks likely to be partnered by Maya Yoshida after Florin Gardos was ruled out with a long-term injury. Another option is the newly-loaned Steven Caulker, the Englishman having joined up for a season from QPR. Investment looks likely in the centre, but out on the right Nathaniel Clyne has been replaced by a combination of Rhu-endly ""Cuco"" Martina (I love that name) and Sporting CP’s Cedric Soares. On the left, everything seems in order; Ryan Bertrand will probably miss the start of the season, but highly-rated youngster Matt Targett is the latest talent to roll off the Southampton production line and should fill in well.

Small changes have resulted in big reactions in midfield, where Morgan Schneiderlin’s departure left a gaping hole at the heart of the side. Southampton moved swiftly to secure the services of Jordy Clasie, neatly fleecing Feyenoord to the tune of £7m for a Dutch international with three years left on his contract. Clasie will take Schneiderlin’s spot as the brains alongside Victor Wanyama brawn in the team’s deep midfield. Ahead of them, an array of talented attackers can be brought to bear, with James Ward-Prowse finally looking to nail down a starting spot amongst the likes of Sadio Mane and Dusan Tadic. Shane Long will likely find some time out on the wing, whilst everyone will welcome back Jay Rodriguez after a long term serious injury. Gaston Ramirez may also finally find his spot somewhere in the team, and Steven Davis will provide his usual quietly efficient self to be a versatile backup.

Rodriguez also has a spot to contest up front, where Graziano Pelle reprises his role from last season as a big, mobile target for the rest of the team to work off. New signing Juanmi is an interesting prospect, and between those three and Shane Long, Southampton have a mix of different styles to try out.

If we’ve learned anything about this team over the past couple of years, it’s to never count them out. So I’m not going to. I fully believe Southampton will be able to contest at the top end of the table again despite having the strains of Europe to deal with, and with their new additions they look like a pretty tasty prospect. A lot lies on the shoulders of Jordy Clasie to replace Schneiderlin, but if Clasie can provide a good replacement than the team will look in very good shape indeed. From front to back it’s a strong squad, but the lack of a solid centre back partner for Fonte so far should be cause for worry, as should the presence of Maarten Stekelenburg, who never set the world alight for Fulham. Still, I think Southampton will do very well, albeit perhaps at the cost of one of either Europe or cup competitions. With that said, I rather expect them to be looking down the table at those chasing them, as opposed to up at the teams they were chasing last year.

Some context, I'm a software developer that writes software for a living. I also love this game, and at some point, wanted to do my own server, because there's only shitty one's out there. So I looked into it, got all the files working and tried to set up some kind of process for developing things.

Obviously, we only have the binaries, not the source code. I looked into ways of getting at least a basic form of version control for binaries, without much success. How do you do it? Just modify them and call it a day? Or do you keep track of the changes?

The community, well, is just terrible. There's not much exchange of knowledge going on, most simply try to sell what they know. Since I wasn't interested in making money with a server, paying wasn't an option. I think most servers are just cash cows, rather than being made by people who love this game. The community could create something amazing if it would just work together, at least that's how I feel.

I hope you can share some insights here. :)

Now, to answer your question. As I see it, bots are really hurting the game, but most won't play on servers that don't allow bots. Because of that, everything you can achieve through bots isn't actual content. Why would anyone spend their time getting something they could also get by turning on their bot and watching a movie instead? Since this game has pretty much no PvE end game and leveling/gearing it done through bots, there is nothing to do except PvP.

The PvP aspect however has absolute terrible balance. Basically, a full Chinese group has absolutely zero chance of winning against a full European group at the same skill level. I don't think balancing them is possible, so you'd have to take one out. Chinese only is far more popular I guess. Now that we've fixed the class balance, let's talk about the actual PvP content. The thing unique to the game is trading. Most servers increase the worth of the trade goods, absolutely necessary. But there's still the problem that new players on a server are unable to do more than 1* because they basically have no gear. PvP becomes less about who is the better player, and more about who has the better gear.

I think it is really simple to fix. Reduce gear scaling drastically. Make basic SoS gear obtainable through a few 1* trades or similar. Decrease alchemy success rate drastically and cap gear at +6. SoM should be obtainable after a few weeks on the server, only SoSun could take a while to get. Also remove all this premium crap like advanced elixirs.

Another problem is the rewards structure. Traders get most of the money, while Thieving only nets very little. Even them out, whatever job you pick, you should be able to get the same amount of money for the same effort.

Now, something that would surely be interesting, but I have no idea if it could be done. You have hunters mostly for killing/kiting the NPC thieves, not for actual protection of the traders. I'd make traders unable to dismount, and remove NPC thieves. By doing this, you need your hunters to protect the traders from thieves, like it should be.

#July asylum applications hit 'all-time record' (for Germany)

##More people applied for asylum in Germany in July than in any previous month on record, the Ministry for Immigration and Refugees announced on Friday.

 The 79,000 asylum applications lodged in July made it the month and “all time record” said Ministry for Immigration and Refugees (BAMF) president Manfred Schmidt.

At the end of August, BAMF is set to update its forecast for asylum-seeker numbers for 2015 with current estimates lying at around 450,000.

Schmidt said his priority was to speed up the ""return"" of asylum applicants from southeast Europe, so that their cases will been closed within six to eight weeks of their arrival.

""We will concentrate in the first place on Albania,"" he said.

Within a few weeks ""over 30,000 asylum applicants arrived from Albania with a protection rate of 0.1 percent,"" he said.

At the moment 209,000 asylum applications are being processed, of which 94,000 are from the Balkans and 40,000 are from Syria.

According to migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt, inefficiencies in the German asylum system are to blame for the backlog. In comparison with the rest of Europe, Germany has a much larger backlog than any other country, he said, with little sign that this is about to change soon.

In June the number of unfinished applications was twice as high as in 2014, with cases slowed by drawn-out revocation processes and ""Dublin"" examinations – investigations into where asylum-seekers first entered the European Union.

Revocation processes take place three years after an initial asylum request has been granted and look at whether the individual still meets the conditions for asylum to be extended.

“In Germany there are as many open applications as in the rest of Europe put together,” said Thränhardt.

New attack on planned asylum centre

A planned accommodation for asylum seekers in Chemnitz in Saxony was attacked with molotov cocktails early on Friday morning.

##Intelligence chief fears escalation

As yet another refugee home came under attack early on Friday morning, Germany's top intelligence chief has warned that anti-refugee violence in Germany has ""come to a head.""
 
Molotov cocktails were thrown at a planned asylum home in the Saxon town of Lunzenau early on friday morning, reports Der Tagesspiegel.
 
It was the second attack on the unoccupied building within the past few days.
 
Around 50 refugees were due to live in the home from September onwards, Tagesspiegel reports.
 
Attacks on refugee homes have been increasing in recent weeks – and Hans-Georg Maaßen, President of the German Intelligence Agency, has warned of further extreme right attacks on refugees.
 
""The situation has come to a head in the past few weeks,"" he told Focus.
 
He added that ""targeted attacks on occupied refugee homes"" could soon occur in which casualties are involved.
 
""There have been over 200 acts of violence against refugee homes in the first half of this year alone,"" he said.
 
""These show the extent to which the xenophobic atmosphere among certain sections of the population has heated up."""

There have been several threads about inquisition in medieval Europe generally, and the Spanish Inquisition in particular (the one I'm guessing you're talking about), that may be helpful as you await an answer. I'll post them below, but there are a few things to keep in mind when talking about inquisition in the Middle Ages. To quote /u/idjet from one of those linked threads: 

&gt; * The medieval, Spanish, Roman, and Portuguese inquisitions were different in formulation and construction, and they exercised specific powers which sometimes were in common and sometimes diverged

&gt; * these inquisitions, much like most interrogations of heresy, were often less about theology than they were about power, and in Foucault's words, control and discipline

&gt; * the medieval inquisition, and the Roman Inquisition, were still guided by a principle of 'returning sheep to the flock': the evidence makes clear that recanting heterodox and heretical views led to lenient punishment (perhaps a pilgrimage to a local shrine, or requirements to attend mass and confession with exact frequency)

&gt; * latter inquisitions did use torture, developed over time

&gt; * all inquisitions did engage in corporal punishment and execution, and those would not have seemed out of place on the battlefields and in the courts outside the doors of the self same churches and places of inquisition

No, they are not being kept there against their will, stop lying. There is nothing stopping them from leaving and heading south. 

&gt;This idea that they're 'economic migrants' as David Cameron keeps saying is absolute bollocks, every country in the EU has taken more migrants because of the influx from Syria (where the majority are coming from) yet we're acting like they're not our problem.

Holy shit the propaganda truly has taken hold. How many people from Syria are black? Seriously? Are these from Syria? [1](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/article30566594.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-733b673b-bb19-45bb-9dd5-84ad5ce62425_I1.jpg) [2](http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9716299.ece/alternates/w460/Calais.jpg) [3](http://www.blazingcatfur.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Calais-Migrants-wait-for-handouts.png) No. Quite clearly a few of these chaps are Somalian, but most are just generally from sub-saharan Africa. The majority are NOT Syrians. Besides, why do we have to take refugees from Syria? It's not our problem, we're thousands of miles from it.

&gt; ""economic migrant"" is a typical Cameron buzzword, it doesn't mean anything, someone coming from poverty to a better life in another country is an 'economic migrant' somehow that term is used to dehumanise these people.

That is exactly what an economic migrant is, congratulations. They're not fleeing some war torn dictatorship, they're moving here because of benefits and a better average life. They think they'll be given a house when they arrive (they probably will).

&gt; 2) what are perceived weaknesses here and how can I turn them into unique advantages?

2- This one has been my main source of  thought for a while, I noticed that there are some parties that demand high quality work/Equipment. and other parties just want to look good to others no matter how expensive it gets. their ego's the best weakness but what types of businesses can turn that into a profit?

It would seem that you in typical els/srs fashion combed through the text looking for something you could use to debunk the notion that socialism is not a panacea. Yet you ignore a fairly compelling statistic.

&gt; Between 1936 and 2008, when much of the welfare expansion occurred, Sweden’s growth rate dropped to being the 13th highest out of 28 industrialized countries.

&gt;During the decades before, between 1870 and 1936, Sweden had enjoyed the highest economic growth in the entire industrialized world.

And then there is that damn 'white privilege' we keep hearing about

&gt;The notion of the “Protestant work ethic” goes back far longer than the modern welfare state. Scholars like Max Weber, Sanandaji shows, long ago noted that the Protestant countries of northern Europe had an overall higher living standard and economic success than most.

That does not sound remotely 'magical' to me. It would actually appear to be documented by scholars. This is a shocking concept to socialists but hard work does actually pay off. It is much more evident when the gumment is not sucking up half of your earnings for the 'less fortunate'

Now I live in NYC, where you run a real risk of being labeled 'cheap' if you don't pay for your date. 

However, I spent six months on exchange in London back in college, and I have to say I definitely noticed a greater degree of gender-normative reinforcement in subtle ways while there. Chivalric traditions in the UK and Europe might well be less common, but my own impression was that there was less of a sense of ""men and women are just humans with different parts"" compared to relatively traditional ideas about them being fundamentally different. For one, I noticed men and women tended not to have as many opposite-gendered friends as Americans do, and I often got fairly noticeable signs from the women I talked to that they thought I was interested in them, simply by virtue of the fact that I had approached them and struck up a conversation. I dunno...just one man's experience, so maybe I'm wrong, or maybe that's just London, but the difference was definitely noticeable."

It was likely confiscated because he didn't declare to the government officials that he had that much money in cash. It's not illegal to have that much, or more, in cash (usually, though there are probably countries where it is illegal) but it's suspicious since there's not usually a good reason to have that much money in cash. Maybe he had a good reason, but typcally government officials only see that kind of money in cash when it's being used for illegal purposes.

This isn't something that would only happen in Europe either. Pretty much all countries are suspicious of large amounts of cash."

They are a step up from Royal Caribbean in the RCI portfolio, and tend to have far fewer kids (they don't have the water slides, surf riders, etc that appeal to families). You could also probably go for a suite, which comes with a lot of perks, including the option of dining in a separate main dining room that has a different menu. 

While I love the Mediterranean, it's not particularly relaxing. Several of the ports are not actually in the city you are visiting (Rome, Florence, and Athens come to mind, although commute lengths vary) and require transportation into the city. At least for me, if I'm spending the money, and more importantly, the time to travel to Europe, I want to actually see the sights. In order to do that, it means a lot of long days, even if you're not doing anything strenuous. It is also port intensive, with very few sea days to catch a break. 

The southern Caribbean islands are some of my favorites, and it would definitely be the more relaxing of your first two options. The nice thing about a ship is that if there is a storm coming, they have the ability to change course and generally avoid it. So unlike staying in a hotel in a tropical place, a tropical storm or hurricane would not necessarily ruin your trip. "

I'm not saying that I'd like to live in Nazi Germany, I just said that Hitler is not as bad as our governments make him out to be. Let's take the holocaust out of the picture, what did Hitler do? Unite the Austrians and the Germans, annex some parts of Czechoslovakia and attack Poland. This is what almost every great power in the world has done. Britain stabbed and shot it's way through India, Asia, America, Africa and Australia in order to make a British Empire, The French Empire did much the same plus killed thousands of Germans in the process just for good measure. The Russians seared their way through Eastern Europe, Siberia, the Caucasus, and many other places. What I'm saying is that all Hitler really did was what every other nation has done in the past and some have done since. And the Treaty of Versailles was fucking bullshit and everybody knew it.

If given the choice to I would return to the way our ancestors lived because it is the way we are supposed to live. The lifestyle we are living has us caged and this has created so many problems for us. Do you think that our forebears killed themselves? We are not meant to live such stagnant lifestyles, it is unhealthy for us. That is why we see so many negative mental effects on people today, transgenderism, depression and autism are all caused by living in cubicles.

If you get a moment then look up John. B. Calhoun's ""Rat Utopia"" experiment. There are direct parallels to be drawn to certain groups today and I think that if we continue living in the societies we live in now then we may end up just like the rats in this experiment."

Complete at 93,000 words, LURK is a novel for mature audiences.


**BLURB**


Film student Drew Brady loves horror movies. They’re his only escape from the real world, a world where he is a depressed, overweight virgin who is unhealthily obsessed with his best friend, Beatriz. When Drew and Bea find a box of old Polaroid pictures buried beneath his house, pictures that allow Drew to spy on his friends during their most intimate moments, the lines between delusion and reality begin to blur, and Drew falls headfirst into a sinister world where his only escape is to destroy the lives of those he loves.


**WHO AM I?**


Hello! My name is Adam Vine. I'm a twenty-nine year old American game designer, screenwriter, and short story writer currently living in Europe. I've written stories for games such as Transcripted, Nightmares from the Deep, and the Grim Legends series. I've lived in four countries, including Germany, Finland, and Poland, and I've visited almost thirty. I published my first story at the age of eleven. ""Lurk"" is my first novel.



**WHERE DID I GET THIS IDEA?**


I got the idea for ""Lurk"" from my love/hate relationship with horror movies, the love part being that I like being scared, and the hate part being that the characters in them seem never seem to know what's going on (we've all heard the rule that ""You Never Hear Characters in a Zombie Movie Say The Word 'Zombie'""). I wanted to write a supernatural descent into madness tale with characters who weren't completely oblivious. I also love unreliable narrators in the fiction I read, so there may or may not be one in this book, too.

The answer to this is so obvious.

When kids are little in Europe or in South America, what sport do they play? They almost always, always, play soccer. In the streets, in the backyard, at school. When fathers want to play with their sons and daughters what do they do? They go and kick a ball around.

In the US, they don't do that. Some do, but kids in the US play many sports, and by the time their out of grade school they're done with soccer. In the streets, they used to almost exclusively play baseball. Now it's mostly basketball or american football. When dads play with their kids they  go and ""play catch"" with a baseball or football. 

The reason countries in europe and south america are so much better is a combination of things, but a big reason is because the pool of players they have to choose from is much, much larger. The larger the pool of players, the better the athletes, the better the players, the more competition, the more teams, etc. The best team sport athletes in America usually play football or basketball. In Brazil, they play soccer.

It's that simple. But as soccer becomes more popular in the US, more kids will play and continue playing, and the quality of players will go up."

They did nothing to prevent illegal Arab immigration into the Mandate territories while doing a vast amount to prevent Jewish immigration. They prevented the Jewish Agency from obtaining weaponry, while allowing the Arabs to do so. Most of the prime British fortresses and legacy weaponry were left to Arab hands. Numerous Britons even worked with, fought with, the Arab armies. The Irgun were entirely justified in attacking King David, and if I lived in Israel at the time, I would have had few compunctions about assisting in the attack. I freely admit that I'm a very right wing Zionist, I likely would have gone militant if I lived in Israel at the time, and the British were legitimate targets that were all but collaborating with the Arabs to destroy the nascent Israel. Screw them. I only regret that more of them weren't killed on the way out. I will never ever forgive Britain for assisting in the Holocaust as it did. Maybe I'd have a lot more family alive today if they hadn't decided to curry favor with the Arabs. I lost a lot of family in Eastern Europe....

Me personally have voted for CDA, PVDA, D66, Groen Links en partij voor de dieren, before. And only these partys

South Korea is a very small country so there's not a lot of job opportunities. I don't think you'd have much luck getting a translation job because there are a lot of English/Korean bilinguals who could do the job better than you. And western businesses don't have much incentive to translate into Korean because of the relatively small population and the high level of English proficiency (compared to most other nations). You would get better results by studying a larger language, like Mandarin or Spanish.

There are American NGO jobs that you can get here in Korea.  The competition is stiff but you would have a competitive advantage because you studied in Beijing. However the NGO jobs are not viable long-time career options, they're always temporary and sometimes part-time.

I don't think Korean is easier than Mandarin, they're just different. Mandarin is difficult because of tones and alphabet. Korean is difficult because of grammar and politeness levels. They're both category 5 languages for native English speakers, so it takes 2200+ hours of study to reach proficiency, compared to 600 hours for European languages."

Ever heard of Libya? How many people do you think the NATO intervention in Libya killed? No act of terrorism in modern history compares with that one intervention alone.

Because you're an American, and presumably know something of domestic American politics, you say that cultural and political factors other than Christianity are more important in producing American military aggression abroad. But then when it comes to the Middle East, you just leave out the entire historical and political context that gave rise to Islamic terrorism, and say that Islamic terrorism means that Islam is fundamentally evil.

That said, how much of a money trap this is depends completely on how seriously you take it. If you view it as a fun casual game and don't care about making high ranks, you can be fairly free to play. Completely free to play is doable, but I've personally found spending money on the adventures to be worth it. (Adventures are PvE, well, adventures that give you cards per boss defeated. Quite a few of the cards are playable to outright good and they're fun to play to boot.)

Doing daily quests, playing matches and initially some basic achievements give some okay gold you can use to buy packs or do arena. Arena has you build a deck from scratch with cards given to you for the duration of the arena run, where you pick from 3 options at a time until you have a 30 card deck. Even if you lose all matches an arena run rewards you with a pack of cards and some dust or gold, but if you get higher wins you can end up earning more gold than you spend on it (150 gold per arena).

TL;DR: Can be free, can be expensive if you want high ranks right now and lots of cards to mess around with. "

I understand your worry here about it being dehumanizing. But try to look at it from the other perspective. Animal rights activists aren't analogizing oppressed minorities as non-humans to value minorities less, they're analogizing animals as oppressed minorities to value animals more. General people know that slavery and holocaust is bad. But they might not know about the giant factory farming industry, so as tasteless as it might be, you can see why an animal rights activist might rationalize making an analogy to slavery or the holocaust to help show others why they should care for the animal rights cause.

&gt;Why is it that I decide to do animal activism as opposed to actually dealing with oppressions that I benefit from?

Should we choose activism based on what we benefit from? A black man does not benefit from white supremacy, but he does benefit from patriarchal notions in society. Should he spend his time and effort being an activist on gender issues instead of race issues? Is it selfish of him to choose to prioritize being an activist for race issues instead of gender issues, the latter of which he is actively benefiting from? I'm not trying to pose these as confrontational questions just to make someone look bad, I'm genuinely curious as to what each individual should prioritize in activism.

&gt;does that mean we have to wait until all humans are equal (or at least semi-equal in terms of access to human rights) until we can actually do animal activism in a wholesome, unproblematic way?

Continuing my train of thought, should we wait until all genders are equal until we can pursue race activism in a wholesome, unproblematic way? Or vice versa regarding race and gender?

The way I see it, social justice recognizes that there are people in worse situations than other. An average woman in a destabilized, war-torn country is arguably in a worse position than an average woman in western Europe. But that doesn't mean we should tell feminists in western Europe that they need to stop being selfish and put all work on elevating the position of their sisters in destabilized, war-torn countries. It is possible to be an activist for social justice in any society without being confined to the limits of purely prioritizing the worse-off, without saying we should put all our immediate energy and efforts towards those the absolute worse-off, and worry about notions of patriarchy in more stable countries later. Therefore, in a world of gender roles and institutional racism, it's OK to still put time and energy into animal activism."

It's not like he was a top player that happened to get picked to become a coach.

That Confederations Cup in 2009 performance was one of the best in US history. He was probably fired a little too quickly from the national team, if you ask me. Playing Mexico in LA is never easy. 

He also should've gotten Egypt to the World Cup, but they drew Ghana in the last round. Granted, they lost 7-1 in one of the legs. And remember what Egypt was going through at the time, too. 

What he's doing with Stabaek is amazing. Not to beleaguer the Tippeligaen, but Bradley deserves a job in a bigger league. It may be because he's American (no American as far as I can remember has ever coached in a top European league), it may because his last two jobs ended in failure, but he seemed to have to ""settle"" for Stabaek.

I think he'll be the one to more or less break into a top league and be a bit of a trailblazer. His sides are always compact and tactically sound too. Would love to see Bob in the Premier League. Leicester for instance would've been a good fit.

Let's get a relevant discussion going. Immigration is not only topical and urgent, but one of the more interesting and involved issues there are to explore. Here are some questions that I have written for those who still believe in the diversity-immigration-multiculturalism complex. There are no right or wrong answers. I offer them simply to test your consistency of thought.

***

**Questions on Immigration for Thoughtful Progressives**

***

**1.0**

Are some demographics more easily integrated than others?

(To be integrated is to be acclimated, lawful, and productive.)

**1.1**

If so, are ethnically similar demographics generally more easily integrated than ethnically distant demographics?

**1.2**

If so, is an immigration policy that favors ethnically similar demographics defensible and desirable?

***

**2.0**

What are the advantages of having a diverse population?

**2.1**

What are the advantages of having a homogeneous population?

**2.2**

Which of the previous two questions was it easier to think of answers to?

**2.3**

What are the disadvantages of having a diverse population?

**2.4**

What are the disadvantages of having a homogeneous population?

**2.5**

Which of the previous two questions was it easier to think of answers to?

**2.6**

Is it wrong to preserve the homogeneity of a population rather than foster the diversity of a population?

**2.7**

Does your answer to the previous question apply equally to all peoples?

**2.8**

Should celebrating the diversity of a population entail celebrating the homogeneity of its component populations? (Consider how diversity is celebrated in academia.)

***

**3.0**

Scandinavian countries are said to be homogeneous, progressive, and prosperous. How are these three characteristics causationally related?

**3.1**

The troubles of Africa are said to have been caused by Europeans arbitrarily forcing different demographics to share the same country. Does diversity make a country easier or harder to govern?

***

**4.0**

Is recent immigration to First World countries conducive or inimical to public order and safety?

**4.1**

Has recent immigration to First World countries decreased or increased domestic freedoms?

**4.2**

Are the fiercest opponents of progressive values found within or without First World countries?

**4.3**

Is recent immigration to First World countries conducive or inimical to the maintenance of progressive values?

**4.4**

Do certain minorities have good reason to fear an influx of reactionary immigrants, more than they have to fear from domestic political forces?

**4.5**

If the Americans, Anglophones, and Europeans of 1965 were provided with an accurate depiction of all the changes that their respective countries would experience as a result of encouraging immigration, would their opinion of immigration diminish or improve? Consequently, would they become more left-wing or more right-wing?

***

**5.0**

Do certain political parties encourage immigration out of self-interest? Why?

**5.1**

Do certain employers encourage immigration out of self-interest? Why?

***

**6.0**

Is conferring the privileges of First World citizenship by *jus sanguinis* and *jus soli* any less morally arbitrary than Apartheid?"

Decent full time jobs will get you 2 weeks or 1 day every month till your off probation. I get 3 weeks vacation every year and in 5 years I get 4 weeks. The vacation pay is % of how many hours you worked till the payout which is in July. Each year it's a higher percentage I think. 
I remember my family in Italy telling me they get almost 7 weeks vacation to start. My mother gets almost 4 months off every year. Her overtime can be paid out (time and half) or you can hours as time off. The hours as time off is more, like twice the amount of hours. 

This is the main factor in having us guilds go for world top 3 in my opinion. They'll burn through all their vacation days in the first couple teirs. Then when the second last or  last tier comes around, they are struggling to juggle work, real life and raiding. Where the Europeans have easily twice the amount of vacation right off the bat, and if you have a good job even 4 to 5 times that. Look at the turn over in some European guilds, most people don't get burned out they just quit. They end their careers on a high note and call it. "

Long story short, they told the surviving indigenous people (~10% I think) that Coatlicue was actually Out Lady of Guadalupe, so after a few generations this beliefs would faded. At least this was true with mestizos. Today in México only 9 to 11% of the population is indigenous that still have their religious beliefs and culture, the rest are mestizos and caucasian. Many catholic temples or cathedrals were constructed over prehispianic temples and buidings.  

Religious syncretism, was also used in other parts of the world by catholics orders, like China, Our Lady of China.

In defense of theses catholics monk orders, they were responsible for conserving the culture and languages of many of the indigenous people, and also they were the ones that tried to defend them from ecclesiastic authorities from Europe from slavery.

No one will care what any third world country as to say since they don't have any skin in the game and have no established credit so to speak. I'm sorry but in every scenario the UN security council, Europe, Japan, and the BRICS will control the currency, even if its not the UN hosting this. Thats about as diverse as its gonna get. 

So essentially it will be the G20 members who control the currency since they control 85%+ of the global economy. And the the G8 members will have heavy influence since they account for 50.01% of global GDP. And there will be heavy influence from the World Trade Organization since this is their field of expertise as this is their primary job already. 

In fact the G20 could act as the Senate and the WTO could be like the House, since they have nearly the whole world as their members. The security council of the UN or G8 could act as the executive branch, since if the guys who control the world anyway aren't on board with an idea, then it simply won't get done. Its just realistic. 

Edit: Also perhaps the Super Currency can be backed by the global supply water. It is essentially the most valuable commodity on earth. We need it to live. And unlike oxygen, its value can never actually change. There will always be the same amount of H2O on earth. Liquid, solid, gas is irrelevant. And it can be quickly be calculated by scientists.

http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-real-reason-america-used-nuclear-weapons-against-japan-it-was-not-to-end-the-war-or-save-lives/5308192
&gt; In the summer of 1945, the U.S. Army Air Force carried out one of the most intense campaigns of city destruction in the history of the world. Sixty-eight cities in Japan were attacked and all of them were either partially or completely destroyed. An estimated 1.7 million people were made homeless, 300,000 were killed, and 750,000 were wounded. Sixty-six of these raids were carried out with conventional bombs, two with atomic bombs. The destruction caused by conventional attacks was huge. Night after night, all summer long, cities would go up in smoke. In the midst of this cascade of destruction, it would not be surprising if this or that individual attack failed to make much of an impression — even if it was carried out with a remarkable new type of weapon.

Not only the descruction occasionated by the bombs wasn't without precedent, but they also were already seeking to end teh war:

&gt; Even the most hardline leaders in Japan’s government knew that the war could not go on. The question was not whether to continue, but how to bring the war to a close under the best terms possible. The Allies (the United States, Great Britain, and others — the Soviet Union, remember, was still neutral) were demanding ""unconditional surrender."" Japan’s leaders hoped that they might be able to figure out a way to avoid war crimes trials, keep their form of government, and keep some of the territories they’d conquered: Korea, Vietnam, Burma, parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, a large portion of eastern China, and numerous islands in the Pacific.

So, it was the Soviet declaration of war that ultimately made them surrender.

&gt; The impact of the Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and Sakhalin Island was quite different, however. Once the Soviet Union had declared war, Stalin could no longer act as a mediator — he was now a belligerent. So the diplomatic option was wiped out by the Soviet move. The effect on the military situation was equally dramatic. 

&gt; It didn’t take a military genius to see that, while it might be possible to fight a decisive battle against one great power invading from one direction, it would not be possible to fight off two great powers attacking from two different directions. The Soviet invasion invalidated the military’s decisive battle strategy, just as it invalidated the diplomatic strategy. At a single stroke, all of Japan’s options evaporated. The Soviet invasion was strategically decisive — it foreclosed both of Japan’s options — while the bombing of Hiroshima (which foreclosed neither) was not.

So, the atomic bombs didn't bring the war to an end, nor made any material aportations to it. And the United states knew this.

&gt; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission historian J. Samuel Walker has studied the history of research on the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan. In his conclusion he writes, “The consensus among scholars is that the bomb was not needed to avoid an invasion of Japan and to end the war within a relatively short time. It is clear that alternatives to the bomb existed and that Truman and his advisors knew it.” (J. Samuel Walker, The Decision to Use the Bomb: A Historiographical Update, Diplomatic History, Winter 1990, pg. 110).

So, why? well:

&gt; In the years since the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, a number of historians have suggested that the weapons had a two-pronged objective …. It has been suggested that the second objective was to demonstrate the new weapon of mass destruction to the Soviet Union. By August 1945, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had deteriorated badly. The Potsdam Conference between U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Russian leader Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill (before being replaced by Clement Attlee) ended just four days before the bombing of Hiroshima. The meeting was marked by recriminations and suspicion between the Americans and Soviets. Russian armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe. Truman and many of his advisers hoped that the U.S. atomic monopoly might offer diplomatic leverage with the Soviets. In this fashion, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan can be seen as the first shot of the Cold War.

India is not represented in the security council. Most of african countries get bullied by the US when it comes to voting. 

The US gets 16% of the vote and according to US senators its because as you said the US has the ""most skin in the game"". This is just misleading. 

The US controls the flow of dollar, and unlike real things - coffee, oil, steel - the US can print infinite amount of dollars and buy other countries stuff. 

So yes the US has the most skin in the game since they provide the most ""credit"" but that notion is rich since US ""credit"" is not actual credit but confiscation of other's people wealth by inflation. 

The BRICS is completely outside of the US system, its a response which is orthogonal to US controlled institutions. The BRICS do not use dollars but yaun and rouble.

China as of 2015 has a higher GDP (PPP) than the US, and most speculators think even then the Chinese economy is undervalued due a massive informal background economy. 

""No one will care what any third world country has to say""

I am honestly speechless by your comment - The third world nations form a majority of humans on earth, the american or European population is a rounding error compared to them. I would think if we are constructing a democratic institute with any legitimacy then its very crucial to give them a lot of voice.

They also need to have a major say since they would be the ""debtor"" nation to your ""creditor"" nations. If you go to an office to ask for a loan then your opinion is as important as the lenders. 

And in this case the lender is not even real since technically the United states doesn't actually earn any credit in a honest way, they used to under the bretton wood system before nixon but then they became a indebted nation ever since vietnam and just declared the dollar a fiat currency allowing them to manipulate the currency to their interest. 


All these organisations - G20, G8, WTO, World bank, IMF - are heavily US controlled, and most poor nations had no chance to do anything about it, US controlled international trade due to forcing OPEC nations to use dollars to trade oil. 

Ever since 2008, things have been great for poor nations. Some even had the balls to show the finger to the US like Iran when they started trading oil using euro ( this is why the US wants to invade Iran ) 

Hopefully we can soon move to a multipolar world and not have to be subjected to US interest all the time. 

The super-currency firstly needs to be an honest currency. We had that when it was backed by gold - but it has drawbacks like being unable to pull back from really terrible depressions or reverse inequality in a simple way. 

There are no easy economically abstract solution to this. 

Creating a global institute wont work - does latvia get the same amount of voice as china ?

Also if you give china more power because of a larger population then small countries would essentially need to band together to counteract chinese interest or else china will always win. 


I honestly do not know how you can deal with such a problem in a mathematically fair method.

1.0 Yes. One of our biggest minorities (that keeps growing) are Ukrainians, Russians, Belarussians - easter slavic people. Absolutely no problem with them, we dont have them chanting in the streets that our culture and society, that is providing them with better standarts of living, is wrong (despite some of them thinking that Putin is awesome and that we are filthy servants of USA). Another big minority here are Vietnamese (because of commie-commie state partneship pre-89). They keep mostly to themselves, they choose on their own to keep their culture separately of ours, celeberate their traditions, dont accuse us of being intolerant and we dont accuse them of anyting apart from the actual petty economic crimes here and there (cheating on taxes etc.) Both these groups don't come here to benefit from our welfare, they come here for jobs. Another big minority are ""Romas"" that never really integrated: Pre 20th century, whatever kind of state was here, they were basically treated as criminals by birth. It got a bit better for them when the first czechoslovakian democratic state was formed post WWI but then the at the time, national, Socialist germany came along with their first attempt to socially engineer europe and started putting Romas in forced labour and extermination camps. Then the commie/socialist came. They held work as a religion - you dont work, you're a blasphemer. So they've implemented their social engineering plans by forcing Romas to ditch their wagons for apartment blocks and inside towns as opposed to their secluded camps outside towns and put them to work much against their disliking. Then we got democracy again and Romas didnt return to their former lifestyle, they remained ""integrated"" in towns, obviously stopped working and the spiral kept on going, czechs started hating them more because the state isnt taking care of them and, they started in turn hating us more and they're stuck with welfare because nobody wants to employ them and they got used to not working anyway. Nobody knows how to resolve this without making one of the parties barking mad but if theres one thing we learned from this: if a social engineer appears at your doorstep, go get your 12 gauge. Muslims are supersmall minority here, so we dont hear from them much. Big part probably are Turkish people selling kebab here which seem to dont mind that we are a nation of beer-guzzling, pork-eating atheists, but we have a few vocal ones, mainly centered around the I guess only mosque in Prague which recently got visited by a swat team  because of hate-preaching against jews and non-muslims that was in a book they translated to czech and wanted to publish. Also we have a so-called Palestinian embassy in Prague, where last year one of the ""ambassadors"" mishandled what likely was an IED which killed him and nobody seemed to give too much a damn why they had explosives in there and what they were planning with them. Ukraininan and Vietnamese embassies dont seem to explode at random for which are we grateful and helps with intergration of their people here :)

1.1 Yep, it definitely helps as there are little differences between us and eastern slavic nations compared to lets say the vietnamese. But vietnamese also integrate nicely so the ethnic doesnt have to be similar, just respectful.

1.2 Not that I know of, but I'm sure there is a ""You have # months to get a job, start a company or start going to college or you're out"" kind of policy for non-eu foreigners, which can make it look like we're picking ethnics, but we're not.

2.0 I have no idea, didn't study it but when observing the US of A it doesnt seem to be that bad when its governed by invidiual-freedom centric ideology.

2.1 Well then I guess you end up with society like ours, which is pretty homogenous and so far I'm loving it and see no reason why we desperately need to change this. I'm an engineer (the real kind, not social) so I look at things pragmatically: What isnt broken, doesnt need fixing.

2.3 Mentioned USA as diverse state in the advantage question, going to mention western part of EU in this question. The disadvantage in their case seems to be chaos, in some cases violence and general turmoil in society but by no means this has nothing to do with their governments or specific ethnics :D

2.4 As I've said I'm loving it here and I dont see why it would be bad. If I want to check out other cultures, I get a vacation and hop on a plane.

2.5 The homogenous ones.

2.6 Nah I dont think so, deliberate destabilisation of perfectly working state isn't my cup of tea.

2.7 ""People"" is very vauge. Certain ideologies say these people are better than others, judging by some attributes, other certain ideologies say that all people are absolutely the same and I say lets keep it sane and admit there are differences, but dont use them to go make better-or-worse comparisons. Like I've said we're bunch of atheistic, beer loving crazies so thats enough to set us apart from even our nieghbours that otherwise are the same but this is enough for certain groups of people to view us as devils and no, these wont get a friendly treatment here which I kinda tried to include in my answers and it is not declaring superiority or racism, its just common sense and the basic instinct of self-preservation.

2.8 Yep that is my idea. We share the state, we share the currency and the system but we arent forced to share everything and I'm fine with Vietnamese celebrating their festivals with fireworks in their enclosed comunities and not pushing whatever they're celebrating there into our newspaper headlines and they are fine with it too. Seems like the Ukrs are keeping their eastern-orthodox church for themselves and nobody is bothered by that either.

3.0 Can't really answer this one fully but I'd say history is one part of it (staying neutral and trading with the warring parties) and the important thing: As a result of not being the main theatre of WW2, they werent subjected to postwar territory divividing because ending up in soviet block means having your economy nose-dive and having to recover from it for decades to come, which didnt happen for f.e. Sweden so there is that regarding prosperity.

3.1 Well my country didnt do damn to African people (which is kind of why we're upset by having to deal with this), if anything we helped to build industry in African countries that were friends with Soviet Union (supposedly old czech electronics and fuses make for reliable IED parts if thats anything to be proud of). And yes I think that is logical, the term homogenous indirectly says that even when used outside the sociology and, in layman terms: the (less/more) different things you have in one bundle the (easier/harder) is to deal with said bundle of things, be it machine components, chemical agents or people.

4.0 I'm from a 2nd world country so I won't comment on that, but the recent news are upsetting.

4.1 Again, not from there, but freedom of speech seems to be taking some hits. f.e. Israeli academics banned from speaking at some universities, that is just caveman-style backwards desecration of the instituions that drive our civilisation forward by creating and &gt;sharing&lt; knowledge, free of political and religious bullshit. Also considering Israelis are one of the technological leaders in many fields and they seem to eat falafel and shit nobel prizes so denying them sharing their knowledge, to me is just howling mad. I love to listen to any academic of any religion, race, ethnic or whatever when he's describing new stuff that is going to help cure diseases or conquer the space.

4.2 Its not such a big problem here in 2nd world so yeah we dont have a lot of active opposition against that but the 1st world seems to have some active opponents of ""progressive"" values, some even shaping into political parties.

4.3 Can't comment on that.

4.4 Lets not beat around the bush here: Hebrew people and homosexual people have a good reason to fear ""reactionary immigrants"" for crystal clear reasons that are not going to change any time soon.

4.5 Can't comment on that.

5.0 Importing voters sounds like a pretty straightforward benefit.

5.1 Importing cheaper workforce without having to relocate your factories to 3rd world countries sounds like a good deal as well.

6.0 Can't really answer that so I'll put forward question since I'm mean like that: Would the ""First world"" with its ""privileges"" exist if it would be from the start not what it was and some people are desperately trying to reverse? I mean not being a bunch of homogenous christian nations (formerly somewhat diverse pagan cultures annihilated by an inhumane ideology masquerading as a spiritual movement originating from the middle east, deja vu?) duking it out between each other, and after some centuries letting go of the religious zealotry in favour of science and nonclerical state that led to industrial revolution, the wealth and ""priviledges""? And isnt trying to change that going to have negative effect on the ""priviledges""?"

Scotland already is, officially a country, not exactly independent, but still a country. Even in the case of a Yes vote, Westminister would still have some legal leeway to keep us in. The new wording you suggested gets rid of that ambiguity and faces us with the real question of whether or not we want to be a part of the UK. Although on that note, it should be tweaked to ""Should Scotland secede from the United Kingdom"", as a Yes vote should probably imply some kind of change. We would vote yes or no to change instead of yes or no to stagnancy. I think that would make more sense.

Q2: I don't think a double majority vote would really stand a chance. With 32 Council Areas, at least one is bound to vote No, and even if 90% of the country votes Yes, that one Council Area's No will overpower everyone else, which just isn't democracy. I think a double majority would work, however, when deciding if we should leave the EU. Because there would be only 4 voting areas in that issue, it would make far more sense, and it would be more feasible, to have all 4 countries agree or disagree.

Q3: That may be necessary. If they should choose to secede, then good for them. Since they're so close to the English border, a border redrawing would make sense and not be too awkward. I assume they would want to become their own country instead of being simply annexed to England, but again, whatever they vote. If every other council area wants to leave except them, then they can vote to remain in the UK, separate from Scotland. As you said, a 2/3 majority seems hard to ignore."

If the Anime industry thinks that the solution to their problems is to hunt down ani fan-subbing sites and distributors, they will only help damage their sales even further. I said I would like for this to happen because I think that the anime publishers and creators need to open their eyes and seek alternatives to broaden their market and to think globally about their sales rather than regionally.

Anime brings together people of all countries and  ethnicities together, yet the industry mostly pretends that Japan and America are the places that matter the most and Europe's offerings, while slowly improving, still lag behind what is available to the previously mentioned countries.

The anime industry is currently struggling, this is a fact. Even world-renowned studios like Miyazaki's are having problems.

I believe they are having problems because there are too few legal alternatives and those that exist aren't convincing enough consumers to try to purchase or watch their content in a legal manner.

The Anime industry needs something like Steam, or Spotify or Netflix but with the majority of content that can satisfy a large audience, be affordable and offer a great service to convince more fans to support, even with very little money, the industry."

FC Groningen won the Dutch Cup last season, their first ever prize. But the team that won the Dutch Cup lost two of their most important players: Tjaronn Chery and Maikel Kieftenbeld. Both went to play in England, Kieftenbeld at Birmingham City and Chery at QPR. It will be hard to improve on last season without those two players but Groningen still has a good squad with players like Eric Botteghin (if they manage to keep him at the club because Feyenoord seems to be interested), Michael de Leeuw, Bryan Linssen (who had an impressive pre-season) and former Manchester City talent Albert Rusnák.

Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, just as FC Groningen, lost their two most important players: Georginio Wijnaldum and Memphis Depay. And just as Chery and Kieftenbeld they went to England. Depay will show what he can do at Manchester United and Wijnaldum at Newcastle United. Depay was the biggest talent PSV had in their squad and was very important with his goals and assists. But it was Wijnaldum who won the Dutch footballer of the year 2014/2015 award.

Two of such talented players are extremely hard to replace, but PSV did have a very productive transfer summer. Besides Wijnaldum and Depay there were some other departures. Defender Karim Rekik, who was loan from Manchester City left to Marseille and back-up midfielder Oscar Hiljemark was sold to Palermo. But PSV did their best to replace them all. Andrés Guardado who was on loan from Valencia was bought from them earlier this year and it was an important capture as Guardado took PSV by his hand last season and turned out to be the perfect player for a very young PSV. Another player who was only on loan last season is defender Nicolas Isimat-Mirin. He was primarily a back-up last season behind Bruma and Rekik but when he played he showed what he can do and he is very popular with the fans. Isimat was signed from AS Monaco. Another new signing was that of Simon Poulsen from AZ Alkmaar. The left-back will be a back-up to Jetro Willems, the young and very talented Dutch international.

But the three biggest transfers for PSV this summer were replacements for Wijnaldum and Depay. Davy Pröpper came from Vitesse as a replacement for Georginio Wijnaldum but he is a different player than him. Pröpper made his international debut for the Netherlands in June in a game against the United States of America. Pröpper is 23 years old (almost 24) and a technically gifted player with great vision. As replacement for Depay two wingers were brought in. Gastón Pereiro was bought from Uruguayan side Nacional and is a big talent who has yet to prove himself in Europe. Maxime Lestienne is on loan this season from Al-Arabi. He was one of the biggest Belgian talents a couple of years back but his career hasn't progressed much since then. He was bought by Al-Arabi for the main purpose of being loaned out to other clubs and to be sold for a bigger sum a couple of years later. But his season at Genoa last year wasn't a success.

PSV Eindhoven still has a great squad with loads of talent and a couple of experienced players. They are expected to once again challenge for the title together with Ajax Amsterdam. But the question is how seriously they take the Supercup game. Last year even the trainer of PEC Zwolle (who won the Dutch Cup in 2014), who don't win that many honours normally, said he rather focus on the first league game than on the Supercup. PSV's coach Cocu has said he wants to win it and Groningen's trainer said the same thing. They will probably both start with their strongest line-ups possible though. Guardado just returned from the Gold Cup (which Mexico won and in which he was voted the player of the tournament) and it isn't sure if Cocu will start with him. Besides him PSV also miss Jetro Willems. New signings Pereiro and Lestienne will most likely start from the bench.

Groningen has traditionally been a tough opponent for PSV, upsetting the odds many a time. But tonight, with Groningen struggling to replace Chery and Kieftenbeld, it is expected that PSV will win quite easily. And I share that thought. PSV had a good pre-season, made some good transfers and look ready for the new season opposed to FC Groningen. I am confident that PSV will beat PSV so I'm personally going for the -1.5 Asian Handicap. PSV -1.5 AH is priced at 2.31 (Pinnacle Sports) and I'm staking 8/10 (4% of my bankroll).

In the case of the word *Massassi* itself, it's pre-EU and has been around for a while. According to *The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film* (as well as other sources), the word began as *Mavassi Outpost* and was an Imperial base on Yavin. By the second draft of the film, it had been changed to *Massassi Outpost* and was the name of the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Even in the script for the original film, that's always been the name of the base. 

By itself, that doesn't imply anything at all, whatsoever, beyond the fact that that's its name. The Legends material over the years went back and said that the Massassi were a subspecies of the Sith species (who, in Legends, predate the Sith Order) who were slaves and servants and they built the temple, yada yada, it's not canon anymore as determined by the Lucasfilm Story Group. When the LSG reframed canon, it included *only* the six films and the Clone Wars tv series *and new material being published from that point forward*, including subsequent novels, comics, reference materials, etc. So, at that point in time, the word *Massassi* once again merely referred to the name of the Rebel base on Yavin 4.

One of those subsequent reference materials that is within the bounds of the new canon is Ultimate Star Wars, which explains that the Massassi Temple on Yavin 4 was built by a race of beings called the Massassi who were enslaved by the Sith. Does this drag the Sith species and everything that concept implied back into canon? No. A small handful may try to argue that, but no. The only thing that's canon is exactly what's been told to us: the Massassi were a species who were enslaved by the Sith. It doesn't say they're a Sith subspecies. It doesn't detail the early Sith as themselves an actual species of being (and thus demystifying the now-unknown nature and history of the Sith), it doesn't even say if the Massassi were enslaved by the Sith when they built the temple (it's phrased ""who were once enslaved by the Sith""), so they're very broad, generic facts. No Kevin Baconing required. That's *why* the canon tabs are there on Wookieepedia. Some folks prefer to continue delving into the Legends stuff, and that's fine for them, no big deal, but others want to stick to the modern, official take on the franchise, and that's okay too. It's a Wikia, so any mistake could happen, but as long as sources as cited, and as long as hundreds of fans read any given page a day and either a) correct errors or b) add tags to the tops of the pages saying that sources aren't cited - or any other number of encyclopedic no-nos - it's serving its intended purpose of *not* leeching off of EU-fandom. It's all based on the LSG, which takes direction from Kathleen Kennedy and other producers.

EDIT: It's worth noting that in the new canon, the novels, comics, Rebels tv series, etc. hasn't fallen into the habit of tying every inane little detail together in an endless string of annoying and bizarre associations like the EU had a tendency to do. Star Wars canon as it stands now isn't overwhelmed with that kind of thing. Each story, no matter the format, has been a comfortably self-contained adventure whose creators simply focused on telling a good story as opposed to placing answering inane fan questions over storytelling like some of the EU stuff managed. And also, the new canon has been very, very (and seemingly deliberately) delicate in terms of not stepping on the toes of the upcoming films. The new stories haven't been galaxy-shattering gamechangers, just stories that are important to the characters involved in them. I've enjoyed this approach myself, but others have, to use a phrase you used, lamented the loss of the endless continuity-porn references. I feel like Star Wars is back to its roots right now, and for the most part, the Canon tabs on Wookieepedia have been helpful in keeping that stuff organized. It's not perfect, I have an issue or two with a few decisions in regards to them, but it's not anything like you're describing in your post."

All along I was following this extravagant story and the whimsy of it all easily guides you to an expectation of cozy denouement. We know she dies, just not when, and we're given no reason to believe the characters don't enjoy at least a measurable period of bliss following the events of the film. The epilogue, then, hits like a ton of bricks all at once - Gustave was shot and killed quickly after the events of the film, and Agatha died only two short years later, when she and Zero were both still children. Zero tells us that the increasingly bland hotel is his last reminder of that tiny fraction of happiness he enjoyed with her, and leaves us with the bitter realization that the elegant and whimsical world Gustave inhabited had likely died long before Zero arrived in it, as Europe fell deeper and deeper into war and strife, and that the entire production that had just swept us off our feet and treated us to humor and adventure and visual brilliance was little more than an illusion propagated by the characters inhabiting it, all of them clinging to the remnants of a different time, just as Zero has now done by clinging to the hotel. The Author never returns to the hotel, completes his work nearly 20 years later, and then he himself dies. It's a beautifully poetic, but heartwrenching ending."

I've rarely seen a Liverpool player as badly out of their depth as Lovren consistently was last season. He doesn't communicate with the left back or with Skrtel, he aggressively and needlessly pushes too far forward leaving acres of space behind him and he struggles to recover. 

The only question is which is the worse pairing: Skrtel and Lovren or Sakho and Lovren? If he's with Skrtel, he pushes up and strands Martin away behind him, opening up space for attacking players to run into.

According to the recent polls I could find, only 17% of people want Britain to become a republic - this is nowhere near the levels required for a referendum. ""Let the people settle that"", I hear you cry. Well you and I both know full well that reddit's demographics are not representative of the country as a whole and especially when you open it up to all redditors and not British-based ones you are manipulating the electorate to fix the result you want.

Another reason for denying this is because the implications would ruin the game. You might get your jollies by seeing republic everytime you come to this page but for many members, especially newer ones that haven't joined yet, they will think that too much has changed and it is too confusing to join now. Before you say ""but we had a EU referendum"", I think we all learnt from that that whilst we may be Euroskeptic, pulling out of the EU would take fun out of the sub and remove ourselves from future projects such as the MEUP.

I'm not going to go into the traditions and history side of things, because I know that there will be members better placed to do so. However, I can only just handle this sub being filled with Communists even though it wouldn't be like that in real life, don't change the model even further by making us a republic.

Austria has a very high gun rate compared to the EU, mostly due to hunters though and while it is not impossible to buy a firearm, it is not common for anyone who has nothing to do with them professionally or for sports to own one.

Home defense by firearm is something that some right wing people try to promote (often paired with the image that an evil immigrant is first tearing down your door with an axe ""Shining"" style and then using his Kalashnikov that he brought with him to shoot any living creature in sight) but in reality/statistics it is even highly unlikely to even find something more dangerous than a multitool on a burglar.

Edit:  
Our SWAT and Homeland Security equivalent for example fired less than a handful of shots in a full year with hundreds of deployments (these are the guys that get called and resolve the situation if someone locks himself at home with his family and an axe and threatens to kill everyone entering the house...). Most of these shots were at burning gas tanks (they are the ones that have better ammunition that can penetrate the steel tanks) and the remaining single shot was in the air as a warning.

&gt; Germany’s stance on the night of July 12-13 announced its desire to transform the eurozone from a European project into a kind of sphere of influence. Merkel was forced to choose between Schäuble and France (and Italy). The issue was fundamental: Her finance minister wanted to compel a eurozone member to leave “voluntarily” by exerting massive pressure. Greece could either exit (in full knowledge of the disastrous consequences for the country and Europe) or accept a program that effectively makes it a European protectorate, without any hope of economic improvement. Greece is now subject to a cure – further austerity – that has not worked in the past and that was prescribed solely to address Germany’s domestic political needs. "

Favorable to whom?

The Koch brothers, per Wikipedia:

&gt;Interested in maintaining their privacy, Charles and David prefer to donate to non-profit groups who do not disclose their donors    
&gt; The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry – especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the brothers' corporate interests. 

Soros, same source: education, peaceful transition of Eastern Europe to capitalism, support of independent presses in Russia and Eastern European countries, support of black students in South Africa, donations to 527 groups that wanted to defeat Bush, and drug policy reform, among others.    
Soros invests openly in causes that certainly don't benefit him directly, while the Koch brothers invest in secret. And what exactly makes him super left wing? Is he trying to advance communism by advancing capitalism?"

""Er der nogen, der har foreslået, at vi skal sikre den fremtidige danske økonomi ved at starte nogle flere krige rundt omkring i Verden, så vi kan få flere flygtninge til Danmark? Eller at vi igen skal tillade indvandring af ufaglært arbejdskraft fra eksempelvis Tyrkiet, som vi gjorde det frem til 1973? Og som stadig har en betydelig indvirkning på tallene, idet tyrkere som følge af den daværende indvandringspolitik og senere familiesammenføringer er den største etniske mindretal i Danmark.

Eller at vi skal afskaffe den danskundervisning, der de sidste 15-20 år har sikret en langt mere vellykket integration af nyankomne flygtninge og indvandrere? Eller at vi skal sørge for, at uddannelsesniveauet i lande uden for EU bliver sænket, så det kommer lige så langt under det danske, som det var for 30 år siden? 

Mig bekendt har ingen stillet sådanne forslag. Og derfor forekommer det at have begrænset værdi med økonomiske beregninger, der viser, at de formentlig ville være underskudsgivende..""

Racism is defined as prejudice due to race. All people identify with others based on what they have in common (i.e. race), everybody acts prejudice in one form or another, any person has the capacity to be racist. To claim that one race is too good to be racist, is to be racist.

The other factor people fail to consider is how absolutely narrow-minded these perspectives are. American history isn't world history, white people are a minority in most countries. When you talk about the wealth &amp; power that ""white people"" have, you generally talk about national prospects, white &amp; black people in the US get paid a lot more than white &amp; black people in Zimbabwe. 

European powers were more powerful than most other cultures, they did use this to their advantage. But look back at the wider picture, when black people were being sold into slavery by their brethren - white people were also being taken as slaves by debtors &amp; arabs, when white people fought other people - those people fought them too &amp; Europeans fought themselves more than anyone else... White people is a category that includes so many different people - there are white homosexuals, jews, disabled, many white people have faced abuses (some personal, some much bigger), many live in poverty, it is silly to stamp privilege on hundreds of millions of people.

Don't get me wrong, I realise there are a lot of poorer and/or hard-working people in this world and I enormously respect all hard-working people. I will agree with you that indebted American students are more hardworking than European ones who are well-off. I myself am a good example, to be honest, I won't disagree when someone calls me lazy. But I *am* ambitious to make our society better.

So from my perspective, nobody in this age should have to live under the choice of ""job or die"". But there is still a fundamental difference between the Western world and the developing world. In the Western world, you are very dependent on others in your live and it's hard to be self-sufficient. If you can't find a job, it's not straightforward to just, let's say, build your house or grow your food. If you don't fit into society, you are forced to be homeless. In the developing world, it's the general population that is poor, but their society is such that most if not everyone finds a way to sustain themselves and their family, rather than ""having to apply for a job and either succeeding or failing"".

We may have colonised other countries, stripped them of their resources and did all sorts of barbaric things in the past but it doesn't logically follow that we should let the people from those countries simply immigrate here if it suits them. This line of thought implies some sort of idea ""historical debt""- That if one country did something bad to another country, the victim country is entitled to some sort of compensation or preferential treatment today. I don't agree with that, because we don't inherit the sins of our farthers. It's also unclear how far back we can take ""historical debt"".

The slave trade goes back to the 17th century, and Europeans were committing all sorts of crimes against each other back then. Can Ireland claim compensation from the UK for crimes against humanity committed during the reign of Elizabeth I? Can Germany claim compensation from France for the slaughter of the 30 years war? Can the UK claim compensation from Denmark for what happened at Lindesfarne? What does the City of Rome owe us for the systematic massacre of British Druids and 300 years of ruthless occupation?  (Take note Osborne, this could be an idea to pay off the national debt!)

There's also a couple of rather glaring historical inaccuracies in his act, which I suspect is deliberate so to support his political agenda- and as someone who loves history this pisses me off.

1: It's misleading to say that the British actively encouraged and promoted living in Britain to their imperial subjects. There is only one point in time, during the final years of the Empire, when Britain did encourage immigration and that was just after the Second World War. But to infer that this was policy straight from day one is inaccurate. 

2: It's also wrong to say that the Indians were perfectly peaceful and happy before the British arrived. When the British started becoming involved in India in the 18th century, the ruling Mughal Dynasty was starting to collapse and it was time of civil and political strife which the East India Company exploited to its own ends. To say that the Indians were all happy with their ""spices and elephants"" paints a false and simplistic caricature of 18th century India.

&gt;I fail to see how that's putting money into terrorist coffers...

Because you're isolating events to fit your myopic worldview. Wake up. Palestine and Israel have many issues that both sides of the conflict are responsible for. But being represented by an organization that willfully carries out terror attacks and then hides behind civilian populations is not only not helping their side, it's cowardly and uncivilized. Israel could certainly come to an agreement with Palestine, but why should it at this point in time, when Palestine wants, nay demands, that Israel paint itself the Great Satan and then put itself into the position of servant to a state that has not only called a coalition of countries to war multiple times, but continues to attack the very human rights that it then proclaims Israel ignores?

With my playthrough as Brandenburg (with extended timeline, but when you start in 1444 gameplay doesn't change radically) I have won the first HRE election, this gave me a lot of manpower and force limit from other states and free cities in the HRE. Early on it's very likely, for Burgundy to be split between France and current emperor, where emperor gets all imperial provinces, that Burgundy holds, it gave me a great boost for the beggining, since I was pretty small at the time and Burgundy has conquered a lot of HRE princes, so as an effect I controlled almost all provinces on France-HRE border, stopping them from expanding east.

Then I was passing Imperial one by one, when religious leagues formed I have already passed 4 of them. In the meantime I have had few successful wars with France, where I got some HRE border provinces I didn't control earlier and gave some southern prorivinces to Spain.
In about 1650 I have passed 7th reform with no princes leaving and started preparing for the unfication at this point I became the most powerful nation in the world. I have launched a huge offensive against almost everyone in the Europe and fed them to states vassalised by th 7th reform, first war I declared was against France and fed them to the Switzerland, Ottomans were the next, I've re claimed Austrian cores in former Hungary, that Turks owned, after that I had a smaller war with Sweden getting back Danish cores (they joined th empire, when they were released by Hansa), then Lithuania (for that purpose I have released a custom client state from Warsaw and two other Polish provinces), Milan and France again leaving them with only few provinces from Paris to to their border with Brittany. After that I just had to wait until my vassals core all of the conquered provinces, so I don't have to do it myself. And now finally I could form an enormous blob (around 1720-50).

After that I pushed Ottomans out of Europe (I had to release Hungary and Serbia so I don't have to core everything manually wasting a lot of admin points. At this point (1870) I control all Asia Minor, Israel, Egipt (except for two Ottoman provinces to Nile delta, Tunis and I'm integrating two vassals I have created from French and Italian provinces that I've in wars. Oh and my army has 1.380k men and navy has almost 500 ships. No one even tries to form coalition against me even through I've got over 100AE with many of my neighbours and 400 with something, that used to be Ottomans."

46.5Mbit/s im Durchschnitt, Tendenz steigend (anders als in Österreich, wo die Tendenz auf Festnetz stagnierend ist)

herst - das sind lauter kabelprovider, die haben wir in österreich auch http://www.netindex.com/download/4,231/Vienna/ aber in holland habens die am land auch es kabel - in österreich schon mal a kabel leitung gesehen ausserhalb von den hauptstaedten bzw groessen ???? ich nicht wirklich .. 


**ausserdem hat wien http://www.netindex.com/download/4,231/Vienna/ bei dem selben link 46.6 also mehr als amsterdam.** 

&gt; Nein eben nicht, wenn andere Länder es schaffen, das ganze leistbar anzubieten, kann das ja in Österreich nicht so unmöglich sein.

wenn wir in österreich damit beginnen hochhäuser zu bauen und dafür die stadt abzureissen, die alpen wegreissen und a flaches land haben, denmalschutz abschaffen - dann wirds auch bei uns kein Problem sein. vergleich kein dubai oder asiatische laender mit good old europe - das hat kan sinn das is nicht das selbe!!!!!

&gt; Na viel Spaß bei ADSL. Wie ich ADSL bei meiner Wohnung im 10. Bezirk hatte, habe ich grade mal 6Mbit/s geschafft bei Schönwetter, und das mitten im am dichtest besiedelsten Gebiet von Österreich. Ich bin dann auf UPC umgestiegen, damit ich halbwegs etwas online tun konnte.

ich glaub dir is ned klar, dass die meisten leute ihr internet zum surfen und mail schreiben/lesen verwenden - die brauchen ka ffth fuer 50-100 euro im monat - sondern 6mbit fuer so wenig wie moeglich :)

kein problem - im 13ten haben wir gerade massiv arus hingestellt, im 15ten kein problem, im 19ten kein problem (bei mir is FFTC im 19ten), im dritten kein problem, graz kein problem .. da 10te wird auch an haufen arus bekommen (ich weis nicht wann aber ich denk kaufkraft spielt a rolle also werden die meisten anderen vorher kommen? aber das weis ich nicht) .. natürlich hat nicht jedes haus die besten leitungen - dafür is ja die milliarde

&gt; Wie war das mit der oft zitierten Breitbandmilliarde? Was ist die sonst?

eine milliarde is aber ned viel, da geht sich ka ffth in wien aus ...

&gt; Kupfer an sich ist nicht das Problem, sondern dass die Leitungen komplett ungeschirmt sind. Da gibts einfach physikalische Grenzen, und an denen sind wir schon längst angelangt für sinnvolle Geschwindigkeiten. Sogar in Datencentern wird Glas für Hochgeschwindigkeit eingesetzt, und das obwohl da Idealbedingungen für Kupfer herrschen (kurze Leitungen, abgeschirmt) und Glas viel teurer ist.

na sicher is glas schneller - aber auch viel viel viel teurer ! die leitungen sind uebrigens nicht ungeschirm, physikalischen grenzen haben wir jetzt auf kupfer schon mehrfach gebrochen (das meinte ich oben mit den BB anstieg) 


kurz: glas legen zu teuer! 1 mia zu wenig! wie lang woll ma noch diskutieren bist einsiehst das 

a.) Mobile die Zukunft ist - VIEL billiger als a neues Leitungsnetz  was wir uns garnicht leisten koennen
b.) die Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung kein FFTH braucht
c.) die Leute billiger wollen, nicht schneller und teurer
d.) oesterreich ka asiatisches land ist 
e.) Kupfer noch lang nicht am Ende ist - aber jeder weis das es nur eine brueckentechnologie ist und wir versuchen die bruecke so lange aufrecht zu halten bis wir mobile so gut sind das wir keine kabel brauchen ?

kabel muss ma legen, reparieren, kann ma abreissen, muss ma staendig erneuern, die wartung is teuer, die technoligie an sich is teuer ..

Read the rest of my responses. He specifically said illegal immigrants.. He said illegal immigrant criminals, rapists, murderers and drug-dealers that we have deported are being pushed back into the US by the Mexican government. He said the Mexican government doesn't want to put up with these criminals so they dump them on the US to let our stupid leaders deal with their problems. He said nothing about legal immigrants. We have already taken 25% of Mexico's population.. at what point is it enough for you? Why not take more European immigrants as they are more likely to have money?

&gt;You cannot support Bernie Sanders and then say you'd vote for Trump unless you have no concept of politics and just associate with names.

Not true. Like you, I believe healthcare is a right for all US citizens. Unlike you and Hillary, I actually care about making sure the welfare system is sustainable for the foreseeable future. I lived in LA a few years ago.. the state of California has been completely taken over by illegals.. Hispanics are now the majority and 30% of the population are on Medicaid. Hospitals along the boarder towns all the way to Texas have been shut down due to bankruptcy from illegal immigrants using service and not paying. The welfare system will collapse if you allow endless immigration from the 3rd world.   

&gt;Even centrist Hillary is significantly closer to Bernie than **Hillary**- you mean Trump

Hillary is neck deep in these trade deals. Sorry but corruption matters to me. 

&gt;It's also worth noting that if a Republican wins 2016 that means the Supreme Court gets right-wing nominations and shifts to an even stronger right-wing majority for the next few decades. Do you know what that means? It means the progressive reform that Bernie is vying for will be impossible. Completely impossible. There is ZERO chance of Citizens United being overturned, single payer, or getting money out of politics with a Republican Supreme Court.

The constitutional amendment to end Citizens United is never going to happen under any president. If you want money out of politics, end deductions on political donations above $1,000. Trump supports universal healthcare (which does not necessarily have to be single payer- even most countries in Europe where I come from are not just a single-payer system, and just like in the US illegal immigrants are draining the welfare systems in Europe). Hillary has expressed very hawkish opinions on war and she is controlled by the Saudis.  

&gt; The Supreme Court needs a left-wing majority for these things Bernie is talking about to be possible.

That's why I support Bernie, but Hillary is totally untrustworthy and would be a terrible leader.. I just plain don't like her. I won't vote to sell the country down the drain just to vote for someone with a D next to their name when the other guy who is running R is basically like a Democrat anyway.  

&gt;So I find it suspicious you'd say that you're a Bernie Sanders supporter, and then would talk about potentially ruining everything he wants. You're likely a right-wing troll.

&gt;Edit: Yup you are.

Nope. What have I advocated for that could be considered right-wing- ending subsidies for corporations? Go to California and you will see most democrats are against illegal immigration because the state is completely overrun.

We aren't living in the middle ages where head of state were appointed by god and the people can't challenge that assumption.

To start off with I want to say that our community is very active with people always on the TS playing games, and with fairly good turn outs for official operations.

So, in this unit we focus on detailed missions and campaigns while using a real-life structure and system to provide our members with a realistic environment to play in.

We carefully select our mods so that we have the best quality pack you can find.

We are based in europe, but accept players from anywhere, we time our events so that players from other timezones can still play with us.
We host a training session on wednesdays at 7:30pm GMT and a campaign mission on sunday at 7pm GMT.
A continued ALIVE mission is kept on the server during the week so that members can play whenever they want. 

If you have any questions feel free to add me (Jamster [2PARA]) on steam or join our TS here: uk2.clanwarz.com:1130

If you are interested in joining, fill in the form linked below.

In that time I lived in two other cities in Europe, and contemplated living in over a dozen other places. I did a fair amount of research each time since I have a family and the logistics of moving are a pain in the ass. 

Vancouver is pretty unique in that it's a modern city which decided to prevent the car from fucking it up at a time when few other cities were. I'd say the goal was good, but the success levels are mixed, due to two factors: the size of the region and the age of the city.

The area is big enough that we do have sprawl, and thanks to the rivers and mountains, infrastructure to solve it isn't cheap. It would be more efficient to have higher density surrounding the core than to build out suburbs reaching to Chilliwack, but that's not what happened, so we have to contend with both problems.

The other issue is the age of the city is so young, the central core of the city is missing a lot of the refinements of the public spaces you would find in older cities that had to define their spaces around walking. We don't have a nice big city square that isn't bracketed by heavy traffic. We are still yet to build a lot of the mass transit that will help us move through the entire region, and as a result, we devote a massive amount of the space to roads.

Combine the size of the region with the under developed infrastructure and you get Vancouver. It's still a major work in progress. "

We need a cultural shift towards more Nationalistic values because if we don't change the culture and the people's mentality we are only delaying the inevitable of our downfall.

It's a bit worse than normal (there has been a large increase in refugees across the EU in the last couple of years), but it tends to peak during the summer, normally. It's probably not as bad as it has been at various points in the past, during other refugee crises. Some of why it is being *reported* now more than usual is in Q10 of this article.

&gt; What is going on around Calais if it's not thousands of destitute Africans?

In terms of those trying to get to the UK through the tunnel, we're talking about 200-500 people. There are about 3,000-4,000 refugees in camps around Calais, but most of them aren't risking their lives trying to get into the UK (see some more details [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/calais-crisis-the-seven-claims-made-about-the-migrants--and-the-reality-10430790.html)).

Getting data on where these people are from is difficult, but the largest group are from Syria. [Across the EU](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Countries_of_origin_of_%28non-EU%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_EU-28_Member_States,_2013_and_2014_YB15_III.png) most asylum seekers in 2014 came from Syria, followed by Afghanistan, Kosovo, Eritrea and Serbia (with a large increase in refugees from Ukraine, as noted by the article).

In the UK Pakistan, Iran and Albania were in the top 5 last year (along with Eritrea and Syria).

So based on this data, most of them probably aren't Africans.

The lot was going to hull up in a spaceship and fly to the nearest habitable planet. They didn't care about the Earth, and was going to leave it behind. They would have no reason to start the Great War as that would impede progress rather than advance it.&lt;

Do you know that one of the main reasons that the enclave was formed was due to many of its founding members tought that nuclear war was inevitable and one of the main reasons that the enclave formed was so that the important people of the nation could regroup and ultimately destroy communism in the event of nuclear war. Now this is widely known and considered one of the enclaves main directives in the fallout universe if everything went to hell regroup destroy communism and rebuild america, we also happen to know that the enclave had no problem when it came to ridd america of its own citizen and use them for questionable experiments (prisoners of war, defectors, ethnic chinese americans.) Now theres a reason that i think of this is a theory and i treat it as such and thats because there alot of leverage and things that fit within the genocidal tendencies of the enclave the ultra patriotic organization that works for the ''greater good'' of america is it really outside of reasoning and the general goofyness of the fallout universe to have the enclave start a nuclear holocaust to finally ridd the world of those things that they considered wrong and start anew, be it on earth or on another planet, i dont think it is mainly because the us could not win the war they could not occupy china and china could not invade america it was a standstill and with the world already in ruin partially from the economic destruction and the nuclear exchange between the european union and middle eastern countries things would only worsen and the world and america would eventually degenerate into something far worse. 

&gt;Pre-war United States in 2077 had a population of 400 million. China in 1939 had a population of over 517 million. China by 2077 easily would've had double or triple the numbers of the US even with the most conservative of estimations. This number advantage, along with what the Chinese Soldier was armed with (Chinese Assault Rifles, Swords, and WWI/WWII era military garb); shows to me that they didn't take Anchorage and hold off American attacks due to superior armaments and equipment.&lt;

You do realize that a countries population is not equivelant to the ammount of people it fields in its military correct? today in the european union theres 506 million people yet they only field a military of around 1.5 million in comparison to america that fields around 1.4 million people through a population of 320 million. So even tough the european union have a total population that is 36% bigger than america it still only fields a military that is around 7% bigger. And this is from todays statistics dont bring in real life statistics into the fallout universe because we have no clue regarding military enlisting policies for either america or china that are the biggest reasonings for military enlisting in the first place, it makes littel to no sence and we should not involve completely irrelevant information. 

firstly we still have no clue what the chinese soldiers were equipped with because the anchorage simulation is not canon regarding chinese or american equipment and strenght. Secondly the only chinese equipment one actually comes accross in the game is the chinese assault rifle which is verry good the chinese pistol which is a tad bit worse than the military standard 10mm pistol it however holds 2x the ammount of rounds and the chinese officer sword a sword adorned by officers for most likely ceremonial use, mutch like the japanese in world war 2 or the united states marine corps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_noncommissioned_officer%27s_sword so once more we have no clue what the chinese actually are equipped with outside of the anchorage simulation and the chinese soldiers in dc as i already said were an infiltration team not exactly made for combat so they shouldt either be looked for regarding details. You also forget that its already confirmed in the fallout universe that the chinese actually succesfully invaded anchorage and a big portion of alaska (theres a reason the anchorage campaign took 10 years) and succesfully held it for a long period of that time.

&gt;No, they were ballistic satellites&lt;

All of them? because so far in the fallout universe theres only 4 talked about confirmed orbital man made objects that are capable of firing ballistics only 2 of them are canon however (the other 2 are from van buren) Now im not against the idea of there being orbital stations with ballistic capabilities but several hundred? be realistic there no need for that when you can achieve the same result from land for alot lower cost and trouble, we dont have any idea where or how many of these ballistic satellites there are. She searched for satellites in the sky and she found alot theres no surprise in that but than assuming that all of these satellites of which we have no idea how many are for espionage or other purposes are made for orbital bombardment even tough only 2 are showcased in the fallout universe is just unbelivable if you think logicly and reasonably about it it doesnt add up, she even mentions it herself that she pinged and orbital body and cross referenced it with data that would indicate what purpose it had she just searched for random satellites and hoped for the best. 

&gt;They were winning the war. The United States was the one advancing through Chinese territory, not the other way around. The United States would have no reason to nuke the enemy they were beating.&lt;

Im not indicating that the chinese were wining i have already stated that and the fact that the us were winning but not by alot and if you think logicly and reasonably regarding why and how the us are winning you will understand my reasoning behind it, it took the us 2 years to take a incredibly small portion of land in mainland china and it was reportedly a relatively costful campaign and the only reason the us were managing this was because of there advantage of having power armor both t-45 and eventually t-51  now remember the argument of putting all your eggs in one basket? Its already confirmed in the fallout universe that the chinese were developing there own version of power armor yet they were years behind the americans, chinese also had one massive advantage over the americans and that was there infiltration and espionage capabilities thanks to there stealth suit technology which helped them conduct several succesful espionage missions which were succesful. Now it was only a matter of time before the chinese succesfully developed there own version of power armor either through there own hardship or through succefull industrial espionage now if the americans lost the one advantage they had they would lose there mainland occupation of china and the war would come to a standstill with both sides being equally matched and this would tie togheter with my enclave nuclear holocaust theory."

A small critique: they differentiate democracy and oligarchy based on who has *influence*, I think who has *power* is more relevant.

These two entities control the world's wealth, and in the past, while they competed against each, they never were ""at war"" with each other. Now, that is all changing as the world is changing. I predict that the House of Rothschild will take down the all of the wealthy trusts of the royal families of Europe; including the Queen of England and her litter, and Rothschild will be at the top of the heap. How will this all play out for us Jews? Only time will tell."
,GreekLobsta,-6,1438533307,t5_2sokd,,False,explainlikeimfive,-6,t3_3fic6z,ctoyw45,,1440237529,0,t3_3fic6z,0,"If you want to know why so many conspiracy theories are ""anti-Semitic"" it's probably just down to the Jews horrible reputation and laundry list of heinous acts since declaring themselves a state in a country that wasn't theirs. Now their reputation was bad from the beginning, they declared themselves ""the chosen ones"" by ""the one and only God"". 

Not to mention their reputation in the ancient world as extremely violent, underhanded guerrilla fighters, wreaking havoc from the hills against any invading forces. Now I'm not against fighting off invaders in your homeland, but they were suicidal, death mongering zealots who wouldn't surrender no matter how many lives, their own countrymen's and their enemies, that they destroyed. In fact 900 Israelis were besieged in a fortress called Masada by the Romans I believe, and instead of surrendering and living out their days, they were all commanded to commit suicide rather than live under another government, which they all mindlessly obeyed. I'll list off some more ""anti-Semitic propaganda"" that will probably result in mad down votes, but I don't care, you should know why the Jews are universally perceived as ""bad"" since that's why these conspiracy theories are about ZOG and what not.  

   The Gaza strip, they bomb/oppress/murder unarmed, harmless civilians out of pure hatred. The Gaza Strip is as bad as the Holocaust or worse, America endorses it and supports it. Israel claims that they are only fighting the Hamas, which the people of Gaza elected to lead them, but the violent extremists of the Hamas wouldn't have any need to fight the Israelis if they weren't forced to live in the most densely populated piece of land on the planet, with a horrendous economy and they aren't allowed to leave for any reason. Gaza is a concentration camp as big as a city were Israel left their enemies to rot. It's an atrocity of modern society and future generations will look back on the people of today the way we look at the Germans who supported Hitler during the third Reich. 

The Israelis were ""given"" an area of Palestine for no other reason than the British didn't want to deal with the problem anymore. The original Palestinians attacked them outright because they got a big part of their country fucking stolen from them by the British, who then just handed it off to a community of violent Zionists. The Zionists, backed by the American government, who only sided with the Jews because they needed to make Hitler look bad, since America sided with the biggest mass murder of the time, Stalin. 

Also to top it off, the Israelis are one of the only middle eastern countries to be allowed to have nuclear weapons (sounds like a conspiracy to me).

Their form of retaliation to any and all attacks, whether real or perceived, from any enemy, is rolling their tanks up to the borders and shelling residential areas within range of their tank's artillery. Just look at their recent history with Lebanon. 

To sum it up, the Israelis use underhanded or devious means to accomplish their goals, ruthlessly slaying anyone who opposes them. Sound like the Israelis out of the conspiracy theories you've heard? 

FYI: doubt this will be read by anyone, but I am not anti-Semitic, as that would imply I'm against all Jews, which I am not. However I am extremely anti Zionist and I abhor and detest the actions of the Israeli government, and the fact that their have their own state to begin with. Just because America made the German holocaust of the Jews (and other minority groups of people in Europe at the time) to draw attention from the fact we were allied with an even more despicable monster than Hitler (Stalin, if you don't know just do some fucking googling) doesn't mean you deserve nuclear weapons and your own sovereign state.

Secondly, please find me a summary of Greek political parties, detailing finances, interior policies and actions and implementation of policies of each year compared to election promises. Won't find it? Oh guess you can't make an informed decision on which governing party should run the country. Representative democracy is nothing but a revolving door of politicians who absolve themselves of responsibility each term. No citizen of any country should be held responsible for the actions of a minority who purposely falsify information and misinform people.

Again, you make the mistake of assuming what every Greek thinks. Approximately half of all Greeks I have ever met - and I've lived in Greece - know 'democracy' as a farce. It has meant the same as it was in Ancient Greece - democracy for the slave owners and the rich, and it's never been more true than today, where shipping magnates operate the majority of the media and if you dare say you want an end to clientelism and plutocracy - oligarchs are the biggest tax frauds and money grabbers- then out of government you go. This is clear in the case of the Junta - implemented against a centrist party with the help of the ship owners, the military and the US. Later on with the first election of PASOK, promises were reversed after back room talks - with dissenting members purged and exposing the political threats made by business, and with the recent election of SYRIZA and the current media and interior state attack on Varoufakis for daring to make a plan B in case the drachma needed to be implemented.

""Living within your means"". What a joke, really, every developed nation depends on the exploitation of natural resources - beyond what the natural world regenerates - and cheap labor of other countries. Another funny thing is that because of the absolute recklessness of Wall St, the GFC meant the Greek government were forced to bail out Greek banks, shifting a private loss on to the public. Greece was scammed by Goldman Sachs in 2010 because of the felt need to limit and hide debt - almost bankrupting the nation - and corrupt politicians repeatedly hid and lied about budgets. Greece during this entire time was dumped with extra asylum seekers thanks to EU policies - forcing entry points into the EU to take back any found undocumented immigrants - of which Greece could not take or provide for. Greece was promised the world with the new common currency and all this ""solidarity"" that made domestic produce unviable - seeing as it's not an actual union. When the GFC hit, and these contradictions came into the spotlight, Greece was forced into buying out dated army and navy equipment in bail out packages from France and Germany, while their banks collected interest off the debt repayments - while those same bailouts went to save banks from their overexposure and reckless lending practices in search of profit.

The solution is pretty clear, exit the euro, seize the assets of banks - seeing as how they already got millions upon millions of public funds- ship owners -seeing as they refuse to pay their taxes or accept different government policies-, private utilities and conduct an audit on the debt and corruption of the state. All corrupt politicians and businessmen should be persecuted, and all debt related to instances of corruption will be considered odious. All attempts to for further austerity on Greece should be met with further debt cancellation, as even the IMF has refused to cooperate with the ECB and the EU on a third bailout, as their austerity policies defy any economic sense - and would further drive Greece into recession."

Abstract
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7985975
Thomas Dent Mutter (1811-1859) was one of the early American pioneers of plastic surgery. He studied under some of the great teachers in Europe during the early 19th century and returned to the United States as a professor of surgery at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. He was renowned for his operations on clubfoot, cleft lip and palate, congenital anomalies, and mutilating injuries. He is best known for the cervical flap that bears his name. His contributions include an endowment for a medical museum that bears his name to which he donated a large collection of his medical specimens. The Mutter Museum prospers to this day. His ideas and innovations have influenced many students of plastic surgery both during his lifetime and today.

Specifically:

As a professor of surgery in Philadelphia, Mütter’s innovations and accomplishments were unprecedented; he was far ahead of his time. In early feats of plastic surgery, he repaired cleft lips, deformities from burn scars, disfiguring tumors, and other cases that most surgeons wouldn’t dream of touching. He was a major contributor to the development of skin flap techniques in plastic surgery; in one memorable case he used a flap of skin still attached to its blood supply on the patient’s back and brought it around to the front of the her neck to replace the scar tissue that had tethered her chin to her chest after a burn injury. After the operation, she was able to turn her head, close her mouth, and blink her eyes for the first time in two decades. In an era of open fireplaces, hearthside cooking, and bulky, flammable female clothing, such burn injuries were common in women.

First of all, thank you to /u/RachelDawesRP for putting together this lovely meet n' greet. As we've had so many fine previous hosts I'm sure there are plenty of kolaches and mimosas to go around.  

Anywhoozle, question time apparently;  

&gt; If you had to pick one area to study: STEM or the Arts? Why?  

While I'd love to say that I'd pick STEM... if I'm honest I'd probably go for the arts. Maybe not painting or sculpting, but I'm a big-time movie and TV geek. I love the thought of taking what we know, putting a twist on it or making social commentary in sci-fi form and letting it lose on the world. Plus there are so many real-world stories and epics that are deserving of being told vs. yet another goddamn teenage post-apocalyptic book to screen deal.  

&gt; Where is your dream vacation spot? What would you do there?  

Ooooh, tough choice... but I'd have to say in the Colorado Rockies. I've been twice and it was too short both times, summer and winter.  
Summer means mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, riding motorcycles/driving sporty cars through canyons, and gorgeous panoramic view after gorgeous panoramic view.  
Winter means snowmobiling, snowboarding, roaring fires...  
Is anybody here from Colorado? I might be willing to pay top dollar for floor space if it means getting access to a lift ticket this winter.  

&gt; If money was not an issue, what car would you drive?  

Goddamit, you're asking a committed gearhead this question? What do you mean what car? As in *a* car, **one** car?! And why just cars, there's a whole slew of bikes...

*Sigh*, okay, so if we're assuming room for one car and one motorcycle at max, I'd have to go with some baja pre-runner inspired mid-size pickup truck. Modest suspension lift with bigger tires, big light bar in bed, front and rear guards, winch, the works.  
Bike wise that's easier; a brand new Honda CBR1000RR. Yeah I know, there are all sorts of rare and fantastic examples of Italian metal or German precision or British stiff lip-ness, but if you're into motorcycles you know why Hondas are special, and if you've ridden one you *really* know why.  

&gt; Have you ever cross-dressed or wanted to?  

Only as a joke. I'm not one to dwell on my level of handsome, but I know for a fact I make a terrifying woman. Hence why it was funny... although the goddamn dress made my butt look big.  
Still, if people want to do it for their own reasons, no harm done. Drag queen shows are a ton of fun as well, and if you don't think so then you have no joy in your life.  

&gt;What song/album did you most recently listen to?  

De Staat's *Wait for Evolution*. Sure there might be more well-known bands, but De Staat knows how to deliver the right amount of pop sensibility with pop-rock punch. Try not tapping your feet or dancing around, I dare you, I bet you... I'll take that dollar now;  
https://play.spotify.com/album/6yRZJf2E78PJS1AAwweQcN  

&gt; Older guys: Liam Neeson or Harrison Ford?  

Oh jeez, tough choice. Um... Neeson. Ford and I have more in common but Neeson seems like he'd be less selfish in bed.  

&gt; Younger guys: Liam Hemsworth or Robert (that Twilight guy)?  

... is this even a choice? Hemsworth, obviously. Look at the way the guy swings a hammer and bellows in *Thor*.  

&gt; Superhero actors: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) or Henry Cavill (Superman)?  

... is this even a choice? See above.  
Also Reeves set the bar way too high. Cavill got closer than Routh by a significant margin but he still doesn't feel Superman-y enough. And no not because of the neck snap, There was just something missing from his portrayal as the Man of Steel/Tomorrow/Many many powers pre Crisis. 

**EDIT:** I think I mis-read the language... yeah I did, it's for those who **like** the ladies or the men, not for one gender to answer the hypothetical ""if you had to/were able to"". Goddammit, I'll leave my screw-up bare, but in pressing on;  

&gt; Older ladies: Dame Helen Mirren or Julianne Moore?

Dame Helen Mirren, every time and without hesitation. She took to gunplay in *Red* after so many years of serious dramatic roles with the kind of enthusiasm that would put teenage boys jerking their handbrakes after watching Ken Block videos to shame. 

&gt; Younger ladies: Taylor Swift or Miley Cyrus?  

Yikes. Um... Miley. If only to avoid the inevitable breakup and being immortalized in song. Especially since there are people in my family who are Swift fanatics.

&gt; Sisters: The Three Kardashians or The Two Middletons?  

Oh christ, and I thought the last one was difficult. Um... I mean the one is clearly a phalanx of entitled spoiled brats who don't know what real life is like... and the other one are European royalty...  

You know what, I'm subverting this one somewhat. All five of them have to have an orgy, and whomever the last two that orgasm last/least then get to be reamed by me. That way I can avoid the nagging feeling that I'm being used for free publicity on whatever porn-tube site is popular right now or to provide a necessary branch in an otherwise rather straight family tree.

&gt;The 2006 census found that Dublin 15's population grew nearly 27 percent in five years, triple the national rate, while about 27 percent of its approximately 90,000 residents do not categorize themselves as ""white Irish."" The newcomers include Eastern Europeans, Asians and Africans, chiefly asylum-seekers from Nigeria.

&gt;Friday's report, which surveyed enrollment patterns at 25 elementary schools in Dublin 15, said it found ""quite a serious and significant trend of Irish moving out and immigrants moving in.""

&gt;From 2003 to 2007, the report said, 79 percent of new students in Dublin elementary schools were non-Irish. It called ""astonishing"" a finding that, since 2003, more than half of students were leaving Dublin 15 schools before reaching age 12, when they would normally transfer to secondary schools in the district.

Yes, I expected France to attack Germany around September 14. That's exactly the message French government was sending to Poland since Polish-German relations started to deteriorate.

USSR wasn't explicitly mentioned in our alliance treaty, thus I did not, but I see an unlikely possibility that had France actually followed on their alliance promises, the Soviet attack wouldn't happen. After all, Stalin **did** wait for *over two weeks* with his invasion of Poland, even though Hitler expected that Soviet attack will be simultaneous with the German one.

You explained everything in pretty good detail and from the information you gave I had (and still somewhat struggle with) a similar ED. Excessive exercise is a form of ED. Calorie counting is a form of ED. Nutrition obsessing is a form of ED. Restricting in between binges is a form of ED. And Bingeing is a form of ED. 

You mentioned biscuits. I'm assuming those are the American cookies. So I don't know how Europe handles ED or what they consider an ED, but in the US (California specifically) binge eating has recently been categorized as an ED. Depending on health insurance she should be able to be diagnosed with an ED and then be recommended to specialists. 

I did not want help at all when I was first told to get it. But loved ones would not take no for an answer. It's a difficult process and friend/family support is crucial. Because she is 17 I would get her parents involved. Be truthful with her what you think and that you are going to tell her parents to help her. She may hate you for this, but eventually (maybe even year later) she will thank you. 

I started therapy for my ED 5 1/2 yrs ago and that started my long road to recovery. Since then I have attended intensive outpatient ED programs. And I continue to see a psychiatrist and therapist who collaborate with each other to best support me. I even get support from school bc I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD. ED is almost always a result of anxiety/depression. If she does have behavioral health problems medication is a big help. She may not get the right combination of pills the first go around, but that doesn't mean there isn't one out there. 

ED recovery is long and arduous, but could save her life. I tried committing suicide bc my ED, anxiety/depression/OCD were so out of control and I didn't see it getting any better. Thankfully a friend and my mother found me and their quick actions saved my life. Since she is going to have to say goodbye to you, the only person she has entrusted her secret to, she is going to feel a lot of despair when you are gone. That's why telling her parents is really important. 

There is so much more I could tell you, but I feel this gets the point across. PM me if you need to talk or have questions or even if your girlfriend wants to talk to me. This should not be taken lightly. "

There's a ton of racial tension in general in that area, up north it's more due to the radical Islamist populations, down south everybody is still grappling over the whole colonial expansion thing.

&gt;  I'm originally Iraqi and if you visit the Middle East/South Asia/East Asia, you'd notice the insane push for getting lighter skin

This is a big thing in a lot of cultures in the Eastern world, and it's actually not because of some idea that white people are superior or whatever.  There's a psychological phenomenon whereby physical traits that are rare in a population become more desirable. In dark-skinned regions where the majority of the population spends their days outside farming, having lighter skin is considered a status symbol and a sign of wealth and superiority, these people didn't have to spend their days toiling in a field. Much the same way that fat people use to be attractive because it was extremely rare for someone to be able to live in that kind of luxury. Japanese Geishas operate this way, in the process of achieving inhuman beauty they apply pure white makeup to their faces, and Japan is historically one of the most culturally isolated and xenophobic countries in the world. Considering the vast majority of people in the world both back then and right now aren't white, it's easy to see why lighter skin generally correlated to high social standing and thereby attractiveness. Also, the tanning industry exists for white people to make their skin darker, so I guess nobody's really happy."

It is much easier to successfully to implement certain ideologies when the population is culturally monolithic, white, high GDP per capita, and is generally small compared to the United States. The population of Norway is just barely above 5m while America is a melting pot of 300m+ immigrants that range from western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin countries. What works in Europe where countries generally have a fraction of the population of the USA, may not work for a diverse country as the US. Sweden has very lax gun laws and very low homicide rates but that is because males are required to serve in their army, while our males are not. Also they are all white and generally prosperous.

However, there are things we can learn from Europe, especially when it comes to education. My grandfather was a recently retired President of one of the top universities in California after 3 decades, who frequently travelled around the world and he states that the Scandinavian countries and Germany absolutely destroy American education because they care more about critical thinking compared to test scores as well as the fact that countries such as Finland value their teachers equal to doctors. They are highly respected. Countries such as Sweden also have higher rates of sexualized violence against women in Europe but they take it the most seriously. 

In short, the Scandinavian countries have a great deal going for them, but that is because their cultures allow for socialism and it works. However it will not necessarily work for America, where we are a heterogeneous country with +300m. If a democratic President wishes to implement socialist policies, it will have to be heavily adapted to suit America's large and diverse and capitalist driven country. "

Your just increasing the negatives for any other party should the normal level of danger attributed to driving result in an accident. On the other hand selling marijuana is not creating danger either, but selling harder drugs sure could be creating a dangerous environment around the sales and for the buyers who now have access to drugs.

Webster defines danger as:

: the possibility that you will be hurt or killed

: the possibility that something unpleasant or bad will happen

: a person or thing that is likely to cause injury, pain, harm, or loss

I meant dangerous in the second sense, which is roughly what you describe as ""increasing the negatives"". When you get into an accident uninsured, the other person involved could have his financial situation completely ruined where that would otherwise not be the case. I'm not trying to say that driving without insurance kills or injures other road users, which is obviously not true indeed (at least not more than regular driving).

&gt; When an individual has a family to take care of and feed, I'm sure they would much rather take the chance of being involved in an accident and having to pay out of hand or over a long period of time rather than sell drugs. And that makes sense. Should people do it? No. Should people sell drugs to support their family rather than driving uninsured? Hell no.

Not in America, because the punishment for dealing cannabis is too high and the punishment for driving uninsured is way too low. In Belgium I would suggest selling drugs instead of driving uninsured. Driving uninsured carries not only a larger fine, it also always leads to a temporary driving ban which makes your situation even worse (and when you get caught driving with a driving ban, you're completely screwed). Selling drugs doesn't.

Of course, you should really not do either, but we agree on that.

&gt; While I don't condone it, you tell me what option low income individuals have for supporting their families when jobs require private transportation and they don't yet have money available for Insurance. I understand that your country and the majority of Europe has many options for transportation besides by car and that there are larger supports for those without money to get out of that hole without having to do desperate things like drive without insurance, but that's not the case in the US.

In the US, I would suggest driving uninsured, and that's the problem with the American system."

Also, trying to put the wolf and the sheep in the same room and make them negotiate ceasefire seems a bit ridiculous.

I don't have good solutions, but even though the problem is complicated and hard to solve, I think the tone of European leaders was pretty weak (and for ""good"" reasons, why would countries like Portugal or Ireland on the other side of continent care what happens in a country that neighbors Russia?). If you have a common, presumably strong, EU Army lead by wavering leaders who follow the narrow interest of their constituency, what's the point? Will they care about what happens in Lithuania? Would they care about Latvia enough to possibly start a WWIII? Talking about salami tactics, would they risk starting WWIII for a town in Estonia? How about a bigger slice? At some point you need principles and I don't see that coming out of bureaucratic institution. 

Again, I don't have a solution, but to me, not the lack of force of the European armies is the problem, it's the political decision that leads the army and having a mess of leaders and divergent interests is not going to make a common army any better."

This tends to be the attitude of people who offer jobs at a quarter of the minimum wage and then complain that they can't find workers, so the government should stop giving people enough money to almost live on so they will be forced to work multiple underpaid jobs.

I've worked behind the counter for social security. I know the details of people's lives and what they've gone through. I'm intimately familiar with the bullshit politics and how people are manipulated into hating each other in order to squeeze another dollar of profit out of them. The thing is, you can take a job like that, but you're still going to be on government benefits because you can't pay rent on $20 a week.
  
   
  
No, the government cannot help you find a job. They can send you to all the classes in the world, and you can follow all the things they say to do, but it will not get you a job.

No, many people cannot educate themselves for free, because they do not have the background or the basic education in order to understand the available education. And Finland's nice, but it's not the rest of the world.

No, most of the planet cannot freely travel outside their country's borders. Even in the EU, travel costs money.

No, the money isn't being spent on weed. People on benefits don't tend to be able to afford weed. You're just obsessed with weed for some reason.

No, most governments will not give you travel money or allowances to live abroad, and most schools will not take you.

I'm talking about people who find themselves unemployed and spend forty to sixty hours a week *on top* of their government-mandated activities (which produce no useful result) looking for work - doorknocking, applying for open positions, networking, attempting to upskill. But it all comes down to whether or not someone is willing to employ you. If they say no, you're shit out of luck, and you can't change that.
  
   
  
You're simply hating people because you've been told to hate them and you have no actual experience being in their position, so you believe whatever you're told to believe.

If you actually cared about this issue instead of just mindlessly repeating what you've been told to think, you'd be out there doing something to help these people, one person at a time, to escape the situation they don't have the ability or resources to climb out of themselves."

Keep these crazy, ridiculous cults and religions (Christianity, Catholics...etc) out of your society. The smart and educated population of European countries have already awaken to the virus that is religion. The vast majority of Europeans are atheist. 

The main type of people that religion attracts are the weak minded simpleton hill billy and crazy superstitious nut jobs. If Religion still controls the world, today they would still think the earth is flat and the sun goes around us. 

These religious nut jobs still believe 'god' created the earth and everything in it (dinosaurs, human, the millions of different species) in 6 days and 6 nights. There are so much pure BS from the bible that comic book fictions are more plausible than the BS from the Bible. 

Also, i find it pathetic and sad that women would follow Christianity when this religion hates women. 
According to the bible, women is nothing more than a sinful subject. Women are not allow to talk in Church or teach that why you never see women preachers in Church. (1 Tim. 2:11-12). There are so many more examples that Christianity hates women. To all the christian women out there, have some respect for yourself, ditch this crazy ridiculous, backward, mind virus religion.
