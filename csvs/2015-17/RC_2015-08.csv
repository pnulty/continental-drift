False,2,Genealogy,ctnf890,,t3_3fbzog,1440210838,t3_3fbzog,0,0,"Watch out for what you think you know versus what you can prove. Our memories are faulty so some stories can get mixed up or just confused over time. Write it down then prove the parts of it. Or disprove parts. I've debunked many family stories but I've also proven a couple. One vague story about my mother's maternal aunt that, with her husband, ran a tea house (I found the place and I'm pretty sure it was more than a 'tea house', but I can't prove that.)

Accept skeletons and heroes right along with the farmers who didn't do anything special. They all made choices that led to you. Don't judge them, learn about them. Every decision they made was made based on what was 'normal' at the time. Well, you can judge criminals a little...

Just because you don't find a record doesn't mean the event didn't take place. It just means you didn't find the record, yet. The record might be lost (think most of the 1890 census) or never got recorded properly (think births &amp; deaths prior to about 1885).

Don't just collect names. Many people 'researching' online today are trying to collect the most number of people in their tree (quite a few claim to have 30,000 or more people researched; I still haven't broken 3,000 after almost 25 years). Don't try to prove a connection to royalty or Adam &amp; Eve; most Europeans are eventually related to some royalty because, well, in those days royalty couldn't stay out of bed. And as for Adam &amp; Eve; that's just not possible so don't try.

You will run into brick walls. Some lines just disappear. Don't get upset or frustrated. Back off and follow another line for a while. Sometimes that helps clear your head to look at the problem from a different angle. Sometimes it gives records a chance to be found or scanned. Sometimes it's just the end of the road for that line.

Help others as you go. Every genealogist / family historian has different experiences with different records. You may have solved a puzzle before someone else. I'm still learning new things all the time. And I help others whenever I can (like this post). At least, I hope I'm helping.

Think about each record and how *confident* you are with each piece of information on the record. My paternal grandmother's birth record, which I just found a few weeks ago, says she was born a day later than I thought. That record was written much closer to her actual birth than anything else I've found so I'm trust it a little better than any census.

There are three kinds of evidence: primary, secondary, and well rumor. A primary record, as I'm sure you know, is a document created at the time or very close to the time of the event. A deed or tax bill is a good example of that. A modern birth certificate or death certificate is too. Secondary evidence is a document created later, such as a delayed birth certificate. Everything else, including family stories / oral histories, are rumor until you find something else to corroborate it.

Then there's the ""preponderance of evidence"". If you can't find a definitive document that proves a fact, find lots of secondary evidence that supports it.

One last thing. An 'index' of a record or a transcription of a record is not the record. It's just a hint that the record exists. An index does not prove any fact by itself. Also, watch out for compiled 'records' such as the ""millennium file"". That's just plain dirty data. Use it, if you must, to find hints but never use it to prove a fact. The number of errors in that data is scary.

That's all I can come up with at the moment. I hope this is useful.",,md724,2,1438387298,,t5_2qmdf

[Here](http://gyazo.com/4f81cefae71e2a7f03764f854068617e)'s my Garen, the first character I played in League. Based Largely on [this](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Garen_5.jpg), but with a more traditional outfit and style.

From my Request: My game of choice would be Rocket League. I know a lot of people want this right now, but I’ll try to make a strong case for why I really, really want it.

Let’s start with my history. I played soccer as a kid. I live in the American South, where of course American football reigns, but half of my heritage is European. My dad was born in Florida (I live in Georgia) to German and Hungarian immigrants-- and of course, hence comes soccer. My grandfather was a coaching assistant for the Hungarian team in the Atlanta 96 Olympics, and my dad was my coach throughout my years of playing soccer as a kid. However, in all that time, I mostly played goalie. Why? Asthma. I’ve always had exercise-induced asthma, and with some incidents where I’ve stopped breathing entirely (one of which occurred several months ago and resulted in several days in the hospital and me missing the weeks leading up to my high school graduation), playing a sport with constant running like soccer doesn’t work out for me. I don’t play it at all anymore, for such reasons, and my athletic pursuits are rather casual.

I love soccer video games. My first smartphone was a Windows phone, and the game I played the most on it was probably PES. I’ve never owned a soccer game on PC- up until last year, my PC couldn’t really run ANYTHING with 3D graphics, but I eventually upgraded to a decent gaming laptop that can. I still play soccer-related stuff. Half my time in Battleblock Theater has been messing around with that basketball/soccer game in the arena, which is easily my favorite mode.

And of course the cars. The game of my childhood was Mario Kart DS, and I still play it, along with the Wii U version today. I love any kind of racing or car game-- Forza Horizon is by far my favorite 360 exclusive, and I still enjoy Motorsport 2. But what I really love is silly car stuff, as exemplified by my Mario Kart history. The first time a friend brought Burnout Revenge over to my house I fell in love with it, and the same goes for Burnout Paradise. Obviously, all of this is obviously combined with the soccer in Rocket League.

I first saw gifs of it and became obsessed. Yesterday I was over at a friend’s house and got to play it for the first time on PS4. It was exactly what I hoped for. The perfect blend of stupid fun and challenge, the ideal game to play with friends, the aforementioned who I could play with due to PSN and PC sharing the same servers, and another best friend is getting it on PC tomorrow. I would get such countless fun out of this game.

And of course, what of specifics of the game itself? It's beautiful. The graphics are clean, colorful, well-designed, and modern. The game is a joy to watch and play. It's functional. It controls simply and nicely, the gameplay is fast-paced and fun. The UI is efficient. It's developed well without game-breaking bugs or cutting corners. Everything about the games execution was done perfectly, and even a pathetic attempt at it's concept would have still given me great joy.

Picking up a controller and setting to work on it, it's more or less exhilarating. I wasn't good at all when I played, but it didn't matter. For every five times you boost and just barely miss the ball, the one time you jump and make contact is glorious. It's a game that lends itself to those accidental beautiful moments, when you somehow flip backward off a wall and catapult the ball into the goal, to declare ""That was intentional"" when everyone knows it wasn't. It's immediately accessible and enjoyable, but offer skills and practice that only time can give. A game to be played and mastered, with only fun and no grind along the way.

This has been on my wishlist since release. I honestly can't think of any game I'd enjoy more right now, even a 60 dollar AAA. If the devs were looking for a perfect target to enjoy their game, that person is pretty much me.

What of my finances? I can't say I'm poor or underprivileged. But I'm starting college in two weeks, my only job is an unpaid internship for work experience, and thanks to horrible healthcare based on preexisting medical conditions, my family had to spend thousands and thousands on my hospital bills from the incident I mentioned earlier. As much as I would love Rocket League, with everything else going on I just can't put 20 dollars toward it right now.

Tito could very well be Randy Orton during his early feuds with Cena. Orton was also widely popular with fans, but practiced his wrestling differently than Cena, and the two were bitter enemies, always looking for ways to oust the other.

Hulk Hogan is very obviously the old European empires, just like you've said. Madly popular and powerful in the old times, but over time has proven to be horrible, bigoted, and outdated.

False,1,AskReddit,ctnir4u,,t3_3f9soi,1440212499,t1_ctngsuw,0,0,"A few problems with that...

First, renouncing used to be free. Then they started charging $500. Then last September they suddenly upped the fee to over $2000 to renounce because so many people were doing it (don't know if it was the last chance to make money off these people, or if it was an issue of butthurt).

Second, you can check out any time you like but you can never leave (without paying a boatload of money). The IRS keeps you on the hook even if you've renounced until you file tax returns for the last five years. Most US citizens abroad don't owe any back tax unless they have a *very* good income, but they still have to file, it's insanely complicated and costs thousands of $ to have a professional do it.

Third, if you have any savings in your own country you can be hit with an exit tax and penalties that can be more than your actual account balance. 

If you're young and broke you have problem #1 and problem #2. If you're older and have assets and especially if you just found out about this law (and/or just found out you're a citizen) you have problem #3. I mentioned Canada before because it has lots of people in the third category - including people who were told unequivocally many years ago that they were giving up their US citizenship when they took Canadian citizenship, then the US govt changed the rules *retroactively* and decided they were US citizens after all, surprise!. These people are not happy campers.

On top of everything else, non-US banks are being forced to give information on all their US citizen account holders to the US govt. A lot of banks (including the one I worked for) couldn't be bothered with the regulations, penalties and compliance costs, and just threw out all their American customers, told them to go find another bank. In many countries, especially in Europe a US citizen now can't get a mortgage, an investment account or even a simple chequing/savings account because no bank will take them on. International pariahs. This includes US citizens who have been doing everything ""right"" - filing tax returns every year, declaring every cent they own to the Financial Crimes Division every year, including their children's savings accounts with $200 in them.

Oh, and if you're a US citizen abroad no company will take you on as a partner or someone with control of finances, because that makes THEM required to file all their financial info with the US as well, since they are now connected to you. Also if you're married to a non-US citizen they want to know all their financial information too.

Again, imagine that as a child of an Irish citizen you can't get a job in the US with any financial responsibility, you can't open a bank account or get a mortgage, you can't get rid of your (unasked for) Irish citizenship without paying a shitload of money and possibly being told to just hand over your net worth or more, because the Irish government has forced all the other countries to cooperate with their tax laws.",,shunrata,1,1438394177,,t5_2qh1i

In fact, no. No, you brought it up, so let's pull this thread.

You self-identify as a brown guy and immigrant. A lot. Like, a **lot** a lot. Yet you don't actually seem to have anything nice to say about immigrants or brown guys. On your account, brownfolk are uncivilized, rapists, incapable of integrating into the mainstream, they're always ""pulling the race card"" -- and more to the point, you characterize yourself as someone who enjoys ""turning people into white nationalists"". You are, in short, a self-identifying brown person and immigrant who has *litearally nothing nice to say* about any other brown person or immigrant. On your account, **you** are perfect in every way (almost as good as a real white person!), and **white people** are perfect in every way (except for the bleeding-heart multicultural liberals, but you still plainly prefer them to brownfolk), but brownfolk are the scum of the earth and should be shipped en masse back to their home countries, the better to protect the pristine white race.

And the weirdness doesn't end there. For example, you've told us that you came to Canada specifically because you made a conscious choice to move to a country which flattered your moral preferences: Canada's attraction was that ""it was an English speaking country founded on European traditions"".

But you also told us that you're in your mid-20s and immigrated 15 years ago, so... you made that kind of high-order moral decision at age 10?

Or do you expect us to believe that the conversation was more like ""Mother and father, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that, in choosing a country to move to, we ought to prioritize selection of an eventual destination which places a premium upon a European tradition of liberalism, informed by the common-law system developed in the United Kingdom...""

You castigate people who might vote for a candidate who they feel embodies or represents their cultural identity -- Olivia Chow supporters are, to hear you tell it, borderline segregationist, and only a genuine idiot would ever vote for someone for this reason -- yet you openly advocate the establishment of all-white nations and the expulsion of all the ""unwelcome"" brownfolk who might dirty their doorsteps. (So a brown person voting for a brown candidate is a segregationist and a coon, but a white person ""standing up"" for an all-white nation is just ""defending their culture"" and their heritage, and you don't understand why anyone would consider them racist...)

No.

No, this doesn't add up.

Remember almost all of Europe does not fluoridate and they are doing just fine.  It seriously bothers me when people pretend something is safe when we only have 1 or 2 generations of data to study of which the data is too complicated to properly isolate variables and perform any real science to tell if it is safe to administer every day for 80 years of every single person's life.  Surely there are people who have worse health because of fluoridated water which is why the CDC lowered the upper limit allowed.

The coastal African states (Such as Benin in the west and Zanzibar in the east) would capture inland tribes, and trade them to each other and Arab states for millennia. When Europeans came and wanted slaves to work on plantations in their new colonial empires, the coastal states started selling off slaves to them, too, and because of the great demand for slaves in these colonies, slavery in West Africa expanded. Once the demand for slaves died out in the Americas in the 19th century, the West African states returned to just trading amongst themselves, until they were annexed by European empires in the scramble for Africa, and with a new government with abolitionist laws, slavery in West Africa died out for the most part. A well known account showing this practice is the life of Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori, a prince from the Imamate of Fouta Djallon who was captured by slave traders of an unknown enemy state in 1788, and sold off into slavery in Natchez, Mississippi.

Of the remaining 16, you have five decks that only topped once, to decks that topped twice, and one deck that topped seven times. So what you're showing me is that during that format, the only deck that had a chance against dragon rulers was ""literally just fuck dragon rulers"".dek

And I think the biggest thing you're ignoring is that, the reason we see the same decks topping over and over again is because there are a variety of them and they vary in play style. Back in the DRuler format, you probably had a ton of people playing Fire Fists, Madolche, Geargia, etc. because those decks were new at the time. As a deck gets older, people lose interest. Obviously there are still going to be some people playing those decks, but it's far fewer. And a lot of the best people that played those decks did so because they specifically didn't want to use DRulers, or the ""best deck"" or something like that. Which means, when Nekroz is the best deck, you have a ton of people playing the other good decks of the era. The main difference is that Shaddolls, BA, et al. are closer in power to Nekroz than Fire Fist, Geargia, et al. were to DRulers. 

The biggest flaw in your argument is the fact that you think that random top = that deck was good/viable in the format. That's not the case. People have to play 9 rounds to make it to day 2, then 3 more to make top cut. That means you only have to play 12 games to make it into the top 32. For starters, you're mostly showing me European events, which are often (though not always) smaller than US events. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that someone could get an early draw and then slip under the radar, always playing down until the late rounds in the tournament. Essentially, it's possible that of those 12 rounds, 4-6 of those rounds could be basically free. Which means you really only have to do well in 6-8 games, or given that you can give up a game or two, more like 5-7 games. All in all, you need to have (about) six good games. That's not a very big sample pool at all. If a large number of people were running Fire Fists or Evilswarm (quite likely; the deck was much cheaper than DRulers) then it's entirely possible a few of them will slip through the cracks. And that's exactly what happened. 

Given, then, that we have the best deck of last format in Nekroz, and then we had Burning Abyss, Shaddolls, Qlis, and Tellars as similar ""rogue"" decks, we saw a lot of them topping. That just means that the rogue-margin in that format was a lot slimmer than the rogue-margin in the DRuler format. The reason that people have not been topping with those decks these days is not because they were good enough to beat DRulers and not good enough to beat the current decks, it's because *not many people are playing them*. The numbers are not in their favor. If as many people played Fire Fists as they currently do Shaddolls, then we'd probably see the anomalous Fire Fist top as well. But we don't. We see more Shaddoll tops because Shaddolls are closer to power in Nekroz than Fire Fists were to DRuler. 

Again, I have to reiterate that I'm not arguing that you're necessarily wrong. It's possible DRulers, if they were only allowed to be their own deck without 95, would not have a significant impact on the game right now. But I am pointing out that your reasoning for why DRulers are ""weak"" compared to today's decks is inherently flawed. I can't comment on your conclusion, but the manner in which you reach it is unreliable. ",YugiCast Philosoraptor.,Lord_Boo,3,1438401629,dark,t5_2rpe6

1438404322,3,worldbuilding,ctnn8lx,,t3_3fd1wx,1440214619,t1_ctnk8rc,0,0,"**&gt;What empires are settling these colonies?**

The two primary empires settling here are **Biryl** and **Rostam**, which are located roughly 750 miles due east across the Cyndral Sea.  Biryl and Rostam are ancient rivals (think England/France) with ancestral claims to each other's lands and titles.  Both of these empires were actually colonies of Kallxenia thousands of years ago.  So in reality it's not so much of a colonization as it is a ***re***-colonization.

There are and have been settlers from just about every nation in the known world, however. Immigration is highly encouraged and welcome, as both nations and their parent empires are eager to populate the land and develop a self-sufficient economy/military, as these are ultimately the greatest defense against potential attacks from the Blighters and other fiends.

There are also intrepid pockets of Halflings, Dwarves, and even Gnomes in just about any major town here, as well as humans of different, more exotic nationality from all over the world.  Krul-Dun (located near the mountains, west of the Tarkesa archipelago), is the only primarily non-human city.  It is a Dwarven colony.  They were allowed to colonize and maintain their autonomy on the treaty-bound condition that any and all exports must pass overland to Triumph city, and thence shipped from Crownhaven, and thus be subject to proper (read: heavy) taxation.  As could be expected, the smuggling of Dwarven handicraft and weapons, primarily via the rather shady town of Lyrseport, has become something of an industry itself! 

**&gt;Why? What benefits does it have (luxury commodities, religious motivations...)?**

The initial push back into the lost lands of Kallxenia was almost wholly religious.  Roughly 1,000 years ago, a new monotheism swept across Biryl and Rostam, and within a few short generations almost all civilized peoples converted.  The Church now wields power comparable to, or perhaps even eclipsing, most kingdoms, akin to Catholicism in high middle-ages Europe.  When the Church declared a Holy War to reclaim the Blighted Lands, about 300 years ago, neither Biryl nor Rostam could avoid throwing their military might behind the effort- not without significant loss of prestige or even clerical censure.  The great bulk of the knights and lords in their realms would have heeded the call of the Church with or without imperial blessing anyway.

Additionally, there is also a sort of ""church"" for the arcane arts in this world, called **The Arcanium**, which exerts similar political clout.  They also have a vested interest in reclaiming these lands, for many ancient secrets and magical formulae lie buried in the ruins and spread throughout Kallxenia.

All in all, however, the primary political motivation is a combination of imperial rivalry and one-up-manship, not to mention self-preservation.  Ultimately no one is comfortable with an entire continent of shadow fiends resting comfortably just a few weeks travel across the sea, and the opportunity to finally strike a sustained blow against this evil blight is such that even bitter rivals can put some differences aside... or at least make sure the other party doesn't gain a significant monopoly or economic advantage once the dust settles.

I've made it a point to make a number of luxuries available to encourage settlement and development, as well.  There are great mineral deposits in the mountains, including ""mithral,"" which is an important metal in a fantasy game. Mussel Lake is the home to a unique water creature with bone fins and teeth that are highly valued for skrimshaw, which is why so many settlements have sprouted on its coast.  Strikenwood is the only known location to find a certain type of tree whose wood is twice are durable, yet half the weight of anything found in the ""old world,"" and is ideal for ship building.  There are many other fanciful examples I won't bore you with.

The lands of New Biryl are also particularly fertile, and it could rightly be said that it has become something of a ""bread basket"" for Biryl itself.  Grain  is by far the primary export.

And, of course, there are many, many ancient artifacts to be uncovered from the fallen civilization, not to mention from the otherworldly creatures of the Blight itself.  I.e. the land itself is a shangri la for would-be adventurers and treasure seekers, and all of the ancillary support economy they might command.

**&gt;What colonial nations/identity have formed?**

I'm still toying around with this.  New Biryl is the focal nation of the campaign, but I can't quite decide whether it should be an independent kingdom that only pays homage to it's founding Empire (Biryl), or to just make it a colony.  I'd really like to put an actual ""King"" in the capital city, Triumph, for story reasons.  I'll probably make him a king, but technically he pays homage to (and recieves support from) the Birylian Emperor.

Noy Rostam to the south is in a similar situation.  The actual people in both nations speak the language and generally have the culture of the parent empires. However, many have been living in the ""colonies"" for generations, and have come to view themselves as more ""New Kallxenian"" and in truth have little loyalty towards distant emperors, or care little for events in the Old World to the east.

Tensions between the two nations are real, but not terribly dangerous.  Generations of trade, a common unifying faith, and a mutual enemy of surpassing evil (The Blight) have brought them together, and some border towns can't be said to be Birylian nor Rostami, but a melting pot of both cultures.  Example:  The town of Draquay, which is a major trade node connecting the different nations, is known for it's distinct pidgin language and dialect, a combination of Birylese and Rostami.

The Armenians had drawn up an alliance of sorts with the Mongolians. The treaty was that if the Armenians helped with the war against the [Mamluks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) (the muslim sultanate that ruled over egypt) that Jerusalem would be ruled by Christians.

The war against the Mamluks went well at the start, with the Mongols making it all the way to Damascus. but, at the [battle of Ain Jalut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ain_Jalut#The_battle), the Mongolian and Armenian forces were defeated. this allowed the Mamluks to retake their land in the [Levant] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Levant.gif) and threaten Antioch.

The Armenians asked the Mongols to help relieve pressure from Antioch but all that the Mongolians did was attack frontier fort of Al-Bira, which is approximatly 15 km north of jerusalem. When the Mamluk forces took Antioch, they either killed or enslaved every Christian in the city. This act of religious vengeance reduced the population of the city.

Another reason why the city of Antioch had declined was due to the disintegration of the Silk Road. The Silk Road had been a major trade route between Europe and Asia for a long time, and had seen a rejuvenation during the time of the Mongols, as the low rate of crime in the Mongol empire encouraged trade. As the Mongol empire Fell, the security of the silk road could no longer be counted on, reducing the trade along the Silk Road.

With less trade going through the city, Antioch could not support such a large population both in raw material and economically, as the economy of Antioch would have been mostly a service economy to the traders moving through.(brothels, food warehouses, intermediary traders, ect.) Antioch was also in a seismicly active area, which made living in the area more difficult. By the early 15th century the city of Antioch was effectively uninhabited.

It is commonly associated there with the Democratic Party, mainly because of its usually *socially* liberal views such as support for same-sex marriage; immigration; diplomatic solutions to conflicts; etc.

Economically however, although Democrats are significantly farther left than Republicans, most are not socialists in the strict historical definition of ""socialism"". They do stand for state welfare programs; universal health coverage; and labor union rights. But apart from the provision of some of these basic services and some regulations here and there (especially to protect the environment), there's not any other attempt to ""collectivize"" the provision of goods and services. So a liberal in the US is pretty much a welfare-state supporter, the way european states work (or used to work, really). This is usually a ""social democratic"" ideology.

A socialist on the other hand would not be content with that, and would expand the State's intervention (it doesn't have to be the state, it can also be ""the workers"" themselves.. but it's usually the former case) in other areas of the economy. Venezuela and Cuba would be the best examples of ""true"" Socialist states (and North Korea too, though it's not a pretty addition to the list). Nevertheless (and here's another important point) most so-called ""Socialist parties"" nowadays are really social democratic parties. So pay attention how the term is being used.

Anyway, in a nutshell, Bernie Sanders is definitely socially liberal (he supports abortion and same-sex marriage; he'ss in favor of the total separation of the state from the church; he wants to reform prisons and end mass surveillance programs) while economically he advocates higher taxes; universal health care; tuition-free public universities; among other initiatives.

It's frustrating that much of the userbase of /r/socialism as well as /r/communism seems to agree with this traditional conflation, shared by both Western capitalist and Marxist-Leninist propaganda complexes, that state capitalism=socialism.  Academic thought has not helped in this respect as academia has been particularly subservient to power.  

The philosophers influential for the past generation of ""radicals"" were European philosophers who were able to find established positions in academia in Europe, where communists and social democrats had enough power to influence the state and gain toleration for its leading intellectuals.  But many of these European academics bought into the ideas peddled by either the Marxist-Leninist ideological complex via Soviet-influenced communist parties... or by social democratic parties making their peace with a mixture of capitalism and bureaucratic collectivism.  With the onset of neoliberalism, capital finally began to gain the upper hand over M-Lism and social democracy, and leftist academia reacted by taking its cues from postmodern and deconstructionist theory.  This propelled academia to become further unhinged from working class or real life settings, though on the other hand it picked up some interesting critical tools and became a little more skeptical of ideology and structures of power/knowledge.  There is a debate from the 70s b/w Foucault and Chomsky that is interesting in this respect and I think they both bring up points worth reflecting on.

http://www.chomsky.info/debates/1971xxxx.htm

Today, socialist theory needs to be rediscovered and rethought as a theory of working-class liberation with (imho) alot more emphasis on liberty and autonomy.  That is, self-rule and self-management for both individuals and communities, rather than an apologia for (statist) bureaucratic management as well as party rule and party discipline.  

There are a certain amount of socialists who believe top-down capitalistic/bureaucratic/collectivist hierarchies are ""progress"" because it leads to ""more production"".  They justify this view via naive historically determinist arguments that full-on corporate capitalism is some kind of necessary prerequisite to socialism.....  I guess I think more libertarian-minded socialists need to either do more to contest the idea that such a view can be called ""socialist""...or just cede ""socialism"" to the authoritarians and come up with a different word to describe what pre-Leninist socialists meant by it.
 
More liberty and grassroots democracy, less elitist managers and executive committees....please.  This not only means harking back to socialist and anarchist theory as it existed before Lenin, it means rethinking the meaning of socialism for the 21st century and its praxis within the context of the technology that exists today.

With this in mind we may have to rethink putting Marx on the pedestal as the pre-eminent socialist thinker.  I admire and respect Marx and I feel the same way about many 'Marxist' theorists but I can't say the same thing about alot (if not most) Marxist groups and tendencies.  Yes, I put alot of the blame on Lenin and Trotsky and even more on the derivative sects and ideologies that treated Marx/Lenin/Engels/Trotsky like prophets and scripture, but it's hard to deny that anarchists like Bakunin and Nettlau, as well as reformists like Bernstein got alot right in their diagnosis of Marxist theory and practice.  And Karl Korsch may have had it right when we wrote this...

there are no countries mentioned in White separatism, other than **South Africa**, but let me address how nonsensical your next statement is

&gt;[White separatism] exists in the Anglosphere, England and Scotland for example, and in Nordic countries, which are still parts of Europe.

You know White separatism implies that a White cultural group, which from the get-go means a mush of European/Non-European White-looking cultures and people, should *separate and form its own nation-state apart from the other non-Whites in the country*. This cannot happen in Europe by definition because Europeans already have their nation-states thanks to nationalism and because they are not White. If a Swede or a German went to the USA, he would be seen as White, but he is not part of the White cultural group/nation.

&gt;Your ignorance of non-American white nationalism astounds me and leads me to believe you don't live in Britain, Germany, or Scandinavia

Good guess, I live in Canada, but hail from Serbia and no nationalist group in Serbia or the Balkans that I have ever heard of has ever called for ""white nationalism"" or ""white separatism"" in Europe. I've never seen any nationalist over there even refer to themselves as White.

Again, they're not all the same.

Then you get Roma or Romani people, who're from various places around Eastern Europe but are ethnically, a looooong way back, from Northwest India.

False,7,HongKong,ctnrsjd,,t3_3fdie4,1440216765,t3_3fdie4,0,0,"I just came back from my one month long HK journey visiting my relatives. Due to expensive flight tickets and that I am still studying, I can only travel to Hong Kong every 3-4 year. My parents aren't very rich so we stay at my aunt's place every time my family travels to HK. It's a house in a village in New Terrorities and we had to take green minibus to get back to the downtown. This has given me a chance to experience HK in different perspectives. As a European, who has lived in a colder climate with monotonic landscape since birth, I already miss HK's architecture and mountains. I love how the huge population allowed me to meet people with different styles instead of seeing a messed up undercuts everywhere. Just taking a MTR felt like watching a fashion show, making HK as a huge source for inspiration and a good way to broaden my horizon. While locating in Asia, you could easily buy weird/interesting/funny stuff that you couldn't even thought about for cheap. I sweat a lot and my skin gets irritated easily so the climate isn't the most suitable for me, especially during the summer. I disgust dirty places like some cha chaan ten(?) with run down appearance. Salesmen and waiters attitude have got worse. Most of them look like they are so fed up and annoyed by everything. Some don't even bother to help or sell anything to you. 

Despite living my entire life in Europe, I somehow still feel HK as a place where I should move to when I get older. A few years ago I wanted to move to HK when I graduate. I still do, but the lower salary, high competition in everything and expensive apartment prices are still a huge turn off. This time I visited my cousins, almost every one of them told me to stay away from moving to HK. It was also pretty gruesome to see how some people are struggling to live while the prices keep going upward. 

I am an introverted person who loves observing other people and experience different sceneries. I could sit in a bus for an entire day to watch how people switch buses before the Tai Lam tunnel, ships moving, planes preparing to land or have just took off. My family came to Europe alone leaving all my relatives to HK. One of my burden has been that I don't know what to do with my parents when I get older. Should I suggest them to stay with me or go back to HK? They can't speak the language properly here so there would be a difficulty for me to move out when I get married and leave them alone. If they decided to move to HK, I don't even know where could they accommodate since my aunt's place is getting crowded due to grandchildren and wouldn't be very appropriate to live there even though being very close with us. I don't even know what should I do if my parent's ill or even pass away here. I am sure that my relatives would want to meet them for the last time before passing away. 

I get this feeling of wanting to go back every time I come back from Hong Kong. Maybe this is just a vacation blue or my real desire that had been buried by my hectic studies in Europe.

&gt;Dragonstone would have required an amphibious assault, which is incredibly difficult to do in modern times, let alone with swords and wooden boats.  Even when Loras is sent to take it, his force takes massive damage and he (supposedly) receives life threatening wounds.

If Loras' failed attack is your argument, then I don't know what to say. Stannis attacked Dragonstone after the Targaryens had been utterly decimated, and all they were trying to do was get their kids across the narrow sea to lick their wounds and maybe regroup. And he didn't even manage to kill the children, which was his mission.

&gt;
The Greyjoys may not be very powerful on land, but you have to remember that the Iron Fleet is one of the largest navies in Westeros.  The ironborn are probably the best sailors in the realm, and are commanded by Victarion Greyjoy, who is a great naval commander if nothing else.  Not even the Redwynes would face him alone, it took the combined fleets of the Crownlands and the Reach combined with excellent strategy to take down the Iron Fleet.

And Stannis didn't face them alone. He faced them with all the power and might and wealth of all the Seven Kingdoms. Are the Iron Islanders the best seamen in the Seven Kingdoms? Yes. However, they are a house divided. The closest comparison they I can make is the individual native nations in North America vs the European invaders. If the indigenous people could have put aside their tribal differences and united against the newcomers, they could have won easily. But they couldn't and didn't, so they lost. All Stannis did was beat a bunch of pirates. Paying the Iron Price is one thing. Uniting is another thing altogether.

&gt;The wildlings are probably the least impressive, but his ability to lead 2000+ men into a successful pincer maneuver in the terrain north of the wall, says a lot about his capabilities as a commander.

The least impressive among a litany of less than impressive military conquests.

Modern history names both George Washington and George McClellan as successful military strategists, but the actual fact is that they both sucked ass as military strategists. They both just happened to be on the winning side. America won her war for independence despite Washington's decidedly subpar military leadership, just as the North won the Civil War despite McClellan's decidedly subpar military leadership.

The same holds true for Stannis Baratheon.

Anyone who has some experience with group theory and measure theory can read [*The Banach-Tarski Paradox*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521457041) by Stan Wagon without much trouble to get a near-encyclopedic knowledge of what is known of the subject (though there are some things missing over the years, as discussed below). It is split into two parts: Part I deals with Paradoxical Decompositions (aka the nonexistence of finitely additive measures), and Part II deals with the reverse, Finitely Additive Measures (aka the nonexistence of paradoxical decompositions).

I was in contact with the author a year or two ago, and was told a second edition is being written to include new results (namely, answers to some of the previously unsolved problems listed in the first chapter of the book). For those interested in the papers which answer these questions, and more, here are some titles:

1. Just, W. “A bounded paradoxical subset of the plane.” *Bull. Pol. Acad. Sci.* 36 (1988): 1-3.

2. Sherman, Glen Aldridge. “On bounded paradoxical subsets of the plane.” *Fundamenta Mathematicae* 136.3 (1990): 193-196.

3. Sherman, Glen Aldridge. “Properties of Paradoxical Subsets in the Plane.” *Journal of Geometry*. 40.1-2 (1991): 170-174.

4. Burke, Maxim R. “Paradoxical decompositions of planar sets of positive outer measure.” *Journal of Geometry*. 79.1-2 (2004): 56-58.

5. Laczkovich, Miklós. “Paradoxical Decompositions: A Survey of Recent Results.” *First European Congress of Mathematics Paris, July 6-10, 1992 Vol. II: Invited Lectures (Part 2)*, 1994.

This is a very interesting subject, and although the prerequisite knowledge for a complete understanding [as far as what is understood] may seem daunting (group theory, measure theory, working familiarity with the axiom of choice, etc), the knowledge needed to start out is quite elementary. In fact, a famous example of a paradoxical set was studied by Galileo when he discovered the 1-1 correspondence between positive integers and their squares, which is an example anyone curious about math has been shown or has studied on their own (the example of the correspondence between positive integers and even positive integers in the video is analogous).",Number Theory,MyOverflow,7,1438419312,,t5_2qh0n

Why am I saying all of that? Because I cannot feel insecure about Europe's place in the world. I just don't feel European in the first place. Yes, my country is in the EU. No, that doesn't mean EU first, my country later. The EU is just too new. See, trust is built over the years and actions. And the EU is not past the point where countries trust each other.

Even if there had been no war between the Western powers and the Axis powers, it seems fairly plausible that a Western-Soviet war would have erupted: the USSR was an expansionary power that sought to claim hegemony over Eastern Europe, while the older European powers wished to prevent other entities from doing so. All the while, colonialism was going to start to enter a decline, world war or not, even if anti-colonialism would likely have gone much slower without the colonial powers being weakened by being in total war for half a decade; and the resultant wind-down of colonialism would itself spark some potential flare ups for global conflict between powers that now *hadn't* had a long major war to make them more conflict averse.

Nor, for that matter, is it hard to imagine a different radical, bellicose dictator taking power in Germany -- Hitler, horrible as he was, did not have a monopoly on that.

Because of Rome's hegemony for as far back as anyone could remember, its spectre still loomed above Europe for centuries more. After the transition, a peried now understood to be less dramatic as the name ""Dark Ages"" would suggest, Latin dialects lived on. In Italy and in the Alps (where Fabri is from), people still retained close to what we would recognize as latin names. What changed, and we see this happening as far back as the first century AD, is that in everyday colloquial language people were dropping the sonsinants at the end of words. Names were no different. Claudius --&gt; Claudio, Julius --&gt; Giulio. There are a ton of names in the middle ages, especially in the early half, that show mix and match localized latinish names from around the mediterranean and Italy. Also, remember that classical latin which we know as latin was more or less maintained in academia, the church, diplomacy, and as a lingua franca used between wealthy/educated people who spoke different first languages. 

The shift from latin to what we now see as distinct, albeit closely related, languages in Europe is incredibly interesting and if you can speak French, Italian, or Spanish and know a bit about Latin you really owe it to yourself to look into the earlier versions such as old french to see this transition unfold.

Went to eastern Europe, I want to say Ukraine but it's been a while.  This was in the 90s btw, when the dollar was worth a lot more, and he was hot shit in that pond.  Met a woman doctor that bounced on his dick and rode it all the way back to the states.

They lived in the 'burbs.  She started working getting recertified or whatever the million bullshit hoops they put out for foreign doctors, all doing it on his dime.  

When they met, she treated him like the greatest man ever.  That naturally normalized, but then she started talking down to him - she has an education, he doesn't.  Started treating him like a yokel.  And started talking up the doctors she was working with.  In response, he subdivided his land and built her her own medical office/practice/building in the sticks.  Was enough people around to make good business.  

It wasn't used for a single day.  They divorced after 5, 6 years, and she's now working in a ritzy hospital in the city and about to get married to a fancy doctor.

This is the most pointed example, but I've seen this happen multiple times, where a guy meets a girl in a small pond where he's the big shit, brings her to a bigger pond where he's not so important.... and they jump ship fast enough.

Seen it with russian girls in Germany, eastern european girls all over the place, and even with some city guys here in the states with normal american girls from the backwater sticks who never experienced city or even suburban life at all and were all isolated -- suddenly going to parties, gambling, jetsetting, whatever new adventure.

Some get a taste of new life, love it and go off to ride the CC, others just marry the next guy up the chain.  It sounds like what happened to your friend.

Another point - if you also look at the average demographic of a UKIP voter, they could be persuaded by Corbyn - over 70% of UKIP voters favour renationalisation of key industries, so does Corbyn. He is also tough on the EU - he wants to stay in for now, but only, and he actually means it, if we can work with the rest of Europe to reform it.

Where did I say that every Tory voter was a radical right-wing Thatcherite? My point was the exact opposite, the country has voted in a government to the right of where the average voter sits. Why can't they do the same with a left-wing government?",Yorkshire,QuillRat,1,1438426795,eng-yorkshire,t5_2qhqb
False,26,Games,ctntjzf,,t3_3fe6kz,1440217661,t1_ctnsy1h,0,0,"Region locking isn't a bad practice if it were done for price protection reasons.

Unfortunately it's generally done as a flat system(Ala Nintendo) that gives zero shits about price protection and is normally more concerned with things like publisher protection. You can't buy the Japanese version of Game X for the PAL region in case someone decides in the next 20 years to localize/release it in your region as it would steal their sales.

And it get's even worse when your looking at one english speaking region having something that the other doesn't IE NA/EU. Because publisher restrictions.

But having a hard region lock on a copy from Country X because games cost half the price their isn't really a bad thing. Provided you don't prevent them activating full price copies as well. And there is a system in place if they ever permanently leave their country to allow them to play it outside of that region

-----

I'd be curious how much region to region locking takes place within the EU though. Aside from those made to conform with local censorship laws.

---

I mean if you were to demand price parity across 2 regions and one of those regions were to get reemed to the point where no one buys games. You could end up with the game simply not being localized/released in that region. ""Because that country won't buy it anyway"" so while you don't have an official region lock you have a soft one in that, unless you speak one of the supported languages, you'll be shit out of luck because they have decided everyone in ""JohnLongBottomOstan"" won't buy it at that price so their is no reason to translate the game into ""LongBotsostanian""",,Alinosburns,26,1438427288,,t5_2qhwp

T-Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceLlz7dOOvY

As the title tells us, T-Mac scored 13 points in 33 seconds, but that happened over a real length of 7 minutes of time. Whenever I show (mostly European soccer-watching) friends the T-Mac clip they're immediately shocked and appalled when it breaks to commercial. ""Oh, so he didn't *actually* do it in 33 seconds?"" It comes with big breaks in the game, which diminishes its incredibility.

Then again, T-Mac's streak has some really impressive bits. 4-in-a-row in the clutch. And-1. Game winning buzzer-beater. Facing Duncan's spurs, perhaps the greatest dynasty ever. to top it off It's hard to scoff at. To recap, 13 points in 7 minutes total and 35 seconds of game time.

Reggie Miller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY0NFTs-UJE

The other obvious parallel is Reggie Miller. Reggie's streak looks pretty similar to Rodney Rogers's. Down 6 points with a little less than 19 seconds on the clock, he hits a 3, followed by a steal and another 3. Then about a minute elapses and he makes two free throws to seal the game. 8 points, in about 2:30 minutes of real time with 18.7 seconds on the clock.

The case for Reggie starts with his stage. Unlike T-Mac's performance, which happened on an otherwise forgettable December night, Reggie made these shots in the Eastern Conference Finals, on the road, against the opponent that had defeated them in the same series the year before.  If you haven't seen the ESPN 30-for-30 that takes a more in-depth look at the Hicks Vs. Knicks rivalry, go watch it on youtube for free. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY0NFTs-UJE

If we're just looking at the stand-alone performance, 8 points in 18.7 seconds is quite something. However, I think the 2 free throws at the end diminish it a little in comparison to the others. These weren't And-1's and it's way more impressive to score points from the field. But, they were the shots that gave the Pacers the game, which is worth a lot considering.....

:'(


:''(


:'''''''''(

Rodney Rogers's team lost the game! 9 points in 26 seconds of real time and 8 seconds of game clock.

What a kick in the teeth. You're down eight points and have the best timed hot streak of your career, going hot as a white dwarf star with 30 seconds left, hit three treys from different parts of the field including a turn-around rainbow from the corner only to get sent packing a minute later by Stockton and Malone.

It's good, but it wasn't a game-winner and it wasn't a game winner in a hotly contested playoff series. And when you don't hit game-winners, you sometimes lose the game thus demoting your achievement from a GOAT moment to a hot-streak.

This isn't true for the bottom 90% of the US.  GDP is only an index; it's not an actual measure of how happy people are, which should be the primary goal of any representative system.  General wealth is very important in reaching that goal, absolutely, which is why we can't just give everyone ponies for free and have to rely on an actual economic system, but it's not the goal and the US, which used to be succeeding at that goal, is now failing.

It's not failing as miserably as many countries in the world, it's true, but various countries in Europe in particular are actually succeeding more than we are.  They get universal healthcare, maternity leave, free university, etc.  We in the US instead get people stuck in a cycle of poverty specifically because they don't have access to these.  I'm sure people actually stuck in that cycle don't give a shit about GDP.

I bought way, way too much, so I guess I did my part as a tourist, hehe.

I went with the intention of buying enough for a lopapeysa and Elizabeth Zimmermann's pi shawl. I got 11 skeins of Lett-Lopi for the lopapeysa and 4 skeins (plates? wheels? I don't know, it's not really a skein) of the unspun Plotulopi (some people don't like it, because it's unspun and can be fragile if you knit really tight.. but personally, I love it, and would encourage anyone to try it because it's so unique!). But of course I got more than I meant to... I also bought 4 skeins of the laceweight Einband, 6 skeins of Kambgarn (this is more plied than the other Istex yarns and seems softer to me, but I didn't see it at most stores - just at Hagkaup), 6 skeins of bulky Alafoss (for Christmas mittens), and 6 additional skeins of Lettlopi. It was definitely as cheap as I was hoping it would be - all of that was the equivalent of about 100 USD (which was my entire yarn budget for my whole Europe trip, shh).

But even in the USA, it's around 35% that want at least some pubic hair (fyi:  Those are fuzzy [no pun intended] stats I read -- just recalling off the top of my head).  That's hardly insignificant.  It also seems to be trend-ish.  ie:  Wait long enough and the pendulum will swing back the other way.",,pilosusantrum,1,1438436480,,t5_vf2

Hahahahahahahahahaha. You fucking joking me? That's your big concern? Your daughter will end up marring a fucking black guy? The chance of this happening is so fucking small, its laughable that you would even consider this as a reason to not reproduce, you are fucking absurd. 

Women primarily need two things from there man, for him to have resources and to command authority. Black men fail catastrophically in both cases. 

They are the bottom of the economic barrel, in America, Europe and Asia, everywhere you look they are the group least able to provide for there women and there families and despite what you many believe, women do take note of this. 

As far as authority goes, they fail even harder, just look at the black family in the US, around 50% of all black families don't have a fucking father around, yes you got that right, around 50%, its not a case of them having low authority in the family, its a case of them not even existing in the family. You can talk about feminism and how white women bitch about white men and that is all true but it doesn't even compare to how black women talk about black men. They fucking despise each other, black women, the group that has the most contact with black men, have absolutely zero respect for them, this is not just some small feminist minority as in the case for whites or asians, this is widespread. 

You know the stereotype that black men have a thing for fat white women? This isn't because they like fat women, this is because they can't fucking do any better. 

If you are a half decent father, hell, even if you are an emasculated looser, there chance of her marrying an africa are very low, women many not be as smart as men when it comes to things such as science but they are not braindead idiots, they want (need) a man with resources and authority (in one word, stability) and many of them know that blacks are not good.

I don't know where you got the idea that white women are attracted to blacks but this is not even close to reality, its very much the opposite. Its almost always a fat woman or an older women or a women with a mental problem (like the recent Irish coal burner). The only thing that could make white women consider black men is the liberal media brainwashing, something that you can negate with ease.

As a redpill father, there is nothing to fear so get rid of this sorry excuse and do your duty for Europe. Have a family and instill traditional family values into your children.",Vlad the Impaler - best Romanian diplomat,BladeStrikes,4,1438436956,ROMA,t5_2u7i2

The problem with that is making sure the money is used to help the migrants build a life in that country and not just swelling someones bank account.

The EU should make sure it's aid money is being used effectively and not being siphoned off. It is pretty clear that the way aid money is current managed is not working, all the young men who are coming onto the EU to find work should be working in Africa etc creating infrastructure, building homes etc. This is probably neo-colonialist but I think we should have EU officials overseeing the projects that EU money is spent on.",England,keef2000,8,1438437044,cnty-england,t5_2qhqb

  Remember the overwhelming majority of migrants to the EU do aim to settle in other nations, these are the fraction for whom the UK seems worth the extra risk.

**Scientific Name:** *Capra ibex eale*

**Habitat:** The yale was a species of wild goat that once lived in the mountainous environment of the European Alps, including most all of the French alpine ranges, southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovenia. Yales once lived in steep, rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests, where it occupied rough terrain at elevations of 1,800 to 3,300 metres (5,900 to 10,800 ft). Despite being physically larger than their Alpine ibex cousin, yales were not usually found in wooded areas, though adult males in densely populated areas were recorded to have stayed in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland if there is no snow. Males also typically spent winters in the forests, while females most often times were found in different habitats.

Females preferred steep terrain more so than males, while males inhabited the lowland meadows during the spring, when the snow melted to reveal green grass for foraging. They then migrated to alpine meadows during the summer. With the coming of winter, both male and female yales moved to steep, rocky slopes with little snow, preferring slopes of 30–45°, while using small caves and overhangs for shelter. The home ranges of yales tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter, and moderate in spring, with females having smaller ranges than males. 

Yales were strictly herbivores, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the rest being a myriad of different mosses, flowers, leaves, and twigs. If leaves and shoots are out of reach, they often stood on their rear legs to reach them. The climbing ability of the yale was also noted, especially when being observed moving to (or at) great heights to obtain mineral salts in their diets.

**Physical Appearance:** The yale, also called the ""centicore"" (Latin: *eale*, Hebrew: *yael*) is a mythical beast found in European mythology and heraldry that dates back to pre-Roman times. It was an antelope- or goat-like, four-legged creature with large horns that it can swivel in any direction. It also bore cloven hooves, a lion-like tail, a goat-like beard, and, in some specimens, boar-like tusks. Both male and female yales had large, backwards-curving, black-colored horns with numerous ridges along their length, that were said to have been able to turn in any direction. Males were also noticeably larger than females, and carried larger, curved horns, indicating sexual dimorphism in the species.

Thought to be a separate or subspecies to the Alpine ibex, the yale had different coloring than the Alpine ibex, as seen in the similar instance of the different coat of the also now-extinct quagga, compared to the zebra from which it had begun to evolve away from. Known for its colorful, spotted coat pattern, similar to that seen in Dalmatian dogs and Appaloosa horses today, the yale had a distinctive, preferred leopard complex (LP) spotted coat. Spotting occurred in several patterns on top of one of several recognized base coat colors, though the most often documented was white-on-black. Three other distinctive characteristics also separated the yale from the Alpine ibex: mottled skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white sclera. Skin mottling was usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, buttocks, and genitalia. Striped hooves, while not always present, were also very common. 

The occasional yale would also be born with little or no visible spotting pattern. While it was not always easy to predict a young yale's color from birth, yale kids were usually born with coats that darkened when they shed their baby hair. In addition, yale kids did not always show classic leopard complex patterns or traits. These would usually change over the course of the yale's life, especially with yearly shedding, though leopard patterns were noted to be stable. Other yales showed very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they matured in age.

Compared with its cousin, the Alpine ibex, and other members of its genus, the yale had a short, broad head, and a larger size. In addition to the leopard complex spotting, the yale possessed a pale, snow-white abdomen for females and black for males, and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat. Like the Alpine ibex, the yale moulted twice a year, firstly in April or May, and then again in September, when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat.

**Magical Attributes:** The yale's primary magical attribute were its hollow horns, which could swivel in any direction. It is said that, using its horns, the yale was able to magically amplify noises through its horns, increasing the vibrations through the ears and skull. This is thought to be a defense mechanism that evolved in the yale to help it escape the likes of larger magical predators, such as manticores, before the predator could attack them with its deadly poison.

The horn swiveling function also allowed the yale to amplify different sounds from different directions, tuning into different frequencies, akin to moving the antenna on an old television or radio. The yale's horns also allowed males, during mating season, to magically amplify their own mating calls and vocal challenges to female and male yales, respectively. Due to this, yale horns were highly sought after by witches and wizards of Hebrew or Jewish descent, who would fashion yale horns into shofars, without having to charm the objects to amplify sound.

Crushed or powdered yale horns were also once used in various potions to increase the overall potency or strength of the concoction. They were a particularly crucial ingredient in potions used to restore, or amplify, the drinker's voice or hearing temporarily. 

**Reason for extinction:** The yale's range was once a swath of territory through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 1500's, however, the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching. The yale first became extinct in Switzerland and Germany by the 18th century (1700's), and were extinct in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century (1800's). 

Only a small population of yales remained by that point in and around the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise Massif. Located in the western Italian Alps and the Maurienne Valley in the northeastern French Alps, bordering the Vanoise and Gran Paradiso Massif, in 1854 a protected area was established by Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia and Italy. Despite the King's decree, however, the rarity of the yale, and its highly sought after horns, caused poachers to hunt the beast into extinction. Due to so few yales remaining, low genetic diversity and the advanced age of the remaining yales is also have thought to have played a role in the failure of the species to reproduce faster than they were being killed. 

The use and sale of yale horns, particularly as potions used to as treatment to restore loss of hearing or voice, particularly drove poachers to hunt the few remaining yales. As the yale became rarer and rarer, the price of yale horns skyrocketed. Those who were particularly desperate or determined to keep their voice or hearing, thanks to use of yale horns in their regular medicated potions, offered many Galleons for the objects. Eager to get rich quick, magical poachers and beast hunters drove the species into extinction within 20 years, despite efforts to preserve the creatures.

The last yale, a male named ""Yorick"", was thought to have been killed in 1871, and it is now taxidermied and on display at the National Museum of Magic and Bestiary of London.

One thing to keep in mind is that the junk production of capitalism has largely been eliminated. The Americans retain a marked fondness for trinkets and gadgets, but to a far lesser degree than under full-on capitalism, where it was common to produce items with no discernible purpose and then create demand by advertising them to consumers. Also, the capitalist tendency towards planned obsolescence is anathema to advanced socialist economic planning. 

This means that material prosperity is measured at least in part by the durability of goods. The EUSR in particular places a high degree of emphasis on the goods they produce retaining their value for a long period of time, meaning that total rates of production can be lower while maintaining a good standard of living. Further, machines are designed so that parts are easily replaceable, meaning that instead of producing an entire new line of stoves, for example, it is possible to distribute new lines of stove elements which use less electricity when they become available; they are designed to be easily slotted into older models. The same applies for other machines such as cars and computers. Household furniture can be expected to last a lifetime with good maintenance. Thus, gross domestic production is comparable to pre-revolution capitalism, because the value of highly durable goods is reckoned to be higher, while allowing for a smaller amount of physical production and less energy use.

However, extremely rapid industrialization was not without its costs. Countries which advanced to socialist industrialism directly from agrarian societies experienced environmental degradation, with China in particular losing much of its forest cover and suffering from severe pollution. 

However, the globalist shift that occured politically in the late 70s meant that by the 1980s, prevailing political ideology held that economic planning should be as long-term as possible and should take into account the degradation of the environment as a cost of production. Thus production with a very high impact on the environment was reckoned to be too 'expensive' to maintain except under special circumstances. 

By the 2000s, it was widely recognized that global warming due to human activity was more severe than had been anticipated and major steps were taken to develop alternate sources of energy. Energy-intensive centres of production subsidized the development and construction of energy projects around the world. China in particular paved the way in solar technology, helping to construct huge solar energy projects in deserts in Libya, Australia, and Mongolia. Hydro-electric power from Quebec runs much of eastern North America, while tidal watermills and large windfarms power much of Europe and Japan.

A global fund was established to funnel promising engineering students into energy research, leading to the development of extremely durable clean battery models. This project also incidentally led to the development of the EM drive at Shanghai Central University.

In 2015, the UN is considering subsidizing a global project to retrofit all vehicles to run on electricity. It is generally reckoned that global temperatures will remain stable as oil dependence is gradually lessened.",,gepeg-libre,1,1438440507,,t5_2rux3
False,1,engineering,ctnxikb,,t3_3dxldi,1440219528,t3_3dxldi,0,0,"Hi folks,

I just found this subreddit and hope to learn a lot more about the discipline of engineering as I read through it. 

Basically wanted to ask you guys a few questions about moving into the engineering field at University and your advice or words of warning for such a path. I just turned 25 and already have two degrees, having trained as a lawyer and received a Master's degree in law in a European nation. If I'm being completely honest though, I am extremely bored by my work and feel that, with the limited exception of a very few jobs, that I will not be able to find the sort of satisfaction I am looking for in this career field. I became very interested in science, mathematics, and engineering as a result of many factors: I took a course in finance in my Master's degree that got me very curious in mathematics again; I read a truly fantastic little book called 'How Computers Work'; and my experiences taking my father to and from hospitals and learning not only about his illness and disease but also the remarkable technological, scientific, and engineering developments which allowed his doctors to try to help him. 

I picked up a book called 'Mathematics for the non-Mathematician' by a fellow called Morris Kline, and do not think that it is too dramatic to say that it radically changed my outlook on mathematics, science, and the role of mathematics in science and engineering. I was decent in maths in school but frankly never really understood the 'why' or 'how' - even if I was able to competently integrate and differentiate. I think I finally am however starting to understand the intuition behind how we can use mathematics to model physical phenomena, and I just get more and more interested in how you folks use mathematical understanding of natural phenomena to help try to build and create. 

I've started re-teaching myself mathematics and hope that I can get back up to basically where I was when I left high school (e.g. AP calculus AB), if not a bit further. 

If I wished to go back to University to retrain, do you guys think it is actually realistic for someone to adjust to that kind of academic environment without being in a formal classroom environment to get used to doing and learning mathematics again? or would I be well-advised to go back to CC and start taking courses in maths and sciences to see how I perform and how much I actually like the real hard work of engineering rather than just the mere thought of becoming an engineer? 

I thank you for your advice!

NYC, Washington D.C., San Francisco, Portland, OR and Vancouver, BC for example are great grid-based or grid-inspired cities, with lots of outdoor areas people enjoy using (there's some failures in all places of course), have good transit that supports pedestrian activity and their public spaces tend to get used well. Vancouver in particular is usually singled out as one of the most livable cities on the planet. But you can find, for example, outdoor cafe dining in all of those places, and it's heavily used.

In Europe you can find similar layouts in Barcelona and Paris and other cities which feature heavily used outdoor non-crap spaces and pedestrian sized grids. This kind of public planning goes back to the Roman era, which was definitely non-car, and ancient European cores often still feature the original Roman layout, but all of the cities I mention had their grid layouts planned before or right at the beginning of the car, so they weren't really planned ""for cars"". They're all grids or grid inspired spaces.

What you are probably talking about are places like Houston, which is somewhat a grid, or Denver, but had the bulk of the city planning done post-car. You'll notice also that both cities feature heavy intrusion of highways and other high-capacity roadways into the city center. This isn't really a feature of the other cities as much. 

European cities with long histories and no sustained central planning tend to feature several concentric layers, each with different pedestrian-to-car features:

* A Roman-era Core (may not exist if the city was founded as a Roman settlement, but this is common for much of Europe), grid-based, but pedestrian-scale

* A medieval-era second-core. Usually a labyrinth of irregular streets that originated as walking paths or cart trails. Many are today popular shopping areas.

* A later planned expansion, usually grid or grid-like. Wider streets which later became used for cars, but still features good pedestrian and mixed-use features. Almost always planned and laid out pre-WW2

* A more modern donut around the entire city of a mish-mash of whatever and features as terrible planning and design as anywhere else. The bulk of the population usually lives here. These are the European equivalent of American Suburbs, but with better public transit to the more walk-able cores layers.

The first two of these usually feature great public spaces, parks, piazzas/squares, cafes, etc. While this gets worse the further out you go. Not all cities are like this, London is just a continuous mish-mash of whatever that's aggregated over centuries. London is also almost impossible to navigate, has constant traffic issues, some good, some poor public spaces, and land-prices are so high now that it resists better civic planning. If it wasn't for the extensive public transit system, London would probably cease to function.

I've noticed in London that public space usage almost entirely inversely correlates to when the space was built (once you account for the weather). St. James's Park, was established in 1603, and you can usually see a nice number of people out and enjoying the area. The [square in front of the British Library](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/103CE/production/_84601566_britishlibrarypa.jpg) looks like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie, while St. Pancras station next door (originally built in the 19th century and more recently modernized is teaming with life, not all of which are train passengers. Walk into the library and there's plenty of people inside, but nobody wants to hang out in the square. The [station is full of people](https://scalingmountlu.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/stpancrasstation.jpg) inside and out and represents a much better public space.

You can find similar juxtapositions in American cities. Madison Square Park in New York city usually has people out and enjoying the park, eating at local eateries, etc. And then you can find squares in front of modern skyscrapers people can't be helped but to run through to escape from. I will add, however, that many parks in NYC were avoided for years due to homelessness, crime and other problems. There's been a recent revival in places like Battery Park and also Madison Square Park as people have started to realize the value of these public spaces.

The good news is that it appears the late 20th century madness that made so many terrible crap spaces may finally be receding. In top U.S. cities, there's a whole renewed interest in making livable, well-used, public spaces. Modeled somewhat on the European model, but also there's plenty of new ideas, North End Way in NYC (next to the new World Trade Center) is a fully new development, but features mixed use ""outdoor"" areas, but under a covered arcade. So people enjoy going there and hanging out and eating and doing whatever even when the weather is poor. When I've gone there in the evening its generally *packed* with people, this despite the surrounding environment being a little sterile and hostile to pedestrians.

Americans *really* want European-style outdoor spaces, but since so much of our infrastructure was built post-car, we suffer through and drive to the nearest Starbucks for the pleasure instead.

He touched a living enemy soldier and disarmed an enemy when he turned a corner and found himself face to face with a young German soldier:
“ 	The collision knocked the German's weapon to the ground. Mr. [Medicine] Crow lowered his own weapon and the two fought hand-to-hand. In the end Mr. Crow got the best of the German, grabbing him by the neck and choking him. He was going to kill the German soldier on the spot when the man screamed out ""momma."" Mr. Crow then let him go.[2] 	”

He also led a successful war party and stole an enemy horse, making a midnight raid to steal the horses from a battalion of German officers (as he rode off, he sang a traditional Crow honor song.) He is the last member of the Crow tribe to become a war chief.[2] Of his story, documentarian Ken Burns said, ""The story of Joseph Medicine Crow is something I've wanted to tell for 20 years.""[3] Medicine Crow was interviewed and appeared in the 2007 Ken Burns PBS series The War, describing his World War II service.""",,Blaqsheep214,2,1438442929,,t5_2qqjc

So, great question, but let me adjust your premise. 

First, western education owes an enormous debt to Muslim scholarship with which Christian scholars came into contact especially from the 12th century in places like Toledo and Cordoba in Spain (both of which had flourishing cosmopolitan cultures and great libraries) and Sicily. This contact re-introduced them to Greek scientific thought, which had been mostly lost in the West as the Roman education system decayed in late antiquity. Aristotle was the key thinker they rediscovered. His logical works became foundational for western universities, which were themselves developing from smaller schools in the larger towns of late 12th and early 13th-century Europe. The towns themselves were growing as the result of the commercial revival that spurred an urban revival where such schools could flourish.

By the thirteenth century there were universities in pretty much all the major cities of Europe. Western higher education, though limited to a small minority, had developed teaching and learning techniques that in many ways laid the foundation for subsequent western thought. Specifically, western schools had developed the method of [scholasticism] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism): the rigorous application of questions to all kinds of basic issues, esp. in theology and philosophy, and the attempt to answer these questions through the application of Aristotle’s logic fused with Christian revelation. Medieval universities were driven by incredible curiosity about all sorts of issues which they could investigate through scholastic logic. In fact, western education in the later Middle Ages could rival anything in the Islamic world by this point; [Islam’s Golden Age was near its end by then] (http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science).

The intellectual explorations grew even bolder in the Italian Renaissance, where scholars scoured Europe’s monastic libraries for copies of classical works in Latin (and later Greek), which were not that attractive to the scholastic method.  The spread of these texts among humanist scholars, the editing of them into standard editions, and the invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century meant that humanist education in the liberal arts was available throughout most of Europe. (The word “humanist” comes from the slang “umanista” which is what students called their professors who taught the *new* discipline of “the humanities,” a subject foreign to medieval universities.)

So let’s reject your tentative conclusion that “catholicism is a poor foundation for excellence in education and other intellectual endeavors.” With its tools of logic (which arguably created the questioning of reality and putting it to logical test which is the hallmark of western thinking and western science) and its interest in recovering and applying classical Greek and Roman knowledge to the study of self, medieval and Renaissance education were excellent foundations.

Come the Reformation. The reality is that, for all its innovation at the upper end of society, the Catholic church had never devised any universal system of education for either its priests or for ordinary people until the 16th century spurred by the Reformation. The Protestant progress in the Reformation made the church realize that it needed to better educate its priests and its people if it were to compete with Protestants. Defend Catholicism by better educating its members so that they understood church doctrine. The Jesuits were founded in 1534 early in the Reformation as a movement in part to better educate priests who in turn could educate ordinary Catholics. There were others too that I’m going to skip due to time.  Jesuits opened their first primary schools in the mid-1550s and they snowballed, combining as they did rigorous training in Catholic doctrine and humanist-oriented interest in the development of individual potential. 

To answer your second question about how the Jesuits became excellent educators, I’m sending you to Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley’s very thorough article on [“How the First Jesuits Became Involved in Education”] (https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/top/church21/pdf/HowtheFirstJesuitsBecameInvolvedinEducation.pdf) that goes into much greater detail than I have time for right now.

This worked out perfectly, churning out a lot of promising/proven players these past 5-6 years. To sum up: Janmaat (Newcastle), Martins Indi (FC Porto), de Vrij (Lazio), Clasie (Southampton) and we still have a new generation of youngsters in Kongolo, van Beek (who are considered some of the best defenders in the Eredivisie already despite their young age) Boëtius, Vilhena and Karsdorp.   
  
Besides, the players we did purchase have mostly proven themselves wonderfully so far: Graziano Pelle (who's story is known), Jens Toornstra (who's doing decently) and Karim El Ahmadi who's been a stable factor in the team this past season.   
  
The result of the financial crisis at Feyenoord, climaxing in the 2010 season, is the fact that there's no way our board will ever overspend on any player. They won't risk it, since overspending and huge salaries are what nearly ruined us last time around. Because of this, Ajax and PSV have much more to spend, but as people in this thread have already pointed out the players they want/can afford have no interest in playing in the Eredivisie and rather go to mid-lower table Premier League teams, eastern Europe, Turkey or even the oil-countries. Simply put, the wages are higher nearly everywhere.    
  
Basically, Eredivisie consists of 1) Promising youngsters who leave before they're 23 (Boëtius, Kishna, El Ghazi, Depay, etc). 2) The youngsters that stayed and weren't good enough for other leagues (Lex Immers, Jens Toornstra, Jan-Arie van der Heijden) and 3) returning veterans who have finally accumulated enough money in their career to justify lowering their salary by a couple million a year (Heitinga, Kuyt).

If we want something to model it on, then we can use Prospect magazine as a role model. It features articles from a whole range of figures with contrasting perspectives, and will often have long form articles from both of them where they give their opinions on specific issues. That's what I think we should do. 

We're all just redditors. We don't necessarily have anything in common with each other, other than the fact that we all find geopolitics interesting, and an appreciation for dispassionate discussion. We shouldn't try to impose a common set of principles when we have no common principles.

If we really want, we can have a popular theme for each week/month. 

* So say, we could have one week/month where we mostly write articles about US hegemony in the world (and therefore some tangental discussion of other world players). 

* We could have different week where we discuss the relevance of international organisations like the European Union, World Trade Organisation, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Euroasian Union and United Nations (and obviously discuss older forms like the League of Nations and the Warsaw Pact). 

* Then we could have a different week about, to what extent traditional military power is important (and therefore, also discuss what other things are also/more important like finance, technology and culture). 

I'm sure we could think of enough themes to last us for quite a while, plus a whole range of other sections within it. I'd say that we should also have some smaller articles that act as traditional reporting pieces where we draw attention to events that have happened in the world (e.g. oil price shifts, elections in major countries, new treaties, et al) and maybe also a few sections where contributing writers can discuss things that are not part of that week/month's 'theme'.

In three plebiscite elections, Napoleon was able to place a constitution that gave him the majority of the power, become First Consul for life, then became Emperor.

In 1800, there was a plebiscite to decide on the election of a new Constitution, which is common during the French Revolution. Andrew Roberts in *Napoleon: A Life* had gone through both voting figures, voting reports, and population reports for voting districts in France for all three plebiscites and didn't find any real irregularities in the support of the Constitution of 1800.

The next plebiscite to make Napoleon First Consul for Life was in 1802. By then, Napoleon made a peace with all of Europe, allowing France to exist in a period of peace for the first time since 1792. The report for voting was still overwhelmingly in favor of Napoleon (reportedly 99%) but was more realistically (according to Roberts) 90%. If anything, this shows that the people were happy with Napoleon, and with the first peace in a decade, few would have a hard time disagreeing.

The final plebiscite was the vote for the creation of the Imperial Court. About half of France's eligible population voted (second highest compared to the vote for First Consul for Life, which was at 58%) and still voted in the affirmative that Napoleon should be a hereditary Emperor. However, here Roberts does find voting irregularities in how the army voted (all in favor of Napoleon being Emperor) and little spots here and there (a small city of a few hundred placing a thousand votes) and such. After doing the work, Roberts still asserts that Napoleon was rightfully and democratically elected as Emperor, but at a figure closer to 70% rather than the 99% Napoleon claimed. This is where, according to Roberts, Napoleon starts to fudge numbers, which is a common theme in his propaganda at the time.

However, there are people who didn't like Napoleon, assassination attempts were made but normally at the hands of Royalists more interested in returning the Bourbons to the French throne. After an attempt in 1800, Napoleon took measures to prevent assassination attempts from working and proved to be effective as he never had a serious attempt happen after.

There wasn't a protest to Napoleon being Emperor because France generally loved him. He created peace and a fine legal code (actually created by a co-consul but guided by him) that lives to this day. It wouldn't be until 1814 when Napoleon becomes unpopular, which is seen not in general actions by the public but rather people evading conscription.",18th &amp; 19th Century France | Early Modern Military Theory,DonaldFDraper,1,1438448737,europe,t5_2ssp3

So yeah, we're liberal compared to the States. We also are very direct to the point of being really blunt. We don't do the niceties like in Britain. Conversely, we also don't do passive-aggressiveness. Just be straight with Dutchies, and it'll go a long way.

Scandinavia is a different animal. While I do feel somewhat related to Denmark, I feel no connection to the rest of Scandinavia. But if I had to choose, I would definitely choose them as my neighbours.

The average cost of just the MOVING (not the secondary cost of staff, cages, etc) ONE Rhino from S.A to Botswana is over 45k.

The nations are less than 150 miles apart.

Moving these rhinos to the US or Europe as many people suggest would be massive. A million dollars is easily obtainable.


&gt;you said the rhino was killing other rhinos when the article clearly says they were only worried that he would, he hadnt killed any of them.

This article might of phrased it that way but no.
The man who won the auction did an interview after winning it and the US Fish &amp; Wildlife approved the trip and now the Rhino had already killed multiple other rhinos.

A) You are sheltered pussy so if you had a RPG nobody would fear you. You would be more likely to stub your toe and die from an affection.

False,2,AskReddit,cto4197,,t3_3ff8y6,1440222665,t3_3ff8y6,0,0,"I used to play a game a few years ago called Monster Hunter Tri; it was my first real dive into the genre of party based PvE and I quickly got hooked.

Later down the line after I had sunk a good 100 hours into the game I met a few guys called Orion, Tiffany and Estrell. These 3 members were, at the time, gods to me. I had played the game well over 100 hours at this point and had only achieved on the ranking system a Hero Rank (HR) of around 75, these guys were sitting in the 350+

While joining them I ran a few quests with them and then we added each other on the game. What followed later was something that I had never done before and that was to add and communicate with these members outside of the game on Facebook.

Tiffany headed up this group of hunters dubbing us The Coven of Celestial Tides. At the time and to MH3's finale we were arguably the highest ranked and most experienced players on the European/Oceana Servers with many of our members reaching a HR of 999 thus, we were quite well known in the community at the time.

Unfortunately, the Coven was destined for a fate the members of the group did not deserve. Tiffany, the leader of the Facebook page and really a cornerstone of the group itself was starting to raise some questions when many of the people who played within the coven tried to get in communication with her over Skype. The questions themselves were due to an issue with her avoidance and misgivings about even broaching the subject. Following some personal investigation by one of the members of the community, images of the one we knew as Tiffany were back traced to an Asian Model.

This revelation caused a huge panic in the Coven and following mass outcry on the finds, Tiffany disbanded the group and fell into a series of disastrous attempts at damage control. With so many of her friends being made online and the attempts to find people who had personal experiences with her proving to be unsuccessful. The group fell into disarray with many of the 25 or so members taking sides. Some were giving Tiffany a benefit of the doubt as to who she was (although the back traced images were fairly indisputable) others were trying to reason with the person who they had believed to be their friend and understand what drove them to create such an elaborate facade.

Regardless, new Facebook accounts were opened and with them came some false claims about the legitimacy of her identity. This spawned a whole new issue as members of the Coven really didn't know who the other people really were. Following an overwhelming sense of pain and betrayal, a new group was made that has been upholding the Legacy of MH Tri since the collapse of the Coven, and while many members never fully returned, the few of us that remained still talk from time to time.

I still miss the old members of that group dearly and it pains me to know the difficulties that many of the members faced even after the whole Tiffany thing blew over. But with the shut down of the Wii servers, even the long party chats in the game have fallen into shadow. Few, if any of us still remain in contact with each other. Once in a blue moon I will contact Estrell and I know that she stays in some communication with a few other members but all up, the group has died.

I miss it terribly and for all the new friends that I've made playing other games, I will still remember with fond adoration the time we broken few had together. Maybe someday in another game we shall hunt again.",,Voortsy,2,1438454216,,t5_2qh1i

It really bothers me that some people on this sub, likely people from North America or Europe, seem to be blaming the poverty of Haiti on the Haitians for ""reproducing too much"" as if decades of brutal colonization never existed. Haiti is primarily poor because they live on the degraded side of a once beautiful island that was colonized by greedy jerkface Europeans. The Spanish took one-half to raise cattle and the sell their leather, and the French destroyed the land on the other half by growing sugarcane everywhere with slave labor to sell as part of the rum trade. This activity was also a part of a larger trading pattern now known as the Atlantic Triangular Slave Trade. This brutal slave trading pattern ended up enriching both the US and Europe immensely while impoverishing other communities in Africa and the Caribbean.

and furthermore...

From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense to have more kids when you're poor just like plants tend to sprout more seeds not less when under environmental stress. Having kids helps bring more labor to your family (if they're allowed to grow up) which can help ensure the family's overall reproductive success.  People in prosperous cities have less children for a number of reasons: education and family planning, cost of living, lack of need for additional labor, and higher likelihood that their offspring will survive.",,gaiapunk,2,1438455389,,t5_2qh1e

I just thought I would post this for any folks who aren't aware of it, which seems to be quite common. I've seen a fair few posts lately where people are struggling with the big birds like the PMDG's and so on, but getting stuck with some of the basics of flying. That suggests a lot of guys are new to simming and have understandably been drawn by the big boys and their svelte sexiNESS (oh yes). Who wouldn't? However, they do not make friendly tutors, even if the fundamental principles are the same.

In real life, you learn to fly on a little plane like a Cessna or a Piper. They are nice and docile, simple to operate, and give good feedback to pilots to help them learn how a plane reacts to control inputs. You learn about instruments, controls, drag, flaps, stabilised approaches, patterns, effects of wind, roll, pitch, yaw, secondary effects of controls etc etc on the ground, then you go up and try it out. One step at a time you build a practical understanding of your aircraft. A real Private Pilots Licence requires a minimum of 45 flying hours in Europe, and will involve even more ground school time. THEN you would move up to increasingly complex aircraft, through planes with retractable gear and constant speed props, mutli-engine, commercial aviation and then finally up to the heavy metal, all the while building on the steps from before. Each underpins the next.

A sim like FSX tries to be as real as possible, and for this reason all the things you might learn on a real pilots programme are relevant to FSX. Wouldn't it be great if you could have some of that real world learning but in the much lower cost and safe environment of the sim? What if you could have one of the world's best instructors telling you really, REALLY awful jokes as you learned? Well, you can!

If you open FSX, and click on the option marked ""Learning Center"", then you will see a tab marked ""Lessons"". Click it. There's Rod! He's resting his arm on a propeller. Rod is very relaxed. Lets shout ""clear prop"". Rod would not look so relaxed anymore. But lets not be mean to Rod, because he is going to be our instructor for the next however long.

As you look down the list you will see a series of lessons there. I would most recommend the student pilot, private pilot and Instrument ones, as the later ones become necessarily abbreviated, but these will give you the most bang for buck in understanding the fundamentals of flight. EVERYTHING you learn here will be transferable to whatever fixed wings you choose to fly later. 

On top of that is a veritable encyclopaedia of aviation information on everything from choppers to taildraggers. Its sad that it does not appear to have been carried over into P3D and it is a massive selling point of FSX. So, if you want to fly, go meet Rod, and don't forget to courtesy laugh at his ""humorism"" or he will fail your checkride out of spite. Also possibly, because of bugs.

It is FSX after all :D","XP, P3D, FSX, DCS, GoogleEarth Flight Sim ;)",TheRealWireline,1,1438455677,,t5_2qspy

1438458165,10,brasil,cto4w79,,t3_3fej6w,1440223071,t3_3fej6w,0,0,"Tipo, um detalhe. o Ethereum roda ""só"" a parte do consenso distribuído (isto é, a parte mais complexa). Eu perguntei lá no /r/ethereum se alguém está fazendo um ""reddit p2p"" em cima dele e tinha um cara fazendo um sistema assim: cada post é feito armazenando uma referência na blockchain do Ethereum, mas o post em si é armazenado no [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/). É que não dá para armazenar muitos dados no Ethereum em si. Eles estão trabalhando num sistema de armazenamento de dados chamado Swarm, mas ainda não está pronto.

Existe também um competidor chamado [MaidSafe](http://maidsafe.net/) que possui uma arquitetura bem diferente do Ethereum. O MaidSafe não usa blockchain e pode armazenar dados (inclusive de uma aplicação rodando no Ethereum).

Mas então, suponha que você tenha um sistema rodando usando Ethereum ou MaidSafe. A ""moeda"" usada nessas redes serve para *pagar* os servidores que estão processando sua aplicação, da mesma forma que você paga a hospedagem de seu site. É uma situação diferente do Bitcoin. Já no IPFS você não paga, ele é tipo BitTorrent - se não tiver alguém ""seedando"" o conteúdo fica indisponível (mas existe o Filecoin, no qual você paga para computadores seedarem dados no IPFS).

O serviço real que o Ethereum fornece é tornar possível, ao menos em teoria, *provar de honestidade* das aplicações que rodam em cima dele. Este nível de confiabilidade é possível porque o código que roda o serviço não é executado em um servidor privado, mas sim em uma rede pública, p2p. E se eu executo um código eu posso auditá-lo.

O caso de uso clássico é o de ""contrato virtual"". Por exemplo, digamos que você fornece um serviço de câmbio em que seus usuários trocam moedas virtuais. Atualmente, serviços como esse necessitam que os usuários confiem na ""casa de câmbio"" (que podem sumir com suas Bitcoins, como o fundador da MtGox que, aliás, [foi preso hoje](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/01/asia/bitcoin-mt-gox-karpeles-arrested/)). Mas usando Ethereum, você pode criar uma aplicação [como o EtherEx](https://etherex.org/faq), em que os próprios criadores do serviço não possuem acesso ao seu dinheiro virtual!

Um ""reddit descentralizado"" usando o Ethereum também poderia dar uma garantia de que os programadores deste serviço não possuem poderes de deletar ou alterar posts, por exemplo. Ou que se eles deletarem alguma coisa, isto fique gravado publicamente. É um nível de transparência que um site tradicional não tem condições de fornecer, justamente por ser executado em um servidor privado, fora do acesso do público.

Hoje em dia aceitamos que empresas sejam ""donas"" dos sites que usamos e que elas não nos devem satisfação - quem está incomodado que vá usar alguma outra coisa ou faça seu próprio site. É possível que em algumas décadas muitos desses serviços sejam descentralizados. O que falta é deixar eles mais rápidos: o Ethereum é tão lento que você precisa programar toda a lógica da sua aplicação em torno dele.

Há também o argumento contrário: a Usenet (espécie de reddit da década de 80 até os primeiros anos da Web) era descentralizada e migramos de lá para serviços centralizados, e este ""movimento"" pela descentralização da Web pode não se concretizar.",,protestor,10,1438455902,,t5_2qh9i

Some context, I'm a software developer that writes software for a living. I also love this game, and at some point, wanted to do my own server, because there's only shitty one's out there. So I looked into it, got all the files working and tried to set up some kind of process for developing things.

Obviously, we only have the binaries, not the source code. I looked into ways of getting at least a basic form of version control for binaries, without much success. How do you do it? Just modify them and call it a day? Or do you keep track of the changes?

The community, well, is just terrible. There's not much exchange of knowledge going on, most simply try to sell what they know. Since I wasn't interested in making money with a server, paying wasn't an option. I think most servers are just cash cows, rather than being made by people who love this game. The community could create something amazing if it would just work together, at least that's how I feel.

I hope you can share some insights here. :)

Now, to answer your question. As I see it, bots are really hurting the game, but most won't play on servers that don't allow bots. Because of that, everything you can achieve through bots isn't actual content. Why would anyone spend their time getting something they could also get by turning on their bot and watching a movie instead? Since this game has pretty much no PvE end game and leveling/gearing it done through bots, there is nothing to do except PvP.

The PvP aspect however has absolute terrible balance. Basically, a full Chinese group has absolutely zero chance of winning against a full European group at the same skill level. I don't think balancing them is possible, so you'd have to take one out. Chinese only is far more popular I guess. Now that we've fixed the class balance, let's talk about the actual PvP content. The thing unique to the game is trading. Most servers increase the worth of the trade goods, absolutely necessary. But there's still the problem that new players on a server are unable to do more than 1* because they basically have no gear. PvP becomes less about who is the better player, and more about who has the better gear.

I think it is really simple to fix. Reduce gear scaling drastically. Make basic SoS gear obtainable through a few 1* trades or similar. Decrease alchemy success rate drastically and cap gear at +6. SoM should be obtainable after a few weeks on the server, only SoSun could take a while to get. Also remove all this premium crap like advanced elixirs.

Another problem is the rewards structure. Traders get most of the money, while Thieving only nets very little. Even them out, whatever job you pick, you should be able to get the same amount of money for the same effort.

Now, something that would surely be interesting, but I have no idea if it could be done. You have hunters mostly for killing/kiting the NPC thieves, not for actual protection of the traders. I'd make traders unable to dismount, and remove NPC thieves. By doing this, you need your hunters to protect the traders from thieves, like it should be.

Hubert Humphrey, in all likelihood, have won some of the early primaries, would have been able to build strong support all over the midwest and far west, and would have gained the nomination.  LBJ was chosen to represent the Southern states on the ticket, but with a Humphrey victory, the East would needed to have needed to balance the ticket.  So LBJ would have remained in the Senate.

But let's not forget, on the *other* side of the election stood Richard Nixon, who was no slouch of a candidate.  And it was no secret that, IRL, the Kennedys were planning on throwing their support behind Nixon in 1960, had Kennedy himself not gained the nomination.  Joseph Kennedy Sr. and Robert wouldn't have had quite the same national sway, but both were on the Conservative side of the Democratic party.  Robert has voted for Eisenhower in 1956.  Joseph would have clearly donated to Nixon's Presidential campaign (as he did in Nixon's campaigns for the Senate), and Robert probably been an operative for Nixon.  To wit, Nixon *would have won in 1960* had JFK had not been there to charm the American voters.  Nixon was the vice president at the time, and he had the party behind him.  He was remembered as a candidate who stood up to Communism, when plenty of others seemed soft on communism.

So the question needs to be, ""What would Nixon have done?""  And the answer: not much different.  The US had a slight advantage in having soldiers on the ground in Europe, ready to fight if it came to it, they had nuclear weapons ready to launch.  So why not force the Soviets to make the first move?  Strategically, the US was in a much better position than the Soviets, and would almost certainly have come out on top, although casualties would have been staggering, no matter what.",,saxonjf,6,1438458649,,t5_35koa

I measure money in euros, not in tons. 

I know that the employees have a high cost so the best thing would be to lower the number of employees. Creating an online bank could be a good option in that way.

About investor: my mention of chypriot crisis was not random. I miss the source but a bill that will enter in function in 2016 will allow bank of European Union to refund their capital with the deposit of their customer while a certain amount of money stay on their bank account. I don't know which level but it is supposed to be comparable to the Chypriot crisis so something like 100000 euros and may be lower.

Any people would prefer to risk one's money in an high risk investment than see it taken by the bank for free. That reality should make it easy to find people to invest in the creation of a bank.

For competition against existing bank, in EU for what I know people are so tired of the abuses of those banks that they would run for any decent alternative.

Make money is the hardest part of the problem. I would still use credit, especially microcredit that has proven to be very efficient when the persons that borrow money is followed by an association. Given the impoverishment of European populations, microcredit in Europe will be full of opportunities and a small local bank is in a better position to do microcredit than a big bank.

To lower the problem of investor, the idea would be that ""investor"" would actually be customer that prefer to have their money in a bank that they own. 

For IT it is far much easier than it looks like for a small bank because of the lower volume of transaction. Many free software are available and pretty efficient and one year of work is enough to build an IT architecture for a small bank. The biggest part is to protect your material against failure and theft and keep the coherence of your data. But if the volume of your transactions is &lt; 10000 per day I think it is affordable.

For cash points:Many strategies are possible.
* Borrow a licence to use already existing cash point like online bank already do
* Be only a secondary bank, so your customer still have a primary account from which they can 
* See if with the adhesion to the Visa / Mastercard system you don't automatically get access to world wide cash points

For compliance, each countries have it own particularity and we need to share information about that subject.

If you want to get through security quickly, don't wear a belt and wear shoes that you can easily take off and back on. Allthough that's optional. 

Try to get on the plane as early as you can and find yourself a good spot to put your bag in the overhead. You'll be happy if you don't have to keep it stuffed with your feet.

Depending on how tall you are, you might want to consider taking an aisle seat, just so you can stretch your legs out as long as no carts are being pushed along the aisles. If you aren't that tall a window seat might be better. You won't have to get up for anybody having to use the bathroon.

You'll arrive some time in the moring and you'll be tired, so try to get as much sleep on the plane as possible. Coming to Europe from the US basically steals your night hours. I really hate coming to Europe from the States. It gives me some serious jet lag for two or three days.

Takeoff feels strange the first few times: The whole plane starts shaking, the engines are cranking up and you're being pressed into the seat, but no reason to get nervous. Once you take off and you get a glance outside it's kinda cool! 

Also there is no reason to get nervous when things get shaky during the flight. Planes are made to withstand insane amounts of force! Turbulences are really no deal for a commercial aircraft, no matter how scary they feel! But be sure to wear your belt whenever possible. You know - for safety!

Oh, and most important: Ask if a free upgrade is available at check in! Last time I traveled, I was lucky enough to get 2 free upgrades from economy to economy plus.

Yes, this I can agree with, although tbh I don't know what specifically you're referring to.  For example, if someone were to ask me whether a Confucian family model (more commonly found in Taiwan) could coexist with a more egalitarian family model (more commonly found on the mainland), I don't see why it couldn't survive. If we're talking about traditional Chinese characters vs. simplified Chinese characters, again I don't see why traditional Chinese couldn't survive (in Taiwan).  I mean, it's still possible to learn Latin in the European classrooms, even though it isn't an official language in any one country. 

&gt; Meh, AIDS aid to African country was a good point for Bush, so was TARP, albeit way too late, he should have not let Lehman collapse. Iraq will always be a stain on his mandate tho.

You're not going to find too many supporters of Bush Jr. among Americans.  Not among progressives and not among conservatives.  This is because he's known as a big-government conservative, and Bush Jr represents the neo-conservative wing of the Republican Party.  Most Republicans in play today are paleo conservative Tea Party (e.g. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul), independent mavericks (John McCain), or establishment Republicans (Chris Christie).  And well, let's just say that it's sad that supposedly the only redeeming point for Bush Jr is his AIDS aid to Africa.

I pointed to certain countries in Europe to illustrate how non-homogeneity is currently challenging that very sort of system, particularly in the form of immigration, something which the U.S. also is working to accommodate. It's amazing how quickly people from Western Europe turn xenophobic once their cushy benefits are challenged by the demographics of immigration while simultaneously lecturing the U.S. 

In other words, implying that someone pointing out that Europe is fairly homogenous is part of what makes it work must automatically mean that person is racist is pretty fucking stupid. Homogeneity is as much about culture, economics and social systems as anything else. The race element is largely irrelevant to that point, except in so far as people's belief in it contributes to the establishment of in and out group attitudes. France would be having just as much of a problem integrating millions of poor white immigrants from Scandinavia within its existing system for many of the same reasons.

I personally do get 55-65 to Sphere - but I also get 45-55 to Centra; being in southern Arizona I'm close to halfway between the two servers. (Straight line distance of 727 miles to Centra, 825 miles to Sphere.)

But then you'll get people from Seattle, Vancouver, Calgary, Alaska, Hawaii, etc. for whom Sphere is virtually unplayable. The vast majority of Centra players will have higher Sphere pings than I do just by distance - Los Angeles to Dallas is 1239 miles, San Francisco to Dallas 1483 miles, Portland to Dallas 1633 miles, Vancouver to Dallas 1770 miles. It's mostly people from Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado who get decent ping to both Centra and Sphere, and those players are a small minority compared to California/Oregon/Washington/British Columbia players.

You say you've seen the ping survey so you should already know this, but let's look at distances for some of the big cities.



Radius city | Distance to Origin | Distance to Sphere
-----------|------------------|------------------
New York | 481 mi | 1372 mi
Boston | 612 mi | 1551 mi
Philadelphia | 442 mi | 1299 mi
Washington | 392 mi | 1183 mi
Montreal | 520 mi | 1517 mi
AVERAGE | 489 mi | 1384 mi




Centra city | Distance to Origin | Distance to Sphere
-----------|------------------|------------------
San Diego | 1971 mi | 1183 mi
Phoenix | 1689 mi | 886 mi
Los Angeles | 1982 mi | 1239 mi
San Francisco | 2089 mi | 1483 mi
Seattle | 1682 mi | 1985 mi
AVERAGE | 1883 mi | 1355 mi


I didn't cherry pick - I tried to pick a representative sample of 5 cities. You're going to get the same result no matter what representative sample you take. Do notice the variance in distances to Sphere from Centra cities - you get Phoenix at 886 miles and Seattle at 1985 miles, so you have Centra players both closer to Sphere and farther from Sphere than all Radius players.

I'd argue that's *more* than counterbalanced by the fact that a Radius team can safely draft many players who ordinarily play on Origin or Pi and get better ping to Sphere than true Radius players. Centra teams can draft *some* Sphere players - someone in Denver is likely fine on both servers, but someone in New Orleans will likely have terrible ping on Centra.

And remember that captains *know* they will have to play X cross-country games in the season before the draft. For that reason I'm very skeptical of the ""but my Radius team has 3 Europeans!"" argument - well, you knew ahead of time you'd have games on servers other than Radius, so maybe drafting Team Europe was not the best strategy (or maybe you're okay with just dumping your one Sphere/Sphere game, which is fine, but don't complain about it!)

And finally, remember that Centra teams get the distinct pleasure of playing Sphere games for 1/3 of their season (unless they get lucky and draw a matchup against a Sphere team), while Radius teams only have to play one Sphere game.

Beekeepers selected these for their own convenience, producing a bottleneck in the genetic pool of these bees. This lowered their diversity and made them much more prone to attacks from funghi, bacteria, viruses, etc... These are the bees that ""disappear."" BUT.....

There is a whole different kind of bee out there, the Africanized bees, and these are a lot more diverse, they are more efficient pollinators than the European bees AND as we all know, they are also a whole lot more rowdy. These bees have not had their gene pool restricted, and when they mate with the European honeybees, their traits dominate. Beekeepers kill these colonies in order to have a more pleasant job. HOWEVER, these bees, the Africanized Bees, are NOT prone to ""disappearing"" (Also known as Colony Collapse Disorder).

So, to answer your question, if the European Honeybees ""Disappear"" we will just be restricted to efficiently growing fruits in areas that are more suited for the Africanized Honeybees.

Having humans perform the task of bees would be way too expensive and would require a person with incredible patience and motor skills. It would be way too expensive, unless you're a slave-owner.

To conclude: There are bees that are disappearing, but its only the really nice and soft ones that beekeepers selectively breed. Africanize bees are not disappearing so bees will not completely disappear.

Which fits with my memory pretty well, because I've been watching pro league for a long time, and in the past when there was a bug they would ignore it, or quickly change the subject if it was mentioned by one of the other casters. 

Talking about bugs could potentially hurt LCS because real sports (Which is what Riot is/was trying to push League/E-Sports as), doesn't have them.

Bugs hurt competitive integrity, and if there are bugs deciding the outcomes of games (Either obviously or in a more debatable fashion), which has happened in the past, then to some it might invalidate the point of watching. 

It doesn't surprise me that bringing those things up might have been frowned upon. Though it's something people should be informed about on stream, they don't have to keep talking about it, but acknowledging and explaining it is something that should have happened as it is more commonly now.

One reason they may be more open to that kind of thing now, is that it brings negative connotations to Riot's name if they have a reputation for telling their casters not to speak of things that make them seem lacking in integrity. 

As much as I love Jatt, he also claimed to never have said the things outlined in ""The Jatt Dilemma"" and though I have no doubt he didn't intend to say it like that and probably meant to expound more on his thinking, he did once say that EU LCS looked weak because they were all beating each other and had no clear best, while NA LCS was strong as a region because they were all beating each other. 

I think Jatt probably intended to say something like EU looked like the weaker region and have low quality games/strategy and have no clear strong winner, while NA looked strong in general at the time, but they were all fighting relatively evenly which made the region as a whole better, but that's not really how it came off. I specifically remember watching him talk about it on stream and being confused.

Anywho, as someone who has watched and played League of Legends since S1 and early S2, I can say with certainty that they were not fond of/allowed/encouraged to talk about bugs or errors on stream. Somewhat similarly to how they can swear on stream if it's a slip of the tongue but they are encouraged not to do it.

If the policy has changed over the recent months and they have full control to do that, that's great. Casters are expressing more of their opinions than before as well, normally someone saying items were garbage or Riot should have stuck with Magus instead of Runeglaive would not have happened.

Remember, this is the same Riot that encouraged pro players when they met at their meetings to not say a champion was overpowered on their own personal streams. Something Scarra had to show some restraint on at the time.

Sorry for the long winded post, but as someone who has been keeping up with league for so long, I don't think it's fair to call everyone who noticed that they didn't like talking about bugs on stream an idiot or circlejerker like I've been seeing in some of these threads.",,Milk_Cows,0,1438472110,veigar,t5_2rfxx

What were the plans for the Germans to invade Iceland during World War II?

Adolf Hitler was outraged when he learned that the British had occupied Iceland on May 10, 1940, gave the subsequent heads of its German fleet ordered to prepare the invasion. Soon after, they introduced him military plan Icarus (ie. Fall Ikarus) based on the invasion fleet would sneak past Royal British naval warships (e. Royal Navy) in the North Atlantic to bring invaders of land on the west coast of Iceland.
Officers of both fleet (ie. Krieg Marine) and Air Force (ie. Luftwaffe) Germans admitted however strongly against any notion of an invasion. The reason was, among other things that, although reasonable likelihood that the invasion would succeed would be virtually impossible to move supplies to the army in Iceland due to control of the British fleet at sea, as well as no aircraft were on the island and it could air force not provided invasion showed no protection. Arguments commander, as well as to potential Germans were going to attack in the United Kingdom, but it would have required total team strength and Air Force fleet of them seems to have been that Hitler had all the speculation about the occupation of Iceland dropped.
Invasion requirement
Hitler and flotaráð German naval thought control of Iceland extremely important for the future of the German government and unrestricted access to the Atlantic Ocean. Soon after the war began, Hitler seems to have expressed an interest to occupy Iceland. Walther Warlimont colonel and action officer yfirherráðs German state (ie. Ober Kommando der Wehrmacht, OKW abbreviated) announced this interrogation after the war. Furthermore, he said that it had hired largely on the one hand the island was vulnerable, and that Hitler seems to have preferred to reach it ahead of the Allies, and the other that he envisioned from the United States Air Force aircraft could provide submarines German naval protection. Karl Jeskó von Puttkamer, who was the Commander in yfirherráðinu, remember also that Hitler had expressed an interest to occupy Iceland in the spring of 1940. However, if all available forces state be busy due to the invasion of Norway and the preparation of the attack against the Allies in the West Europe.
As stated earlier, did Hitler angry when he received news of the occupation of the British 10. May Ruled here any potential invasion of Germans would be more difficult with the presence of foreign forces in Iceland, but also after the show was that the Germans were addressing submit Norway conquered and thus unrestricted access to the Atlantic, the British had now managed to put up obstacles their occupying Iceland and prevent them so the way to the Atlantic Ocean.
In late May 1940, started to change passenger ship Europa and Bremen so that they could attend the team transport to distressed troops Germans in Narvik but in the end did not have to use boats to date. At this time flirted Hitler still dreams of domination over Iceland despite the presence of British country. Since work on changing ships was already in motion, he grabbed the opportunity and ordered in June should be prepared for the invasion of the country.


Below is a passenger sister ships Bremen and Europa who set many speed record on his voyages across the Atlantic for the Second World War. The Germans had planned to exploit their speed to turn patrolling ship of the British fleet in the North Atlantic.
Preparation invasive
It was floated council German naval surprised when it received a notice on June 12 to change four ships to the invasion and when they were announced the day after the plan was to invade Iceland they were alarmed. Sjóliðsforingjanum Hans-Jürgen Reinicke was tasked to draft the invasion and four days later he returned from a very negative report on the action Icarus. Float Council also set in motion efforts to change the six ships that were intended to help transport.
The next day was much met the expected invasion. Representatives flotation Council met Warlimont action officers yfirherráðs German government on 17 June and representatives Herrala fleet and Air Force met separately later date to discuss the Icarus. Stating that the Air Force under the command of Hermann Goring put himself strongly against such invasion ideas that no landing paths existed for fighters and bombers. Erich Raeder yfiraðmíráll and Admiral German naval finally met Hitler on June 20 and presented him preparing for the invasion of ideas fleet and difficulties in floating Council that the implementation of the invasion.

I did this with the christian bible too for the same reason. Turns out there are tons of things which contradict the radical views which the polemicists espouse, and very few which support them. 

Even if I accepted the polemicists' views (after having seen weak support for them and many contradictions and questions raised), I'd still disagree it was morally just, and probably be on your ""side"". So keep that in mind.

I believe she was around 6, from memory, at betrothal. Nothing really out of the ordinary for the middle ages then. Same thing happened in europe all the time...

But let me go ahead and respond to this argument that I've responded to and spend hours backing up with my own hours spent researching from both sides of the story, because just because I've repudiated the same copy-paste argument many times doesn't mean you've seen my responses.

Keep in mind I don't have a particular intepretation or opinion of this as much as questions, comparing the historical record and the facts with the arguments from both sides.,


If marriages happened at 9 today and they were consummated (i.e. sex started, which isn't the only meaning but let's say that's what it means here, quite possibly does!), with the parent's blessings (as required in Islam), I'd say the parents are wrong anyway and it wouldn't be right. Those parents are probably messed up in the head.

The whole ""consummated at 9"" comes from a saheeh (meaning its authenticity is trusted) hadeeth whose interpetation and English translation is not universally agreed upon. But there are literally tens of thousands of other hadeeth and sayings, thousands and thousands of which touch on this topic. Are you familiar with any of them? Many contradict the whole ""Omg Muhammad wants people to rape babies"" take away, which is a favorite amongst those who like to malign Islam.

I'm not trying to convert people to Islam or even defend it, I just spend a lot of time investigating these topics, and am curious where these views come from, and sharing my own observations. I totally respect the opinions of others... as long as they don't support raping children anyway (which that one singular hadeeth about supposed husband-wife intercourse is not about IMO, even if she was 9 as some interpretations say, and it was done with the blessing of the community and her father, as was of course the case)

&gt; Do you really believe this? If so, that's interesting. Definitely a noteworthy contrast to how things operate here----thanks for the post.

Look, I am not trying to troll, but this is just a personal observation from somebody who has lived in both the new and the old world (and long enough to know that both continents have great discrepancies within and generalizations are very risky) but I feel that many questions similar to yours boil down to two very different mentalities.


Europeans: ""Uh.. so we need to fix this safety thing... if we all pay a little more and built a centralized solution, that should be reasonable efficient""

Americans: ""Why should I pay more taxes to protect somebody else? I can buy a gun and protect myself, no need for more taxes""

Note that the European approach may be better in some cases, such as safety, but it also isn't in many different cases. But the pattern is especially visible in election seasons, with all American politicians making promises to ""Joe the Plumber"" and Europeans making promises to different ""classes"" (again, huge generalization, but I think you get my gist).

Generally, Europeans live in Nanny states and expect their government to take care of a lot of stuff for them - the taxes are high enough - whilst Americans will revolt instead of paying taxes for something they can take care off themselves. Both schools of thought have their own faults.

I had this discussion many, many times and this ended up to be my go-to argument to explain the European mentality to Americans:

""Ok, so you know crime correlates with other factors such as healthcare, welfare, education... or lack there of. Back home, about 40% of my income would go into these. Now it's less than 10%. So I pay more for safety and I get more safety, that's basically capitalism 1.01. But if I ever have a legit reason to buy a gun whilst paying that much, I'd rather point it at the government for failing. For that kind of money, I'd want a carefree existence... I don't get that, but at least I don't have to take care of everything myself.""

It's in very good condition, though I can't stand to listen to at the moment as I don't have a record cleaner yet. The other is the recent 2011 Why Pink Floyd..? reissue, bought about a year ago. I think $25/disc is not outrageous these days, and it's far from a bad pressing. Which sounds better? Probably the original, once clean, but the new one has sentimental value as it was bought on a family holiday. Moreover, I like to compare the two. Strangely, neither has a sticker. But, doesn't the new one come with a sticker? Yes, plastered on the front. As far as I'm concerned, the cover art for that album is textless, so I remember using Goo-Gone to remove it on my aunt's counter top.

I've had two copies of DSOTM, both from the 2003 press. The first one also appeared at 2nd &amp; Charles, but I didn't bother to check it because they had put a seal over the top {didn't make that mistake this time!} It sounded fine, but had some surface noise and came without any posters, stickers, or even an inner sleeve. At $30, mind you. Later, a sealed one appeared on Discogs for $40 {good for this press}, and took that opportunity. A friend was happy to take the old one as he was just starting.

On that note, I've gone through three copies of both *OK Computer* and *A biЖid A*, as I was looking for analogue copies. *OK Computer* was dull and *A biЖid A* was bowl shaped, so I wanted new ones. I'd heard rumours of Parlophone records being shoved into Capitol sleeves at Barnes &amp; Noble, took a chance, $50 mistake. Once again, brother and friend were fine with those and took them. Ended up importing a Parlophone *OK Computer* and found a Parlophone *A biЖid A* on eBay for $29.

On a ^^**FITTER** happier note, I thought the *In Rain/bows* box would be fun, but didn't want to take the chance on me not liking it, so bought the single-record copy first, as I knew that if I like it, I wouldn't mind paying $120 for it, but wouldn't want to pay $100 for an album I didn't. I liked it. Friend took the spare of that one as well.

Meanwhile, there are certain albums that I like enough, with very good-but-potentially-limited-enough recent pressings {on the best-this-has-ever-sounded level} that I hope to get a couple of backups of whilst I still can: 2010 *In the Court of the Crimson King*, 2010/2014 Audio Fidelity *The Hounds of Love*, potentially Parlophone *OK Computer* {they're still pressing it; don't know how the masters have held for 18 years}, and *A biЖid A* if the opportunity presents itself.

Je suis desolée pour la paroi du texte.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that when I got Mondo's ParaNorman Soundtrack, it ended up being the black one. You know where this is going. For some reason the movie just clicked on first viewing, and I liked the soundtrack, and of the Monod releases I have {Ghibli Selects {$30 from Acoustic Sounds because of a damaged cover - two tiny corner dings I would've eventually done myself! This was several months ago.}, Halloween, Coraline, ParaNorman, and 2001: A Space Odyssey}, it was one of two - the other being Halloween - where I thought the colour variant fit the packaging and movie. So... I cheated on that one.

Also, I don't believe this counts, but I plan on eventually having a complete series of both Mono and Stereo Beatles reissues. At first, I was going to get a Stereo Box due to it being a complete Beatles collection, and collect the monos. Then I heard the quality of the Monos and wanted the Mono Box, and, since my Dad has the Stereo box, get both books. Then I heard that the Stereo Box was pressed at Optimal in Europe, and, since I don't live there, {Maybe some day...}, get that since the monos are the same there as here.",Pro-Ject,Phaneronic64,1,1438477523,,t5_2qh7i

Je te parle des [trotskistes pendant la seconde guerre mondiale](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskistes_fran%C3%A7ais_durant_la_Seconde_Guerre_mondiale). Les mecs étaient tellement opposés à l'élan patriotique et à la ""collaboration"" (dans leur tête, ce n'est évidemment pas la collaboration avec les coupins nazis , mais bien avec les bourgeois!) qu'ils prônaient un ""défaitisme révolutionnaire"".

En termes d'idiots utiles et de traîtres on a rarement fait mieux.

&gt;Et ils seraient les véritables collabos alors que leur poids politique à l'époque de l'occupation était nul ?! 

On juge par les actes. Ils ont eu une attitude de collabo et de traitres, tellement ils étaient occupés à s'épurer (et oui, il ne faut pas oublier que pour vous, le combat principal c'est celui de la pureté, c'est comme ça qu'on retrouve des [appels au meurtre](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2zev2a_ertv-a-la-manifestation-de-soutien-au-peuple-grec-paris-28-06-2015_news) chez des antifas, mention spéciale pour le ""vous n'avez pas le droit d'exister"").

&gt;Ta citation est complétement sorti de son contexte en plus. Mais t'as l'air de croire à ce que t'écris, c'est bien.

C'est quoi exactement le contexte qui voudrait faire d'un soldat nazi un poto de lutte ?

Mais bon, c'est marrant que t'essaies de défendre cette position, juste après m'avoir lancé un ""nazillon"" ;)

Merci encore, je m'amuse beaucoup.

Ah oui, tu parles du poids politique ""à l'époque"". Je te rassure, leur poids politique est toujours nul aujourd'hui.

&gt;Mais pas seulement. C'est un raisonnement de droite libérale quand t'as comme objectif la création d'un marché sans frontière.

L'internationalisme de gauche conduit systématiquement (et d'ailleurs le comportement des antifas le prouve) à une collaboration avec la classe dominante, qui est aujourd'hui une hyperclasse mondialisée. Il définit comme ennemi principal non plus la classe dominante mondiale (puisque ça conduirait à une collaboration avec des impurs nationalistes), mais bien les classes prolétaires nationales (d'ailleurs concrètement ce sont eux qui votent FN).

Tiens d'ailleurs on a un autre exemple historique pendant la guerre d'Espagne : les mecs étaient tellement occupés à se battre entre différents courants de gauche que Franco a juste eu à attendre alors que militairement, même avec l'aide des nazis, c'était pas gagné.

&gt;Dans un système capitaliste oui. D'ailleurs les xénophobes sont bien utile dans ce processus, en empêchant toute solidarité internationale. 

Les nationalistes (j'imagine que c'est ce que tu appelles xénophobe) empêchent effectivement l'idéal communiste d'Égalité de tous les prolétaires, puisqu'ils défendent le droit des peuples à disposer d'eux-mêmes, c'est vrai que c'est un concept avec lequel vous avez du mal. Alors c'est sûr, l'idéal internationaliste c'est qu'un ouvrier français vive dans les mêmes conditions qu'un ouvrier chinois, c'est le fameux passage du Manifeste :

*on a accusé les communistes de vouloir abolir la patrie, la nationalité. Les ouvriers n'ont pas de patrie. On ne peut leur ravir ce qu'ils n'ont pas. Comme le prolétariat de chaque pays doit en premier lieu conquérir le pouvoir politique, s'ériger en classe dirigeante de la nation, devenir lui-même la nation, il est encore par là national, quoique nullement au sens bourgeois du mot. Déjà les démarcations nationales et les antagonismes entre les peuples disparaissent de plus en plus avec le développement de la bourgeoisie, la liberté du commerce, le marché mondial, l'uniformité de la production industrielle et les conditions d'existence qu'ils entraînent*.

Évidemment, on voit bien que les conditions d'existence des prolétaires dépendent des droits sociaux nationaux, c'est ça que les ""xénophobes"" défendent et que les immigrationnistes attaquent.

Va demander à un ouvrier français s'il veut avoir les mêmes conditions matérielles qu'un ouvrier chinois... Pas étonnant que ça ne marche pas comme argument !

&gt;Le fascisme a toujours été l'allié du capitalisme

False,2,explainlikeimfive,ctoht43,,t3_3fglns,1440229348,t3_3fglns,0,0,"The media really likes to over emphasize the interbreeding with Neanderthals. a few key points to remember:

* Speciation is a process, a process that can take millions of years. Moreover, two populations need not completely separate if the existing barriers to reproduction are ""good enough"" to prevent or hinder gene flow.

* Barriers to reproduction can be external (separate habitats, living in different geographical areas, behavioural differences, different mating rituals, different mating seasons, mating times...) or the barriers can be internal (sperm cannot penetrate the egg, if sperm can penetrate egg the genetic differences are too big to overcome, the hybrid is unable come to term, if the hybrid is born it is sterile, if the hybrid is born fertile it is of poor health compared to non-hybrids....). Scientists take into consideration all of these factors, not just if two individuals can mate and produce viable offspring.

* For example: Lions and Tigers can be forced to mate in captivity and produce ""viable"" hybrids. I say ""viable"" because while some of the hybrids are fertile they are of poor genetic quality and ill health. They would not be able to compete with non-hybrids in the wild. Lions and tigers also live in different habitats, and have very different social structures. These differences are good enough to prevent gene flow, they don't need to have additional internal reproductive barriers like the sperm being unable to penetrate the egg. For this reason tigers and lions are considered separate species. 

* Similar arguments are made for Neanderthals and Humans. We evolved in two different locations (Neanderthals in Europe c. 350,000 years ago; Humans in Africa c. 200,000 years ago). We behaved differently (Neanderthals had stagnant tool cultures, Humans were much more innovative). By the time the two populations encountered each other about 50,000 years ago many external reproductive barriers were already in place.

* The 1-5% DNA interchange can be explained by a couple on interbreeding events. It does not mean that this phenomenon was ubiquitous across the Neanderthal population, nor did it have to be a common event. If hybridization was not common, then this would be a good argument for separate species classification.

* The 1-5% DNA has not been well explored as to what it actually does. 

* We do not know the context of these interbreeding events; were they consentual? rape? Moreover, we do not know how the hybrids were treated; were they accepted into human societies? were they outcasts? These social and behaviour factors can be external barriers to reproduction, in the same way that lions are social and tigers are solitary. If humans and neanderthals behaved differently, and acted like different groups (e.g. they could distinguish themselves from each other) then this would be another good argument that these two populations were well on the way to full speciation.

* We do not know the vigour of the hybrids; were they all fertile? were some or the majority sterile? how fit were they in terms of being able to compete against other humans? This is important for understanding speciation.

* We have no evidence that Neanderthals have human DNA - e.g. the flow of DNA appears to be one direction. This is another good indication that hybrids were of poor quality, and that speciation was well on its way to completion. ""While modern humans share some nuclear DNA with the extinct Neanderthals, the two species do not share any mitochondrial DNA, which in primates is always maternally transmitted. This observation has prompted the hypothesis that whereas female humans interbreeding with male Neanderthals were able to generate fertile offspring, the progeny of female Neanderthals who mated with male humans were either rare, absent or sterile.""

* We do know that Neanderthal populations were already in decline in much of Europe before humans even arrived, because they were not adapting to the climate change experienced there. We do know that a good majority of Neanderthals NEVER encountered humans, and went extinct on their own accord. We do know that humans were competing for the same resources as Neanderthals, where the populations encountered one another in Southern Europe. The dominant and most supported hypothesis for the extinction of Neanderthals is NOT their admixing with human populations, but rather we outcompeted them - through passive or coercive means.

**TL;DR** The current evidence suggests that while humans and neanderthals were certainly capable of interbreeding and producing viable, fertile offspring, these two populations were well down the path of speciation. Several biological and behavioural reproductive barriers had already manifested by the time these two populations first met. For these reasons, and others outlined above, humans and Neanderthals are by and large considered separated species.

If you teach Physics, it has to be at the high school or Uni level. Uni level needs PhD in Physics. High school level needs teaching certificate from the government of the country in question. In general, there are unemployed physics teachers with certificates who are native Germans/Brazilians. Why should they hire you? It would not be legal for you to teach Physics in most countries without a teaching certificate. 

After you get your TESOL degree, you can teach abroad without problem. In the EU, you will not be able to get a job without EU citizenship. The Brits have everything pretty sewn up. This will give you money and experience, but no knowledge.

My first recommendation to you would be to consider whether you are Einstein or not. If yes, PhD Physics. If no, perhaps you should try to get a physics high school teaching certificate in MN. This would allow you to teach Physics in English in International schools anywhere in the world where there are English speakers (everywhere).

If you go overseas to teach TESOL, you are entering an area filled with con-men and incompetence. Anybody can speak English, so Anybody can teach it. (or so people tend to think) It is a very strange field and so I would not recommend it.

While the majority of doctors have called for instituting an age restriction so that it's only performed therapeutically or with personal consent, the government has ignored them. Parents are still permitted to consent to nontherapeutic child foreskin excision. The only difference is that they require a doctor to be present if the surgery is not performed by a doctor. Of course some people consider that a gross imposition on their religious rights. To quote some medical organizations opinions on nontherapeutic circumcision, the [Swedish Pediatric Society](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2012/02/19/Swedish-doctors-urge-ban-on-circumcision/UPI-61961329678560/) called for requiring non-therapeutic circumcision to be voluntary. The [Swedish Children's Ombudsman, Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), the Swedish Society of Health Professionals (Vårdförbundet), the Swedish Paediatric Society (BLF) and the Swedish Association of Pediatric Surgeons (SLF)](http://www.thelocal.se/20130928/50496) agree:

 &gt; There is no medical reason to circumcise little boys; the procedure is painful, irreversible and can cause complications, according to Sweden's children's ombudsman and representatives for several healthcare organizations.

 &gt; The ombudsman Fredrik Malmberg, together with representatives from the Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), the Swedish Society of Health Professionals (Vårdförbundet), the Swedish Paediatric Society (BLF) and the Swedish Association of Pediatric Surgeons (SLF), argues that Swedish law requires that the child's will be taken into account wherever possible. Circumcision is a procedure which is typically carried out at a very young age and it is this issue of consent which is paramount, they argue. ""We consider circumcision of boys without the child's consent to be in contravention of article 12 of UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which gives children the right to have an opinion in matters which concern them."" They furthermore argue for a change in Swedish legislation in order to meet the human rights of the child and medical ethics.

Representing Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish clinical sexologists, in 2013 the [Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology](http://www.nacs.eu/data/press_release001.pdf) stated:

 &gt; The penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia. The foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions. It protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity. Ancient historic accounts and recent scientific evidence leave little doubt that during sexual activity the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive, erogenous structure, capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners.

 &gt; As clinical sexologists, we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys. To cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal, healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision. Unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent, the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity.

Norway is a *very* wealthy nation, and like most welfare nations it's very hard to be in poverty, but in exchange we don't really have an socioeconomic over-class like most of commonwealth nations does have. It's also very expensive here, not as much for Norwegians as for foreigners, but even for us living here things can from time to time come off as expensive.

High taxes make sure that everyone has food on the table, a roof over the head and all the opportunities in the world to go and study, and this makes it very easy and feasible to take a socioeconomic path from relatively poor to quite wealthy. With this said, being in a high-income field of work usually doesn't benefit you more being here instead of elsewhere in Europe, Australia, North America or Asia for that matter.

Norway is an export oriented country, with a high focus on refining and selling natural resources, mainly oil and different gasses, and as it is today with a global oil-crisis, Norway is suffering a bit from lack of export and trade opportunities in this field (it's the westernmost area that suffers the most from what I've heard, and this is due to being the more oil focused region).

How is like living here? Well first off, it's cold. It can be insanely cold and dark for most of the year, and if you're living on the western coast be prepared for a never ending rain. The nature here is something else, I might even call it the most beautiful place on earth. There's several locations I still can't believe I've been in, since it has been ***THAT*** gorgeous! 

It can also be very boring in comparison with other European countries, as you might know we're kind of sparsely populated here up north, and there can be times when it feels like there's nothing happening. If you're living outside of Oslo, one can get the feeling that everything is very peaceful and quiet. Foreigners also usually complain a lot about our food, don't know how it is for Australians but I knew some British South-Africans who complained daily about the food. Also worth noting, is that supply is very different from abroad, since everything that's imported is heavily taxed and domestic food is subsidized.

Scandinavians as a people are often very reserved, we like our personal space and will never engage socially in public if we're not formerly introduced to one another. But once you get to know us, it's kind of hard to get rid off us. Most people like to get crazy drunk on the weekends, but god forbid if you have a beer during the weeks. We might come of as smug and quietly judging, but I like to think of us as very tolerant and open once you break our personal barrier. 

All and all, living here is very good. Many people find Norway to be a paradise on earth, and if you're curious about how it is here you should really come and visit!

Doesn't mean I don't follow it along with PS4 activity. If you want to find someone who is very active and interested in each and every aspect of this game then guess what... you are talking to him. 

&gt;I have 200h in this game. If I haven't 'found the religion' then very, very few people have. No one's taking my place when I leave. The game just gets that much smaller, like it has been, and like it will continue to until there's a really steep sale.

Good for you... but unfortunately for you the PC side of the house sees a much larger player base from EU then US. Just the facts... US is a more console based player field. EU and Asia thrive when it comes to PC gaming. And believe it or not but the game on PC is still selling. Just have to see the many posts on this subreddit of new gamers interested in picking up copies. But funny thing is that usually the first things out of other PC players mouths are... don't buy it because it isn't populated.

&gt;This isn't about being to find ""the game mode I prefer."" This is about there being exactly one game mode left in the game that has more than one server.

This is about US player base for you. If you want to play then you are going to either have to play what others want or get a group of friends together and play what you guys want.

&gt;Your advice about organizing the community is hilarious nonsense. If you think it isn't, I suggest you to try it yourself and see what happens.

It is called *making friends* and then it is called organizing a Platoon. I have done it on BF3 and enjoyed it very much. Not too difficult, just find like minded friends and organize. It happens every single day of the week. People get together make Platoons plan times they are going to meet up and play. Maybe it is hard for you as the method of finding friends on PC is not as intuitive as it is for console players? I myself found that when I did play PC that my friend base was made before getting onlne. While on console I actually found most of my friends by playing with them in games. 

Now if you aren't good at making friends then yes it can be a daunting task. But surely many many avenues to start.

I understand your worry here about it being dehumanizing. But try to look at it from the other perspective. Animal rights activists aren't analogizing oppressed minorities as non-humans to value minorities less, they're analogizing animals as oppressed minorities to value animals more. General people know that slavery and holocaust is bad. But they might not know about the giant factory farming industry, so as tasteless as it might be, you can see why an animal rights activist might rationalize making an analogy to slavery or the holocaust to help show others why they should care for the animal rights cause.

&gt;Why is it that I decide to do animal activism as opposed to actually dealing with oppressions that I benefit from?

Should we choose activism based on what we benefit from? A black man does not benefit from white supremacy, but he does benefit from patriarchal notions in society. Should he spend his time and effort being an activist on gender issues instead of race issues? Is it selfish of him to choose to prioritize being an activist for race issues instead of gender issues, the latter of which he is actively benefiting from? I'm not trying to pose these as confrontational questions just to make someone look bad, I'm genuinely curious as to what each individual should prioritize in activism.

&gt;does that mean we have to wait until all humans are equal (or at least semi-equal in terms of access to human rights) until we can actually do animal activism in a wholesome, unproblematic way?

Continuing my train of thought, should we wait until all genders are equal until we can pursue race activism in a wholesome, unproblematic way? Or vice versa regarding race and gender?

The way I see it, social justice recognizes that there are people in worse situations than other. An average woman in a destabilized, war-torn country is arguably in a worse position than an average woman in western Europe. But that doesn't mean we should tell feminists in western Europe that they need to stop being selfish and put all work on elevating the position of their sisters in destabilized, war-torn countries. It is possible to be an activist for social justice in any society without being confined to the limits of purely prioritizing the worse-off, without saying we should put all our immediate energy and efforts towards those the absolute worse-off, and worry about notions of patriarchy in more stable countries later. Therefore, in a world of gender roles and institutional racism, it's OK to still put time and energy into animal activism.",,Edgy_Atheist,8,1438487413,,t5_2t5sa

It was during my Netherlands game, at a point where I was the dominant power in both North America and Africa, and was both absolutely filthy rich and completely destitute of manpower. (I made pretty much every province I could into a company province.) So my armies relied heavily on mercenaries.

France is my ally, and joins the Protestant League with me. The Ottomans follow her, along with Muscovy, Britain and Bohemia. Between Britain and me, the non-European theaters were basically decided before the fighting started. However, the PLC joined a reasonably strong Austria, along with Sweden, the entire Iberian peninsula, a sprawling Papal State, Hungary, and most of the HRE. Now, this war was immediately after the new forcelimit changes occurred, so the HRE members were able to field a very large army.

All told, the two opposing armies were almost exactly equal in size. However, a very significant percentage of the Protestant armies were in the Americas with colonial nations, or on the British isles, where they stayed for most of the war. Not only were we outnumbered in Europe, but the Catholics, with the exception of the Iberian, shared borders. This meant that there was fighting on half a dozen fronts.

The north east was defined by indecisive battles between midsized armies around the northern PLC border. To the south, the Ottomans waged an initially successful campaign against the Austrians and Hungarians. Unfortunately, the Papal armies arrived shortly, and a series of large scale battles ensued. Again, the Ottomans were initially successful, but having come into the war with depleted manpower, they simply couldn't keep up. They were eventually able to link up with Dutch and French troops and join the epic Battle of the Rhine.

The Battle of the Rhine consisted of several dozen massive battles fought in and around the Rhineland. Most of these battles had a total of over 150,000 soldiers present. Early on, the Protestants won a few of these massive battles. But soon, a pattern set in; a Protestant army of 20 to 60 thousand would be engaged by a similarly sized Catholic force, and then all the Catholic armies in the Rhineland would join in, almost invariably defeating the Protestant army. These defeats were devastating to the ability of the French to keep fighting, as they had also entered he war with practically no manpower.

In the hopes of keeping enough continental Protestant forces alive to challenge the Catholics in open battle, I decided to send my merc armies into almost every large scale battle that I could. My hope was that my treasury could absorb losing battle after battle more effectively than the manpower reserves of the other belligerents could. In the end, this strategy payed off, but only after over a decade of war. At some point, a combination of these major battles and my attempts to snipe Catholic  detachments paid off, and I was able to white peace nearly everyone. I forced Austria to accept Protestantism as the official religion of the empire, and that was that.",Victorian Emperor,RepoRogue,13,1438487889,,t5_2su3h
False,8,personalfinance,ctok8q5,,t3_3ffh6g,1440230495,t3_3ffh6g,0,0,"If I hadn't gotten married I'd still live with my parents.  To this day I don't have TV (but we do have internet) and I rarely buy any clothes. If I bought lunch at work it'd be $100 A month or more when I could have easily made it 40$ a month or less. Not to mention groceries. I applaud you for all of this. I make $52,000 a year as a registered nurse but after student loans (400 a month at least) and having a husband that spends money (not as I always see fit but he works too so he deserves to spend what he wants which isn't always unreasonable) I don't have a lot left over. I would like to pay student loans but like I said, I am married so I can't determine where 100% of our budget goes. 

All I can say from personal experience is that as an RN making 52,000 a year - sure I can't go to Europe whenever I want to (which sucks considering my husband in from Sweden) I can certainly live comfortably. I have always used my parents when able and spent as little money as possible. As I speak I am skipping my friend's bachelorette  party and went to a party at someone's house because it was cheaper. You gotta do what you gotta do. No one is responsible for debt in the end but you. Congratulations for being able to pay off so much. 

I have a used car (Cadillac SRX - yes, so luxurious) I pay 250/month on (put $7k down) but due to my job if anything happened I can certainly pay that monthly payment off. We also bought our house in February - 460/mo which is cheaper than most apartments. 

Where I screw up the most is on eating out. But it's something my husband and I do together for fun. You need to choose what's more important to you. I could have told my boyfriend to fuck off and not have ever gotten married- It sure would have been cheaper. But that lifetime of regret would have killed me. 

In the end it's like losing weight. You don't want extra debt?  (aka extra lbs?) Spend less (eat less). You don't mind paying a bit more each month? Then don't be as careful. 

I just know that most people like me are going to be comfortable no matter what - sure I don't have a lot in savings after my care purchase (which was between me AND me husband) but I can still comfortably pay my debts. Someone not as lucky as me will struggle- that is where using every resource available comes into play. I don't get my hair done and we usually download games if we even play. My hair dye is about $3 a box compared to $60 in a salon. I wear a uniform every day compared to office attire. We don't go out a lot. Once a week spending ~$60.

False,18,Futurology,ctoki9q,,t3_3fgbe6,1440230619,t3_3fgbe6,0,0,"Well, since 1991, Eastern Europe went through its violent post-Soviet period, has come out of it scarred yet mostly at peace, Russia underwent its miserable post-Soviet era in financial depression before rising once more as a military and economic power (now stripped of its economic power by International Sanctions, but still has large military power), the nations of the Middle East have risen in Economic Power (specifically Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia), China has risen to be a world power and a keystone in the global economy, several major natural, economic, and manmade disasters have shook the world, and globalization has been the name of the game in the financial and the political world.

That ends the historical side. Now comes the technological side.

The World Wide Web technically began in 1989, but did not achieve widespread adoption until 1991. This was a project of CERN, who would 20 years later run the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland and discover the Higgs Boson particle, thus completing the Standard Model. In the time since the World Wide Web became active, Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix, Wikipedia, Facebook and Twitter have become gigantic web-dominating entities, starting from humble origins. Other giants have since passed from the spotlight, such as Netscape, AOL, eBay!, and the once almighty Usenet.

The Internet weathered a bubble that appeared in the late 90s that burst in the early 2000s, and has since recovered from it. The internet was once largely limited to dedicated desktop computers and laptops, now a growing percentage of internet access comes from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Around the world, the internet is now becoming a vital communication node and even a pastime. Despite language barriers, the internet is allowing an unprecedented new global culture to emerge such as never before. Personal Assisstant programs such as Siri and Cortana are becoming more vastly used and more complex, beginning to resemble early-stage Artificial Intelligence.

Cellular phones have emerged, replacing the payphones that were so common once, and cellphones themselves have evolved into the ubiquitous smartphone. This author's opinion is that the smart flip-phone will be the next big craze, making its splash in 5 years or less.

TV has become far more on-demand focused. The reality TV craze, once very huge and very annoying, is in a stage of collapse as scandals emerge and their viewerbase leaves for new entertainment. CGI has become a staple in film and TV production, and has become so overused that it is now an accomplishment for a TV show or movie to rely 90% of the time or more on practical effects only.

The internet has lead to a boom of independent music artists and a decline in CD sales. A record revival that started in the late 2000s now results in several million vinyl records a year being sold, along with new turntables to go with them. A smaller revival of casette tapes has accompanied it. When will VHS return? Who knows anymore.

Also related is digital piracy, which has become a rather large practice nowadays. It is a controversial issue in the tech world, and although technically illegal in most places, it is pretty widespread nonetheless.

In Space, the Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990 with a faulty lens and derided as a white elephant early in its service, has produced some of the most amazing images of distant stars and galaxies since a repair in 1993 allowed it to operate as it was intended to. Numerous discoveries have been made in space, such as hundreds of exoplanets, and the largest space project to date, the International Space Station, has been a success and has yielded 15 years of unprecedented scientific research. The Space Shuttle suffered one more tragedy, the loss of *Columbia*, before being retired in 2011, to be replaced by the SLS rocket, due to launch in 2018-2019.

Groundbreaking new space technology has been tested, such as ion drives, solar sails, additive manufacturing, and reusable rocketry. Spaceflight is gradually opening up to the private sector, but new players in the industry have faced setbacks and challenges before their real emergence can begin.

The irony is that charities, like Oxfam, are promoting an institution (the EU) which has very unfriendly economic policies against third world countries. The EU cripples both all developing nations with excessive and bureaucratic regulations and tariffs which prevent such countries from exporting their goods. The EU, for example, uses our money to subsidise certain EU agriculture (farms/fisheries). This drastically relieves the price for production making it an unfair competition.

Because any dissent against the German government is because of radical leftist provocateurs. Certainly not because some of its policies are at fault.

Can you tell me any point in my argument in which I used the fact that some Greek people call us ""Nazis"" against anything?  
I merely pointed out that this ridiculous brainwashing is partially responsible for that.  
I know that it's mostly just a few bad apples. And I know that even if it wouldn't be, then Tsipras would be to blame, not each individual brainwashed person. So, pointing this out was not in any way trying to take away the ""moral responsibility"", which we have already just from being humans.


And I don't know, how good your German is, but I can promise you that ""Maßnahme im Rahmen der Kriegsführung"" is really just the formal description of ""war crime"". Sure, it expresses it in a really dry way, without mentioning the word ""crime"" even once, but it doesn't mean anything else than war crimes. It doesn't try to. All it does, is focus on the important point which is that it was a measurement which happened during war.
And therefore these ""Maßnahme[n] im Rahmen der Kriegsführung"" were paid for in war reparations, to which we come now:

What you first have to understand, is that war reparations aren't all that moral and holy. They are mostly just a way for the winner of the war to force the loser to pay him money. Often they are even a violation of the loser's people, but it doesn't matter, because the winner writes the history.

And in the case of Germany after WWII, there were the 3 big winners USA, UK and USSR (a.k.a. the Allies minus France). Those decided over Germany. Because ultimately Germany surrendered to them, not to Greece or any other party.

And therefore, if those winners decide that we owe a certain party no war reparations, then we owe that party jackshit.  
That includes Greece, even if such a moral obligation would come in real' handy half a century after everything has been settled.

But the winners even awarded Greece 115 million Deutsche Mark as war reparations in 1960, which you received.

And if you want more, and want us to have an actual obligation to pay you, then quite frankly, you'll have to start a war against us and win it.  
There is no other reason why we would have to pay you anything, other than the moral obligation.  
And 70 years after the incident, you come a little late for that as well.

Especially since you clearly don't want it as a compensation for the deaths of civilians caused by German soldiers, but just because you have no other money.  
To pull the morals-card now, is really just an asshole-move. You don't want to pay back our money, because suddenly now you've started mourning about all these deaths that happened long before the birth of pretty much anyone involved. That's both an insult to us Germans and derogatory towards these victims. The last 50 years, probably, you didn't care about them all that much, but now when you could use it, you want to cash in on the money that they were worth.

So, yes, we might pay you money, because we love our moral obligation and because we don't quite want you to wreck the European economy, but don't you fucking dare to claim that we would owe you this money.",,Syl0s,0,1438497652,,t5_2qh4j
False,2,europe,ctoo0yu,,t3_3fhkd8,1440232343,t3_3fhkd8,0,0,"**Viktor Orbán can not stop the cigarette smuggling**

A social explosion will develop in the winter months in Ukraine, if we can't stabilize the economic situation by then - said László Brenzovics to the Origo. According to the president of the Cultural Association of the Hungarians in Transcarpathia it is not possible to set limits to the cigarette smuggling, as long as there is a huge difference between production costs and selling prices.

* Kiev can't liberate now Donetsk and Luhansk.

* The migration of Hungarians from Transcarpathia could continue.

* It's not possible to restrict cigarette smuggling.

* László Brenzovics do not trust in decentralization.

**Is there any data about how many Transcarpathian Hungarians fighting in Eastern Ukraine and how many of them KIA?**

No such data is available as they are not asking the ethnic affiliation. (...) According to my information there are five ethnic Hungarians killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine, they were all professional soldiers.(...) around a hundred Hungarians took part in the fighting there.

**Does everyone already accept that they are not able to achieve a significant breakthrough in the frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine?**

They are not accepted that, but reality overrides desires. It was an interesting phenomenon, that during the debate on the constitutional amendment the Ukrainian government parties were divided. The Porosenko- and the Yulia Tymoshenko block both argued for the change, while the Radicals sharply opposed. Especially they criticized the passage which referred to a some kind of a special status of the not controlled part of the Donetsk and Luhansk region. This debate very quickly were about the disagreement concerning war and peace. The radical part of the ruling party gave anti-Europe and anti-NATO statements, and they stated that the Minsk Agreement forces the recognition of the special status. The answer was that those who think that it is forced, were allowed to take a gun and fight for the liberation of those parts. This extremely sharp statement also suggests that saner part of the leading group knows that it is an asymmetric conflict in which Ukraine alone can't win. The Porosenko - party wants to build a fortified line along the current frontline, which also indicates that the government can't make a difference on the battlefield. Unfortunately, because of very many reasons the Minsk Agreement can not be enforced, like there wo't be municipal elections in October in the affected areas.

**How long Ukraine can hold out?**

It was surprising for Russia that Ukraine did not collapse under the weight of the first strike. Kiev is able to maintain the current front line, but the country is close to bankruptcy, and we are not yet collapsed just because of the western loans. It's negative that the International Monetary Fund in return for the loans demands such steps, which worsening the Ukrainian citizens' life conditions dramatically. More and more austerity steps can also lead to a social explosion. Especially in the winter, when a significant part of the population will be, objectively, unable to pay its bills.

**It is possible to stop the Transcarpathian exodus in such a situation?**

The exodus of Hungarians from Transcarpathia is a process that started a very long time ago. In the 20th century, a significant number of Hungarians left Transcarpathia at every border changes. Lately it has been intensified since the Hungarians in Transcarpathia are under double pressure. On one hand there is the total uncertainty because of the war, on the other is the extreme economic downturn. This leads to the migration of the the working male population, because otherwise they can not support their families. Despite all of this, you can't talk about escaping. The main solution would be the peace, which is also the interest of Ukraine, that would lead to the stabilization of the situation, so some of the displaced will certainly return.

**Do you have any experiences that the Hungarian border guards directly involved in cigarette smuggling?**

Transcarpathia lies on the border of five European countries and the smuggling is a huge tradition in this region. Even the Soviets were able to stop it only with barbed wire, and after 1990 it started to flourish. Recently, it reached an industrial dimension. The main reason of this that anti-tobacco fight in Western Europe increased the price of cigarettes to cosmic heights. In London a pack of cigarettes is 5-7 pounds, while the production cost is only 30 cents. You can't eliminate smuggling as long as there is such a big difference. The United States couldn't stop alcohol smuggling by administrative measures and the US of the 1930s was much more organized state than today's Ukraine.

**So the replacement of the customs commanders is useless?**

It can bring interim results, but not a success.In addition, this change will only increase tension among the population of Transcarpathia, as the money from the smuggling is spread among the people. Obviously, it is needed to restore order, but Europe should review its policy on smoking, but I do not think that anyone can stop smuggling.

**The aforementioned constitutional amendment can create a more autonomous Transcarpathia?** 

If the law is implemented properly, it can actually create a more independent Transcarpathia. However, there are plenty of doubts, because this reform starts in a situation, when Ukraine faces serious problems. In addition to that, the amendment of the Constitution contains elements which makes the decentralization relative. The reason is that the president will be able veto any action of the local authorities. ",Hungary,vortalwombat,2,1438497664,HUNG,t5_2qh4j

So essentially it will be the G20 members who control the currency since they control 85%+ of the global economy. And the the G8 members will have heavy influence since they account for 50.01% of global GDP.

Post-colonialists will long for a pre-colonialist past, when religious tradition was supposedly moderate and nurturing, indeterminate and dialogic. In their view, the modern expressions of religion are no more than the monstrous offspring of colonialism itself. Thus, the fighters for independence were merely continuing colonialism under a different cover and are thereby encouraging the growth of fundamentalism. In both cases, a religious resurgence is not a paradox but a logical outcome.

Walzer reminds Marxists that nowhere in the world, ever, has pluralistic universalism succeeded in supplanting national identity, and that foreign rule has been experienced in every case as national – not class – oppression. In addition, he notes, all the national liberators sought to create democracies, however flawed and imperfect, but their ambition was definitely to be accepted as legitimate members of the family of nations.

Contrary to them, the agents of religious revival challenge democracy, if they don’t actually reject it. They are not interested in universal values of human rights but in particular religious laws, whether of sharia or halakha or dharma, and they always rely on a fundamentalist interpretation of those laws. They have no wish to be part of the family of nations, but rather they counterpose themselves to it, like a charming teen with special needs. It is illogical, Walzer claims, to think that religious fanaticism springs naturally from democratic nationalism, as the two are utterly different. “Labor Zionism doesn’t produce religious zealotry; we might better say that its most authentic product is the Palestinian national liberation movement,” he writes.

The writer reminds post-colonialists that religion before modernity was not so moderate and accepting, but quite oppressive – toward adherents of other religions, for example, and toward women. On the contrary, the rise of religious fundamentalism is actually a reaction to liberalism, and above all to women’s liberation. What generated fundamentalism is not national suppression but the freedom spawned by democracy.

In the end, Walzer argues, the secular-liberal frameworks are too weak. They are unable to create a stable identity, sources of inspiration and, by the same token, continuity. They surrender in the face of religious revival. Walzer blames the liberators for not acting to bolster ties with the religious elements. If religion were accorded a larger place from the outset, the emergence of a religious contrarian character could be avoided. “Traditionalist worldviews can’t be negated, abolished, or banned; they have to be engaged,” he writes. What’s needed is a dialectical process in which the two poles are brought into contact and interact with each other to the point of creating a third entity. That did not happen, Walzer maintains, and we can see the results.

This, then, is his answer to the paradox of liberation: A total rejection of religion and a condescending attitude toward the religious public are the seeds that engender a fundamentalist religious revival. It is impossible to escape the past, and a tree cannot be made to grow without roots. Engaging tradition in a deep dialogue, Walzer writes with a measure of hope for Israel, “might still improve the odds – for the eventual success of Jewish national liberation.”

A different direction

Although I agree completely with Walzer that an ignored past will return and make its presence felt sharply, and that it is of surpassing importance, even now, for secular society in Israel to enter into an intensive dialogue with Jewish tradition – I want to propose a different direction for thinking about religious revival, using his examples. This direction seeks to apprehend that revival in the three countries under consideration as a reaction not to detachment or to condescension, but to a foreign political and social superstructure. That is, simply, we should note that in each of the countries – Israel, India and Algeria – the religion that returns to center stage is not Christianity.

This is a significant point, because secular, democratic nationalism – of which an essential element is the separation of religion from state and the rendering of religion as a private matter for each citizen – is a phenomenon that derives from Protestantism and that is shaped by its religious model. In the cases under discussion, then, the reaction is not only one of a tradition that was forgotten, whether in a natural process or by force, and is now rising to the surface again: The reaction is that of a collectivist religion that harbors extreme ambitions for the public space, and that rises to the surface in contradistinction to a secularized, privatized political body that is structurally based along the lines of a foreign religious model.

Judaism, Islam and, to a lesser degree Hinduism, are incapable of fully digesting the process of Western secularization, which sprang from Protestantism. (Even Catholicism had a hard time accepting secularization, not recognizing it in essence until the 1960s in Vatican II.) It should be clear that any attempt to secularize the religions according to that model will generate a challenging response. Indeed, no fundamentalist resurgence occurred in Christian countries that were liberated from colonialism.

In a postscript to his book, Walzer surveys the liberation movement that transformed 13 British colonies into the United States of America, and admits, as in passing, “The idea of a secular state did not challenge the deepest convictions or feelings of (most of) the future citizens of the American republic.”

This is the core of the matter. As Walzer notes, the separation of religion from the state even gained the support of evangelical Protestants, because one’s relationship with God was perceived from the outset as a private and individual matter – not as communal, social or national. In short, the evangelicals view the state as a threat to religion; religious Zionism views it as the earthly foundation of the seat of God.

Consider, for example, Ireland, which gained its independence from Britain after a struggle. It’s always been a Catholic country, but the recent referendum approving same-sex marriage by a large majority indicates that the state is definitely not moving toward a revival of religious fundamentalism.

Similarly, the East European countries that attained freedom after years of Soviet domination are not spawning radical religiosity – whereas the movement for the liberation of Palestine is coping with a Muslim religious resurgence even before achieving its goal.

Prof. Walzer’s new book analyzes one of the fateful questions of our generation: why young democracies constitute fertile ground for the rise of extreme religion. He cites a great deal of evidence and presents the considerable resemblances in the three examples he writes about. Undoubtedly, the alienation between the liberating elite and the liberated masses played an important role in the return of tradition after its suppression. This is a spectacle we are witnessing today. However, it is not the whole story. The causes of religious revival need to be sought in religion.

1.0 Yes. One of our biggest minorities (that keeps growing) are Ukrainians, Russians, Belarussians - easter slavic people. Absolutely no problem with them, we dont have them chanting in the streets that our culture and society, that is providing them with better standarts of living, is wrong (despite some of them thinking that Putin is awesome and that we are filthy servants of USA). Another big minority here are Vietnamese (because of commie-commie state partneship pre-89). They keep mostly to themselves, they choose on their own to keep their culture separately of ours, celeberate their traditions, dont accuse us of being intolerant and we dont accuse them of anyting apart from the actual petty economic crimes here and there (cheating on taxes etc.) Both these groups don't come here to benefit from our welfare, they come here for jobs. Another big minority are ""Romas"" that never really integrated: Pre 20th century, whatever kind of state was here, they were basically treated as criminals by birth. It got a bit better for them when the first czechoslovakian democratic state was formed post WWI but then the at the time, national, Socialist germany came along with their first attempt to socially engineer europe and started putting Romas in forced labour and extermination camps. Then the commie/socialist came. They held work as a religion - you dont work, you're a blasphemer. So they've implemented their social engineering plans by forcing Romas to ditch their wagons for apartment blocks and inside towns as opposed to their secluded camps outside towns and put them to work much against their disliking. Then we got democracy again and Romas didnt return to their former lifestyle, they remained ""integrated"" in towns, obviously stopped working and the spiral kept on going, czechs started hating them more because the state isnt taking care of them and, they started in turn hating us more and they're stuck with welfare because nobody wants to employ them and they got used to not working anyway. Nobody knows how to resolve this without making one of the parties barking mad but if theres one thing we learned from this: if a social engineer appears at your doorstep, go get your 12 gauge. Muslims are supersmall minority here, so we dont hear from them much. Big part probably are Turkish people selling kebab here which seem to dont mind that we are a nation of beer-guzzling, pork-eating atheists, but we have a few vocal ones, mainly centered around the I guess only mosque in Prague which recently got visited by a swat team  because of hate-preaching against jews and non-muslims that was in a book they translated to czech and wanted to publish. Also we have a so-called Palestinian embassy in Prague, where last year one of the ""ambassadors"" mishandled what likely was an IED which killed him and nobody seemed to give too much a damn why they had explosives in there and what they were planning with them. Ukraininan and Vietnamese embassies dont seem to explode at random for which are we grateful and helps with intergration of their people here :)

1.1 Yep, it definitely helps as there are little differences between us and eastern slavic nations compared to lets say the vietnamese. But vietnamese also integrate nicely so the ethnic doesnt have to be similar, just respectful.

1.2 Not that I know of, but I'm sure there is a ""You have # months to get a job, start a company or start going to college or you're out"" kind of policy for non-eu foreigners, which can make it look like we're picking ethnics, but we're not.

2.0 I have no idea, didn't study it but when observing the US of A it doesnt seem to be that bad when its governed by invidiual-freedom centric ideology.

2.1 Well then I guess you end up with society like ours, which is pretty homogenous and so far I'm loving it and see no reason why we desperately need to change this. I'm an engineer (the real kind, not social) so I look at things pragmatically: What isnt broken, doesnt need fixing.

2.3 Mentioned USA as diverse state in the advantage question, going to mention western part of EU in this question. The disadvantage in their case seems to be chaos, in some cases violence and general turmoil in society but by no means this has nothing to do with their governments or specific ethnics :D

2.4 As I've said I'm loving it here and I dont see why it would be bad. If I want to check out other cultures, I get a vacation and hop on a plane.

2.5 The homogenous ones.

2.6 Nah I dont think so, deliberate destabilisation of perfectly working state isn't my cup of tea.

2.7 ""People"" is very vauge. Certain ideologies say these people are better than others, judging by some attributes, other certain ideologies say that all people are absolutely the same and I say lets keep it sane and admit there are differences, but dont use them to go make better-or-worse comparisons. Like I've said we're bunch of atheistic, beer loving crazies so thats enough to set us apart from even our nieghbours that otherwise are the same but this is enough for certain groups of people to view us as devils and no, these wont get a friendly treatment here which I kinda tried to include in my answers and it is not declaring superiority or racism, its just common sense and the basic instinct of self-preservation.

2.8 Yep that is my idea. We share the state, we share the currency and the system but we arent forced to share everything and I'm fine with Vietnamese celebrating their festivals with fireworks in their enclosed comunities and not pushing whatever they're celebrating there into our newspaper headlines and they are fine with it too. Seems like the Ukrs are keeping their eastern-orthodox church for themselves and nobody is bothered by that either.

3.0 Can't really answer this one fully but I'd say history is one part of it (staying neutral and trading with the warring parties) and the important thing: As a result of not being the main theatre of WW2, they werent subjected to postwar territory divividing because ending up in soviet block means having your economy nose-dive and having to recover from it for decades to come, which didnt happen for f.e. Sweden so there is that regarding prosperity.

3.1 Well my country didnt do damn to African people (which is kind of why we're upset by having to deal with this), if anything we helped to build industry in African countries that were friends with Soviet Union (supposedly old czech electronics and fuses make for reliable IED parts if thats anything to be proud of). And yes I think that is logical, the term homogenous indirectly says that even when used outside the sociology and, in layman terms: the (less/more) different things you have in one bundle the (easier/harder) is to deal with said bundle of things, be it machine components, chemical agents or people.

4.0 I'm from a 2nd world country so I won't comment on that, but the recent news are upsetting.

4.1 Again, not from there, but freedom of speech seems to be taking some hits. f.e. Israeli academics banned from speaking at some universities, that is just caveman-style backwards desecration of the instituions that drive our civilisation forward by creating and &gt;sharing&lt; knowledge, free of political and religious bullshit. Also considering Israelis are one of the technological leaders in many fields and they seem to eat falafel and shit nobel prizes so denying them sharing their knowledge, to me is just howling mad. I love to listen to any academic of any religion, race, ethnic or whatever when he's describing new stuff that is going to help cure diseases or conquer the space.

4.2 Its not such a big problem here in 2nd world so yeah we dont have a lot of active opposition against that but the 1st world seems to have some active opponents of ""progressive"" values, some even shaping into political parties.

4.3 Can't comment on that.

4.4 Lets not beat around the bush here: Hebrew people and homosexual people have a good reason to fear ""reactionary immigrants"" for crystal clear reasons that are not going to change any time soon.

4.5 Can't comment on that.

5.0 Importing voters sounds like a pretty straightforward benefit.

5.1 Importing cheaper workforce without having to relocate your factories to 3rd world countries sounds like a good deal as well.

6.0 Can't really answer that so I'll put forward question since I'm mean like that: Would the ""First world"" with its ""privileges"" exist if it would be from the start not what it was and some people are desperately trying to reverse? I mean not being a bunch of homogenous christian nations (formerly somewhat diverse pagan cultures annihilated by an inhumane ideology masquerading as a spiritual movement originating from the middle east, deja vu?) duking it out between each other, and after some centuries letting go of the religious zealotry in favour of science and nonclerical state that led to industrial revolution, the wealth and ""priviledges""?

Scotland already is, officially a country, not exactly independent, but still a country. Even in the case of a Yes vote, Westminister would still have some legal leeway to keep us in. The new wording you suggested gets rid of that ambiguity and faces us with the real question of whether or not we want to be a part of the UK. Although on that note, it should be tweaked to ""Should Scotland secede from the United Kingdom"", as a Yes vote should probably imply some kind of change. We would vote yes or no to change instead of yes or no to stagnancy. I think that would make more sense.

Q2: I don't think a double majority vote would really stand a chance. With 32 Council Areas, at least one is bound to vote No, and even if 90% of the country votes Yes, that one Council Area's No will overpower everyone else, which just isn't democracy. I think a double majority would work, however, when deciding if we should leave the EU. Because there would be only 4 voting areas in that issue, it would make far more sense, and it would be more feasible, to have all 4 countries agree or disagree.

Q3: That may be necessary. If they should choose to secede, then good for them. Since they're so close to the English border, a border redrawing would make sense and not be too awkward.

Last season on opening day we saw these two play in the reverse fixture, Aberdeen went into that game drained, having been eliminated from the Europa League just a couple of days previously and they lost 3-0. It did not stop them ultimately having their best season in yeras and they were the closest challengers to champions Celtic all season long and only three points adrift as late as mid March. Today we have a little bit of history repeating as the Dons again played a Europa League match on Thursday, this time having made the longest trip in European football history (and back) to play Kairat Almaty in Kazakhstan , where they lost 2-1 in very tough conditions. That was an 11,000km round trip which effectively lasted four days in terms of travel and acclimatisation, across five time zones (and back !), having already been to Macedonia and Croatia in the last month, they must be at least a little jaded and it will be hard to get ""up"" for today's bread and butter action.

They are focused on extending their European adventure and expended a lot of energy to get that away goal on Thursday after falling behind to two early goals and are sure to have one eye on the return leg this week. United will have been fully focused on this for weeks and will be looking for the highly energetic, upbeat performance they put in on this day last year, they also won both home games against Aberdeen and backing them with a handicap start today looks the way to go, as I am certain that the visitors would see a point as one earned rather than two lost. The hosts started last season very strongly, and were 6-1-1 and top of the SPL after eight matches and are looking for something similar this time round, they have had a ""poor"" pre season results wise, but have been playing top level opposition and pushed EPL side Watford very close last weekend in their final warm up game. Anyway, far from ideal prep for Aberdeen and I have to oppose them.

There are a lot of new players around right now but finding eachother can be difficult. The easiest way to do this is to join a guild and look for exploration buddies there (remember that you can join more than one guild at a time). Even the veteran players like levelling their alts and exploring with them.

You could also make a post online to look for gaming buddies. Some of the places you can try is to post on /r/Guildrecruitment, /r/Guildwars2, on /r/GamerPals and over on /r/MMORPG. The best place to start is /r/Guildrecruitment. When you make a post like this, state that you are looking for someone to explore and level with, write it in an inviting manner and remember to state whether you are NA or EU, and include your identifier so people can find you if they're interested.

Another thing you could try is finding people while in-game. You could also ask in the mapchat if there are any new players around and if someone responds you can ask if they want to group up and explore and level. You could also go to the spot where the new characters go into the world map for the first time and ask the people there in /say if anyone is new and interested in exploring together. There might be someone who is interested. It's not like you have anything to lose.

----

*What would I recommend?*

**Method 1:** Browse /r/Guildrecruitment to see if there's a guild that looks like you'll fit in there. If you find one, join them and play with other new players in your guild. If you find that this doesn't solve your problem, you can join another guild or try other means.

**Method 2:** Make a post in /r/Guildrecruitment and /r/Guildwars2 saying that you're a new player looking for people to play with. You can also look out for posts from other new players who are lost or asking for someone to play with. Contact these people and see if you guys make good exploration buddies.

I wish I could tell you that you didn't have to do anything but, unless you go into the game with friends, finding those people you love playing with in the long term takes some input. As long as you're not too shy to talk to people, it's not that hard though. I hope you manage to make some good friends to travel with. :)

The thing is AC games seem to have a formula. The first game in the trilogy (AC 2, AC 3, AC Unity) introduces overhauled gameplay and engine (and often setting [Italian Renaissance, Colonial America, 18/19th Century Europe]). The second game in the trilogy (AC Brotherhood, AC 4 Black Flag, AC Syndicate) takes what the first game did and improves it, you'll see a few new gameplay mechanics and the game just seems to play better overall. The third game in the trilogy (AC Revelations, AC Rogue, Unannounced) just feels (to me at least) stagnated; the gameplay doesn't seem to improve much (if at all) and they usually just add a few things almost like an afterthought (like the tower defense game and the reverse boarding, and (strangely enough) these seem to be the only games with ziplines). In my opinion the second games in the trilogies tend to be the best (my favorite AC games are Black Flag and Brotherhood in that order) while the first games tend to be next and the third games tend to be my least favorites.

It's what it is: a MINIMUM. Don't like it, train, go to school, work harder, go into business for yourself.

&gt; My kids will have better wages when they start work 

If they can find work. Interestingly a lot of places with ""Oh, we start at $20 an hour"" have lower numbers of jobs.

&gt; and my oldest is only 10 - you ""all"" seem to hate Obamacare, which is meant to be helping you. I don't know the logistics of this so please enlighten me.

Euros and Ozzies think that Obama care is ""free healthcare like we have at home"". It isn't.

How health care works here is that you need to buy insurance to mitigate the costs. The problem is that certain poor people couldn't afford it, or the insurance companies (because they're INSURANCE companies) wouldn't take you if you had something expensive like full blown AIDS.

So Obama said I'll fix this and most of the country thought it was going to be ""everything free like in Europe"" and instead what happened was they just made it a LAW that you HAD to buy insurance.

You couldn't be barred for having an expensive condition, so they simply raised all the prices. I used to insure my family (four people) for $400 a month with a $1500 deductible. Now it's $810 for far less coverage for two people, with an $8500 deductible.

By deductible it means ""we won't pay a thing until you hit the deductible"". So whereas I had maybe $1500 in medical tops a year now I have to pay $8500 out of pocket before the $8400 I'm paying to the insurance company helps me out.

The insurance companies are loving this. Loving it a lot. Profits are way up.

&gt; - what is it with you and guns?

No different than anywhere else. And if you take the gangbangers out of the equation, there's total parity. But the reason we're blaming the guns is because otherwise it looks like we're blaming the people of color, and that's not very politically correct.

&gt; so apparently I'm not well liked in here for asking an innocent question

False,2,europe,ctorx8r,,t3_3fhleu,1440234179,t1_ctorg48,0,1,"It's not a question of security alone (even though this plays a role), but also of responsbility and, ultimately, independence (even sovereignty). The EU is beginning to play a role in international affairs, simply due to the size of its economy and the influence of that on neighbouring countries. 

Security: the EU's mere presence shakes up the geopolitical stability on Russia's western border. How much would Russia care about NATO if it didn't see most of its former sphere of influence 'switching sides' to join the EU? The EU aggressively pushed to expand eastwards, and the threat of more countries doing so continues to this day. And, all of this, over the course of a mere 15 years. Putin grew up with eastern Europe painted in deep red, and now it is painted deep blue. Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova - Russian attempts to contain the expanion of EU influence. And it's quite obvious why Russia sees this as problematic because our expansion worked by persuasion, not force.

What is more dangerous to an authoritarian leader: the threat of a defensive alliance and a confederation without a proper military - or visibly better living conditions? Ours breed discontent in those who cannot join us, and is an incentive to those who can. This has proven to be a bigger stick in European politics than any army. 

The whole migration crisis is another symptom of this. 

Responsibility: this is mainly directed towards the United States. The US is what makes NATO work. France and Britain are important, but NATO would lose most of its teeth without the massive force that is the US military. Many people would then claim that NATO is sufficient to defend Europe. And while this is true, this is based on the assumption that the US will continue to do so and do so unconditionally.

This is irresponsible towards a useful ally but also towards ourselves because it leaves us at the mercy of a powerful third party over which we, as Europeans, have no control other than what our governments are able to muster in international relations. Yet if their hand is forced because our security is dependent upon American goodwill, we will be unable to enact our own policies without first asking Washington for permission.

Which brings me to my third point.

Independence: Europe has its own interests, and EU citizens are able to formulate and enact them in the form of the EU (not perfectly, but it is a work in progress). This allows us to form a compromise between the will of several hundred million people. But representation does not end there. It must also enact the will of these people. And we are currently entirely unable to do so in many areas. 

If we want to secure access to resources, favourable trading conditions, the security on our eastern and southern borders then we cannot rely on the goodwill of others or our impressive economy alone. To do peaceful diplomacy, I believe that you need to first of all ensure that all military options are off the table. And you do this by assuring the other sides that I'd be unwise to engage in a military conflict with yours. Right now, the EU cannot guarantee this because its unclear who would even defend the EU as a whole, with EU interests in mind.

And all those countries which are highly in favour of a combined military? With an exception of Finland (which is very well capable of defending itself after decades of self-reliance), countries at the ""border"" of the EU are in favour of a combined armed force. As are those who understand that we share a common interest separate from Russia, the US or anyone else. ","Schönwetterfans, adé!",DFractalH,2,1438514386,EURO,t5_2qh4j

Though ON seemed poised to win rotations for Elbow, Epsilon patiently pushed the back spawns for a break, retaking a slight lead going into the final hill of the first rotation. The map continued to back and forth as ON won rotations for School to take a 20 point lead of their own, and though Epsilon pinched from all angles for a momentary break, ON was able to reassert control for a 25 point advantage going into the second half of the map.

[](#14info) *Second Hill Rotation Commentary* - In complete contrast to the first rotation of hills, ON had a strong performance on the initial Box hill to extend their lead to about 35. Though Epsilon seemed poised to win rotations for Green, ON pinched through School and Front Green for a flawless break. Epsilon would, however, secure the final 15 seconds to maintain their deficit at about 30 seconds. Though they seemed to forfeit initial control of Garage in the process, Epsilon simply brute-forced their way through Ramp for a quick break to retake the lead going into Elbow. Though ON had initial control of the hill and the favorable spawns on this crucial hill, MadCat went huge with a three piece in the hardpoint for the break and hold. As a result, their previously slight lead extended to about 30 going into School. With just about 45 seconds remaining, Epsilon simply contested for a few seconds to confirm their map 1 comeback victory.

**Map 2** - Solar S&amp;D: [Epsilon](#epsilon) wins 6-2 - [Scoreboard](http://i.imgur.com/uNO6Tpj.png)

[](#14info) *Map Commentary* - The defensive team emerged victorious on each of the first two rounds as ON stemmed an Epsilon B push with ease and Epsilon did much of the same to ON's A push. The subsequent two rounds, however, were extremely lopsided in Epsilon's favor as they simply ran through ON's setup on the B bomb in round 3 and dismantled ON's offensive push on round 4. Though the subsequent round was much closer, the result remained consistent as MadCat won a big 1v1 over Mochila. Though Epsilon was able to force map point with another win on defense, ON was able to remain in contention with a defense of their own, emerging victorious in a big 2v2. This would prove to have little significance, however, as Epsilon's aggressiveness at the B bomb on defense proved to be too much for ON once more.

**Map 3** - Comeback Uplink: [ON](#opticn) wins 19-6 - [Scoreboard](http://i.imgur.com/TyPJOPF.png)

[](#14info) *First Half Commentary* - Despite beginning on the unfavorable side, ON had a strong start to the map, taking an early 2-1 lead with a strong push through Glass for a dunk. After another one point toss to take a two point advantage, Epsilon began to come alive, taking advantage of their presence on the favorable side by slaying and taking Glass control. Forcing ON into the Sandbags spawn-trap, the EU roster put through a one point toss and two dunks of their own to take a 6-3 lead. Once again, however, ON would formulate a response of their own, pushing out of the Sandbags and taking control of Glass for three consecutive dunks, ending the side in four minutes and eleven seconds with a four point lead.

[](#14info) *Second Half Commentary* - After a battle for drone and Glass control that lasted well over a minute, ON finally emerged victorious, reversing the drone through Green for the first points of the half in the form of a toss. After another set of kills to force Epsilon into the Sandbags spawn-trap, ON was able to put through another two tosses, extending their lead to 7 with just 1:30 remaining in the map. Though ON simply needed to stall for the remainder of the map, they would not remain content with their lead, choosing to pour on scores for a dominating map 3 victory.

**Map 4** - Retreat HP: [ON](#opticn) wins 206-140 - [Scoreboard](http://i.imgur.com/ABCHP2x.png)

[](#14info) *First Hill Rotation Commentary* - Unfortunately, I missed the initial four hills of this particular map, but upon resuming, OpTic Nation found themselves up 50 points going into Top Attic. Not only had they secured the final seconds on the Bottom Dirt hill, but ON also won rotations for this crucial final hill. They would prove to dominate control of this particular hardpoint, holding what appeared to be a full sixty seconds with flawless spawn anticipation and rotations for an eighty point advantage going into the second half.

[](#14info) *Second Hill Rotation Commentary* - Despite a slow start to the second half, seemingly failing to hold their rotations for the second Turtle hardpoint, ON continued to scrap a number of seconds before breaking the final 20 points of Turtle to maintain their lead at about 75. ON also contested extremely well on the subsequent Bar hill, staying alive to not only maintain their lead, but slightly extend it to about 80. With an imposing deficit and just two hardpoints remaining, Epsilon made a valiant effort to slay around the penultimate Bottom Dirt hill, but their lack of maintenance of the spawns made it such that they could only lessen the deficit to about 60 points going into the final hill, confirming ON's map 4 victory.

When the rest of Eastern Europe begins moving towards laissez-faire economics and mutli-party elections in the late 80s, the Yugoslav Government would face increasing pressure from its citizens and from other countries to liberalise.

The Yugoslav authorities begin some market liberalisation in the early 90s and agree to economic integration within Europe, however they avoid total democratisation by only allowing socialist parties acting under the banner of the Socialist People's Front to run for and hold office. Because of Yugoslavia's influence in the early days of the EU, there is less pressure on countries within the union to have strong democratic institutions. This allows a number of former Eastern Bloc countries to quickly revert back to authoritarian governments allied with Moscow with little criticism from the rest of Europe.

With pro-Moscow authoritarian governments being the norm in Eastern Europe, we might not have seen any unrest in the Ukraine like we see today.

We have the ability to speak wit more than 95% of the world by communicating in one or two languages and are able to travel anywhere in a couple of days. We also have the information to know as a simple civilian what's going on on the other side of the world. The Internet is the biggest playing factor in becoming one huge globally connected species wherein different cultures melt into a new type that was nonexistent in previous generations. We can order stuff from China or America and receive it in less than a week. It also leads to more transparency and secrecy, but that's not a part of your question.

One of the dangers coming with this much information is probably the isolation of interests. Since there is too much going on to keep up to date we all follow our personal path more, and we close ourselves of for news that doesn't interest us that much. The world needs to be connected in new ways, which hopefully will result in mutual agreements/understandings on war, science, cultures and the growth of the human race. This is already happening with more global economics, terrorist organizations, businesses and politics. A fine current example is the situation in Europe with Greece, wherein one country has to sustain its existence on behalf of other countries, since the European countries in itself are not in control of their own money (central bank of Europe prints money) anymore. The entire economic system is dependent on each other already.

I think this will be followed by politics in between continents, somewhat like the UN or Europe with more power to set guidelines so the world can melt into a place where the main goal is to reach global human satisfaction.

If you can't find a job, it's not straightforward to just, let's say, build your house or grow your food. If you don't fit into society, you are forced to be homeless. In the developing world, it's the general population that is poor, but their society is such that most if not everyone finds a way to sustain themselves and their family, rather than ""having to apply for a job and either succeeding or failing"".

What happens overseas with the solar industry doesn't really get filtered down to the guys who install it.

We know how to put it together, and how much the equipment and labour costs for the installation on our side of things.
We can also extrapolate how much the salesman has fucked the customer over, when the customer makes the payment the after installation is complete.

What matters to us:

* How long can we stay in this industry, before business slows down to the point that we quit?

Affordability is a major issue - government subsidies and incentives can only last so long, as it is only meant to kickstart the industry and have people interested in acquiring a system.

People have short term memories when it comes to prices. Systems that use to cost $15,000 years ago, now can be had for $5000. Yet, people have the expectation that subsidies and tariffs (price that the power company buys your power for) to remain the same.

Earlier systems that used to cost $20,000 to install, were given a rate of about 60 cents per kilowatt-hour they produced. Now, it's 8 cents (in Victoria), but the systems are heck of a lot cheaper.

When someone's says, ""8 cents? But my neighbour is getting 60 or 22 cents!"", they never did factor in early high installation prices.

Logically by the actual nature of the incentives and subsidies, the Government should be eradicated the program by now. Objective complete - industry established, installation prices have plummeted. But generally, we just whinge too much, so the program just winds down to placate them.

---

Leasing is relatively difficult to establish feasibly here. It works in other places where the energy buy back price is high (which is government subsidised to incentivise people to get into solar), with heaps of good sunshine, and expensive electricity costs. Heck, it requires a lot of capital to start, because the payback rate is so slow. Elon Musk is the chairman of SolarCity - he's got shitloads of money to do that.

* I pay about 27 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity.
* The power companies pay me 8 cents/kWh, that I produce.
* Melbourne gets a daily average of 5 hours of full sunlight spread across the year (that's our solar quotation estimation standard).

To break even on my power bill, I'll need to make more than 3 times more power during the day, than I will need to use at night. Now, can you see how much diddly squat that's going to reduce my power bill?

I shut the fuck up to some of my customers about this fact, when I immediately know that the payback will NEVER repay their installation costs, when I look at their power bill. Some systems can be repaid in bill savings, others won't (based on their installation size, and usage habits).

Really, when some folks make a $50 saving per quarterly bill... 

Let's do some quick maths:
      $50 x 4 quarters in a year x 20 years (life of system) = $4000 savings on electricity costs.

...They paid $8000 for the system, in today's money. THAT IS IMMENSELY FUCKING IGNORANT.

---

&gt; With countries like Germany being able to generate up to 75% of their energy from green sources...

That's great, but I'll need to understand how that power is generated, distributed and consumed - because it's easy to mess with numbers, by changing the definition of the statistic. I'm not sure what to comprehend out of that statistic.

    Example:
       - Generates 100 units: 75 green, 25 dirty.
       - Imports 50 units of dirty from neighbouring country.
       - Ha ha! 75% of the energy I generate is green!

Germany produces a lot of excess energy during the day, which gets sold to the European electricity distribution network, for neighbouring countries to use. Then, it buys power from its neighbouring countries at night, if it needs it.

Germany is decommissioning their power plants, and replacing it with renewables, claiming to be green. When those systems don't work well during the day due to poor weather, the neighbouring countries pick up the slack with their dirty power plants.

They can afford to do that, because the European Union has worked well in their favour and are sitting on tons of money, while the rest of Europe feels the pain of the economic crisis.",,gisdaman,4,1438525114,,t5_2qh13

The current Russian - unique people. Regardless of the origin of the blood, they are labeled with a single brand. No one ever tried to blind her today yesterday, killing her tomorrow.
Actually what we now call Russia, was born on the territory of Muscovy, Moscow principality, which was an integral part of the Great Horde.
All the princes and knights kind, took power of the occupier and gladly served as the servants of the great Khans.
Then, when the Horde began to fall apart, its focus has shifted to the Crimea, and Muscovy became a vassal territory, but with the prospect of growth.
Until 1700, the princes of Moscow regularly paid tribute to the Crimean khan.
However, in parallel, Muscovy expanded its territory.
Moreover, this expansion was due to the settings that were in the Horde.
Roughly speaking, the Horde was recovering. Somewhere in the West, has already started the Renaissance, it's time great discoveries born industry and science was restored, and Muscovy sought to restore the Horde, but under their own flags.
Then came Peter and became the king of Muscovy expand to the West.
Make it was not easy.
Half Muslim, Horde Power, very reluctantly unfolded his body to Europe. But the process has begun.
It is clear that Europe show bloodthirsty nature of Muscovy, Peter decided not to and planned to rebrand.
He decided to show that its roots are in the realm of Byzantium, that is - in the Roman Empire, exactly where the roots of all European monarchies.
To do this, he needed to have a link - Kiev and appropriate name - Russia. Muscovy Rus was only in 1721 to the highest order of Peter.
At this point, the process has begun for another past - Slavic, Russian.
Peter took to build the Third Rome - that is, to restore the past.


Yesterday's magnificent kind of the Golden Horde, who were the backbone of Muscovy yesterday and proudly bearing their names Horde became urgent perelitsovyvat under current trends, that is - rapidly ""ruset""
And the descendants of the Horde lords became Russian (native) nobles.
Their partial list just incredible!
Yushkova, Suvorov Apraksins (from Salahmira) Davydova Yusupov Arakcheeva Golenishcheva-Kutuzova, Bibikova, Chirikovs. Chirikovs, for example, came out of the kind of Berke Khan, the brother of Batu. Polivanova, Kochubei Kazakov. Kopylov, Aksakov (Aksak - means ""lame""), Musin-Pushkin, Ogarkov (the first of the Golden Horde came in 1397 Leo Ogar, ""a man of great growth and a brave warrior""). Baranova ...


 Their ancestry is recorded as follows: ""The ancestor of the genus Murza Zhdan Baranov, nicknamed the bar, and by baptism called Daniel, arrived in 1430 from the Crimea."" Karaulov Ogarevs, Akhmatova, Bakaev, Gogol, Berdyaev, Turgenev ... ""Ancestor kind Turgenev Murza Leo Turgen, and called for the baptism of John, went to the Grand Prince Vasily Ioannovich of the Golden Horde ..."" 
This kind of aristocratic attitude toward tukhum Horde, as well as the kind of Ogaryovo (Russia their ancestor - ""good name Kutlamamet Murza, nicknamed Ogar""). Karamzins (from Kara-Murza, Crimeans) Almazovo (from Diamonds by baptism called Erifeem, he came from the Horde in 1638), Urusov, Tukhachevsky (their ancestor in Russia was Indris, a native of the Golden Horde), Kozhevnikova (go on Murza-skin, with 1509 in Russia), bulls, Ievleva, Kobyakov, Shubin, Taneyev, Shuklin, TIMIRYAZEVO (Ibrahim was a Timiryazev, who came to Russia in 1408 from the Golden Horde).
Chaadaeva Tarakanov ... and continue to have for a long time. Dozens of so-called ""Russian families"" began to put the Tartars. But they built the lost Russia.
And after this perelitsovki and migration to the ""Russian"" canvas, Karamzin (see. Above) sculpt his famous story.
Tellingly, his entire 300-year history, the newly established Russia, trying to get out of the closet, two dusty corpse - the restoration of the borders of the Horde and the capture of Constantinople, for which he was in trouble.
After the revolution, the Bolshevik Russia has, with a sea of ​​blood trying to restore the Russian empire, and after the collapse of the scoop, Russia is trying to restore the Soviet Union.
Moreover, the people there were already familiar metamorphosis.
From comfrey Zhukva, oath of allegiance to the king and the country, to the nobility type Mikhalkov, when the Communists became Communists just spat and trampled the recent past, when the commune collapsed, princes and counts began to climb out of alleys, like cockroaches from the trash!
Those Mikhalkov, notebooks lackeys Bolsheviks are now columnar nobles and talk about the virtues of serfdom!
In this regard, to make a prediction. In a few years from that den under the abbreviation of the Russian Federation will have no choice.
But yesterday's ""elite"" will dig up the roots of Ukrainian and disown relations with today's tip.
As before, they are screwed to their surname ""s"" in order to become Russianized, then they will do the same, but with the end of the ""to"" or ""PAA"" to obukrainitsya.

Mais c'est aussi le cas en Syrie, en Irak, en Iran, bref partout où il y a des kurdes. Ils sont politiquement très à gauche en plus, entre le communisme pur jus (quasi staliniens) du PKK et le  communisme libertaire et l'autogestion. Le PKK est reconnu par la plupart des pays comme une organisation terroriste, ils possèdent une vraie petite armée.

Il y a depuis des décennies une guerre civile plus ou moins active entre les kurdes et la Turquie, le PKK avait déclaré un cessez le feu de manière unilatérale en 2013, la Turquie l'a brisé. En plus des bombardements turques (en Turquie, en Irak et en Syrie dont à la désormais célèbre ville de Kobané), il y a eu ensuite des rafles parmi les indépendantistes kurdes, l'extrême gauche turque et des membres de Daesh. Bref contre tous ceux désignés par l’État turque comme ""terroriste"". Au cours de ces opérations, une  militante du PKK est morte, déclenchant des émeutes à Istanbul. Deux jours avant ces arrestations, un attentant attribué à Daesh a fait 32 morts au Kurdistan turque, contribuant à accentuer la colère des kurdes qui estiment que la Turquie ne lutte pas vraiment contre Daesh (en fermant la frontière dans le sens Turquie-Syrie par exemple). Depuis le PKK multiplie les attentats contre la police et l'armée.

Dans le même temps, les kurdes et le PKK se sont imposés aux USA et à l'Europe comme des alliés indispensables dans la lutte contre Daesh. Bachar el-Assad a d'ailleurs laissé les kurdes assez tranquille au début de la révolution syrienne, espérant s'en faire des alliés de circonstance. Cette nouvelle légitimité (le PKK étant jusqu'à présent considéré comme une organisation terroriste, et donc infréquentable) agace certainement beaucoup la Turquie d'Erdogan, qui revendique son autoritarisme et son nationalisme. Et comme je le disais, sur le plan politique ils sont à l'opposé. La région de Kobané, le Rojava, a d'ailleurs revendiqué son indépendance vis à vis de la Syrie en 2012, et il s'y développe une vie sans État, avec les principe du communisme libertaire : autogestion, liberté, égalité, respects des minorités.

Bref je sais pas si j'ai été assez clair, parce que la situation là bas est assez compliqué. Mais en gros, pour la Turquie, Daesh et les kurdes, c'est la même chose. La Turquie soutient peut être les islamistes, en espérant déstabiliser la Syrie et l'Irak, mais ils cherchent aussi dans le même temps à détruire les volontés d'autonomie kurde.

Read the rest of my responses. He specifically said illegal immigrants.. He said illegal immigrant criminals, rapists, murderers and drug-dealers that we have deported are being pushed back into the US by the Mexican government. He said the Mexican government doesn't want to put up with these criminals so they dump them on the US to let our stupid leaders deal with their problems. He said nothing about legal immigrants. We have already taken 25% of Mexico's population.. at what point is it enough for you? Why not take more European immigrants as they are more likely to have money?

&gt;You cannot support Bernie Sanders and then say you'd vote for Trump unless you have no concept of politics and just associate with names.

Not true. Like you, I believe healthcare is a right for all US citizens. Unlike you and Hillary, I actually care about making sure the welfare system is sustainable for the foreseeable future. I lived in LA a few years ago.. the state of California has been completely taken over by illegals.. Hispanics are now the majority and 30% of the population are on Medicaid. Hospitals along the boarder towns all the way to Texas have been shut down due to bankruptcy from illegal immigrants using service and not paying. The welfare system will collapse if you allow endless immigration from the 3rd world.   

&gt;Even centrist Hillary is significantly closer to Bernie than **Hillary**- you mean Trump

Hillary is neck deep in these trade deals. Sorry but corruption matters to me. 

&gt;It's also worth noting that if a Republican wins 2016 that means the Supreme Court gets right-wing nominations and shifts to an even stronger right-wing majority for the next few decades. Do you know what that means? It means the progressive reform that Bernie is vying for will be impossible. Completely impossible. There is ZERO chance of Citizens United being overturned, single payer, or getting money out of politics with a Republican Supreme Court.

The constitutional amendment to end Citizens United is never going to happen under any president. If you want money out of politics, end deductions on political donations above $1,000. Trump supports universal healthcare (which does not necessarily have to be single payer- even most countries in Europe where I come from are not just a single-payer system, and just like in the US illegal immigrants are draining the welfare systems in Europe). Hillary has expressed very hawkish opinions on war and she is controlled by the Saudis.  

&gt; The Supreme Court needs a left-wing majority for these things Bernie is talking about to be possible.

That's why I support Bernie, but Hillary is totally untrustworthy and would be a terrible leader.. I just plain don't like her. I won't vote to sell the country down the drain just to vote for someone with a D next to their name when the other guy who is running R is basically like a Democrat anyway.  

&gt;So I find it suspicious you'd say that you're a Bernie Sanders supporter, and then would talk about potentially ruining everything he wants. You're likely a right-wing troll.

&gt;Edit: Yup you are.

Nope. What have I advocated for that could be considered right-wing- ending subsidies for corporations? Go to California and you will see most democrats are against illegal immigration because the state is completely overrun.

In that time I lived in two other cities in Europe, and contemplated living in over a dozen other places. I did a fair amount of research each time since I have a family and the logistics of moving are a pain in the ass. 

Vancouver is pretty unique in that it's a modern city which decided to prevent the car from fucking it up at a time when few other cities were. I'd say the goal was good, but the success levels are mixed, due to two factors: the size of the region and the age of the city.

The area is big enough that we do have sprawl, and thanks to the rivers and mountains, infrastructure to solve it isn't cheap. It would be more efficient to have higher density surrounding the core than to build out suburbs reaching to Chilliwack, but that's not what happened, so we have to contend with both problems.

The other issue is the age of the city is so young, the central core of the city is missing a lot of the refinements of the public spaces you would find in older cities that had to define their spaces around walking. We don't have a nice big city square that isn't bracketed by heavy traffic. We are still yet to build a lot of the mass transit that will help us move through the entire region, and as a result, we devote a massive amount of the space to roads.

Combine the size of the region with the under developed infrastructure and you get Vancouver. It's still a major work in progress. ",,slimspida,1,1438530571,,t5_2qhov

The video showed that shooting that happened in Paris. So it's not all that different. While most of the shootings here have to do with mental health issues. So it's not really a gun problem, it's a healthcare issue. I can hurt just as many people with my car, knife, sword, or anything else really.

1438569522,207,AskReddit,ctozmg9,,t3_3fi90o,1440237873,t3_3fi90o,0,0,"In my first year of college I worked at Kinko's (a fact I always feel the need to apologize for so allow me to say that I am sorry for the fact that I used to work at Kinko's).  I was nineteen at the time and had two co-workers: Tom, who was thirty, and Ed, who was nearly fifty and, well, let's just say that both of them were doing the same kind of work at their respective ages for a living (despite both of them having college degrees) that I was doing as a college freshman for a bit of extra money.  Despite the fact that both of them had gotten nowhere with their lives they were both hell bent on being life coaches to me even in spite of my endless protestations to their efforts.

Ed wasn't too bad: he was a desperately horny old geezer who expected me to want to fuck anyone who had anything even vaguely resembling a vagina and had a tendency to forget that banging obese middle age women might hold some appeal when you're fifty, but not when you're nineteen.  He also considered himself a failure though and didn't want me to wind up like him so I occasionally got decent advice from him.

Tom was another story.  Tom was deranged.  I'm going to take Tom on in list form:

Tom was an MRA before MRAs were a thing.  He was convinced that women only cared about sex, had no morals and wouldn't think twice about manipulating men in whatever way they wanted just to get laid.  The fun thing about this is I happened to know his most recent ex and got to hear from her about what a selfish asshole Tom was (though I was able to figure that out pretty well on my own too).

Tom was convinced that natural blondes had gone extinct and all the blondes you saw had died their hair to try to trick men.  ""Look at the roots"" he'd always tell me, ""it tells you who they really are.""

When I told Tom I didn't like to drink (after a bad experience with Vodka when I was fourteen) he became convinced that I didn't understand how to drink, by which I mean he thought that I failed to understand that drinking alcohol led to a state of drunkenness.  During an office party he decided to demonstrate this to me by drinking four pints of Guiness and then following me back to campus (I lived in the dorms at the time) so he could climb a modern art sculpture on campus to demonstrate to me how you're supposed to do stupid things while drunk.  He showed up to work the next day so hung over he was sent home and written up.

Any time I talked about any hobby or interest of mine that was even vaguely nerdy (such as watching Lord of the Rings) he would berate me for having interests that would guarantee no girl would want to have sex with me.  When I told him once that he knew nothing about nerd culture, he got really angry and started telling me about all the hours he spent playing D&amp;D in college.

He would always tell me he was a die-hard liberal but when I told him I thought Bush was a terrible president (this was in 2002-2003) he went ballistic and started screaming at me that I was a traitor to America and should be put up against a wall and shot.

Tom's definition of a good movie was that it had to change your life.  Any time I told him I liked a movie he would ask me how it changed my life and if I didn't have an adequate answer he would tell me that I didn't actually like it and had only bought into the hype around it because I couldn't think for myself.  According to Tom, only about ten good movies had ever been made (because even if I could convince him that a movie had changed my life it was still a bad movie because it hadn't changed his life) and they were a rather fascinating hodge-podge ranging from the iconic (2001: A Space Odyssey) to the cult (Richard Linklater's Slacker) to the obscure (the forgotten Alec Baldwin comedy Miami Blues).

When I told Tom I wanted to be a writer he started lecturing me about art (insisting that I knew nothing about what art truly was).  He told me about the time he and his friends dropped acid and put on Dark Side of the Moon.  In the middle of the album one of his friends, unprompted, punched a hole in the wall, which he told me was the greatest display of art he had ever seen.  When I told him how idiotic that story was, he said that I could never truly be an artist.

All of this took place in Hawaii, and Tom used to endlessly berate me for my stupidity for moving out there. He used to tell me that I had bought into the hype (that I was incapable of thinking for myself was a regular theme of Tom's lectures) and should have stayed on the mainland.  He used to lecture me about how great the mainland was as though I had never been there, even though he had only lived in Arizona for a year and I had lived on the mainland my entire life up until a few months prior.

During one of those lectures he told me that Dallas was in the middle of the desert.  He based this off the fact that Slacker was set in Austin and he could see sand in the background in some scenes and therefore Austin was in the desert and therefore Dallas was in the desert because Dallas was only a couple hundred miles away.  He started arguing with me when I told him he was wrong (insisting once again that I knew nothing about the mainland) and then I told him the reason I knew he was wrong was that I had lived in Dallas for seven years.  Did this convince him?  Nope.  He continued to insist that I was wrong and had just never seen the desert because I had never left the city.  A general rule of thumb with Tom was that when it came to arguments with me I was always wrong and he was always right no matter how ridiculous the rationale.

I have plenty more Tom stories I can share if this takes off but I kind of hate writing long posts if they're not going to go anywhere and this one is already pretty damn long so more Tom (and more Ed too if you wish) if there is sufficient demand.

Edit: by popular demand, more Tom stories:

During my time there I moved out of the dorms and into an apartment and Tom was pissed when I refused to throw a huge party that he could show up to.  He kept insisting that it was an important part of the college experience that you throw a party where all of your stuff gets destroyed.  When I told him I didn't want my stuff getting destroyed he told me college students shouldn't be so attached to their possessions.

Tom was convinced that every country on earth except for the US was an impoverished third world nation whose citizens lived in squalor and starvation (he had never been to any country except the US).  I tried to argue with him on this, pointing out that the standard of living in Europe was just as high if not higher than the US and he insisted that that was a fabrication and that people in countries like France and Germany were starving to death in the streets.  My admiration for these countries was also more proof that I was a traitor to America (remember that he claimed to be a die-hard liberal).  For some reason though, Australia was the one exception.  Tom loved Australia but insisted that I would hate it there because I don't drink enough.

As a nineteen year old I could get away with a lot of boyish flirtation with a lot of the cute girls who came in.  For me it was just a bit of fun but it used to infuriate Tom and Ed to no end that I would flirt with these girls and not try to get them into bed (I tended to pursue girls on campus).  One time a Macedonian girl came in and to my great good fortune I had done a report on Macedonia for senior year Social Studies (God bless you Mr. West) and managed to really impress her by flaunting my knowledge of Macedonian history and culture.  After she left Tom came up to me and told me to stay away from Macedonian women because they all have hairy asses.  I asked him how many Macedonian women he had fucked and he got really defensive and told me enough to know what he was talking about.  To my knowledge, that's the only Macedonian girl I've ever met so I don't know where Tom was finding them.

More on Tom and movies: any time I would mention any of my favorite movies Tom would ridicule me for liking them and when I told him to try watching some of them he refused on the grounds that he knew none of them would change his life.  I remember mentioning Seven Samurai in particular and he laughed and told me that there was no way he would ever watch a three and a half hour black and white foreign film and yet when I mentioned that I disliked 2001: A Space Odyssey he got pissed and started shouting at me in the most condescending tone he could manage, ""it's an epic okay.  Ep-ic.  Kids these days don't know anything about that because you don't have the attention span to watch anything long.""  When I reminded him that I loved the three and a half hour Seven Samurai that he refused to watch he denied having ever said that. (footnote: I had watched 2001 when I was fifteen and thought it was really boring.  I've since revisited it as an adult and have a much higher opinion of it now)

I wound up being fired from Kinko's for reasons having nothing to do with either Tom or Ed.  A couple months after I got fired though both of them got canned too (that they were both terrible employees should come as a surprise to no one) even though they had each been there for about five years.  I only saw each of them once or twice after that.  The last time I saw Tom he seemed to have had something of a revelation that he needed to get his shit together and was planning on going back to college.  Ed was still a wreck and still pissed at me that I refused to let him use my apartment as a place to fuck his sleaze bags.

I tried to add more about Ed but this post is apparently too long now so look to the comments for more about him.

I'm having a hard time recalling much else about either of them worth sharing at the moment but if I'm able to dredge the depths of my memory banks for more stories about them I'll post them.",,schnit123,207,1438534734,,t5_2qh1i

The TM G18C is a good performer, but it has the same fragility issues (slide and frame) as the 17. The WE G18C is a clone, but if anything even worse - the dense pot metal ruins the gun's performance and is even more fragile than the TM's ABS.

It is possible to *build* - not buy - a high-end select-fire airsoft handgun, but it is very, very expensive. A rough guide would be:

* **Tokyo Marui [GLOCK 18C](http://echigoya-guns.com/guns/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=51&amp;product_id=231)** $149
* **GunsModify [GLOCK 18C Slide, Barrel, Tritium Sights &amp; Non-Safety Serial Tag Kit](http://www.gunsmodify.com/en/product/detail-id-24.html)** ~$150 (Ideally you don't want the tritium sights - without them the kit is about $75, so ask GM if they can do that for you)
* **GunsModify [GLOCK 18C BBU](http://www.gunsmodify.com/en/product/detail-id-48.html)** ~$45

Organizations that try to concentrate on more than one thing or the 'whole' picture almost inevitably end up doing the work poorly or failing completely. A better strategy is to create collaborations so that each organization can concentrate on their core capacities.

For example, low-income housing here connects with Catholic Charities to provide free meals to children during the summer when they aren't going to school and therefore probably don't get to eat. They also provide a place for job placement organizations to come and meet monthly with residents and with government services to provide training on home ownership and paths to ownership for the people who have gotten that far. One of our ag organizations is connected with an org that provides help to have criminal records expunged (another bar to employment for their constituents). They rely on each other to do their work well and come together to make something amazing.

In addition to the number of peaceful revolutions increasing relative to violent ones, those non-violent revolutions are substantially more effective than the violent ones, provided they meet certain conditions.

Whoah. Hold on a second here. This is straying deep into bad history territory itself. Not only is it a blithe and broad assertion that is deeply questionable in its own right, it also ignores the local nuances that govern how a struggle evolves.

Very few people actually *want* a bloodbath but this is often an unfortunate outcome when two camps clash. The French Revolution would have looked very different if Louis XVI (aka the absolute monarch) hadn't decided to flee or if half of Europe hadn't mobilised against the new regime. Yet who here is able to condemn the National Assembly for deciding to set out on the road to democracy? They didn't have crystal balls.

The difference between France 1789 and the Baltics 1991 is that in the latter state power was actively decomposing - Moscow was increasingly unable to enforce its authority even if it had wanted to. A situation where there is no need for violence (something that was generally limited to Moscow during the Union's collapse) is a pretty happy ""certain condition"" for non-violent protest.

All of the above is of course arguable and has been debated for centuries. But that's exactly what makes a sweeping statement like ""non-violent protest is more effective than violence"" bad history.

&gt; Throughout decolonisation and the end of the Cold War (and certain events since that I can't talk about because of rule 2), non-violent protests have been the protest of choice with increasing frequency, and have been more successful

Much the same way that fat people use to be attractive because it was extremely rare for someone to be able to live in that kind of luxury. Japanese Geishas operate this way, in the process of achieving inhuman beauty they apply pure white makeup to their faces, and Japan is historically one of the most culturally isolated and xenophobic countries in the world. Considering the vast majority of people in the world both back then and right now aren't white, it's easy to see why lighter skin generally correlated to high social standing and thereby attractiveness.

In that culture since life is tough women can't contribute the way women in the west can. These are strictist cultures where men and women don't mix and neighboring tribes will kidnap women to insult tribes they are fighting or whatever. So in a culture where your daughters honor is the only thing that allows marriage to take place with another family of stature, the raped girl is essentially spoiled goods and a burden on the family because now no one will marry her and since there are no jobs for the daughter to support her self the parents see her as a burden for the rest of her life since they would have to support her. 

The partition of India and Pakistan was one of the bloodiest. People 
Would go into villages and kill the men and kidnap their women. Sikhs in particular would kill their daughters if they knew an attack on their village was coming. 

In eastern cultures love marriage has no meaning, although this is changing slowly. You marry your children for family ties and affiliations, sort of like how old school European kings used to do. 

It's unfathomable, but many a times, the daughter is married off to the rapist, instead of seeking the death penalty on the rapist, the father knowing no one else will marry the daughter would instead have the punishment changed to the rapist having to marry his daughter in exchange for his life. The daughters would oblige because they have no say and don't want to be a burden on their fathers. 

It really is a completely different way of life then what we are accustomed to. Obviously it's wrong and with globalization things are gradually changing. A Christian buddy of mine, who comes from Egypt, was kicked out from his home because he didn't want to marry the girl his  father was forcing him to marry his friends daughter. It's been almost a decade, this happened when we were in our final year of high school. He has since married a girl of his liking, someone who loved him as well.

&gt;While there is some truth in several of these assertions, our data refute some of the harshest stereotypes about Roma beggars. They are definitely poor, they are not organised 
by traffickers, the money is sorely needed and spent on necessities, and criminal activities are not closely associated with begging.

Vad som inte talas om i artikeln:

&gt;The claims of the supporters of the Roma are not fully verified either. Discrimination against the Roma may be less common than expected, criminal activities are not necessarily limited to the most marginalised subgroups, and there is definitely money to be gained from migration.

I Europols rapport så kan vi på sidan 6 läsa detta (ber om ursäkt för att jag inte har någon direktlänk här):

&gt;The traffickers involved in the recruitment phase are often of the same nationality or ethnic origin as the victims. However, the tendency for homogeneous groups to engage or work together with other nationality crime groups in order to realise their goals is increasing. All groups show some similarities: the ability to adapt easily to new environments, conditions and markets and to respond quickly to counter trafficking initiatives.

&gt;**Some trafficking groups are family or clan based with strong codes of conduct and allegiances and provide significant challenges for law enforcement to penetrate, e.g. Albanian speaking organised crime groups and *ethnic Roma* crime groups**.

På sida 4 i EPRS rapport kan vi se detta: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140780/LDM_BRI%282014%29140780_REV1_EN.pdf#page=4&amp;zoom=auto,0,600

&gt;According to Europol, **the most frequently reported groups undertaking THB in the EU are, in descending order, ethnic Roma**, Nigerian, Romanian, Albanian-speaking, Russian, Chinese, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Turkish. Some of them − e.g. Albanian-speaking, **ethnic Roma** and Turkish groups **are family or clan-based and thus very difficult to infiltrate**. The Agency considers Bulgarian and Romanian (mostly of Roma ethnicity), Nigerian and Chinese groups as probably the most threatening to society as a whole.

&gt; I'm not a fan of the European court of human rights. I feel the UK has a good track record on Human Rights and can manage it ourselves. I believe that if we have the need to remove someone from our country, we can make that choise within our own borders.

Ok fair enough, but I see this is about control. Now Human rights is hard issue, because I personally think that no government should be allowed to interfere with a case. The fact is our government does interfere. The reason the court of Human rights works is that it protects us from the government from doing that. now 9/10 the government normally wins, its only been the few cases the government loses that we ever hear about it. 

&gt; ment of people seems a little unballenced and I would like to see the UK able to control the number of EU citizens that enter the country, especially when those coming in just create more competition in a particular labour market to the point of wage compression. 

Well wage compression according to national statistics in the previous year, wage compression was only 0.5% so its very tiny. It is also something that could be easily solved by raising the minimum wage. I don't really think we can stop competition in a globalised world. 

Also you say its unbalanced but a lot of countries like Spain rely on British workers and pensioners to move there.

But not many countries want just us, they want the EU. Its alright trying to trade with one country but, the USA, Canada they want to trade with all the EU not just us.

They are a both culturally and racially monolithic culture with small populations. It is much easier to successfully to implement certain ideologies when the population is culturally monolithic, white, high GDP per capita, and is generally small compared to the United States. The population of Norway is just barely above 5m while America is a melting pot of 300m+ immigrants that range from western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin countries. What works in Europe where countries generally have a fraction of the population of the USA, may not work for a diverse country as the US. Sweden has very lax gun laws and very low homicide rates but that is because males are required to serve in their army, while our males are not. Also they are all white and generally prosperous.

However, there are things we can learn from Europe, especially when it comes to education. My grandfather was a recently retired President of one of the top universities in California after 3 decades, who frequently travelled around the world and he states that the Scandinavian countries and Germany absolutely destroy American education because they care more about critical thinking compared to test scores as well as the fact that countries such as Finland value their teachers equal to doctors. They are highly respected. Countries such as Sweden also have higher rates of sexualized violence against women in Europe but they take it the most seriously. 

In short, the Scandinavian countries have a great deal going for them, but that is because their cultures allow for socialism and it works. However it will not necessarily work for America, where we are a heterogeneous country with +300m. If a democratic President wishes to implement socialist policies, it will have to be heavily adapted to suit America's large and diverse and capitalist driven country.

Sorry, London. I visited you twice and tried my best to roll with you, but it just didn't click. Your skyline is a jumbled mess. Your public parks and riverfront are not worth visiting. Which is sad because your urban core is so noisy and so busy everyone would like a respite from it. You have some of the best museums, restaurants, and entertainment in the world. No one can take that from you. But to enjoy it, one must endure everything else. You have the density and noise of Manhattan without the ever-present buzz of excitement. You have buried your history among glass and steel monstrosities. Your neighborhoods stretch on forever and seem to be losing their identities (and their local pubs) at an alarming rate.

*Part 1*

**1.** My general stance on moderation is that any post that is off topic, or spam, will be deleted, and the user may be subject to a ban. For comments, any comments that go against the 4 rules of Reddit will be removed. Comments that contain off topic hate speech will be removed. For example, ""!@#$% orange people. They are !@#$%. Kill them!"", will be removed as it has no place in an immigration subreddit. However, if someone is commenting in a thread that deals with orange people - provided no calls for death or dehumanization are in the comment - they may use offensive speech. 

**2a.** All news sources will be allowed. I have a flair system in place that will clearly mark unreliable sources or links. Hateful sources may also be subject to a flair (although I don't have a 'hate' flair yet).

**b.** I've already said that any off topic hate speech is not allowed. Offensive speech that is on topic for a thread, provided no dehumanization or death threats are present, will be allowed to remain. 

**3a.** This is not a subreddit for personal stories. Yes, you can vent, but notice rule number 2: **Self posts can be about immigration in Europe or meta-posts, that is all**. A story about a crime wouldn't really be on topic. Personal stories can of course be incorporated into self posts, but they shouldn't be what the self post is about. Venting in the comments is allowed.

**b.** Ultimately, a subreddit is what it's users make it. I didn't make this subreddit to be an /r/european clone. If the user base is racist, so be it. I can curtail dehumanization and death threats, but I cannot just ban people for feeling a certain way. I can guarantee that even if the user base is racist, the subreddit in no way supports racism. Racism is not considered something on topic for an immigration subreddit. Self posts and links cannot just be about hating a race. 

**4.** As of now, no. If in the future something, for example memes, becomes a problem, temporary bans may be implemented.

*Part 2*

**1.** A polarized community means that discussion will be going on, and there won't be a circlejerk! As of now I don't think the community has matured enough, but we'll see how things become.

**2.** Once again, the community isn't really solidified, so I cannot say. I might do something where we have days of the week where certain types of news (pro-immigration, anti-immigration) are discussed so things don't become just one-sided. I might use a filter system if there ends up being two types of echo chambers.

**3.** Brigading is really a case by case issue.

**4.** If enough people complain about racism, we might have a sticky thread about it. Again, filters could be possibly implemented.

**5.** 
&gt; De ce ai vrea asa ceva?

Allowing all languages just affirms that you can speak in any language on here. Most people will use English on here, I presume, but I do think other languages should be allowed if someone wants to comment or post in another language. 


*Part 3*

**1.** I don't like this idea. If they are mods of those subreddits, they already have enough on their hands. I also want don't want catty fights between mods.

**2.** Good idea. 100% agree!

**3.** I'm not going to force translation. The masses can decide what language they will reply to.

**4.** Not a bad idea. I will look into this.


*Part 4*

Once again, this is not an /r/european clone. We are also not going to censor like /r/europe does. This is a subreddit for all things immigration in Europe. I do not think it will fail, for now. 

I hope your main account subscribes! :)

- ""Stoke City"" has made a formal offer, but Igor Mikhailovich considered it necessary to reject it. That is his right.

- **You would be interested in playing for ""Stoke City""?**

- Yes, why not? It's the championship of England, every game is interesting. Do not worry, I have another year of contract - I have it in good faith to work, and only then will look for alternatives.

- **It turns out that you fit the team that did not play in the European Cup?**

- I believe that the change of the Ukrainian championship on the English Premier League - a step forward. I have ambitions, I want to play in the top clubs, but if these suggestions do not have ... I weigh the ""pros"" and ""cons"": in this variant has its disadvantages, but ... it is nice to play when every week the stadium is coming 50 thousand, and not 5 ... When you play with ""Manchester United"", ""Chelsea"", ""Arsenal"", ""Tottenham"" and ""Liverpool"", that will only continue to grow, to move forward.

- **You are aware that you will be hard to leave after the departure of Lance?**

- I had an agreement with the president, but he decided not to let go of me. I repeat: I am a professional, so I will fulfill his contract until the end.

- **Most will not renew the contract with ""Dynamo""?**

- I believe that it makes no sense to go somewhere 27-28 years. Last summer I said Igor, that sign his last contract with ""Dynamo"". I prolonged the agreement with his club that he could get compensation for what made me who I am today. Igor Mikhailovich did not want to take money - I can not make him do it.

- **Igor Mikhailovich you explain your decision?**

- He said, ""Stoke City"" - not my level. Talk to the president, asked his opinion ... Maybe it is something you specifically tell. Now talking about my position: I was doing nicely for the club, all openly told the press. There is a proposal, but the president does not want to let me go, so I have fulfilled my contract.

- **""Stoke City"" does not give up on your transfer?**

- This offer still stands.

- **Do you have any other options?**

- Nothing concrete there. But nothing, I will have to wait - until the end of the transfer window a month.

Mel’s skin is “white, pale as cream”, Bloodraven has “milk white skin”. So cream and milk, hmm. Bloodraven is an albino, and Mel is an albino too, save her red hair, which we’ll come to. She wears a hooded cloak shadowing her face at the parley, in daylight - Bloodraven wore a hooded cloak in daylight because his albino skin was so sensitive.

Mel’s feature that doesn’t seem to be from Shiera or Bloodraven is her hair colour. If she’s an albino it would be white like Bloodravens - and her hair is perhaps the only feature preventing people thinking of her as an albino. Which is why GRRM giving us information about red dye seems curious and very interesting, knowing Mel’s hair is an unusual red tone.

I don't know if I wasn't clear enough, or you're being obtuse. It isn't a question of semantics, of what does or not qualify as racial discrimination. It's a question of whether it actually happened, which it's pretty clear that it didn't.

Their models etc still do definitely say we can get out of this issue, but I get the impression many climate scientists are sceptical of this happenning but that's a personal view of theirs, and not backed by science. The climate scientists who do work on these things (social science based), I think are more open about their views. 

Fusion if it ever happens is probably the only magic bullet, but we have been saying for decades that it is not that far away from working. Even if/when it does come online, we probably have another 20 years until it is economically ready, and then still very expensive. 

What you are talking about in terms of sucking CO2 from the air does exist, it is called carbon capture and storage. It's promising technology, but still in it's infancy and very expensive. It hasn't been really used yet to directly suck up CO2, but usually to connect to existing power plants, which could theoretically make fossil fuels carbon free. Again it's a long way away, and by that time hopefully we should have other solutions. There are also issues with the stability of CO2 storage (typically at the moment it is under ground). 

Well we are in Western Europe seeing emissions coming down, and I know at least in the UK (where I am) that this has happened since 2007. However, this is just emissions emitted inside European borders, the EU is typically a big importer, and so actually people really question whether emissions are reducing or if we are actually just exporting emissions to china and india. 

Technological solutions are probably going to be easier than political solutions, but we really need to do both. For example, the best thing to do is to reduce demand first for energy, then what energy requirement is left then can be dealt with using technologies solutions, personally I think this is the only way we are going to save it. 

Of course political solutions are also intrinsically linked to technological, and without climate policies encouraging these technologies there is simply no way any of them would get off of the ground.  ",,ohjw,2,1438551803,,t5_2qhx3

To me the current immigration policy seems chaotic and destructive. Allowing huge numbers of people to descend on select areas, drastically changing those areas against the wishes of the locals whilst leaving other parts of the country completely untouched. 

I don't think it's government policy to dictate where, geographically, immigrants buy property or start families, so I think the underlying problem is with the location of cheap property and that immigrants would be drawn to areas with cheaper rates of rent, which would explain why some areas are seemingly untouched by immigration, solution would be to increase the quality of affordable housing and temper the rental market

Even if we wanted to stop immigration, EU's free movement would mean our only option would cutting down on non EU immigration and asylum seekers, which has been going on for a while to no avail.

For the record, the Economist is generally thought to be a centrist newspaper (center-left by American standards, center-liberal by European standards). The Economist frequently supports leftist policy prescriptions, such as green energy initiatives, the Iran nuclear deal, gun control, income redistribution, etc. It also publishes articles which oppose all of these, because contributors to the Economist are some of the most qualified academics in the world, and they hold many diverse viewpoints. The Economist is held in extremely high regard (along with the Wall Street Journal, the Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Harvard Belfer Center, etc.).

&gt;Yeah, because they should be like us in the US -- we built our country on private schools and used them to largely eliminate illiteracy. And after WWII we educated a generation of great minds with our fabulous private school system! Oh wait -- none of that is true!

Second, this is actually mostly true. [This paper](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&amp;context=ce) by a Boston University professor of educational policy studies makes a pretty decisive case for the efficacy of private education: during the 19th century, private schooling provided for the majority of education in the United States (out-servicing public schools in the relevant case studies). Moreover, the introduction of public schools in the United States actually did not increase total educational access over time, but displaced the private school share of the market (over a 24 year period, from 1826 until 1850 during which the Horace Mann public school system was instituted, overall educational access in Boston remained 45.4%, though the share provided by private schools declined). Most of the motivation for displacing private schools was rooted in a desire to instill ""civic virtue"" in Americans, and fear of the subversive nature of private (particularly Catholic, particularly Jesuit) education, with modern progressive themes of increased educational attainment being a convenient ex post facto explanation imputed onto an original prejudicial justification. 

Public schooling in the United States emerged largely as a form of Calvinist, anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant indoctrination campaign, and it was generally quite ineffective and expensive.",,HippeHoppe,1,1438554246,,t5_2qhlm

There's various options already out there, but nobody bothers because it increases costs and makes their offering less convenient compared to a competitor who isn't using it.  So yeah ... it's time for the government to step in and force us all to get our collective acts together.

I'm similarly concerned about how this is actually going to play out, as the government hardly has a good track record for coming up with sane or practical solutions. 

The concern over how imports/exports are going to work is a perfectly valid one, and for once in my life i'll admit that this would be much better if it was being done on the EU level instead. Nevertheless i suppose something is better than nothing, and regardless of how crap the rules are, at least they'll be the same for everyone (...in the uk)

Thats the issue. 

Valve gives DoTA a 1.6 seed pool and gives exactly 0 dollars to CSGO. The 'valve sponsored majors' aren't valve sponsored, they're community sponsored. The money comes from the esport cases. 

&gt; For one, it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that, at the current frequency of tournaments and prize pools of said tournaments, there is already enough money to support the scene as it is. 

Again, compare this to DoTA's scene. The same amount of money is in the scene, and it will only grow with DoTA's adoption of the majors that CS has. 

&gt; Another point I’d like to make is that players don’t have to rely on winning tournaments to earn money, as there are other sources of income for them.

Again that is true about DoTA. 

&gt; . These tournaments not only offer $250,000 prize pools(with $100,00 going to the winner) but they provide travel support for all teams, provide a LOT of recognition for the teams’ brands and sponsors(achieving the highest viewership figures of all Counter-Strike tournaments) and significantly, they enable teams to receive sticker money, which is where a team has a chance to sell in-game stickers of their logo, for around 60 pence(or 1 dollar) each, and receive a cut of the proceeds.....

See signed edition of items/runes in DoTA. See valve providing travel support for TI. That's a poor argument seeing as the same developer is treating two different communities - one which helped build their steam platform and been a premier esport for 10 years and the other which valve had not attachment to prior to 2010 - completely differently. 

&gt;  For the upcoming major, ESL have put in place regional qualifiers for North America, Europe and Asia/Oceania

Valve does this for DoTA as well. 

The argument isn't one of 'growth of CS'. Thats never been the issue. The issue is respect. Valve doesn't respect counter-strike as they do DoTA. They never have. Until they pony up actual money that won't change. Nevermind how shit their game is compared to a version 11 years older. ",,var1ables,2,1438555445,,t5_2r08k

Also, the US has at least a facade of being a federation of states, rather than being one single large country.  We originally were even more of a federation, with very strong states and a weak federal government, almost like the EU.  We found out that made it really, really hard to actually accomplish anything, so they created a stronger federal government.

However, when they did that, part of the reason the states were OK giving up some of their power, was that the new federal government would continue to be a cooperation between the states, not a new single government with total power over citizens directly.

Because of that, we have weird vestiges of the earlier, weaker federation style of government everywhere.  Including the fact that we have two houses in Congress.

The following is purely based on the lore (cutscenes, mission briefings, and mission setups) and showcases the GLA's relatively excellent conventional warfare abilities, extreme strategic mobility, ability to rebound from devastating defeats, and practical technical expertise:

* The GLA were, canonically, able to capture and effectively operate enough US and Chinese equipment that they defeated the US rearguard during the retreat from Central Europe and then (implicitly) defeat the German and Central European militaries. That sort of conventional military experience is shown by the plot (the Chinese had to liberate Central Europe afterwards)

* The GLA is as you mentioned absurdly good at tunneling, which allowed the Battle of Crete and the sinking of the USS *Ronald Reagan* to occur. It's shown in the beginning cutscene and (if I remember correctly) alluded to by the GLA soldiers during the mission.

* Although the GLA Stingers, RPGs, and Quad Cannons probably wouldn't be effective against a proper air force, the GLA has demonstrated significant stealth capabilities even in the face of CnC!USA's recon satellites as well as their many tunnel networks.

* The GLA also has a good track record of acquiring and launching WMDs, such that major ground campaigns (and nuclear counterattacks) needed to be undertaken by the US and PLA respectively to dislodge them. This speaks to both GLA infiltration abilities and their technical expertise (taking control of the Particle Cannon is no joke).

* The GLA has also, going by mission set-ups, sprung back into existence after 3 large conventional offensives annihilated GLA conventional assets, including their ICBMs and capitol. And the 4^th offensive by the PLA merely ended the 1^st GLA War, which did not prevent the 2^nd from coming to fruition (though of course, we're not going to be able to get anything on the shape of that war).",,OldWorldGlory,2,1438560510,0623,t5_2s599

If you go to twitch.tv Rocket League is often on the front page. If you click on the icon it will give you a list of various streams. The titles will often say if someone is playing in a tournament, or in highly ranked match play.

After watching for a bit, I can recognize some of the names from the games, so I know some of the better players to follow.

twitch.tv/teamrocketrl is one of the better channels to try. They share the channel among team members, so it's up quite a bit. They have some good tutorial videos on Youtube. fyshokid is one of the more spectacular players in the game. As a group they like to joke around a lot, and they're truly some of the nicest players in the game.

u/The-Hambeast already mentioned Kronovi's chat, who is widely considered the best player in the game at the moment. His teammate, Gibbs, posts on this subreddit regularly. He also runs a stream for their games at twitch.tv/gibbs0o0. Same with sadjunior at twitch.tv/sadjunior.

I love watching m1k3Rules, but he doesn't stream as much. He rarely (as in almost never) plays one v one. 

Outside of that I just look for names I recognize.

ESL will be every Sunday. Europe ESL starts at 8am EST. North America ESL starts at 3pm EST. They usually last about 3 to 4 hours.

The matches are best of 5 until the finals, when they're best of 7.

For the top teams it's rarely competitive in the first few rounds. In the North American ESL Cosmic Aftershock (kronovi/gibbs/sadjunior) never lost a game, much less a match. The first several rounds they were beating each team by 7 goals or more each game.

In addition to watching the games live, if you're interested in seeing high level play, all twitch channels have some of the most recent streams stored under the player's profile, although they rotate off after a period of time.

I hope that's helpful. I think the game is a lot of fun to watch. There are some really good players out there, and the community among the top players is still very collegial for the most part. ",,36yearsofporn,15,1438566296,,t5_30cz1

To put some numbers on it, the UK government fiscal position for the past two years has been a deficit of [5.7%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-budget). The US by point of comparison came in at [4.1% and then 2.8%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-budget).

The last two years, FWIW, are also the first that the UK [has appreciably grown](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita). It doesn't look to be long before they'll break their record GDP/capita set 7 years ago, if they haven't already.

That all said, the new majority Tory government is promising [more austerity](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/world/europe/britain-elections-cameron-austerity.html), perhaps providing us with more data points if they go through with it.

&gt; To be clear, austerity in a booming economy—which hasn’t really had as much objection

I can't think of hearing of cuts in boom-times referred to as austerity. To me, austerity is synonymous with: ""government cuts that are forecast to leave the economy underemployed"", and is often imposed by creditors (not in the UK's case of course). Google ""define: austerity"" seems to agree with this with: *""difficult economic conditions created by government measures to reduce public expenditure""*, at least [for me](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=define%3A+austerity&amp;oq=define%3A+austerity).

I am aware that the definition offered by Wikipedia/Investopedia and the like would also apply to austerity that does not harm growth/employment in a boom-time, but that's not how I think of it these days.",,TheMania,2,1438567463,,t5_2selg

There was a lot of violence which surrounded the rise of some of these nations (cough, Germany, cough) but the rise of nationalism in Europe was hardly *all* bad. Add to it, Napoleon's armies also spread the values of the Enlightenment across central Europe in a way that no upper-class philosopher ever could. And, in arraying their armies to defeat Napoleon, many states had to educate their NCOs and soldiers to unprecedented levels.

&gt; Let me tell you my story and what Naniwa means to me, okay? My name is Amel and I come from Slovenia, tiny country from Central Europe. I am software developer, computer gamer and avid fan of e-sports.
&gt; 
&gt; My favorite Starcraft 2 professional gamer is Johan Lucchesi, ID NaniWa. When I started playing Starcraft 2 back in January 2011, I played Protoss race. Back then, I liked the players that were popular in community like White-Ra, IdrA, TLO. I heard about NaniWa at MLG Dallas 2011, when he won his first major tournament. I didn't think this guy would be something special, interesting, until he showed his different attitude while winning whole tournament without losing a game. I really liked his calm ""It's ok"" that everyone knows him for. I could feel there is something behind this guy. He was very calm and retained. Since I was playing protoss I started spectating him and his replays. I still didn't pay much attention to NaniWa until the times around when he moved to Complexity. We didn't hear much about him since summer 2011, but MLG Providence was the moment when he came out of shadows and almost won the whole tournament. I think that was the first time that I rooted for a gamer with all nerdchills that gamer can have. It was crazy mixture of adrenaline and euphoria. From that tournament on I loved this guy. He became my favorite player. He showed his unique attitude and personality with legendary ""Nani walk"" and comedic ""bad gestures"" versus DongRaeGu. Some time around MLG Providence people started to criticize NaniWa for his bad behavior on Twitter or in-game bursts. When he moved to Quantic, people started chanting about him not being able to remain on a team for a long time, etc. The Community turned against NaniWa, my favorite player. And after that probe rush vs Nestea during Blizzard Cup of 2011, people went mental. NaniWa was alone in the dark.
&gt; 
&gt; I was watching a lot of his interviews, him explaining why he did things he did, why he rushed with probes, why he is changing teams constantly, etc. He reminded me of myself, because he wants the best conditions for success, which he couldn't get from the teams. It's not always material things, it's not always the name of the team, psychology is a big deal here too, which weren't ideal in Korea. You being alone with 15 Koreans, with no communication, it's almost impossible to not feel like a robot. Naniwa is a very competitive guy, when he loses his temper, he lets it out on twitter, which is another reason why people didn't like him. But as for me, I understood him. He was seeing a picture of myself.
&gt; 
&gt; After Naniwa joined Quantic to be with Sase in Korea, I always watched him play, I will never forget his two consecutive GSL RO8 runs, I was just crazy, like watching Arsenal - Barcelona 2011 Emirates game. I think NaniWa has in the highest possible position in his career at that time. It showed how good can cooperation and living with Sase bring his game level to top. When he left Quantic gaming, I wasn't sure what will happen with my best player and only reason to follow Starcraft 2. But the guy continued. I like his discipline, I like how he trained at home ALONE while he was without team to keep his pace in the game. I was really sad when Quantic released him, because I thought he would quit gaming, but then in interview with JP McDaniel, he said that he still has a lot of motivation for game, and that he will train from home. Such a big enthusiastic guy! No matter he was the top foreigner in the world (Stephano was big earner, but he couldn't do much in GSL, which is the real showoff of strength), he didn't beg teams to accept him. He wanted to go his own road. Like always, since the day he started playing computer games. He went his own way, while people didn't support him in what he loved. This strength is the reason why he is the best foreigner in SC2 of all times.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I don't follow Starcraft 2 that much, but whenever NaniWa plays I really want to watch the tournaments. I can still feel those nerdchills now as if it's still 2011, my best SC2 year. NaniWa is the only player that keeps me following the SC2 scene, no matter how little time I have now.
&gt; 
&gt; I think NaniWa is copy of myself. He is competitive, which makes him rage online and do unexpected things sometimes. That's why people call him ""villain"" of Starcraft 2. But I don't think he is villain, because if person is really enthusiastic about something he does, there are a lot of psychological chemicals involved. If you lose, you can be sad and go write something on twitter just because of that feeling in your stomach. But NaniWa always knew that, so he apologized every time he wrote something bad, which proves that he does care, and regrets his impassioned outbursts later on. But a part of the SC2 community will always be against him, because they don't understand him. He is very honest person, that is the other thing that connects him with me. Watching him giving interviews is just pure entertainment.
&gt; 
&gt; Being a fan of NaniWa has made some big impacts on my life. I learned that even if many people are against you, you can still succeed if you work very hard and have a goal. When you invest hard work into what you are doing, you build some kind of bulletproof vest and no one can put you down. I like to know that there are people like NaniWa in SC2 scene. He doesn't receive high rewards like other top professional gamers, he doesn't have the best training conditions but he is still on the top through whole SC2 era. That is hard work my friends. Able to survive in SC2 scene because of hard work and discipline, is worth only one thing - /bow for King of the North. Johan Lucchesi is Keanu Reeves of SC2.

It's set in ancient Rome, each of you playing a faction aiming to claim the throne.  It has a really neat enforced alliance mechanic where each turn you bid to influence what the alliances are.

In addition it includes the original rules for Conquest of the Empire, which is essentially like Roman Axis and Allies.

Alternatively you have **Struggle of Empires**, the game Conquest of the Empire was based on.  Again it has an alliances mechanic but is instead set in the 1800s, so closer to the time period you wanted.

Or, finally, get **Axis and Allies**, it's a fantastic game and well worth the purchase price.  I'd suggest **Axis and Allies: 1942** as it's pretty much the game as originally published (with some rules tweaks and new units).  If you feel like really splashing out you could get the two 1940s games (Europe and Pacific), combine them and play a massive version of world war 2.  

The only thing to be cautious of is that A&amp;A only plays 5 players.  I've seen suggestions like ""you can play multiples to a side"" but that never really works.  It either results in arguments or one person dominating the strategy and the other feeling left out.

You are very rarely going to see a 10 player big box strategy game, however if you want something massive that can handle 8, check out **Twilight Imperium** with the first expansion, **Shattered Empire**.

2) Historically the UK has been more kind and tolerant to genuine refugees seeking asylum. Quite a few european countries are very anti-immigration and they don't take kindly to refugees coming into their country and taking jobs or living off government welfare.

In his book *Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook*, clinical psychologist Glenn Schiraldi says that people who suffer from PTSD often have a hard time finding therapists who are experienced and fully qualified to treat the disorder. So, it's good to know about treatments that look promising.  I can tell you about some promising things that don't seem to pose any side effect risks - CES and therapies like MBSR, mindfulness therapies. 

Dr. Schiraldi says that, although PTSD itself doesn't respond to self-help, there's a variety of symptoms associated with it, and some of these respond very well to self-help.  His book provides advice on how to know what kinds of things you can do on your own and detailed practical advice.  With 64 customer reviews so far, this book has a 4.5 star rating.  The founding editor of *International Journal of Emergency Mental Health* calls it ""the most valuable, user-friendly manual on PTSD I have ever seen."" 

PLEASE NOTE - I'm not saying the research I'm citing here is all up to date.  You're invited to read up on it.

Pilot study - use of CES by vets with PTSD

http://stress.org/wp-content/uploads/CES_Research/CES-for-PTSD.pdf

Not to be confused with ""shock treatment,"" CES, which makes use of very small pulses of electricity with a device powered by two AA batteries - like a TV remote - has been used in Europe and Japan since the 1970s. It's available in the UK without prescription. The FDA, expressing concern about possible seizure risk, has put it in the
by-prescription class, although a review by the National Research Council found no significant side effects. Information about devices like the CES Ultra is available on the Internet. I'll mention that there's a more expensive product called Alpha Stim, which has two technologies - CES and a pain relief thing called MET.

The VA on mindfulness

&gt;While researchers have not yet studied the effects of mindfulness practice in helping trauma survivors diagnosed with PTSD, research has shown mindfulness to be helpful with other anxiety problems. It has also been shown to help with symptoms of PTSD, such as avoidance and hyperarousal. If you have gone through trauma, you may want to learn what mindfulness is and how it might be helpful to you.

False,1,WTF,ctpl1yn,,t3_3fj6lv,1440248169,t1_ctpcyqg,0,0,"It was a lot harder to bail out of a bomber in WW2, you'd be lucky to get half of the crew out, as so many things could impede your ability to get out of the craft safely. Thankfully the crews filmed here were all positioned right next to the exit of the planes, (or on the wing struts) and a safe exit was relatively easy. Luck (as lucky as a mid-air collision can be) played a big part.

But its late, I'm bored, so I thought I'd go into more detail what it'd be like bailing out of your dying, plummeting bomber somewhere high over the skies of occupied Europe in 1943. 

Say you're in a B-17, and its going down, here's just a small list of thing that can keep you from bailing out:

The plane is going to crash, as a result of one or more of the following: a German interceptor riddled it with machine gun and cannon fire, antiaircraft artillery riddled it with shrapnel. The skin of the plane is just thin aluminum, and the crew members are wearing over their flight gear a flak jacket, and a steel helmet. Neither of these offer particularly good/any protection from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ0wBe6dYRk).

The plane could have taken a near-direct flak hit which, is literally an artillery shell exploding right next to you. The shrapnel could wound or kill you. The concussive force of the blast, or person being slammed against the side of could knock you unconscious. You die.

You're at 30,000 feet. You're on an oxygen supply. Think of any situation that could cause that supply to fail, or you being separated from it- you lose consciousness in seconds. You die.

The plane is carrying hundreds of gallons of high-octane aviation fuel. If these go up, they will envelop the plane, and you with it. You die.

Your bomber could be in a violent spin or tumble, and the centripetal force could pin you against the inside of the aircraft, unable to move. You die.

You are the ball turret gunner. There is insufficient room for you to wear your chute inside. The plane is going down, and hydraulics have failed, and so a second crewmember needs to manually orient the turret so you can climb out, don your parachute, and bail out. All while plummeting out of the sky. This doesn't happen. You die.

There are several exits, the normal entry hatch below the cockpit, out the bomb bay, the door aft of the waist guns, and even the windows of the waist turret gunners. There's a sizable chance on bailing improperly out of one of these exits and striking the horizontal stabilizer. You die.

Needless to say, flying in those things, in the War, was extremely dangerous, and took some serious steely nerves. I can't remember the specific mission, but one bombing raid about 300 bombers were shot down. Each had a crew of about 13... so that's almost four *thousand* men either killed, wounded, captured, or missing. In one day.

False,1,todayilearned,ctpm0ju,,t3_3fhxyw,1440248621,t1_ctozzxh,0,0,"Basically the Black Hand saw Austria-Hungary as a threat to Slavs and Serbia and wanted to scare off any imperial advances. They felt that by attacking Austria-Hungary that the Empire would give up more territory that had Slavs. There were also a lot of bad feelings after Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina (also Slavic). The rest is pure speculation on my part, but from my understanding Austria-Hungary was on the brink of collapse, and in its wake the German Empire was going to swoop in, take over the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, and consolidate its rule that way. The assassination also may have been a premature reaction to this way, a warning to any country that may have been looking at Serbia as a potential conquest. This of course is when European nationalism is really hitting its stride, and the idea that your nation ought to be sovereign and be the best. Serbia had only gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1815, so less than one hundred years later they didn't want to be gobbled up by another empire, especially after being independent for the majority of a century.

Nice buzzwords like ""social agenda"", as if being against historical revisionism is an ""agenda"", but what the hell facts am I overlooking?  Fuck yeah slavery has been a thing in other places, no shit.  Guess what?  Nobody should be proud of that.  Not the Africans who sold other Africans, not Arabs, not Europeans.  Not northerners who engaged in the trade and not southern buyers.

The confederate flag is the flag of a short lived nation that did nothing but fight for their ability to own human beings.  That is all the confederacy ever did, and as such it is inseparable from that ideology.  Sure, the flag is important in hirstorical context.  And sure, slavery wasn't on the mind of every poor southern farmboy's dying beath on the battlefield.  I never said otherwise.  And most importantly, we can't forget how a blind sense of ""duty"" to their state, or plain old ignorance caused them, like so many before and so many to come, to fight and die for something so shitty.

But when somebody makes a plea for ""respect"" for an entity that was willing to throw away the lives of so many of their own young men, not to mention the young men they were fighting, *over something  evil like slavery*, that rubs me the wrong way.  There is nothing there to respect.

Currently, the literature focuses on radical right/ anti-immigrant/ right-extremist/ populist-right/ extreme-right parties--there is not a clear term or definition of the phenomenon at the moment--as well as populist parties.  With the rise and Syriza, 5 Star movement in Italy, and PODEMOS' possible success, there is a growing interest in radical-left parties.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of any literature that takes a broad look at these movements, as most research focuses on the right and specific issues, such as immigration, asylum, or the EU.  

There is not an agreed-upon mechanism of their rise, which is still a very active debate, but you may try using google scholar to look up: New Social Movement Theory, Resource Mobilization Theory, Contentious Politics, protest parties/protest voter, and anti-establishment.

As for authors on the subject, I would recommend: Mudde, Van der Brug, Fennema, Van der Eijk, Superti,  Katz, and Mair.

You may try looking up specific parties; Vlaams Blok in Belgium, Lijst Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands, Republicaner in Germany, FPO in Austria, etc..., all of which have a fair amount of research on them, for specific movements. 

Since it is a relatively new research area with many competing theories, let me know if there is a more specific area--like micro-level, voter analysis or more broad party system analysis--that you are interested in and I can dig up some specific articles, and possible a book or two.

This is advocating horseshoe theory.  I admit to being a radical, but I came to my conclusions by reading and logical thinking. I find it insulting to assume I'm a conspiracy theorist for my beliefs. Additionally this assume liberals are incapable of holding irrational beliefs, when there are many centrist who believe in conspiracies.

&gt; It should be obvious in the House there is really no significant left wing caucus. 

Depends on your definition of left wing I suppose, but I consider most US democrats to be centrists.

&gt; However, in the Senate  there is one socialist, Sen, Bernie Sanders.

If you're playing the ""Bernie Sanders is a socialist, Drinking Game"" feel free to take a swig!

&gt; The US liberal movement is essentially centrist. This is true for the liberal party in the UK, too,

I agree with that...
&gt;  as shown in the political poster from Liverpool.

Swing and a miss, I tend to not judge parties by a single poster.

&gt; The liberal movement started more than 200 years ago during the French and American revolutions.

While the term ""left wing"" did have its origins in the French parliament the actual modern American ""liberal movement"" began around the time of the civil rights movement. It's not exactly an ancient tradition.

&gt;  It is a centrist philosophy today that developed as a counterpoint to European monarchies.

While this might be true of classical liberals it doesn't apply to the modern definition of the term.

&gt; Many of the Tea Partiers are fascists. Allen West is good example of a fascist Republican. So are Michelle Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Louie Gohlmert.

HAHAHAHA! While many tea partiers are authoritative they certainly are not fascists by any sane definition of the term.

&gt; The GOP, on the other hand,  has shifted from the right and descended into far right fascism. 

Far right fascism different from center right fascism!

&gt; Fascism is another word for corporatism. On author has stated that corporatism is the first stage of fascism

Untrue, corporatism is a distinct ideology. Some corporatist ideas overlap with fascist ideas, but corporatism can swing into the left depending on the specific brand.

&gt; There really is no coherent left wing political movement in the US as there is in Europe  
 
Really, cause the Democratic Party seem pretty coherent to me.

&gt; This is why European politics are so different from those in the US.

""Europe"" is not one unified political block. While many leftist parties in Europe do collaborate with each other, that is far from a ""unified movement"".

A lot of fringe left wing ideas (antiwar movements, conspiracies that MLK was murdered by the FBI, 'environmental' movements, etc.) were started and funded by the Soviets with the goal of undermining the US government. We find it funny today, but Communists gaining influence in Hollywood was a very real threat to the US. 

From Wikipedia: 

&gt;According to Stanislav Lunev, GRU alone spent more than $1 billion for the peace movements against Vietnam War, which was a ""hugely successful campaign and well worth the cost"".[3] Lunev claimed that ""the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in America and abroad"".[3]

&gt;According to Oleg Kalugin, ""the Soviet intelligence was really unparalleled. ... The KGB programs -- which would run all sorts of congresses, peace congresses, youth congresses, festivals, women's movements, trade union movements, campaigns against U.S. missiles in Europe, campaigns against neutron weapons, allegations that AIDS... was invented by the CIA... all sorts of forgeries and faked material -- [were] targeted at politicians, the academic community, at the public at large.""[2]

&gt;According to Sergei Tretyakov, ""The KGB was responsible for creating the entire nuclear winter story to stop the Pershing II missiles.""[4] Tretyakov says that the KGB wanted to prevent the United States from deploying the missiles in Western Europe and that, directed by Yuri Andropov, they used the Soviet Peace Committee, a government organization, to organize and finance demonstrations in Europe against US bases.[4][5][6] He claims that misinformation based on a faked ""doomsday report"" by the Soviet Academy of Sciences about the effect of nuclear war on climate was distributed to peace groups, the environmental movement and the journal Ambio,[4] which carried a key article on the topic in 1982.[7]

Unbeknownst to them the owners two children (Laura and Leonard Osterman) were hidden away and saw everything.


Fast forward to present. Ben Caspere and the corrupt cops use the diamonds as collateral to buy into a conspiracy of rich men that plan to exploit land deals to make a fortune. They use Frank Semyon and his waste disposal company Archeron to to heavily pollute large tracks of land with heavy metals, rendering it uninhabitable and driving down the price per acre to mere pennies. They then bought the land cheaply and plan to sell it to the government to build a high speed rail line thus making a fortune. Frank was meant to be part of this deal and gave Caspere millions to ""buy in"" to the conspiracy but Caspere is  murdered before he can pass on the money and it is instead distributed between the other conspirators and leaves Frank penniless.


Caspere was also in cahoots with the mayors son Tony Chesanni who, along with some people he knew from his time at the Chesanni wilderness retreat mastermind the idea of secret, secluded sex parties that cater to rich, powerful men including the state attorney general, most higher ups in Vinci and state PD's, McCandless and other board members of the Catalyst group (who hired a re-branded Black mountain PMC as their security). The purpose of the parties was to either woo or simply gather blackmail material on the clients. The women for these parties were supplied by the Russian-Israeli mobster Osip and managed by Frank's ambitious double crossing underling Blake. The women themselves were trafficked from eastern Europe, enhanced with plastic surgery by Dr Pitlor (who himself was treating Caspere for anxiety related to his sexual perversions) and them ferried to Caspere and Chesanni's parties. Tony and Osip run these parties behind the mayors back, muscling him out of control of Vinci and moving in on Franks turf. Frank had his underling Stan tail Blake however Stan was spotted and killed by Blake (who staged his murder to look like Caspere's to take the heat) to cover his clandestine involvement with the Russians. It is at these parties that the land deals are arranged between clients.


It is important to note that Caspers's favorite mistress was secretly taking photos at these parties and planned to black mail the guests leading to her murder in the woodland cabin by Tony Chesanni and his men. However the hard drive with the black mail material remained in the possession of Caspere at his second home until it was stolen by the Birdman after been discovered by Ray Velcoro following a tip from one of Casperes prositiutes  given to him by Frank.

Now the event that shakes everything up is the murder of Ben Caspere. 
While it is unknown who was wearing the bird mask and mutilated Caspere by burning out his eyes and removing his genitals at this point we can strongly assume it was the work of the orphaned Ostermann twins in retribution for Caspere's involvement in their parents execution. this is supported by the fact Laura was posing as Caspere's assistant at the planning office and thus it is likely Leonard is the birdman since neither Catalyst or the Russians seem to know who killed Caspere/stole the hard drive. At first it appeared whoever murdered Caspere also murdered Franks underling Stan but it's now known that  Frank had Stan tailing Blake but Stan was spotted and killed by Blake (who staged his murder to look like Caspere's to take the heat) to cover his clandestine involvement with the Russians.

Caspere's murder throws alot of unwanted light on those he was involved with both in the past (Burris, Dixion and Hollaway) and the present (Chesanni, Pitlor, McCandless and Osip). They want the case closed quickly (which is why the first 3 episodes move so slowly since no one is motivated to actually solve the damn case) and thus pressure the detectives to pin the case on a pimp and meth dealer, citing an altercation with a Pimp as the reason for his murder. To strengthen this story either Hollaway or Burris gives some of Caspere's possessions to a prostitute working for a pimp and has her pawn them for cash in an obviously traceable manner. This leads the detectives to the shoot out while Dixon withholds the fact it is a methlab with armed guards within in the hope that the op goes bad and everyone is killed thus closing the wrapping up the case in a neat bow.

False,3,MensLib,ctpotbn,,t3_3fl96x,1440250005,t1_ctpoggr,0,1,"I appreciate your reply. I said this in another comment already, but I'll repeat it here. I don't really disagree with some of the issues feminists want to fix, but i feel as if there is a general feeling amongst the majority of feminists that women are still as unequal today as they were in the early 1900's. Things like Women's Suffrage and so on are no longer things that feminists in today's Western society need to focus on. However, instead of helping women in third world countries such as places in the Middle East and Africa, they are too busy focusing on issues that either don't matter or don't exist here in the West (man spreading, rape culture, the pay gap, etc.). I use to believe that feminism was the scourge of humanity, and that it should be eraticated, but I understand that its core philosophy is to give women the same rights as men. I just think that it has, in a way, become misguided in the modern age.

Now, I could go on about some of this stuff, but you kindly asked me to discuss why I don't believe in rape culture or the gender pay gap, and I am happy to answer your question. To start off with, I feel that rape culture as it is currently defined, does not exist in Western society (America, Canada, most of Europe). There is this idea that when a rapist commits the act of rape, they are somehow treated with more kindness than the victim. Because apparently, rapists don't get many years in jail, and there aren't thousands of rape shelters that exist to accommodate victims of this crime. Rapists are some of the worst people on the planet, and it's preposterous to think that any competent justice system would serve a punishment to them that isn't justified. When you look at countries like India or areas like Africa/the Middle East, rape is usually not treated with much severity at all. THAT is a rape culture. I would also like to point out that thanks to some feminist lobbies to in Israel and India, men cannot legally be raped in these countries (much like the U.S. and Great Britain). This could be expanded further, but I have another question to answer.

The pay gap is something that I have studied pretty extensively, and have come to the conclusion via documents and studies (as have many economists) that it simply does not exist. Yes, when looking at raw data, women make on average 15-20 cents less for every dollar a man earns. However, when you take into account the fact that women are more likely to take part-time jobs, take longer vacations, and work less hours than men (among other factors), this gap disappears to almost nothing. I am on mobile, so I can't link to any studies right this second, but I will try to as soon as I can. Thank you for reading, I realize that this was a very long winded post, but you have been very cordial with me, so I wanted to thank you by answering your questions to the best of my ability.",,MuhamedBesic,3,1438586807,,t5_38jid

Swish, Mobilt Bank-ID och [kontaktlös Blipp-betalning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IfbZb4ydIs) upp till 250kr (funkar bra, finns nästan bara på Ica dock)!

Det finns både enkel inloggning för att föra över mellan egna konton snabbt, och riktig inloggning för fulla rättigheter, det är lättare att betala räkningar i mobilen än på datorn då den kan läsa in ORC osv via kameran.

Fondsparandet funkar bra och har inte sett några avgifter än, transaktioner tar 2-3 dagar dock.

Det är sjukt nice att Icabanken finns i alla Icabutiker när man vill sätta in kontanter på kontot. I vanliga mat-kassan så säger man att man vill sätta in pengar, drar sitt kort, ger kontanter, personalen skriver på mitt kvitto, klart! 7-23 alla dagar.

Utlandsbetalning kan göras direkt på internetbanken, den kontrollerar uppgifter man fyller i. Eu-betalning är gratis. Inga valutaväxlingsavgifter! Jag kan sätta begränsningar för mina betalkort direkt i appen, i vilka världsdelar det ska fungera, om de ska vara öppna för onlinebetalningar med och utan mastercard securecode (logga in på banken för att verifiera internetköp, känns säkert)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29

&gt;Race, as a social construct, is a group of people who share similar and distinct physical characteristics.

&gt;There is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed, and that racial groups cannot be biologically defined.[22][23][24][25][26][27]

&gt;When people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved.[29] In this sense, races are said to be social constructs.[30] These constructs develop within various legal, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.[31] 

&gt;Socioeconomic factors, in combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups.[32] **Racial discrimination often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and morally inferior.**[33] As a result, racial groups possessing relatively little power often find themselves excluded or oppressed, while hegemonic individuals and institutions are charged with holding racist attitudes.[34] Racism has led to many instances of tragedy, including slavery and genocide.[35]

Zvýraznené je tvoje rasistické správanie ktoré tu predvádzaš.

Daj mi príklad východoeurópskej krajiny kde nie je korupcia a kriminalita skrz na skrz od politikov po obyčajných ľudí.

The emails turned out to be quite accurate on *some* points.  

&gt; The paper quoted Mr Blumenthal as telling Mrs Clinton - who is currently seeking the Democrat nomination to succeed Barack Obama in 2016 - that a Cameron government would be ""more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian ... sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher"".

This has turned out to be true.  Most of the Tory Cabinet come from privileged backgrounds and have consistently proven that they don't give a damn about the working class and poor.  ""Narrowly"" Etonian has proven to be an understatement.  

&gt; Mr Blumenthal, who was an aide to Bill Clinton during his time in the White House, said Mr Cameron's foreign policy was largely driven by his ""need to keep his party behind him"" on issues such as Europe.

Again, this has proven true.  Cameron's Europe policy is a mess because he is trying to please the Eurosceptics within his party.  

&gt; Other messages describe London mayor Boris Johnson as ""the Tory clown prince""...

This can hardly be denied either.  Johnson's charming clownish behaviour hides a deep ambition to be PM.   However, given the rising popularity of Osborne and May among Tories looking at life-after-Cameron, it's looking increasingly unlikely that Boris will ever be PM.

1438595209,2,AskHistorians,ctpqiac,,t3_3fkx0b,1440250803,t3_3fkx0b,0,0,"The short answer is basically everyone hated Servetus's Unitarianism.  In many ways he went further than even the most extreme Reformers and ended up being rejected by both Catholics and Protestants for the most part.  He went very strongly against the Trinity, calling the belief an ""error"" explicitly (that's even the name of one of his books, *De Trinitatis Erroribus*).  It's important to remember that even today almost all Christian groups accept the Trinity as essential, and it's as far as I know a concept that hadn't really been questioned by Christians in more than a millennium in Servetus's time.  Shortly after Servetus (and possibly inspired by him), you do find some Unitarian groups--most prominently the [Polish Brethren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Brethren) and the [Transylvania Unitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Church_of_Transylvania), and later the Unitarian Church in England from which contemporary Unitarian-Universalists are partially descended.  But really, he had very few contemporaries (the other well known was [Lelio Sozzini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lelio_Sozzini), known widely as Socinus--see also [Socinianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socinianism), which is a traditional, somewhat pejorative term for non-Tritarian Christianity) and was preaching something that was essentially universally condemned as heretical by pretty much the entire spectrum of Christian theologians.

This small Unitarian movement, with whom Servetus is grouped though he was more of a thinker than a movement man, is classed by most historians today as part of the [Radical Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Reformation), rather than the ""Magisterial Reformation"" of Luther, Calvin, et al.  If I'm remembering George Hurston's argument correctly, there were three main wings of what he called the Radical Reformation--the Anabaptists (including modern-day Mennonites and Amish as well as more violent forms, like the [Kingdom of Muenster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münster_Rebellion)), the Hutterites (who practiced a ""Community of Goods""), and the various Unitarian movements listed above, as well as a few other small movements scattered here or there.  But generally, the defining characteristic of the Radical Reform is that they were seen as completely beyond the pale of acceptable Christian thinking by both Catholics and most Protestants, and therefore suffered prosecution by both.  I don't know specifically who else condemned Servetus, but if asked, almost every important theologian of his period would have.  Even the English [Act of Toleration of 1689](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration_Act_1688) (a century and a half later), which legalized all ""non-conformist"" Protestants explicitly did not allow for non-Tritarian groups (or atheist or obviously Catholics).  I believe the restrictions on Non-Trinitarianism in England (generally one of the more tolerant countries in Western Europe towards strange Protestant groups) were [only lifted in 1813](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_the_Trinity_Act_1813).  I don't know who felt ""threatened"" by him, but most of his peers would have considered his ideas heretical and deeply dangerous. His ideas were only really allowed in the most tolerant places, like Poland (before 1658) and the Netherlands (though I'm not sure precisely when the Netherlands became the tolerant place for ""dangerous"" Protestant ideas, it long had that reputation).",Comparative Religion,yodatsracist,2,1438593597,religion,t5_2ssp3

Both points can be faked. First, the sender address means nothing. I can write you a PHP script in 1 minute which can send emails from any address. Second: Hover over the link in the mail and have a look at the tool tip on the bottom left / right. It shows you the real link destination. You can also right click and copy the link address and then post it anywhere.

This is of course a major drawback of email design. It was originally intended to provide a return address. But since its never actually checked everybody can insert anything they want. Of course, most common email clients don't provide this option since there is no point in it. But attackers want use those common clients and yours doesn't have any possibility to check it. Also see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing

If somebody writes an other link text than the actual link directs to than they have something to hide. This almost always a certain evidence for a scam. Of course, some people prefer to use a normal sentence or shortened link as link text (""click me!""). I'm talking about those cases where the link direction completely differs.

I will provide you a quick analysis of this game.
It's a BO3 between Property vs ROCCAT (Ex-Encore). Game will be played Online in a series called ""CEVO Professional Season 8 Placement EU"" 

Both teams will attend with their full rosters, and those are the following :

- **Property : twist, zende, Dumas, BENDJI, KAB0M**

- **ROCCAT : suNny, KHRN, aslak, REFLEX, xartE**

Odds are currently 55-45% In favor of Property.

###Property

Property are quite an interesting team to say the least. There are times when they beat everyone, and times when they get beaten by everyone. In my opinion this team has very big potential to fight with the best tier 2 teams. They're just way too inconsistent. That being said, they should focus on every single game, even if the games won't matter. It seems like they're winning games that are actually important, and losing the rest. I believe that they're all in for CEVO though. ""Twist"" is amazing AWP, and very consistent player, he usually delivers for the team. If he manages to step up this BO3, Property is strong in this one.

Recent performance :

- **Property vs LQQMPP** 0:1 (13:16 on Train)

- **Property vs Hellraisers** 1:2 (Cache, Dust2, Inferno)

- **Property vs FlipSid3** 0:1 (3:16 on Cobblestone)

Their latest results are very bad, but the game against LQQMPP was very close, Hellraisers are overall better team than Property, they had to fight F3 in their best map. If you compare their match history to ROCCAT's, you can see that they're clearly playing against better teams.

###ROCCAT

Only hope of Finns. This team is quite interesting aswell, the ex-Encore. They're in good form, but inconsistent aswell. ""aslak"" and ""suNny"" have been really stepping up for this team lately. When they're playing bad, this team is pretty much done deal. I've been watching their games lately, and their play style is really stubborn, just picking up the aim duels, they're not using any versatile tactics. Only one or two smoke executes per map etc. With enough work, this team also has great potential.

Recent performance :

- **ROCCAT vs eBettle, 1:2 (Cobblestone, Dust2, Mirage)**

- **ROCCAT vs Team Jynttä, 2:0 (Dust2, Inferno)**

- **ROCCAT vs SKITLITE, 1:0 (16:8 on Cache)**

All of these games were played at Assembly's, Jynttä is mix team formed by Allu and Get_Right (They were playing mostly for fun).
SKITLITE's just some tier 5 finnish team. Only challenge they really had was eBettle, those were close games, eBettle finally wrapping up the series.

###Conclusion

In terms of raw aim, this game is pretty even, but Property having the superior AWP player, I would see Property being slight favorites in this matchup. Property also has more versatile strats than ROCCAT.

- **My Odds : 60/40**

- **My bet : Low/Medium on Property, If CSGL odds ends up being same as my odds (60-40), you should consider skipping the game.**

- **Risk : High**


**P.S**
Keep the negative comments to yourself, and instead give instructive feedback as they will promote the same thing.

Ma petite soeur a traversé l'Atlantique vers New York hier dans un avion commercial bimoteur (certifié ETOPS: ""engines turn or passenger swim"").

A New York elle a pris un taxi pour aller prendre un verre à Madison Square Garden au lieu de profiter des donuts ouverts la nuit à JFK Airport comme je lui avais conseillé :-(

La elle a un vol de 3 heures depuis New York JFK jusqu'à Miami (elle m'a envoyé un SMS, elle vient d'embarquer dans cet avion).

A Miami elle à 10 heures de correspondance avec peut-être le temps d'aller à Miami Beach et de voir les façades Art Déco d'*Ocean Drive*.

Et normalement demain à 14h elle atterri au Brésil :-)

Tous les vols ont eu lieu avec American Airlines.

Heureusement il y a Flight Radar et Flight Aware pour déstresser en suivant le vol et voyager par procuration :-)

a few questions...

1) a li-ion battery costs 2 lakhs/10 year. india has 300 million houses. explain where we will get the money?

2)lithium is poisonous. how will the huge waste be disposed

3)lithium is not infinte in supply. where does one get enough lithium for 7 billion people without skyrocketing its price. right now solar power is less than 1%. at this rate lithium can last 440 years.
consider solar becomes 20%...lithium will last us 22 years. tesla can pretty much go fuck itself it still relies on that.

and finally stop citing science journals for practical purposes. technically every month they say new cure for aids is discovered. when there is an actual product on the ground that is cheap it means something. right now the tesla power wall is nothing but a novelty. It has its niche uses. but thats it. it still 'niche'. 

Considering US has all these problems (which by the way is irrelevant here) and india has 300 million people who cant even eat everyday, solar tech is going nowhere in next 20 years UNLESS there is some real breakthrough in energy storage(not necessarily in battery) that makes it cheap.

solar prices have come down. sure. great. but we are talking about energy storage not production. Solar theoretically can power the entire world during daytime. what if it rains? what about pretty much all of europe for 6 months? what about night?

solar can augment nuclear energy but never replace until storage is cheap

&gt;Child trafficking is a cross-cutting issue as children are victims of all the above-mentioned and other types of exploitation. The latter include trafficking in order to commit petty crime and begging, as evidenced by a recent report concerning Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden. In some cases children are initially trafficked for one form of exploitation, only to be sold into another. All this may happen with parents being involved in the process.

&gt;There are numerous cases of Romani children being trafficked for various purposes, which confirms the general tendency of ethnic Roma to be over-represented amongst trafficking victims. Certain cultural practices, such as exploitative begging involving minors, as well as forced and child marriages, are often linked to the trafficking of Roma. It is claimed that the existence of such practices increases the vulnerability of this ethnic group to human trafficking.

[Källa](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/bibliotheque/briefing/2014/140780/LDM_BRI%282014%29140780_REV1_EN.pdf#page=7&amp;zoom=auto,0,350)

&gt;Roma organised crime groups are extremely mobile, making the most of their historically itinerant nature. An attitude of detachment towards Roma communities by public authorities in some Member States has, in turn, left the most vulnerable members of these communities - children and young women - unprotected from exploitation by criminal groups. Given the size of the Roma communities in Bulgaria and Romania, the proposed accession of these countries to the Schengen Zone may prompt a further increase in THB by Roma organised crime groups.

&gt;&gt;During an investigation in child trafficking involving Roma children trafficked to other EU MS, it became evident that the traffickers had clear expectations that if the children were exploited to their maximum potential, the profits that could be generated would be in the region of €20-30,000 every three to four months. In the same case, it was established that numerous mansion-style houses had been constructed in the town in Romania where the trafficking group originated from. In this rural area, where the stated average monthly income amounts to about €400, houses which cannot have been constructed for less than €100,000 present a clear message to many that crime does pay.

One is that everything on an aircraft has to be certified. This isn't easy or cheap. So every bolt, rivet, belt, piece of plastic, all has to be certified. So if a manufacturer wanted to use metric, they would have to do this for every bolt. Lots of money. 

Second, no one would fly the aircraft for very long. Aircraft are for making money. Backend costs are a huge factor in how long an aircraft operates. Aircraft hardware is standardized. They use what is called either the AN system, or MS system. AN was updated to MS. So all pretty much all standard hardware has a main part number and a  dash number. Dashes in bolts are in 16ths of an inch. So a -4 bolt is a 1/4 inch. So is everything else. The o rings, the nuts, everything. So if I have a -4 bolt and need a new nut and washer I just go get a -4 nut, and a -4 washer. If you built an aircraft in metic no one would have screws or bolts on hand. It would all be special order. 

All this would lead to expensive down times and huge repair bills. Let's say you get a basic squawk, like inop annunciation on de ice boots during deflate cycle. That means there isn't any, or enough suction to keep the boots down. So normally I would go out, break loose a fitting on the suction line, and install a vacuum gauge, do a run up and measure the suction, go from there. Now, if the aircraft was metric, you, the owner is screwed. Where do I get your fittings? How do I adapt your fittings to my gauge? Everybody else has standard AN stuff. So I'm going to charge you for the extra time, really charge you for the tooling, and it's gonna take a long time in calendar days. And every time there's a squawk this will happen.

It was going to happen, someone would have done it and by doing it we secured our place as a modern nation rather than being stamped on by larger Empires. Not only did this small island retain independence it grew so huge it won the European game of Empires and changed the world (for the better?).

What we should be proud of is clearly not the subjugation but what was done with it. Places like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are in FAR better shape than other European colonies.

More importantly though is having an Empire of that size allowed us to almost globally abolish slavery and piracy, we even gave up territory and money in exchange for countries to stop the practice, that has to be worth being proud of? Yet it would be impossible without Pax Brittania.

1438603776,2,unitedkingdom,ctpt0tg,,t3_3fjxee,1440251988,t1_ctpcyxl,0,0,"&gt;How would you nationalise these things?

There are three components we need to nationalise if we want complete renationalisation of the railways: 1) railway infrastructure, 2) train operations, and 3) train ownership.

1) Railway infrastructure (tracks, signals, stations etc) are already nationalised because they are owned by Network Rail, a publicly-owned company, so that's already taken care of.

2) Train operations are currently done by [train operating companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_operating_company) (TOCs). TOCs are awarded time-limited franchises by the government to operate trains on specified routes, so to renationalise train operations we simply need to wait until the current franchises have expired and replace the current, private, operators with a public operator. Train operations can thus be renationalised at zero cost, it just takes a bit of time.

3) Train ownership is the more difficult, and often overlooked, aspect. When British Rail was privatised its rolling stock (carriages, locomotives etc) was sold to a group of private companies called [rolling stock operating companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Great_Britain#Leasing_services) (ROSCOs). The ROSCOs lease the rolling stock to the TOCs. Because the ROSCOs own the rolling stock outright, in order to achieve full renationalistion we'd need to either buy the rolling stock off them or buy completely new rolling stock. Either option will be extremely expensive.

&gt;is not illegal under EU directive for the state to have a near or absolute monopoly on rail?

Sort of. You're referring to the EU's [First Railway Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Railway_Directive) which states that EU countries must allow open access operations on railway lines by companies *other than those that own the rail infrastructure*.

That last but, which I put in italics, is important. It basically means that a country can satisfy the directive by having one company managing the infrastructure and another, separate, company operating the trains. There is nothing stopping both of these companies being publicly-owned though.


&gt;should we not aim to achieve a more Japanese rail industry with a greater amount of competition

Japan is rather interesting in that it has arguably the world's best railways, and most of their railways are also privately owned and run (Japan thus shows that privately-run rail *can* work, although why theirs does and our doesn't is another discussion).

I presume that by competition you're referring to the fact that some areas in Japan are served by multiple rail companies, and thus passengers can choose which company to travel with?

Firstly, this is true for Japan's biggest cities, but for most other places in Japan you're stuck with one train company.

Secondly, in places where there is competition, there are reasons that it exists which would be hard to replicate in the UK:

1) Japan's big cities have a *very* high population density, making multiple, competing train operations feasible. In the UK I doubt anywhere other than London has sufficiently high density, and London already has multiple modes of public transportation.

2) Planning - I don't know how the planning laws in Japan work, but judging by the amount of infrastructure that gets built there, and how quickly it gets built, I'm guessing it's much less strict than the UK. Building new infrastructure in the UK is extremely difficult - just look at the protests against HS2 or Heathrow expansion.",,burgleurgle,2,1438603557,,t5_2qhqb

No, I understand that.

I'm trying to say that imported goods (even energy) are a small fraction of the total vacation costs in Europe. Local goods/services fixed to the Euro are the majority of what you are paying for and those components are much cheaper.

A bottle of water costing $2 (theoretical because they bottle water in Europe too), or even doubled energy prices, isn't going to change your €150/night hotel bill much in either direction. Like hotels, restaurants are typically between 80% and 90% labour, regionally produced food, and real-estate so those prices aren't going to fluctuate much either.

So yeah, that 10% of your vacation cost which relies on imports may not decrease in price; but the other 90% is much cheaper relative to a few years ago.


Also in this very specific case the US Dollar has gone up in value, the Euro did not fall relative to most of their trading partners so only imports sourced from the United States will have an increased € price.

Try Russia on for size (Moscow has awesome hiking trails); there are near zero US imports to Russia right now so a rising US dollar has very little direct impact (most imports appeared to be from Germany actually). Anyway, Kremlin view rooms in a place like Hotel National are around $250/night USD now and 5 years ago they were closer to $700/night USD.

I'm not a wine connoisseur or wine snob, whichever term you prefer but the argument goes that by protecting the region and the method, you ensure the survival of regionally variant techniques so that the people who do experience wine as an art form can continue to experience those wines in the future. Defenders of the approach point to large wine brands in places like Australia as an example of how lack of deliberately preserved local variation leads to every bottle of wine from a type of grape tasting the same.

To be honest, saying that American sparkling wine is practically the same is a bit like saying that Coca Cola is practically the same as Dr Pepper. While they have a lot in common, the two things really do taste different.

One last point, to those of you who think that only Europeans want to protect regional names in wine production. You might want to [rethink](http://www.napavintners.com/about/napa_name_protection.asp) that position.",,coalila,1,1438606357,,t5_2qqjc

We introduced a Bank Levy based on borrowing, to encourage more sensible levels of leverage, and have put it up incrementally.

But the Financial Transaction Tax, a Tobin Tax, is something else entirely, and Sweden has already tried it and it ended up being a disaster.   Where it is meant as a stabilising force it works in the opposite manner and leads to more 'blocky' form of trading which can spook markets.  In the first week of being introduced the Swedish bond trading fell by 85%.
  
    ""Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was 
     much lower than that on equities, the impact on 
     market trading was much more dramatic. During the 
     first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell 
     by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds 
     was only three basis points. The volume of futures 
     trading fell by 98% and the options trading market
     disappeared. Trading in money market securities, 
     which faced a tax as low as 0.2 basis points, fell by 
     20%. This reaction was due in large part to the 
     existence of a wide variety of non-taxed substitutes. 
     Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes 
     returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.""

Not only did the Swedes succeed in wiping out their trades, the trade went to other markets where they cashed in.  So if the EU does want to press ahead with a Financial Transaction Tax the UK with its financial market should move Heaven and Earth to be outside it when they do.  If not here it will just go somewhere else.  We've told them it would be a calamity. The Swedes from experience have told them not to go there.  But this is the EU all over.

Added to that it would hit the UK financial equities market disproportionately hard where we already have introduced our own Bank Levy.  We'd be paying twice for what is effectively now stability in other people's banks.

[""We tried the Tobin Tax and it didn't work.""](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b9b40fee-9236-11e2-851f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3hkyOXIgP)

Not only that but the Swedes found that whatever revenue the tax raised was offset by their own losses in capital gains revenue.

Labour, Lib Dem, as the major parties of the centre left. Leaning more towards Labour these days, though I was broadly supportive of the Lib Dems in coalition. Unfortunately, they pretty much disowned their own record in Government almost before the election, which lost them my support really. They're back into protest party territory now. Labour might be going a similar way, but it'll have a better chance of recovering.

&gt;Whether you consider yourself liberal, conservative, libertarian, statist, Blairite, cultural Marxist, neoreactionary, leftist, rightist, nationalist, Islamist, shitlord, etc, and how you think others see you.

God knows. I'm a centrist really. I'd choose Blairite as I think Blair is remembered unfairly - and that history will remember him better. It's an appropriate term for me as a vaguely centre-left social liberal who believes in foreign interventionism (this includes the Iraq war and the defeated motion on Syria). I find myself siding with Blair or with how I imagine Blair would side - for example I support Kendall in this leadership election.

How do others see me? Leftists seem to think I'm a Tory and want nothing to do with me, Right-wingers seem to think I'm some sort of moderate Tory too. Hm. I've never voted for the Tory party and under Cameron/any potential successor I'm very unlikely to.

&gt;Your views on the individual issues, e.g. the EU, the economy, capitalism/socialism/Communism, euthanasia, war, gun rights, feminism, LGBT (e.g. gay marriage, bakers having to make gay wedding cakes, trans issues), immigration, workplace discrimination laws, minimum/living wage, reverse discrimination, religion/atheism, drug prohibition, direct/local democracy, councils, bin collections, press regulation, online/television censorship, net neutrality, knife laws, rape culture, AGW, free speech, Islamisation of the UK, profiling, speed cameras, Lords reform, the monarchy, Scottish independence, animal rights/welfare (e.g. foxhunting, badger culls, Halal/Kosher slaughter, factory farming), voting age, policing and punishment of criminals, grammar schools, tuition fees, giving prisoners the vote, etc, etc (sorry If I've forgotten anything important here).

Pro-EU Federalist. Capitalism broadly good - should be the default economic model however sometimes choice is not clearly defined and leads to a poorly functioning market e.g utilities and commuter transport (i.e I would renationalize the railways, buses and water/electric companies but leave Royal Mail, British Airways, etc.)

Euthanasia is difficult - I support when the person who's going to be dying can clearly state their intentions but I've no idea where I come on either side of the broad and blurry grey area.

War is bad, but sometimes it's worse than no war, and most of the time you don't know beforehand. Guns are a privilege and not a right. Feminism good - sometimes its representatives can make me cringe. Gay marriage good - though I was disappointed by the court case you refer to as it seemed to me to clearly not be discrimination.

Immigration too high, multiculturalism failed.

Workplace discrimination laws seem unenforceable to me and a bit of a waste of time, but I don't know enough about them to know if that's accurate. I know that at my place of work there are no women, and only two people who aren't white. Broadly in favour of positive discrimination as a temporary measure, but I think it leaves unanswered questions.

Minimum wage is good - George Osborne's not-Living wage was a bit of an insult, though. I think everyone should be paid enough to live on and that a company which is not capable of doing that is a failing company, and should be classed as such.

I'm an atheist, would prefer it if everybody else was too, but I think the first step is to encourage secularization. I don't see any reason for things like tax breaks for religious organizations (not sure if the UK has that, tbh) or an established Church of England.

I think cannabis should be legal and available for sale for recreational use. Anything else I think whatever the evidence suggests will reduce harm to consumers the most should be adopted, which might mean legalizing heroin or it might not.

Against things like direct democracy and localism. Against press regulation. Not sure what online/television censorship refers to, but I'm against weird porn filters and stuff as I think the market already provides a solution. Net neutrality is important. Knife laws are fine, global warming is anthropogenic (that's not really a political view), free speech important (uncomfortable with new extremism laws), Islamization will probably fade away over time. Profiling bad. Speed cameras good.

Lords reform - it depends on what reform. I'd want various ""chosen"" organizations to be given a number of seats to which they appoint one of their experts independently of the government to provide technocratic oversight in a much more formalized way than the current house does, for a fixed, renewable term. That means reduced political membership, no hereditary positions. Organizations that appoint a peer or several should be broad ranging from religious organizations, scientific ones, from the arts world, charities, etc. It should have the same powers it does now (i.e I would not amend the Parliament Acts).

Monarchy is good. I think a constitutional monarchy with an apolitical monarch who enjoys broad public support is the best possible constitutional arrangement. Scotland should be independent if it wants to be and I think it has a right to hold a referendum whenever it chooses, however I don't think it's the option best for Scotland and it would hurt my national identity if they chose to do that (I identify as British over English).

Not too bothered about animal rights while we still live in a world where humans can barely respect each others' rights. I buy free range, but still eat meat. I wouldn't mind seeing the fox hunting ban removed as that was poor legislation that was not worth invoking the Parliament Act for. I'd support a badger cull if I could believe it would work, but I'm yet to be convinced.

Voting age is fine at 18, but reducing to 16 wouldn't be so catastrophic. I don't think it would solve any of the problems that it's supposed to, though. Prison should be for reform not punishment. I would definitely give every prisoner the vote.

&gt;Which issues you're particularly passionate about.

&gt;Why you think what you do (or at least why you think you think what you do).

I'm most interested in what I think could be changed about Britain to make it a better place. I'd like to see a Britain where people participate actively in their democracy through their local party associations and their MPs so that measures like MP recall, direct democracy and proportional representation aren't necessary. 

I'd like to see a Britain where people are paid enough to live on without needing to go to the state, if they're able bodied, working age and without children. A Britain where anybody can, at any time, make the choice to educate themselves as an adult in a chosen skill without having to worry about who will feed the children, and a state that can provide that for free at the point of need, to get British people into skilled jobs that pay more than they could hope to get with whatever qualifications they left school with. I don't think that peoples' poor choices in childhood should hold them back once they've learnt their mistake.

I want to see a Britain where students' circumstances don't force them to work, but they can if they choose to do so. Or they can give their spare time to teaching themselves a skill outside their curriculum, or some other extra-curricular activities that help build them as a person. A Britain where the focus is on the individual student's development, and not just on their future career.

I think this because these are all the sorts of opportunities that I have had or that friends of mine have had, or wish they had, which have/would benefit us greatly, and I think they should be available to everybody.

&gt;What you see for the future of the UK politically.

Tory win in 2020 with increased majority, under Theresa May. Labour have nothing much more to offer in the 2020 Parliament than they did in the 2015 one, which won't be much. We remain in the EU and committed to ever closer union, but the general feeling will be that we're still going to leave before the EU becomes a country in its own right.

&gt;How, if at all, your views have changed over the years.

Not sure if they have much. I've always found that what I believe is somewhere in the centre ground. Details change.

&gt;Your favourite and least favourite politicians, commentators, political sites, blogs, forums, TV channels, etc.

Favourite is Blair - obviously. Least favourite? Probably Chris Bryant. The man is a disaster. I also don't like Owen Jones or that Guido Fawkes site. Don't like George Osborne. I like Michael Gove.

&gt;Any results of online political tests, political compasses etc that you want to share with us.

Those things are terrible and should always be disregarded.

&gt;Why you're posting about politics on Reddit. It's not going to achieve any political change. So do you enjoy it? Is it a form of masochism? A bit of both? Do you see it as a way of ""testing"" your arguments to see if they're rational?

Yeah it's fun to bounce ideas off people. Sometimes I end up changing my view as a result of posting here. I come here to learn and to make ""friends"" (as far as it goes on here) with people in a totally different environment to normal. For example I don't tend to discuss politics with work colleagues, and friends aren't usually that interested or informed. I also come here to debate points that I don't actually agree with, as a means of experimenting and deciding whether I *should* agree with them.

* **The United Kingdom, in practice, does not have control over the firing of Trident.**

In 2006, the [Select Committee on Defence](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/986/986we13.htm) found that Trident, realistically, would never be fired without US approval.

* **There is no credible and economically viable alternative to Trident - Trident costs £2bn/yr to maintain, for a total cost of £100bn.**

The [Trident Alternatives Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212745/20130716_Trident_Alternatives_Study.pdf) found that any alternative to Trident will either incur a massively disproportionate cost (e.g switching to SSBN weapons), or will cripple the effectiveness of the Trident program in the first place (e.g reducing to 3 submarines). This is due to the heavily streamlined process of manufacturing Trident warheads.

* **The biggest threat to the UK in the modern era is non-state actors through asymmetric warfare.**

Nuclear weapons are completely ineffective against insurgency. [Mr David Cameron](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61936/national-security-strategy.pdf) said as much in 2010.

* **The actual use of Trident would be illegal under international law, and would make the UK an international pariah.**

The design of nuclear weapons [inherently and disproportionately targets civilians and infrastructure](http://www.cnduk.org/information/briefings/trident-briefings/item/96-trident-and-international-law) - they are 'blind' weapons. The Geneva Convention states:

&gt;‘the civilian population shall not be the object of attack’ and prohibits ‘methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment’.

Beyond this, the use of nuclear weapons is, in essence, 'punishing' civilians for the actions of their leaders. As you might be aware, [civilians do not necessary agree with the actions of their leaders.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAjqGnQpVks).

* **Nuclear weapons are used and guided by humans - and as such contain inherent and lethal flaws.**

Please educate yourself about the following 'near miss' incidents, and appreciate how close we came to earthly annihilation because of simply human and machine error.

['These missile attack warnings were correctly identified as a false alarm by Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. This decision is seen as having prevented an erroneous data for decision about retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies, which would have **likely resulted in nuclear war and the potential deaths of millions of people** ...'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident)

[(During the Cuban Missile Crisis) 'Typically, Russian submarines that were armed with the ""Special Weapon"" only required the captain to get authorization from the political officer if he felt it was necessary to launch the nuclear torpedo, but due to Arkhipov's position as flotilla commander, the B-59's captain was also required to gain Arkhipov's approval. An argument broke out among the three, in which **only Arkhipov was against the launch**...'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov)

['""**one simple, dynamo-technology, low voltage switch stood between the United States and a major catastrophe**,"" ... ""The MK 39 Mod 2 bomb did not possess adequate safety for the airborne alert role in the B-52...""'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash)

['The realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with deteriorating relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a ruse of war, obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear first strike. In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in East Germany and Poland on alert ... **The 1983 exercise is considered by many historians to be one of the closest times the world has come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962**...'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer_83)

['Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert, and the nuclear weapons command suitcase was brought to Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who then had to decide whether or not to **launch a retaliatory nuclear strike against the United States** ... Yeltsin activated his ""nuclear keys"" for the first time...'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_rocket_incident)

* **Nuclear weapons are unsafe, pt 2: We can't be trusted to look after our own WMDs**

Trident whistleblower described the project as ['a disaster waiting to happen'.](https://wikileaks.org/trident-safety/)

&gt;There have been suicides onboard, and on an A-boat we had a shooter kill his own work colleagues. There were some people that I served with on that patrol, who showed clear psychopathic tendencies. The odds favour destruction, if no action is taking.

* **The concept of MAD is flawed - wars are not averted, merely relocated.**

MAD is considered [by political scientists](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/uploads/Rauchhaus_Evaluating_the_Nuclear_Peace.pdf) to have a effect at deterring direct war between two nuclear powers, but exacerbating the likelihood of proxy wars - paradoxically, the loss of life can even increase due to the ferocity and brutality of proxy wars. This is called the [Stability-Instability paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability%E2%80%93instability_paradox).

* **The Trident program accounts for less than 1% of the nuclear warheads on Earth.**

Trident makes up some [225 out of 16,300 warheads](http://thebulletin.org/2014/september/worldwide-deployments-nuclear-weapons-20147595). Scientists call this a 'drop in the ocean'.

***

So let's summarise. We don't have control of Trident. It costs a ludicrous amount of money. It's dangerous, both inherently and because we can't be trusted to keep weapons of mass destruction under proper security. We would never realistically use it. It doesn't actually deter other nuclear states from war - it might actually make the situation worse. We have nobody to use it against. Using it would mean the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians, as an 'i told you so' against the government of the country being bombed. And let's not forget [the problem of salami tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_d_vMKswE).

However they've always given me kind of the same feeling as standing on the edge of a really high building, or on the ledge of a train station with the intercity speeding by. Being so close to a situation/item/place with so much danger potential makes me a bit nervous. I like the feeling of standing on the edge (adrenaline baby!), but get down as quickly as possible.

/Just sayin'.

&gt; You **literally** said that Jews prove stereotypes true by wanting **too much** money in reparations from the holocaust.

You are LITERALLY putting words in my mouth.

[From the Forward article I cited:](http://forward.com/news/1259/thousands-of-romani-survivors-destitute-after-repa/)

&gt;The $34 million that went to the Romani survivors is a tiny fraction of more than **$60 billion** that European governments and business have designated for Holocaust restitution and reparations since World War II. The largest chunk of the money — some $17 billion — was given by Germany to the Israeli government.

How much is (or would be) ""too much"", in your estimation? 

On an individual basis, did the Romani victims (and survivors) suffer any *less* than the Jewish victims? Is the disparity in compensation between the various groups not egregious? Does it not seem just a tad selfish and hypocritical that ONE group of victims grabbed the lion's share in compensation, and did little or nothing to work for justice for victims who were not members of that group?

&gt; You are an antisemite

That slur has been so overused that it has lost all meaning.

Labour and Greens to an extent.

&gt; Whether you consider yourself liberal, conservative, libertarian, statist, Blairite, cultural Marxist, neoreactionary, leftist, rightist, nationalist, Islamist, shitlord, etc, and how you think others see you.

I'm socialist.

&gt; Your views on the individual issues, e.g. the EU, the economy, capitalism/socialism/Communism, euthanasia, war, gun rights, feminism, LGBT (e.g. gay marriage, bakers having to make gay wedding cakes, trans issues), immigration, workplace discrimination laws, minimum/living wage, reverse discrimination, religion/atheism, drug prohibition, direct/local democracy, councils, bin collections, press regulation, online/television censorship, net neutrality, knife laws, rape culture, AGW, free speech, Islamisation of the UK, profiling, speed cameras, Lords reform, the monarchy, Scottish independence, animal rights/welfare (e.g. foxhunting, badger culls, Halal/Kosher slaughter, factory farming), voting age, policing and punishment of criminals, grammar schools, tuition fees, giving prisoners the vote, etc, etc (sorry If I've forgotten anything important here).

EU: I don't know, I used to be against, then I was in favour, now I'm leaning against again.

The economy, capitalism/socialism/communism: Marx was right.

Euthanasia: It's fine with informed consent.

War: Unless it's a revolutionary one, bad. :3

Gun rights: I have no idea. I'm very conflicted on this issue.

Feminism: Still relevant, but very misunderstood.

LGBT issues: I long for a society where gay marriage is just called ""marriage.""

Immigration: Again, very conflicted and unsure.

Workplace discrimination laws: Fine in reasonable amounts.

Minimum/living wage: Should be much higher.

Reverse discrimination: It happens, it's not as prevalent as some would make out.

Religion/atheism: I'm an apatheist, I don't believe in granting religion special rights. I don't care if you choose to worship le magic sky fairy, for I am euphoric by myself.

Drug prohibition: At least soft drugs should be legalised.

Direct/local democracy: A mixture of both is good for now.

Press regulation: The free press isn't great, something needs to be done.

Censorship: Won't somebody think of the children!!???

Islamisation of the UK: If it is happening, which I doubt, it would be a bad thing.


&gt; Which issues you're particularly passionate about

Socialism and implementation of it, rural affairs. I hate injustice and ingrained privilege.

&gt; Why you think what you do (or at least why you think you think what you do)

I like to think I've made an informed opinion. I want a society that maximises human happiness, scientific output, and cultural output. I do not believe our current system can or will do that. 

&gt; What you see for the future of the UK politically

 Bleakness and misery.

&gt; How, if at all, your views have changed over the years

 I was a Conservative for a long time but began to read more leftist writings and gradually abandoned my beliefs.

&gt; Any results of online political tests, political compasses etc that you want to share with us

 See my flair.

The United States provides this service at an **enormous** discount to the rest of the world. We protect basically all world shipping including shipping un-related to transactions between any US or US linked interests.

This is unprecedented in modern history.

2) All of the wars which *do not happen* because the US acts a stabilizing force.

There are no shortage of nations which are basically at each other's throats. It just so happens that in many cases the United States is aligned / has close diplomatic ties with *both* of them.

Across most of the world wars as we used to conceive of them basically do not happen. Since the rise of the US as a superpower the world has experienced its longest and most substantial peace in human history.

And that in no small part relates to the fact that the United States is willing to step in between countries like Greece and Turkey and say **no**. When Europe is basically incapable of developing a unified foreign policy stance on, well just about anything.

I'm not suggesting that the United States goes out and feeds all of the hungry.

But as the most powerful coherent force (in economic, political, and military terms) in the modern world. It's ridiculous to suggest that the current modern order is not heavily shaped by US.

&gt; Era impossível entender aquilo de outra forma se não ameaça contra a minha vida. Ameaçar o ciclista com o carro é infração gravíssima e ela seria suspensa de dirigir, teria o carro e CNH apreendidos como prevê o artigo 170: “Dirigir ameaçando os pedestres que estejam atravessando a via pública, ou os demais veículos: Infração – gravíssima; Penalidade – multa e suspensão do direito de dirigir; Medida administrativa – retenção do veículo e recolhimento do documento de habilitação”. Eu denunciaria Elaine naquela hora e por isso coloquei minha bicicleta na frente do seu carro e o mesmo fez meu companheiro, com o intuito de restringi-la naquele espaço para que ela não fugisse da minha denúncia. No mesmo momento ela deu duas aceleradas, batendo a dianteira do carro na minha coxa, e quando ela acelerou fazendo o motor roncar, eu larguei a bicicleta e coloquei as mãos abertas sobre em seu capô, pedindo que parasse, na tentativa de fazê-la ficar ali. Thiago repetia: “Você vai matá-la? É isso?”. Até então eu achava que nunca aconteceria comigo um carro avançar com meu corpo vivo e em pé na frente.
Ela arrancou e eu subi em seu capô, por reflexo, por ser uma atitude mais rápida que sair da frente do carro e por acreditar que assim ela não teria coragem de ir embora. Mas não. Elaine me carregou em seu capô por muitos metros enquanto meu companheiro e muitos transeuntes gritavam “Pare o carro, você vai matá-la!”. Eu achei que fosse morrer, que não havia como descer dali sem me machucar ou perder a vida. Eu berrava que ela parasse o carro. Eu estava com o rosto no vidro, de frente para o rosto dela, e ela continuou dirigindo comigo ali, me olhando. Ela parou o veículo quando viu que outros carros estavam parados no sinal vermelho da Andradas com a rua Pacífico Mascarenhas. Quando ela parou meu companheiro abriu a porta do Palio, desligou o carro e arrancou a chave. Elaine saiu do carro e só o que eu conseguia dizer era “Você acabou de tentar matar dois ciclistas?”. Eu já tinha aprendido um pouco sobre o que era ódio, mas naquela hora a ficha caiu sobre como a sociedade tem produzido pessoas destrutivas, indiferentes, de humanidade precarizada. Ela desceu do carro dizendo: “Você tem sorte porque aqui o movimento é grande. Se estivesse vazio você sabe que seria bem pior!” e “Se você fizer B.O. eu vou pegar seu endereço. Você não fica esperta não pra você ver...”. Muito outros ciclistas e transeuntes se aproximaram. Um colega de Thiago, que havia acompanhado todo o episódio, se prontificou a ser nossa testemunha. A Guarda Municipal aparentemente estava próxima do local e no mesmo momento dois guardas municipais chegaram para intervir e ouviram todas as ameaças. Eu consegui gravar algumas delas. Os guardas municipais acionaram a Polícia Militar e fomos para a calçada do Boulevard Shopping aguardar a viatura que viria. Um dos GM disse que ela teria que ser detida imediatamente pelas ameaças e tentativa de homicídio, mas só a Polícia poderia fazer isso. Elaine estacionou o carro e ficou do lado de fora. Quando a polícia chegou, cerca de duas horas depois, os policiais informaram que iríamos para um DP no bairro Vera Cruz. Até aquele momento alguns amigos chegaram de bicicleta e um deles levou nossas bicis destruídas – a minha principalmente – para casa. Fomos de viatura, Thiago e eu, para o DP. Elaine iria em outra viatura. Quando chegamos, o departamento estava vazio e logo depois chegou Elaine, algemada (!!!), vermelha, suada, sendo conduzida violentamente para um canto da recepção. O sargento nos disse que ela havia resistido a entrar na viatura, eles se debateram, então ela foi algemada e levada a força. 

&gt; Durante toda a madrugada Elaine esteve algemada. Uma equipe da Record chegou ao local e eu tentei fazer com que toda a minha fala fosse pautada no fato, mas com viés didático sobre como é importante que motoristas respeitem quem utiliza a bicicleta. O mesmo repórter seguiu Josislene, quem ele achava que fosse a motorista, e a seguiu até o lado de fora com a câmera em cima dela, ainda que ela se recusasse a responder perguntas como “Por que você quis atropelar os ciclistas?"". A reportagem finalizada não foi mentirosa, mas as minhas falas “educativas”, cortadas, com o objetivo de tornar tudo espetaculoso. 

&gt; Elaine mentiu em seu relato, óbvio. As 3h fomos orientados a seguir para uma delegacia no Barreiro, onde ficamos até as 5h. Lá o delegado nos informou que ela deveria ser presa em flagrante por 4 crimes: ameaça, dano material, desacato e resistência. E o flagrante aconteceria porque a soma da pena destes crimes seria maior que 2 anos. Se seguíssemos com este objetivo, isso aconteceria só quando a equipe das 7h chegasse, porque ele não poderia fazer mais flagrantes naquela madrugada (?). Depois de ouvir os 7 envolvidos, ele disse que sairíamos de lá entre 10h e 11h. Estávamos com fome e frio e tínhamos compromissos para esta manhã, por isso não prosseguimos naquela manhã, mas o faremos nesta terça-feira.

&gt; Não hoje, mas na segunda-feira continuaremos a prosseguir com a representação contra a motorista para que ela perca o direito de dirigir e arque com os danos nas bicicletas caso ela possa. Não achamos que possamos escolher o que exatamente vá acontecer com ela, mas não gostaríamos de vê-la presa. Ela tem que pagar pelos crimes que cometeu, isso é fato e não a queremos impune. Porém, nosso discurso é antiprisional e se pudéssemos escolher as penalidades imediatas, gostaríamos de vê-la longe da condução de um carro. Eu quero imaginar que a motorista, que um dia tentou me matar, seja uma ciclista. Meu desejo é que a pena dela seja andar de bicicleta, ensinar motoristas sobre como se portar no trânsito, levar seus filhos para pedalar e que ela idealize todas as melhores psicológicas possíveis. Desejos que são meus e de Thiago, mas que representam ciclistas, que são recebidos no espaço público com hostilidade. Que representam toda a resistência a cultura carrocêntrica, doente, compulsória, uma resistência pessoal e política que cause rupturas suficientes para que nunca mais vejamos ciclistas serem carregadas em capôs de carros dirigidos por pessoas tão perdidas quanto nós mesm@s.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ",ArlindoPereira,1,1438613582,RJ,t5_2qh9i

There are differences in terminology between Australia as a country, Australia as a continent, Australasia and Oceania. This is because officially a continent has to be a continous land mass which is why there are alternative views considering North and South America the same continent and Europe and Asia the same continent, Eurasia.

The continent of Australia is considered on different circumstances. For example East Timor is a country in Asia yet is considered part of the Australian continent purely based on the fact it is on the same plate as Australia, and so does not follow any of the criteria which other continents follow. But the continent that East Timor is part of is certainly Asia. It is just on the same plate as Australia

There are 14 different countries in the region and too many islands for it to be a continuous land mass. But each individual country/island  isn't their own seperate continent.
It is similar to how you can consider Madagascar not part of the continent of Africa because it is not part of the same land mass. However it is considered part of Africa because common sense, it is in the same region and seperated from mainland  Africa. Similar to how New Zealand seperated from mainland Australia.

There are differences in the terminology but the 14 sovereign states are not part of any of the other 5 or 6 continents and there is not 8, 9 or 10 continents and so the 14 countries(which are too many name)are associated with each other and if the terminology was properly defined would be considered the same continent.

1) Capcom is a good developer. They are pretty good witg what they do, and given their experimenting with previous games (most notably Tri's water combat) and truly seem to expand on the errors of previous games. Like with Aerial style. Maybe they are adding in less ledges, increase jump tolerance to that of a normal status effect, making aerial the only reliable way to mount, but not every 3 jumps at max resistance. 

2) they seem to have a system. Like with Tri and 4. They release the normal version in japan, maybe EU and US. It doesnt have G Rank, and doesnt have as many monsters. They then sit back, watch how people do with what they are given, and balance it for the next 'G' installment(Ultimate for us) where they include more monsters and more levels of difficulty. 

3) Japan is the first release. Which REALLY should be the big comforting factor. Before we even grt our hands in it, they have a real great chance to see if anything is largely broken. Because as much as i hate to admit it, Japanese players are just THAT much better. Because of their culture (which basically says 'be the best or else') if anyone was to find a real easy way to break the game, it'd be them. And even if they have no desire to releease a G or Ult installment, the glorious abilities of patching can still fix all that.

False,1,europe,ctpys5h,,t3_3flpks,1440254767,t1_ctpycxl,0,0,"&gt;I will have to disagree with that part with passion. IF EU/EZ doesnt make some kind of example out of UK if it leaves(or any other who leaves first) then other non-EZ nations will not have any fear about leaving EU and that would result in a series of nations to leave EU. 

That might have made sense 200 years ago, but it is absurd and harmful now.. Probably more importantly I'm willing to bet it would do exactly the opposite of what you suggest, it would make countries more likely to leave, less likely to join and sew distrust..

And again, the UK shouldn't be part of a union on that basis (essentially if that threat is made, I would bet it'll make people in the UK keener to be out..).

&gt;If UK will have hard time negotiating with EU after leaving EU then other smaller nations will not leave and only try to change EU from inside and that is what pro-EU people want.

The UK would rather try to change the EU from the inside out, the issue at the moment is that the wider EU seems disinterested.. I'm not sure that the UK government has done enough, but its in a bit of a catch 22 situation, you can hardly (although people are going to try..) to sell the notion of remaining in the EU on the basis that it might change enough to be palatable, if people don't think it is now.. 

&gt;I would love to see UK follow that logic if/when Scotland leaves UK :) sure there would not be any ""punishment"", right?

I doubt it, it'd be pretty counter-productive. I'd point out that the UK (Westminster government at least) could just have not granted a referendum - that seems to be the approach in other countries with areas that want independence. It did, and it would have respected a result either way. I don't think it would then try to harm a fledgling state on its northern border...

&gt;IF UK leaves I think that residence permits etc. will be valuable negotiation point for politicians especially when lot of UK´s ""shitty jobs"" are done by immigrants/foreign labor.

I would be willing to bet we'd end up with a visa waiver system, less automatic access to the job market on arrival, but access to everything if you have work in the UK and that this would be bilateral. I seriously can't see anything less working.

&gt; If EU decided that anyone travelling into EU needs to have permit/visa that would hamper UK´s business pretty hard while EU is big enough to handle the problem without too much problems.

Yes.. but again, it'd be a bit of a pointless exercise and would do damage in both directions with no gain. So why bother?

&gt;UK would be in serious shortage of workers soon(in 1-2 years time) and EU would have lots of extra workers that could be hired for other projects inside EU(with shittier pay of course).

If the UK decided it needed more immigration it would have almost no problem in supporting that from the commonwealth and the US... Lets face it, there are more skilled migrants out there who want to come to the UK than can currently get a visa (for non EU citizens..).

False,5,europe,ctpyx22,,t3_3fk3zp,1440254832,t1_ctptd4t,0,0,"Even if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination and goes onto win the presidential election, I'd say that Merkel may still be the most powerful woman in the world. 

Look at it this way: Merkel is not just the leader of Germany, but the whole European Union. (Although, by the time Clinton potentially becomes president, The European institutions themselves may have overtaken that role). The European Union itself is actually more powerful than the United States. The EU has a larger GDP (EU: $18.5 trillion. USA: $17.4 trillion) and a larger population (EU: 500 million. USA: 320 million). And yes, whilst the EU economy generally at the moment is sluggish, the EU also has much more potential for sudden and huge economic growth in the Eastern and Southern member states once the crisis is resolved. The only area where the USA is unquestionably a more powerful entity in terms of overall assets is in military might. However, military might by itself is not very useful on modern international relations. Economic might is the determiner, and even then the EU already has not one, but two independent nuclear deterrents and, collectively, would be the second highest military spending bloc in the world, after only the USA. So Merkel as the leader of all this would certainly be a rival to a US president in terms of the power their blocs preside over. 

The second thing to look at is the restraints upon the power of Merkel in her role as leader of the EU and the restraints which would be upon Hilary Clinton as president. Within Merkel's own country she is virtually unrestrained, as her party alone has almost an overall majority and also is in coalition with the Social Democratic Party which makes her control about 3 quarters of the Parliament. So within Germany she's virtually unrestrained which is power she can then project outwards across Europe to instigate reform. The support Merkel has from like minded governments around Europe further solidify her position: The European Commission is held by a member of the European People's Party (Junker), which is the Euro group that Merkel's Christian Democratic Party belongs to, as does the European Council (Tusk). Even the European Parliament is held by a Social Democrat *from Germany* (Schulz). So the European institutions are definitely on the same ideological wave length as Merkel. So are virtually all the major member states: the UK is slightly to the right, France is slightly to the left. The only country which is an outlier is Greece. The restraints that there would be on Hilary Clinton? Let's not forget that her husband, Bill Clinton, tried to push through the relatively modest proposal to further healthcare across America never even made it to the floor of Congress (their equivalent of Parliament) despite Bill Clinton being a very popular two term president. What's more, even Clinton's own party, the Democrats, have refused toe the party line on things like the Pacific Partnership (a version of TTIP but for Asia-America), and that's without even considering the Republicans who will likely continue to control at least one house of Congress, who have consistently undermined Obama's position on things like the Iranian nuclear crisis by sending letters to the Iranian government that they will not support *any* treaty with Iran. 

TL;DR/Conclusion: So the bloc that Merkel presides over is more powerful in many ways than the US bloc in terms of both population and economic size (which is what matters), although the USA is still obviously more powerful in the military area. However, the restraints upon Merkel are considerably fewer than the restraints that would be on a potential president Clinton. Merkel has complete dominance over domestic politics, and is surrounded in Europe by like minded politicians, both in other countries and in the European institutions. However Clinton is unlikely to be able to dominate politics in Congress, and will probably not even be able to rely on the support of her own party.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just wanted to quickly share somewhere my progress because this morning a friend of mine sent me a photo of me at a party 3 years ago (firstly why the hell was I wearing stripper stockings and secondly you will see this as my 'before' photo on the left of my picture) and I realised how far ive actually come and to just get some things off my chest. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Brief history, I was always the 'fat friend' in high school. I was never depressed about it, but it would get to me when they were all getting boyfriends and I wasn't or we'd go clothes shopping and I could never get what they were. 
&gt;
&gt;Growing up my mum and I lived with her dad (my grandpa), and he would tell me all the time how big I was or how I ""took after my mother"" since everyone else in my family is fit and almost stick thin.
&gt;
&gt;I remember when I was younger wearing jeans and a jumper outside in 45 degree Celsius (Australian summers) heat just because I was too worried about him seeing me in a bikini or shorts incase he told me I needed to lose weight again.
&gt;Anyway, my grandpa wasn't a bad man. He loved me he just wasn't the type to show it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The turning point was when I came back from traveling overseas to The UK, Europe and America around this time in 2013 and none of my clothes fit I had gained so much weight and that was the first thing everyone said to me. 
&gt;I was my heaviest at around 86kilos. (189.5 pounds according to Google).
&gt;
&gt;I hit the gym, and I love it. I used to do cardio, to drop the initial fat quickly but I haven't done it for around a year now. I only lift weights. 
&gt;
&gt;I don't have a vast knowledge on technical things like calories or surplus's or what I should train and when or anything, but I do know the basics about what I should eat and when, no starving myself, etc. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm still not as lean as I want to be, I want to drop more fat but I don't want to be skinny. I want a big butt, I want something left to cuddle, I want to be fit. 
&gt;I know it isn't a massive change but I feel so much different. 
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just wanted to quickly share somewhere my progress because this morning a friend of mine sent me a photo of me at a party 3 years ago (firstly why the hell was I wearing stripper stockings and secondly you will see this as my 'before' photo on the left of my picture) and I realised how far ive actually come and to just get some things off my chest. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Brief history, I was always the 'fat friend' in high school. I was never depressed about it, but it would get to me when they were all getting boyfriends and I wasn't or we'd go clothes shopping and I could never get what they were. 
&gt;
&gt;Growing up my mum and I lived with her dad (my grandpa), and he would tell me all the time how big I was or how I ""took after my mother"" since everyone else in my family is fit and almost stick thin.
&gt;
&gt;I remember when I was younger wearing jeans and a jumper outside in 45 degree Celsius (Australian summers) heat just because I was too worried about him seeing me in a bikini or shorts incase he told me I needed to lose weight again.
&gt;Anyway, my grandpa wasn't a bad man. He loved me he just wasn't the type to show it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The turning point was when I came back from traveling overseas to The UK, Europe and America around this time in 2013 and none of my clothes fit I had gained so much weight and that was the first thing everyone said to me. 
&gt;I was my heaviest at around 86kilos. (189.5 pounds according to Google).
&gt;
&gt;I hit the gym, and I love it. I used to do cardio, to drop the initial fat quickly but I haven't done it for around a year now. I only lift weights. 
&gt;
&gt;I don't have a vast knowledge on technical things like calories or surplus's or what I should train and when or anything, but I do know the basics about what I should eat and when, no starving myself, etc. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm still not as lean as I want to be, I want to drop more fat but I don't want to be skinny. I want a big butt, I want something left to cuddle, I want to be fit. 
&gt;I know it isn't a massive change but I feel so much different. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, thanks for listening if you did.

Some things you might want to consider: Do you enjoy world PvP in other games? If not, roll on a PvE server. If you don't know what world PvP is, roll on a PvE server. I'm sure one of the reddit guilds will be on one.

I recommend hunter or warlock for first time levellers. It means you can only DPS, but DPS is the simplest role, and if you're a class that can take on other roles, people might pressure you to do so even if you're not comfortable with it. Other pure DPS classes are Mages and Rogues. Mages are squishy and rogues can be kind of difficult to learn imo.

Whatever you pick, when you get to level 10, you have a choice of 3 specs. Read the text about each spec to see which you think sounds interesting. Then go to icy veins and review this every 5 or 10 levels to make sure you are playing close to properly (at first you won't have very many of the spells described on icy veins). This won't matter much until you get to level 90 or so, but the sooner you get into the habit of playing well, the less likely you'll end up confused about what you're doing wrong.

Start at level 1 (don't play a DK), take your time levelling slowly, read quest text, finish chains even if you outlevel them. You'll enjoy the game more if you know what's going on.

&gt;23 - Zakarin was on a lot of RFL bets for Tour of Poland, yet he must be one of the leaders of /r/peloton’s suspicion index (yes, I’m referencing this). Are people going to lose their minds (again) if he does well on Vuelta?

Of course, his doping is so blatant he makes Chris Horner look almost believable. If he does well at the Vuelta, people will start losing their minds but if there will be nighttime testing as it's been reported i doubt he will performs as well as in the Tour de Romandie

Anyway, it's a shame those reports aren't released anymore. Most of the guys above 5 ended having a positive.  

&gt;34 - The one time I really bought what twitter critics were saying was when this happened which was followed by claims that there's no money in Asia to correctly test for doping. Nobody will really care, but we have a problem here.

There's definitely a problem there, both the Iranian teams probably have a tema program but get away with it given that the testing at the races they usually win is non existent. If they rode in Europe they'd either start having mediocre results or be caught at their first race.

&gt;40 - And finally, what are your concerns and suspicions?

I don't believe sudden improvements in performance, i think they are almost impossible to achieve without doping.

&gt;Will water be forced in fast enough under a pumping stress to assure a continuing water supply? Some rock, such as clay or solid granite, may have only a few hairline cracks through which water can move. Obviously, such rocks transmit only small quantities of water and are poor aquifers. By comparison, rocks such as fractured sandstones and cavernous limestone have large connected openings that permit water to move more freely; such rocks transmit larger quantities of water and are good aquifers. The amounts of water that an aquifer will yield to a well may range from a few hundred gallons a day to as much as several million gallons a day.

If we look at e.g. The Netherlands, people know what they want. We have more than 10 parties (instead of 2 in Taiwan, even though there are more but its mainly 2) and they choose what they think whats the best for them. Instead of being emotional and choosing the same over and over again, they choose which has the better plan to solve the problems. There are also less drama and pointing fingers like in Taiwan. Like this incident you see immediately one party pointing finger to another. When the students in NL were protesting NOT A SINGLE PARTY were pointing fingers to the party that made the plans. 

&gt;If discourse is ""too free"" and ""too much drama"" for you, then perhaps a ""not free"" and a ""boring"" authoritarian nation that jails teenagers like Singapore or China does be more suitable for you. 

&amp;nbsp;


Have you seen what happened to France? Again, way too free (and even less drama than Taiwan) and the country got screwed way too hard. The former president stepped down and the new one, whom people thought he was the best choice because of the 'wonderful' ideas causing the elites leaving the country, leaving 'plebs' behind. How? Because he went full 'your wishes are my plans' mode and this is what France looks like right now.

&amp;nbsp;

This is how emotional tw students are. I saw what happened during the negotiation and the arguments are pretty personal(we have a lot of pressure) and what happened during the negotiation were really emotional too. Not saying its bad, but when its too much, you cant accept everything thats said. What did they really expect during the negotiation? You cant be kidding me that you will succeed like that.


&amp;nbsp;

""Too much drama"" and ""too free"" is not democracy anymore, its dictating for the bottom led by people who want influence into the politics making things way complicated than it looks like(kuch kuch mr cheng). Democracy isnt like that. Ever seen how european countries deal with problems? We wont invade the parlement, we wont curse the politicians, we wont hurt the police and when they try to stop us we wont broadcasting it to display how 'bad' they are, because its their job to do it. Nice democracy.

It would make the relationship between the EU and members change from one where it was about mutual consent and voluntary association to one that was distinctly not. The idea of being forced to hand over sovereignty to a super-national entity is very different from handing it voluntarily and being able to get it back.

&gt;UK has hard time to change EU from inside if it doesnt join on any major EU thing that happen, bailouts etc.

The UK is part of lots of things that the EU does, just not the Eurozone (because it isn't in the UK's interests..) or Schengen (because it's an island..). Claiming it should jump on to things like bail out funds for the Eurozone is a bit odd.

&gt;If UK would have been more co-operative and not looked of exemptions for everything other EU-nations would have listened it more but not UK is seen just a angry kid who jumps up-and-down and threatens to leave when it doesnt get what it wants.

This has to be the most stupid reading of the situation I have come across. Do you think the UK should not act in it's interests? Should not do what it's people want? Do Irish and Danish opt outs also mean they aren't playing nice? When countries negotiate, it is always in balance with other countries interests, opt-outs are a way to compromise on needs not petulance. 

&gt;For political reasons my dear political reasons. No politician wants to admit that he/she made a good deal for their negotiation partner and not for his/her own people. I think that there would be enough ""make their leave hurt""-people in EU to make politicians wary about making UK-profiting deal.(At least publicly)

Yes, politics comes into this, of course it does. But it doesn't explain it.. If people in the EU seriously believe that people who want to leave should be hurt, their economies damaged, their citizens harmed and impoverished - not because that is a consequence of leaving, but as a punishment directed by the remainder... then fuck the EU and everything it stands for. 

Now personally I don't think the EU would act in this way, but frankly if it did, or appeared to do so it simply won't last. The UK will still leave and I would predict that others would follow.

&gt;I think that UK would have been a dick if Scotland leave. 

I seriously dount it..

&gt;For sure UK would have made proposals etc. that would have tried to prevent Scotland from developing any stronger.(Less competition the better-thinking)

Again, I don't think so. It would have been incredibly counter-productive. The UK and Scottish economies are incredibly integrated, it would hurt the UK and that at the end of the day, is pretty pointless.


&gt;AND that is sure for all the other nations in the world, I cant think that UK´s own benefit would not have been UK`s priority when negotiating with independent-Scotland.

Of course it would, and the EU's own benefit would be the priority in EU/UK negotiations too. But there is no point in being petty or damaging yourself to get back at another country..

&gt;I think that would be the result but it would hinder EU-citizens working possibilities in UK and that would lead in to less work-based immigration. That could could UK´s ""good jobs"" as they would run out of skilled foreign labor from EU if they didnt rise the salaries.

Again, I don't think the UK would have issues attracting immigrants as and when it needed them. It wouldn't be as neat as free movement of people within the EU, but it's perfectly possible.  

&gt;Also the worker shortage could be solved with visas etc. but that would shut UK out of EU-free trade/movement area and that would basicly just prevent UK from grabbing all of the best people from EU and that is what Germany and France want. They want to have those talented people even if UK would suffer because of it.

Again, there is a lot of talent in the US, Canada, Australia, India, China and so on that currently can't easily get into the UK. If there is a serious issue, the UK would be able to solve that particular issue. It would be far from catastrophic. It would of course be incredibly amusing to watch those on the right of politics in the UK explain why we need to do it (after years of arguing against) but hey.  Again, it wouldn't be catastrophic, it'd be different.

One thing I will say is that this discussion really highlights something for me in terms of the aggression and anger some people seem to harbour about the possibility of a country leaving the EU and frankly it makes me really uncomfortable about the direction the EU is taking and the future it may have. If the position you present is really one that the EU would display toward the UK within a campaign against the UK leaving, It would have a disastrous impact on the result... I wouldn't vote to be part of an EU that is petty, aggressive, angry and self-destructive, nor one that sees an act of self determination as treason...",Northern Ireland,marsman,1,1438620370,NORN,t5_2qh4j
