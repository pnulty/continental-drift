0120 From the live topic of reddit :     Earlier today CNNTürk reported that police were providing NYE security by going under cover dressed as Santa Claus.https://t.co/n0hMCKvMZt

Confusion between a shooter and a cop ? Shooter disguised as a cop ? We don't know yet at all; but apparently odds are the shooter wasn't a cop but isis by now (0251).

Regardless; the whole incident is likely a terror attack.

hearthbreaking incident; i hope they will find/catch the culprits

0126 some people seem to think they heard allahu acbkar; but no way to be sure. that would find 

0133 the turks are now saying there was possibly a single attacker

0146 part of the reasons the death toll is high is because it was a nightclub completely full (700+ people reportedly) and somebody went in and opened fire straight on everyone

no claims that i know about yet, but the modus operandi fits with daesh once again

At that point I'm starting to think the jihadis can't support people being happy so they try to kill everyone that is using religious excuses for their jalousy/hypocrisy/frustration

0216 turkish media gag order reported regarding this attack; from the PM's office; except on relaying official statements

0307 there are rumors the attacker(s?) spoke arabic

0325 RT.com (the kremlin news outftit) now suggest the attack was suspected earlier :

&gt; The owner of the Reina’s nightclub, Mehmet Koçarslan, has claimed that the club had been warned  about a possible attack, and that the information came from US intelligence services. Security measures had been taken, he added.

---

&gt;* KINSHASA: DR Congo opposition parties and the government reached agreement Saturday on a deal to defuse a political crisis over President Joseph Kabilas fate that has caused months of deadly unrest, a church mediator and officials said.

&gt;* Kabilas second and final mandate ended on December 20 with no sign of him stepping down and no election in sight, spurring the church to launch negotiations to avert more violence in Democratic Republic of Congo.

&gt;* The Catholic Church, which plays a key role in the vast central African country of some 70 million people, launched the negotiations on December 8 and had initially hoped to see a deal before Christmas.

&gt;* Voters in DR Congo were originally to have chosen a new president this year, but the authorities said the electoral registers must be revised, a huge enterprise in a country almost the size of Europe.

&gt;* Sixteen representatives met on Saturday, comprising eight from the opposition coalition, called Rassemblement (Gathering), and eight from the government and groups which had signed a deal with the regime in October.

It was illegal for slaves to own any property without the permission of the slave owner, as exemplified by [Section 56 of the 1833 Alabama Slave Code](http://www.archives.alabama.gov/cornerstone/slavecode1833/page06.html). You'll also notice that in Section 30, the code prohibits freed slaves from living in the state. Once you were freed, you had thirty days to leave Alabama on your way to a free state.

The laws were similar in [all the slave states](https://books.google.com/books?id=yUHtxLgkEU0C&amp;pg=PA96), and in some, slaves couldn't own land even if the slaveowner gave permission.

These laws changed over the course of the mid-1600s to the 1860s. 

When New York was controlled by the Dutch, slaves *were* allowed to own property. However, this right was taken away once the English controlled the government, and it was one of the reasons that led to the New York Slave Revolt of 1712. But there weren't any plantations in New York, so no black plantation owners. (New York did have a few manors granted by the King which practiced tenant farming by both white and freed black farmers, but it wasn't slavery.)

In the Northern states, even those that had slavery, land ownership by both white people and black people was generally held by single families who owned and operated their own farms. Large estates were the exceptions. In the few large estates there were, they typically used indentured servants, or when that was made illegal, then they used immigrants. Cheap labor, but not free labor.

But again, large estates were rather uncommon in comparison to what was going on in the Southern slave states. Slaves couldn't own land down there, and free black people didn't exist in the South, so non-slave black people didn't own land down there, either.

Thus, there were no black plantation owners either in the North or in the South. I'm sure someone can dig up an exception two, but a black-run plantation in the U.S. was almost unheard of.

I'm not well versed in slavery in South America or the Caribbean, so maybe someone else can answer about that. I imagine it's largely the same. The plantations in those places were mostly based on large land grants the King gave to his friends back in Europe when colonization began in the 1500s and 1600s. 

Sometimes, these rich European nobles operated plantations from afar, but often they just sold their land off (or their heirs did) to their rich friends and contacts living in America, i.e., other white people. Until intermarriage, I'd be surprised to learn of non-white plantation ownership anywhere in the Americas, but again, my expertise is in the United States, so I could be wrong. ",AskHistorians

Also the Japanese ethnic identity is more rigid than skin color, there are Koreans and Filipinos in Japan that are well beyond 3 generations and no one considers them Japanese.

I'm not saying it is a zero sum game, European nations have been exchanging populations for thousands of years. That doesn't mean their identities don't exist nor that they can be subsumed by anyone that shows up and reproduces. It's kind of insulting if you look at it that way. ",worldnews

Sim, eu percebi, estava a fazer uma crítica. Não se trata de evolução, é apenas uma mudança. Para dizeres que uma mudança é evolução/progresso, é porque a estás a dotar de superioridade, e era isso que eu estava a criticar.

Não, chama-se falácia do espantalho.

Se o filho/filha/amigo/a/etc sabe que quer aquilo, e a outra pessoa a aceitar como é, não acho que seja ""influenciar"". Se muito podes dizer que seja ""permitir"", não influenciar.

Não sabes tudo o que se passa no mundo.

I mean three Israeli ""art students"" were caught high-fiving and celebrating on the Jersey waterfront when the towers exploded on 9/11!   

Jones is now openly supporting a racist ethno-supremacist state that engages in ethnic cleansing and uses American blood and treasure to eliminate its regional rivals.   

He complains about Muslim migrants entering Europe.   Perhaps he should read Hillary's emails, like this one, and see what caused the latest migrant wave:  

&gt;The best way to help Israel deal with Iran’s growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad...Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly. Then, Israel and the United States  might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.""

The idea that the Saudis are more powerful than Israel is patently absurd.   Do members of the Saudi royal family receive five minute standing ovations in Congress?   Are American politicians replaced by Saudi-funded candidates if they don't kiss Saudi Arabia's ass?   (see Cynthia McKinney and AIPAC).   In any case, the Saudis have been largely aligned with Israeli policy for quite some time, so portraying them as enemies is inaccurate.  

The reality is that both Israel and the United States have consistently funded radical jihadist groups to prevent Arab secular nationalism.   Israel founded Hamas for Christ's sake!  

Jones then has his sidekick claim that Israel has the most ""moral"" army in the world!   LMAO!   This is the country that drops white phosphorous bombs on cities compromised mostly of children;  that tortures children in its prisons; that uses snipers to kill kids on their way to school; that has top Rabbis claiming that killing goy babies is A-okay; that uses pedophile creeps like Jeffrey Epstein to blackmail American politicians.  

In his ""Strategy for Israel in the 1980's"", Oded Yinon advocated a genocidal plan that would break up the entire middle east into warring factions.   ""Iraq is first"" he said.   They are doing exactly this, using the United States army to commit genocide.   Millions of Muslims have been killed since 9/11.   The neocon movement is made up of ""Israel first"" Zionists. 

Alex Jones is a chickenshit.   Trump and his useful idiots are not interested in placing ""America first.""   It's Israel first, then, assuming WWIII doesn't result and any money is left after the latest multi-billion dollar handout to the Zionists, maybe something will be left for your average working stiff.   

Former CIA officer Michael Scheuer put it thusly regarding Trump: 

&gt;This kind of policy requires the utter abandonment of all the tenets inherent in the concept of America First. Together, your selection for ambassador to Israel — a supporter of West Bank settlements; that is, the brazen theft of Palestinian land — and your promise to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem will do four disastrous things: they will kill and maim more U.S. military personnel; decrease U.S. national security; prolong America’s Islam war by decades; and irreparably rupture the trust of your political base’s faith in your promise of putting America first. Proceed in the direction you are setting and you will be from the first day of your presidency nothing more than one more post-1945 U.S. president who is a slave to Israel’s national security interests, and the hapless pawn of disloyal Jewish Americans, their organizations, and their journals.

Je me suis occupé de gamin d'âge allant de 1 an à 9 ans, et j'ai jamais eu à leur en mettre une pour me faire respecter. Alors oui, punir et expliquer pourquoi sans frapper, ça prend plus de temps, c'est plus fatiguant et parfois ça te donne pas la satisfaction d'assouvir tes pulsions violentes quand le gosse est insupportable, mais c'est beaucoup mieux pour le développement mental et physique du gosse ainsi que pour maintenir une bonne relation avec lui.

La majorité des parents que je vois frapper leur gosse ne leur donne jamais de justification autre que ""tu fais ce que je te dis et c'est tout"", ""je t'ai déjà dis que si tu recommençais t'allais t'en prendre une"", etc. parce que ce qu'ils veulent en frappant leur gosse c'est soulager leur frustration c'est-à-dire que le gosse arrête de suite d'être un problème pour eux. Hors, un gamin, ça pleure, ça hurle, c'est violent parfois, et ça s'arrête pas comme un téléphone auquel tu retirerais la batterie. 

Savoir les calmer tout en leur faisant comprendre que ce qu'ils ont fait était mal et pourquoi la punition (qui doit être proportionnelle à la bêtise évidemment) est justifié, c'est ça être un éducateur. On ne punit pas un enfant pour lui faire payer sa mauvaise conduite, on le punit pour lui donner de bonnes bases morales et lui apprendre comment se conduire en société.

Si tu essaies d'apprendre à ton gosse que blesser les autres c'est mal et qu'il/elle ne peut donc pas frapper sa soeur même si elle lui à piquer son jouet par exemple, lui infliger de la souffrance physique comme punition est un paradoxe total.

Etre un bon parent c'est savoir fixer des limites et les tenir, mais c'est aussi prendre le temps d'expliquer à son enfant pourquoi elle existent.

Secondly, i was speaking historically.

Asians who do not differ culturally to 'white' australians are the norm.

the term 'white' has a hisotry itself, and reflects the point im making.  italians and greeks werent considered white for a long time in australia, in the uk theres what you could call 'racial' tension with eastern europeans who are outwardly white. White doesn't mean much, and i don't think its a useful label. 'white' today isn't an idenity that one gets behind, its almost a term of derision used by people who feel outside of the mainstream cultural and social identity, whether for historical, economic or personal reasons.

&gt; Sen. John McCain, who has emerged as the chief opponent within the Republican party to Donald Trump&amp;#039;s warming relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, underscored his tough stance Saturday by spending New Year&amp;#039;s Eve at a forward combat outpost with Ukrainian troops.

&gt; The visit to Ukraine is particularly pointed since it was the Russian strong-arm annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the cross-border military support for anti-Ukrainian government forces in eastern Ukraine that reversed a thaw in U.S.-Russian relations and led to the imposition of economic sanctions by Washington and the European Union.

Abdulhamid II was a monster, and the basic template of the modern tyrant. While the Ottoman Empire in name lived until 1923, what AbdulHamid II did to the Tanzimat and the systems the Ottomans had before hand effectively killed the Ottoman Caliphate.

The world would be a far better place had Abdulmecid II not caught Tuberculosis and died at the age of 38. His son tried his best, but really wasn't up for the challenge (Though he did approve an Ottoman Constitution that was never actually used, because of Abdulhamid II up there). 

The way the Caliphate operated historically was as a moderater, essentially constraining and curbing radicalism, reactionary trends, and deviations like Wahhabism, and in the very early days the Khawarij, who were broadly similar to the Wahhabists of today. Occasionally this would fail, the most spectacular example (aside from Abdulhamid up there) being duing the Fatimid Caliphate, when a mentally deranged lunatic named al-Hakim came to power.

The false thing DAESH wants to set up is a perversion of the past, and everything that came before it, from the Ottomans, right down to Rashidun Caliphate. DAESH, and their followers are damned to hell, considering how they pervert things, and their psychopathic level of violence.

The big issue is, once the Ottoman Caliphate died in 1923, the Moderater, so to speak disappeared. And, over time, the Wahhabs came back, with no one to stop them this time. The Muslim World lost its immune system, and is struggling to fight this infection. 

The best thing Europe could do right now is adopted a ""Walled Garden"" approach to Muslims in their nations, carefully screening who is coming in, like the US does, and because most of them, save France, have weaker separations of Church and State, adopt these Muslim communities and give them the necessary support to operate and thrive, while banning outside money and influence. The Muslim World is in a Dark Age right now, much like Western Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, and it will take time to recover, along with trying to deal with the infection that is causing so much trouble.

I am a center-right conservative/libertarian(on some issues). I am non-religious, I believe gay people should be able to marry. I believe abortion should be legal up until conscious brain development. I don't believe leftists/liberals are bad people, or they are extreme. I believe they have different, and equally respectable views on issues. I believe we should both come together and create solutions. 

Unfortunately I have not met many liberals who are willing to even call a conservative ""normal"". I lost probably 10s, if not hundreds of potential friends for being a conservative on economic issues and some economic/social issues like welfare and minimum wage. It's too bad I am not respected. 

My favorite part is when I hear liberals blaming insurance companies, big pharma as if it is only their fault that our system is such shit. As a physician, trust me when I say I understand the system pretty well. I took an entire year long course on the system, plus years of personal experience. Physicians are probably theI  only people who regularly deal with the business, political, and actual science aspects of medicine. That said, they are to blame yes, but gov't has a big part of the blame as well. In my opinion, liberals are far too quick to solely blame private entities and leave the gov't blameless. Or say private organization owns a greater portion of blame. That is often not correct. The far left ignores facts and realities just like the far right. It is simply more ""accepted"" as a worldview for some odd reason. The gov't is not moral or just, they are just as filthy as companies. Both act in their own self interests. For companies it is money, for gov't it is power. They drink from the same cup. Businesses tend to respond to the actions of gov't, and gov't tends to act in the interests of lobbying businesses. It is all power plays. Over and over again I see the gov't ignore the people, or placate them with a very watered down version of whatever was asked for. I don't know what is with the ""gov't knows best"" attitude. Sometimes private people know better than politicans being paid by goldman sachs. 

Believe it or not, it is possible to be conservative, and support ideas like no citizens united. It is not some virtue of liberals either. 

Just as on example in my sector... when the US FDA requirements are HIGHER than Europe, something is wrong. Our standards are high, but it is completely anti-science. And it probably does kill more patients waiting for life saving patients then it saves in the device innovation and drug discovery process. Conservatives actually advocate for lowering the standards toward European levels, but democrats say it is ""unsafe"". Democrats love to say how great European system is, yet we can't ""lower"" ourselves to their standards. makes no sense. Imagine how much more discovery and research we'd get done if we kept it at European levels of regulation. It makes me really sad that I have to say we should deregulate to European levels. 

American regulation is such a shithole right now. We underregulate in some areas that should be more regulated and overregulate in areas that should be less regulated. It's basically just conflicting interests regulating in these ""wars"" that create meaningless BS. Even if I disagree with some of European regulation, at least a good portion of it is specific and works well together. American regulation looks like a 5 year old designed it.

If we fucked them to a truly recognisable point there would be significant skeletal and cranial differences between Europeans/Asians and Africans.

I will link to another comment I posted earlier, concerning the same topic, in /r/archeology:

&gt; A very very small portion of the Human population interbred. I wouldn't be surprised also, if those children were considered freaks by early Humans and shunned to select societies, further reducing the genetic stamp.

&gt;There are practically no traces of Neanderthal in Homo Sapiens other than a small genetic mark. We took no physical/skeletal features from them. Besides environmental adaptations we have pretty much the same physical/skull/bone configuration as communities that didn't interbreed with Neanderthals, such as the sub-Saharan African Humans.

&gt;To be truly ""descended"", Europeans/Asians would have to carry significant markers that would make them some sort of cross between Neanderthals and Sapiens.

&gt;You should really be glad. Homo Sapiens were more intelligent most likely. Despite the Neanderthals having a larger brain volume, their skull was elongated much similar to the other great Apes, whereas the Sapiens skull is a lot more distinct and specialised. See [this](http://d2rormqr1qwzpz.cloudfront.net/photos/2013/03/13/45894-skulls.jpg) image. Humans have a smaller brow and a bigger forehead, allocating more space to the Frontal lobe. Also a smaller jaw which outlines that our diet may have consisted of cooked/soft foods for a longer period of time. This is an indication that our brains may have been capable of a higher neuron density as lower chewing time/energy/muscle allocated to jaw, plus soft/cooked foods means more energy to brain.

&gt;Their brains were also highly specialised to low-light vision. A lot of it was used, along with their massive eyes/eye sockets, to process visual information in low light environments. This is also why Sapien skull volume tends to increase the further from the equator you go. Here's two sources (BBC likely the more reliable) explaining that aspect of their brains: [1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21759233) [2](http://www.livescience.com/27850-social-brain-beat-neanderthal-vision.html). The BBC one also details the likelihood of Humans having a larger frontal lobe compared to Neanderthals. It's also likely that the Parietal lobe was more developed, as that neighbors the occipital lobe, which in Neanderthals would have taken up more space.

&gt;Additionally, they had large and very nerve-rich noses used for smelling. This consumed a large portion of brain power, too.

&gt;In conclusion, despite the whole ""Neanderthals had larger brain volumes"" thing, once again people don't account for brain specialisaton. Some take it as a point of pride to have Neanderthal DNA, ""look at my big-brained partial ancestors!"" kind of thing. Not saying this is you, but I've seen it a lot.

&gt;But, natural selection took care of the Neanderthal. Maybe if they were more intelligent, they wouldn't have gone extinct. You should be proud to have only a smidgen of Neanderthal in you and of the fact that you remain pretty much fully Sapien. I wouldn't pivot the fact that you are descended from the evolutionary losers, personally. Sapiens clearly did not get along well with Neanderthals and so interbreeding was likely minimal. If we would have co-habitated, we would have more of a physical/genetic trace. Instead it appears that we out-competed and killed them off, with a few bands of Humans bringing their genes into the fold.

For reference, we share 96% of our DNA with Chimps. It doesn't mean we are ""96% chimp"". Australopithecus Afarensis probably bred with cousin species of Apes, Habilis probably did the same with Australopithecus etc etc. But at the end of the day it wasn't enough to create new species of hybrid hominids.

To say that ""we fucked them"", as in, they went extinct because we merged our sub-species, would mean that Europeans and central Asians are a different sub-species of Human than Sub-Saharan Humans. There would be a recognisable physical, skeletal trace, considering how different the Neanderthals were to Homo Sapiens (in a closed comparison).

Edit: Additionally, from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_human_migrations): ""Debate exists whether modern human populations interbred with Neanderthal populations, most of the evidence suggesting that it happened to a small degree rather than complete absorption.""",westworld

My first wig was treated Asian hair (my hair was curly and brunette so I wanted the same thing) - it had been stripped of the black color, dyed, and permed.  It didn't look great to begin with, but within four months it looked terrible and I hated it.  My second wig was virgin European hair that was about shoulder-length, and it still looks gorgeous nearly 7 years later (I have had it ""refilled"" with hair so to speak a few times but the cap is fine).  From my experience, it's best to buy the best quality you can manage financially because you'll feel the most confident in it and it'll age well.  On a related note, when I buy a wig, I get a prescription from my doctor listing it as a ""cranial prosthesis"" which I can then submit to the state (I'm in NY) as a medical expense to get the tax refunded.


Anyway, anecdotes aside, I'll just give you all the information I can think of:


**Wig basics**


*Synthetic vs human*


With wigs, I’ve generally found that you get what you pay for.  Synthetic wigs are more affordable and can be lovely if you get a good one, but I’ve found them to be warmer to wear than human hair which I dislike.  I like to wear a synthetic wig to the beach or pool if I’m going in the water because I like to preserve my human hair wigs.  You do have to be careful with heat and synthetic hair; if you open the oven and get blasted with heat, the hair can melt, and you have to be careful with the temperature if you heat-style them (although most synthetics don’t need much if any styling).  My oldest synthetic wig is probably six years old, but it hasn’t gotten six years worth of wear because I only wear it when I know I’m going to get sweaty.


There are different levels of quality for human hair with Asian/Indian “ranking” as below European hair.  “Virgin” hair just means it’s undyed and untreated which generally makes it easier to work with.  My favorite wigs to wear are definitely the human hair.  They’re pricey, but they look beautiful, feel comfortable, and last very well.  You can heat-style them without worrying about the hair melting and as long as you care for them properly, they’ll last years.  For me, the cost is worth it because they’re more comfortable and generally look more natural.  Obviously the hair that they shed (all wigs shed) doesn’t grow back, so you do need to add hair every few years or so.  My oldest human hair wig is nearly seven years old and the cap is just starting to show some wear.


It’s definitely a personal decision because I know people who are happy with their synthetic wigs.  Regardless, I recommend buying something that you know is good quality (ie not a crap costume wig) because you’ll feel better and it’ll look better.


*Monofilament tops*


All the human hair wigs I own have monofilament tops.  This basically means that they’re hand-tied and you can move the part around without worrying because it looks like natural scalp.  Regardless of whether you go for synthetic or human hair, I would definitely recommend looking for the monofilament (“mono”) top because it looks so much more natural.  I uploaded a picture of myself to imgur [here](http://imgur.com/rYUBV8X) so you can see what I mean; the wig I’m wearing there is virgin, European hair (that was coming up on needing to be washed) with a mono top.


*Adhesive and clips*


When I started wearing wigs, I didn’t have enough hair left to use the clips that come in a lot of wigs, so I’ve never used them and therefore can’t speak to them.  However, if you do have hair, you can just clip the wig in using the clips that come in most of them.  Since I don’t have hair, I use daily adhesive ([this one specifically]( http://www.hairdirect.com/store/clear-a-contour.aspx) doesn’t irritate my eczema-prone skin).  If I’m doing something really intense, I’ll use supertape, but it’s more difficult to remove.  It’s not generally advised to stick any tape directly to the wig cap to avoid damaging it, so I sew in patches of “skin” - essentially a thin polyurethane material - where I want to place the tape and then apply the tape to that.


**Where I buy**


I purchase most of my human hair wigs from a local Orthodox Jewish woman who sells them.  I honestly don’t know the brand because it’s all in Hebrew, but I know they're all kosher, virgin European hair.  [Wilshire Wigs](http://www.wilshirewigs.com/) runs great sales and has some beautiful wigs; I’ve ordered synthetic wigs from them and enjoyed them.  [Yaffa wigs]( http://www.yaffawigs.com/) also has some good ones, and they have [an outlet]( http://www.yaffawigsoutlet.com/) from which I’ve purchased a human hair wig that I enjoy.
 

**Wig care**


Since wigs don’t produce oil like normal hair does, they don’t need to be washed as often.  For me it’s generally every 4 weeks, sometimes a little longer in the winter.  For synthetic wigs, I wash them in a basin with a shampoo/conditioner from Revlon that’s designed for synthetic wigs.  For my human hair wigs, it’s ideal to wash them on your head to minimize shedding.  I use whatever shampoo and conditioner is around and rinse very thoroughly to make sure no product is left in the hair.   Sometimes I’ll use dry shampoo on my human hair wigs between washes if they do start to get oily (generally from me touching them).  I don’t do much styling so I can’t really help you there.
 

**Scalp care**


I currently have no hair, so I just wash my head with baby shampoo because it’s gentle.  I have dry, eczema-prone skin on my body which includes my scalp, so I like to gently exfoliate with a washcloth because it helps keep my head less itchy although this might not be a problem for you.  I also apply lotion (currently the First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream) to my head at night to moisturize and wash my head in the morning before putting the wig on to keep the cap clean.
 

**Resources**: The National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) [website](https://www.naaf.org/) is a decent place to start.  [Bald Girls Do Lunch](https://www.baldgirlsdolunch.org/) is a really nice organization - I've met the founder - that also has a lot of information, and Thea herself is great.  [Alopeciaworld](http://www.alopeciaworld.com) is a social network that also has a lot of information and someone on there is probably in your area.  I don’t know anything about you, but the black community tends to do a ton of hair replacement and black women you know might be able to help point you in a helpful direction.

Slavic languages are also a good choice, though I would say they are definitely more of a step up than German. I would recommend Russian, because it is probably the easiest and most widely spoken Slavic language. The alphabet it pretty easy to get accustomed to, and there are also many great sources.

Outside of European languages, I would say the hardest part is to get accustomed to a different grammatical structure and other such things. Some easier options I would say are Turkish, Indonesian, or even Hawaiian or Maori if you're into that. They are probably easier than Spanish in general, but to an English speaker might actually be a step up because of the change in mentality.

It makes more sense to use Japanese actors for that production, but it's less problematic to use Hollywood actors/actresses because it attracts the best talent from around the world, so it could wind up being a good film anyway.

I can think of two actual fascist parties with anything more than fringe (less than 1% support), that would be the Syrian Social Nationalist Party which is active in Syria amongst anti-Arabist secularists (especially non-Sunni Muslims) in Syria and amongst the Greek Orthodox community in Lebanon and Golden Dawn which is active in Greece and commands popular support as a result of reckless treatment of that countries by the banking community and the European Union specifically regarding the financial crisis and the intense migrant flows to the country.

Most British people who aren't specifically interested in the Syrian Civil War wouldn't know that the SSNP existed, and Golden Dawn got more mention a few years ago after their militants killed a rapper than they do now even though they're more popular now (steadily polling at 25% of the vote sometimes going up to 30% and surpassing Syriza as opposed the average of 12-15% in 2014-15).


Let's make some things clear shall we? Fascism is a specific thing, it is not a nebulous label that we can apply to any right wingers we dislike.

Anti-immigrant politics are not intrinsically fascist.


Social conservatism is not intrinsically fascist.


Being nationalistic is not intrinsically fascist.


Fascism is an ultra nationalist ideology that *rejects democracy*, either seeing it as a failure and useless or more commonly openly referring to it as a means to an end and promising to use the power to they're given by voters to abolish democracy outright. Fascism goes beyond the average of national pride, nationalism or patriotism and believes in the concept of a national cult — where the nation itself is elevated to almost being a God to be worshipped. Oftentimes fascism will conflate the party and the nation to be one and the same. Fascism is revolutionary not reactionary, unless you live in a state that used to have a fascist state and now doesn't (so Iberians, Italians, Croatians, Austrians and Germans) than fascism is separated from conservatism or reactionary politics by the fact that unlike social conservatives *they have no desire to go back to how things were* but instead *fascists want to create a whole new society*. The difference can be observed by reading about the antipathy between the Nazis and the large traditionalist movement in Weimar Germany. Unlike the traditionalists and monarchists, the Nazis were disdainful of the old nobility and had no desire to re-empower them or reinstate the Kaiser, unlike the traditionalists and monarchists the Nazis and Italian fascists were irreligious and distrustful of Christianity in general but especially Catholicism (the only relevant Christianity in Italy) because Catholicism is under the control of the Pope which is a foreign power is and unlike the various Protestant denominations could not be co-opted to serve fascism. The fascist usage of religion (especially in Germany) was very cynical and not much different from the Dawkins types' view of religion — that it is something that can be used to control and pacify stupid people. If you would like to see a great example of the tense relations between the Nazis and German conservatism then read about the relations between the Nazi German government and arch-conservative philosopher Ernst Jünger and how he was slandered in the Völkischer Beobachter and only spared imprisonment because he was and is very much loved by wider society and considered a national treasure.

Fascists are suspicious of capitalism, since it is by nature an internationalist dynamic and thus outside of the limits of state control. That's why fascism is very enthusiastic about government control in the economy and strives for autarky so that the nation can be removed from [the power of] the international system entirely. Fascism is unapologetically pro-violence, unlike most politicians across the spectrum who see usage of the military as an unfortunate reality of statecraft that should be used only when other options are exhausted fascism sees violence as integral to the maintenance of the nation's virility and masculinity and sees any form of pacifism as tantamount to treason for that reason. Other politicians see state violence as a means to an end, to stop an enemy country or maintain law and order but fascism sees violence as the means itself.


If you'll read above you'll find that most so called fascist parties from Ukip to the AfD to the GOP under Donald Trump are conservative parties, even reactionary in some respects but not fascist parties.

Enoch Powell made the same clarification many years ago when he was called a fascist and a Nazi for the '*Rivers of Blood*' speech. He wasn't a fascist or a Nazi by any definition, neither were similar elements to him like the Tory Monday Club — they didn't want to create a whole new society based upon anti-democratic values, a national cult and glorification of violence they were simply traditionalists who wanted to return society to how things used to be. Whether you think that's good or bad is of course up to you, but what isn't up for debate is what fascism is.",ukpolitics

Dear Avaazers, 

In 2016, hate was given hope -- but now we take it back! 

From terrorism to Trump to Syria, it was a rough year. But hidden by all the darkness filling our screens, there's a simple, beautiful, truth: 

The world has never been in a better place. 

From poverty to literacy, the rise of women and fall of deadly disease -- on virtually every metric -- the world is better off than it's ever been. It's a powerful reason for us all to have hope, and rise to 2017. 

So to kick off the new year, here's a video of 10 beautiful reasons to have hope -- let's share them, add our own, and together give the world a million reasons to hope in 2017: 

[Share this on facebook](https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/hope_avaaz_2016_share/?bvZCmbb&amp;signup=1&amp;cl=11469878660&amp;v=85900)

 
Even on the environment, we're winning epic progress on everything from historic ocean conservation to an unstoppable revolution in clean energy! 

Political extremists and divisive zealots thrive on fear and desperation. That's why they try to convince us that the world is falling apart. 

Master trolls like Trump and Putin have even hired vast armies of both real people and fake ""bots"" to hijack our social media with smears and lies about how awful everything and everyone else is, except them. (this is true! see sources below). What better way to answer them than a million new year's posts about what gives each of us and all of us hope: 


Let's take this dose of hope, and let it fuel our determination and that of our friends. Because in 2017, together, we rise. 

*With hope*, 

*the whole Avaaz team*

PS - This new year's reflection feels so important, for each of us, and for a world that is at a tipping point -- between love, hope and wisdom, and fear, anger and ignorance. Here are 5 points of reflection that might be useful for your reflection this year: 
1. Yes, things are serious. A new autocratic world order (60% of Avaazers believe even a second rise of fascism) could threaten everything we love. 

2. But this is also a tremendous opportunity. Humanity, like each of us, learns best from mistakes. Much of our greatest progress has been catalyzed by crisis. If we meet this moment right, we can emerge from it stronger and wiser than ever. 

3. We need to be strong, and to challenge the forces of regress. But let’s not be twisted by the darkness and act from fear and anger. We are warriors for love and wisdom. We must act from that light.

4. When we do come from love and wisdom, we can see that our ‘enemy’ is not so much any people, as it is unwisdom. Misplaced fear and anger. Lack of awareness and understanding.

5. These are age-old foes of our people. Our grandparents faced far worse with far less, and they won progress. We have every reason to hope, and no excuse for despair. 
And lastly - all the forces present in our world are present within us. Fear and love. Hope and despair. The choices we make in our personal lives shape our world through billions of acts of kindness or cruelty, wisdom or foolishness. All we can do is our best. Let's hit that mark this year :).

The two times they tried to start such a state collapsed after only a few years in the late 50's, with Syria and Egypt forming one country (United Arab Republic) with North Yemen (United Arab States) and Iraq  and Jordan another (Arab Federation). Gaddafi attempted another in the 70's between Libya, Egypt, and Syria (Federation of Arab Republics) but it was largely ineffective and collapsed after 5 years. There is a semblance of the European Union in the Arab League, but it's institutions are no where near as strong. Not to mention that at least half of the nations in OPEC are in the Middle East, even if that organization is focused more on economic rather than political objectives.

But to your point about the U.N.  artificially creating Israel, when they set up a plan to divide Mandatory Palestine, [they offered far more land to the Arbas who lived there](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/UN_Partition_Plan_For_Palestine_1947.svg/2000px-UN_Partition_Plan_For_Palestine_1947.svg.png) when compared to what they control in the West Bank and Gaza Strip today. It appears that the two areas were almost connected, certainly closer than the current distance of the two regions today. Jerusalem was even proposed to be an international city under U.N. administration, fairly similar to the status of Tangiers during the French and Spanish protectorates of Morocco. Yet the Arabs rejected this plan and the Arab nations that already existed ganged up on Israel. Somehow, against ridiculously bad odds they won and were able to have repeat successes in the future Six Days' and Yom Kippur Wars. The legitimacy of their annexations in 1967 is obviously debatable but if there is anyone to blame for the strong position Israel has today it is due to the folly of Arab nations (and generous American foreign aid to be fair). No one demanded the Arabs pay Holocaust reparations for a genocide they did not commit. The post-Holocaust Aliyah, British decolonization efforts, and a climax in sectarian conflict all combined to form the basis for Israel and Palestine today.              ",worldnews

In addition to France forward Antoine Griezmann, the Premier League club have expressed their interest in recruiting Spain midfielder Saul Niguez. Though the pair possess release clauses totalling £145m on contracts that were renewed last summer and run until 2021, United believe they will be able to negotiate transfer fees down from the buyout figures and are willing to wait for the close season to do deals.

Saul, 22, is an archetypal Mourinho midfielder: tall, athletic and very mobile. He can play anywhere across the centre of the park and also operate in defence.

Griezmann has delivered 62 League and Champions League goals for Atletico from 118 appearances since joining from Real Sociedad in 2014. The 25-year-old is one of the best second strikers in world football and is seen as a potential replacement for Wayne Rooney.

Mourinho believes he needs to add a further four or five elite players to return United’s playing staff to the level of the Sir Alex Ferguson era. He must also slim down an overmanned squad and is open to the sale or release of a number of fringe players. Morgan Schneiderlin, who has attracted interest from West Brom and Everton, Memphis Depay, and Bastian Schweinsteiger are available in the January window.


Though United have avoided publicly discussing their readiness to move Rooney off their books, there is a recognition within Old Trafford that the captain’s status as an automatic starter has been lost to fitness and lifestyle issues. Were Rooney to accept an offer from elsewhere — he has been the subject of hugely lucrative approaches from the Chinese Super League — United would gladly be relieved of the 31-year-old’s remuneration.

Central defence is another position that Mourinho wants to reinforce and he could make a move for the Southampton centre-back Jose Fonte.",reddevils

Therefore their attempts to discredit facts were constrained compared to Russia's, taken as a whole. I'm drawing a broad conclusion from a broad premise. It's not going to get more specific than that.

With a fact-hating Trump administration allied with the Republican party in Congress, there will be more desire to push fake information online, and therefore there will be more official US online propaganda than before. This isn't rocket science.

My point was that I think it's possible (not necessarily likely, just possible) that Paul and the people he wrote to might not have believed that Jesus was a real person who lived during that time period. I was just trying to think outside the box and from a more literary position seeing as that's the way my brain works. What if those early churches weren't at all what we imagine they were? Even all the jazz Paul writes (1 Corinthians if I'm not mistaken) about Jesus dying for our sins and all seems to have been written in a different style and could therefore have been added much later by Christian writers.

I probably should have used a better example than Harry Potter. What about something like The Flying Spaghetti Monster? People write about him to each other as if he were real both to poke fun at religion/current events and to give each other advice. Trekkies and fans of Game of Thrones even go so far as to learn fake languages to use while speaking as if their favorite characters and story lines are real. Fan fiction tells even more stories using the same characters. There's nothing within the story that lets you know that its author and readership know it's fiction. This type of story building is common in humans going back millennia. What if Jesus began as one fictional story and various mythology from nearby cultures got woven into it and we just lost track of how to tell the original from the fakes.... without realizing maybe the original was just as fictional as its antecedents? Maybe it even started way before the first century.

Was Snow White real? Or Cinderella? Were they, like Robin Hood, based on something real and evolved into legends? Probably not. They seem to have developed a very long time ago and their tropes have spread across Asia and Africa in various forms, so they are far older than the kingdoms of Europe where we seem to have frozen them in time. Would we look at the Brothers Grimm and said that such stories appear to have been true because Snow White and Cinderella lived during the same time period and in the same area as they did and many people retold the stories? Certainly not. Perhaps had Europe at the time had a more open-minded, polytheistic religion at the time, the stories may have become part of the mythology. Can we really say for sure that they couldn't have?

Okay, so still very few soldier deaths/injuries. And there is **nothing** in this blog you linked about

&gt;But they suffered substantial casualties because Al-Abadi ignored US advice and sped up the advance for political reasons. Now the US is in control again, and they are making good progress.

&gt;Also you cited an empty wikipedia article. That's pretty unbelieveable.

lol but a .blogspot is better? I was only sourcing the causalities.

&gt;The United States doesn't directly order divisions into battle. But US officers are on the ground assisting with every aspect of the slow comb through the town. I'm not sure why you cited that US briefing. But the assault on mosul has been on going for 3 months now.

Because you claimed the ""US was in control"" of the ground invasion, when in reality it is mainly lead by the Iraqis and Kurds with air support from other people (like the US).

&gt;The Islamic State is not an isolated entity. It's more like an arab/islamic version of European nationalism in the 19th century. It's a political movement. The historical precedent is for the surviving members to either merge with other groups, or form their own.

**So, again, not ISIS.** The main reason you started this conversation was because you were so offended that I said that ISIS wasn't a threat. **You've spent the last 3 posts affirming what I said: that ISIS will dissolve and is not a threat.**

&gt;ISIS is a symptom of the institutional problems of the middle-east, and the problem will not go away.

Like Sunni persecution in Iraq and Syria?

&gt; They all came to Germany as American soldiers.  At first C-Block was only Red Dogg (George Anthony Joseph) and Mr.P or P.O.P. (James White). It was with Mr.P that Red Dogg had the success with the album ""General Population"" and all the hit songs from that. It all went very well for those to. They were the ""main members"" of CBK that were most visible, but the singer Theresa ""Misty"" Baltimore and the rapper/singer Goldie were also members of the group and featured on many songs.

&gt; C-Block's first single was ""Skake dat azz"" together with the rapper A.K.-S.W.I.F.T. It was released in early 1996, and got a lot of airplay in the clubs and hiphop charts.
The real breakthrough came with their single ""So Strung Out"". This song hit the top 5 on the very popular chart, Viva Top100, and reached top 10 in many European countries.
The followed up the success with another bomb-song ""Time Is Tickin´ Away"", and it got as big, if not any bigger then the previous single. If you ask anybody about C-Block, the person probably would mention ""So Strung Out"" and ""Time Is Tickin' Away"" directly.
After that it was time for the debut album release. ""General Population"" hit the stores, and this album is one of the, if not the greatest album of the history of the European HipHop/Rap scene. The album contains, except for the 3 singles ""So Strung Out"", ""Time Is Tickin´ Away"" and their fourth single, ""Summertime"",  super-songs like ""Everything´s Good"", ""Being Raised"" and ""Round N Round"". This is really something for the fans of European Rap &amp; HipHop.
After the single ""Summertime"", Mr.P started to think of an own career and he and Red Dogg argued a lot. P wanted too much and he left C-Block...
     
...so now C-Block became Red Dogg, Misty and Goldie. That was the new C-Block.
It tokk some months before the first single ""Eternal Grace"" was released. The song hit the Viva top 10immediately, and was released for Christmas 1997. In March 1998, the single ""Broken Wings"" had a world premeire. A cover song of Mr.Mister's ""Broken Wings"", and here Red Dogg really proves how great rapper he is. The first verse of this song has it all. The new album ""Keepin´ It Real"" which was released in May 1998. This album has a little more hiphop influence, but still the typical CBK-style. The songs ""Bounce"", ""Keepin It Real"", ""Motherless Child"" and defenitely the great ""We Believe"" and ""You Win Again"" are worth to check out.

&gt; The second album was a big success, especially in the middle-european countries and Bulgaria, hitting for example nr 1 spot in Poland.
The group started to plan for the next single, that was supposed to be ""We Believe"". But, things doesn't always turn out that good.

&gt; After a year of silence, C-Block made a comeback with the new single ""Keep Movin´"" with some surpriseing members. James White (or P.O.P.) had returned to the group, and did the rappin by himself this time, and you could see a new singer too, Jeanine Love. Well, where did Red Dogg, Goldie and Misty go? I was actually very disapointed that Red Dogg wasn´t in the group anymore, because I thought that he always was the brain behind the group and brought us the fattest raps. Anyway, I like P.O.P. a lot aswell. The single ""Keep Movin´"" was released in the summer of 1999 and it was a groovy phat usual CBK track.  It got a lot of play on the club charts over europe, but never had the sucess of the earlier CBK tracks.
Almost a year later ,in the summer of 2000, C-Block had released the single ""The Future Is So bright"" .The succes wasn't there at all. Althoug you could read on the inlay of tha single, that the new album ""Changes"" was planned to be dropped soon, the group took a break. And after that it's quiet....

&gt; Later in 2004, the fans found out some chocking news about Red Dogg. Tony was shot on 15th of September 2001, and very badly injured. He almost lost his life. He is now in a wheel chair and lost a little of his memory. The guy that shot him was a big criminal and got cought and got sentenced. However, latest news from his family in California indicates that he has re-married his ex-wife and now they live together with their daughter and grand daughter.

&gt; In 2010, something amazed is about to drop. The amazing project Euro-Rap-Revival is featuring 40 of the most amazing euro-rap artists, with total new production and songs! Two of these artists are Misty and Goldie. Read more on Last.fm.

- There are little to no grids in European cities; Most cities are pre-war whereas the U.S. is mostly post-war

- Suburbs are not as sprawling, and a majority of people live in dense urban centers

- Public transportation (Especially Trams in Mid-Sized cites) is heavily favored

- Several European cities have ringroads, rather than have highways cutting through their CBDs as American cities would

- There is typically an old and new city center, the old one being the densest with tight alleys and corners, as you go out from the center wider boulevards may be noted with several roundabouts and open-space.

&gt; ROME Italy will seek to deport more migrants who have no right to be in the country and will open new detention centers to hold them before their expulsion, according to a written directive and a ministry source.

&gt; Police chief Franco Gabrielli sent a two-page directive to stations across the country on Friday ordering them to increase efforts to identify and deport migrants a week after Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri was shot dead near Milan.

&gt; Gentiloni&amp;#039;s predecessor, Matteo Renzi, agreed to set up &amp;quot;Hotspots&amp;quot; to identify and fingerprint migrants who arrived on Italian shores, but he refused to build large detention centers to hold migrants who did not qualify refugee status.

Do you think all defenses of Muslims and Islam as ""memes""?

You clearly didn't even read the articles because *they clearly explain the context of all quotes*. Usually they are related to war-times. If you just rip out of quotes like that, you could justify a lot of terrible violence and criminality. 

And even if Muslims who aren't supportive of terrorism were a minority, this would still make it unjustified to generalize and bar entry for all of them. 

Would you want entry for Americans to be barred in any country because of the wars and crimes committed by previous administrations, that you didn't even vote for? The majority might have voted for them, but you didn't, so why should you get punished, too?

&gt;They're currently destroying the west in Europe literally as we speak.

All these millions in Germany and other places, including the US only faked their integration, their friendships and their jobs to plot acts of terrorism? They never criticize themselves and [have never denounced ISIS?](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/70000-muslim-clerics-issue-fatwa-condemning-terrorism/)? They don't come out after [terrorism attacks to condemn](http://time.com/4112830/muslims-paris-terror-attacks-islam-condemn/), sometimes before everyone else?

[Never ever?](https://www.bustle.com/articles/149432-7-times-muslims-denounced-terror) They [don't](http://mu-warrior.blogspot.de/2015/11/self-criticism-in-muslim-world.html) ever [criticize](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/210079) their own religion?  

They are entirely unpatriotic and would [never mourn US soldiers](http://i.imgur.com/tPIGmtY.jpg), as [this page claims](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/12/2008_in_photographs_part_2_of.html)?

 Do you live in a bubble?

If I'm allowed to say something, the ""meme"" of picking quotes to show how all Muslims, even those you might meet every day in cities like Austin, New York or Washington are silently hating you and all their friendliness is just pretense, is really the worst of them all. 

No matter how often Muslims denounce any attacks, how many clerics clearly condemn ISIS and explain how their view of Islam is justifiable, nothing can convince anyone who already has equated Islam with supporting terrorism.

At this point this prejudice will overtake anti-semiticism soon if it hasn't already. ",LateStageSocialism

Here's what I want to do this year:

1. No drinking (I really want to see if I can enjoy life without the need of alcohol. I live in Ireland and pretty much everything revolves around drink so let's see if I can still have fun without it.)
2. Draw an entire comic book (One of my resolutions last year was to get better at drawing and while I have gotten pretty good there's still a bit to go until I can draw an entire 22 page book. But I think I'm close so hopefully I'll make it by the end of the year)
3. Record all my original songs (There's only 4 so I really should get on that.)
4. Write 3 new original songs (Gotta keep it up, the only way to get better is to keep writing.)
5. Go on 3 dates (Haven't been on a date in about 2 years, so this would be an amazing accomplishment if I do it)
6. Take a trip to the continent alone (I live so close to Europe but never really go. My excuse is always that none of my friends want to go but that's not much of a reason. It's just over there, I could easily go for a weekend and it be nothing.)
7. Finish Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (This is just a small one. Really liking the game but I usually stop playing games when I get about halfway through. So it's more of a motivation thing than anything else)
8. Read 10 books. (Read 7 last year so bumping it. Already nearly finished my first book.)
9. Explore more. (Just to see the world even if it's just more of Ireland. I spend to much time in a tiny bubble. So I want to expand it.) 
10. Get a bike (This relates to number 9. Save time and money since I can get places quicker but don't have to worry about petrol or bus fare.)",OneYearOn

Someone above mentioned that Final Fantasy games are more cutting edge, which also is a factor in how the decision to release them over here is made.

Unlike the Bible, the Quran is clear and very specific in its violent instructions. These verses apply only under specific circumstances, i.e. as self-defense or during war. But what could explain today's prevalence of violence, extremism and terrorism in Islamic societies?

Islam, itself, is not the problem. The Quran is not the problem. Muslims were more moderate and peaceful than European Christians in the past 8 centuries until the 1940's. And then western imperialism happened and the Ottoman Empire fell which ripped apart Muslim nations. The West took over and suppressed Muslim people and dominated their politics and culture and that created this reactionary antagonistic behaviour these extremists have for the West. Most of these militant Islamic groups are relatively recent creations which only emerged towards the early last century. 

Political instability, disenfranchisement and ignorance are what fuel Islamic extremism. Islamic societies have been under intense western political pressure for 2 centuries now. Islamic terrorism is a reaction against the West's constant meddling and wars in, and oppression of Islamic countries.

People turn to fundamentalism and extremism when their society feels threatened. The problem with Muslims is that they lack a central authority figure like a Pope that does all or most of the scriptural interpretation and teaching for them, and a Catechism that summarizes all the fundamental tenets of the religion and that makes Islam much more susceptible to misinterpretation, especially by uneducated, disenfranchised Muslims, than the Bible is.

Actually, most Catholics are conservative. Especially Mexican Catholics.

&gt;Irish, Brits, Slavs, Celts, Italians, etc. are all white. 

We haven't always agreed on this loss and the Italians. The Mediterranean sub race has generally been considered suspect or questionable until fairly recently. Especially the Italians, given history with the Moors and all. The American Party would not have accepted an Italian Catholic. They didn't do things halfway like you do. They stuck to their principles.  


&gt;Your slippery slope argument only applies to retards who can't analyze IQ or racial differences. 

You mean like those you don't understand that Italians and Eastern Europeans are not the same ethnicity as Britain's? Or those who don't understand that Mediterraneans are not Nords or Alpines? Are those who think that they're going to attack the Jews based on IQ? It is not the IQ of a Jew that is the problem. Statistically, Ashkenazi have very high IQs. That is not the aspect of their nature that is a problem.


&gt;My ancestry is overwhelmingly British WASP, so I have virtually no bone to pick in this conversation.

But you're inviting in the Catholics...

&gt;But I do not believe that it's conductive to our movement to limit White Identity to solely WASPs in the US. If we do, then we're fucked as a movement from the start since there aren't enough WASPs left in this country to fuel our movement.

Because of people who did not believe in keeping America white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, who invited in the Catholics and the Italians and the Eastern Europeans and paved the way for letting in the Jews and then other non-whites, Muslims, and other groups. You've admitted to feed, accepted their promise, and allowed them to move the goal posts. All while claiming to stand for the very principles that you have given up on.


&gt;We need white Americans of Italian, Polish, Russian, Irish, Greek, etc. descent if we want to actually take back our country. Focusing on WASPs will get us nowhere.

That's the exact same argument used by those who say we need to accept Jews ever going to come back the Muslims. Or who say we need to accept anticommunist non-whites if we're going to beat the Communists. Or who say we need to work with the Jews if we're going to beat the atheists. Or that we need the atheists ever going to beat the Muslims. Or that we need the good Muslims if we're going beat the terrorists...

It's the people who control those banks that were in a position to Take Over Control of the Federal Reserve once it was established. Getting rid of the FED doesn't really change anything in terms of who actually controls things and you still runs the show behind the scenes.

Where pretty much all of western Europe wouldn't even allow those two groups within their borders without killing them, the Moors let them live in relative peace. After the Reconquista, Spanish Gypsies where driven to extinction and the Jews almost where. Both of the languages of those people are long gone. They saved Greek and Roman Literature and philosophy while the Christian world burned it for being written by heathens. Baghdad was the intellectual center of the medieval world, and rivaled even Rome and Constantinople in power, population and influence. What changed? The fall of the Ottoman empire. In 1916 the Arab's revolted agains the ottomans, wishing for a single Arab state. They aided the British in their fight against the Ottomans. The British and French then partitioned the empire between them, which most of the Arab world considers a betrayal. The British gave the Kingdom of Arabia to Ibn Saud, and that dynasty promoted a very new ideology called wahabism which is the extremism we see today. The partitioning, cold war interventions like the US removing the Ayatolla of Iran from power, and wars like the recent Iraq-Afghanistan war, severely destabilized the region and made it easier for Wahabism to spread.

TL;DR Britain and France betrays Arabs who helped them overthrow the Ottomans and takes their land for themselves for a while, Britain appoints an extremist as king of a piece of the land they stole called Arabia, those two powers plus the US spend a few decades doing various political and economic shenanigans that greatly destabalize the entire region baring Arabia, and Arabia spreads it's extremism to destabilized countries. Arabs are sick of the past century and are more religiously extreme, and the West acts surprised when they do something about it.",worldnews

And in the Middle East, you've got Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other oil-rich Islamist monarchies funding radicalism there (and around the world, but that's another matter). So, if you're the CIA and looking for some armed insurgents, the Islamist radicals are the ""low-hanging fruit"". This makes sense based on what we know of CIA operations in other regions, too.

I do think there's some reason to believe that there is a long term plan to use Islamic radicals as a foil to trigger events elsewhere (Europe in particular). But I'm not yet sure what the ultimate goal is supposed to be. It also seems that the plan may not be working as planned. This is an area where we still need some more information about what's going on behind the scenes. Some leaks from Europe would be nice.

This Corbett Report video addresses some of the reasons to be suspicious that there is an agenda behind the migration (and associated infiltration of Islamic radicals).

Most importantly, is it a brown, European hedgehog (brown fur, not typically meant as a pet, under wildlife protection in a lot of countries) or an African hedgehog (one with white fur, the ones you usually see as pets)? Depending on the species, the diet will be different.

My knowledge is mostly limited to African hedgehogs, but everything except the diet should be very similar for European ones. So to answer your questions : 

1 - I would recommend either putting wood chips in his home or using some kind of blanket or cover that you can wash without much difficulty. Most hedgehogs will poop while they are in their wheel, so most of it will be in and around the wheel. Litter training them is not usually possible. The poop shouldn't be very runny (at least not for African hedgehogs) so that problem should hopefully go away after you feed him right for a while.

2 - Honestly, I would recommend dry cat food as the primary food source, with occasional meals of wet cat food or meal worms. This might also help make his poop more manageable. You can't really overfeed them with regular food, they will just eat as much as they should (for an adult African hedgehog less than 2 tablespoons of dry cat food per day). The only way to really overfeed them is with mealworms, which they will just devour until they are all gone.

African hedgehogs should basically only eat protein (get the cat food with the highest amount of protein you can find). They don't eat veggies or fruit, although  you can feed them tiny tiny portions of fruit once in a while if it makes you happy. Nothing acidic, though. European hedgehogs are a bit more omnivorous and will sometimes eat small amounts of veggies or fruits.

3 - They really don't drink much. As long as he always has enough fresh water in his terrarium / cage, he will be fine.

4 - It sounds very odd that your hedgehog is ""running up to you for cuddles"". That is not something hedgehogs do at all, and even the most socialized hedgehogs are not puppies. They need a lot of time alone and don't like stress of any kind. That being said, if you are just laying in bed with your hedgehog on your stomach or in your palm, it shouldn't stress him out, so don't worry about that. Just don't constantly drag him out of his hiding places and be aware that they sleep for at least 15 hours every day.

**Edit** Concerning his home : Make sure the temperature doesn't drop below 23°C during the day or 20°C during the night and that there is no draft. In NZ, I guess that's not going to be much of a problem, but monitor the temperature and get a heat lamp as needed. Unfortunately, most people on this subreddit have a cage for their hedgehogs, but a terrarium is generally more suitable and makes it much easier to have a consistent temperature as well as preventing drafts (and unpleasant smells for you). 

Also make sure he has enough space (breeders here require 120x60x60cm, although I noticed that Americans seem to consider half of that space enough...) and a wheel that's large enough for him to run comfortably.",Hedgehog

**Meeting people in hostels:** 

Pros: 

- More people to choose from
- When you hit it off with someone you can travel together from there

Cons: 

- Chances are you probably won't stay at the same place for very long and you're more likely to end up as '5 minute friends' than establish any real friendship


**Meeting people on organized trips:** 

Pros: 

- You're forced to spend time together (this could also be considered a con)
- You know the duration of the trip and how much time you'll have with them
- You will share experiences that you will remember for a lifetime. Sharing great experiences brings people together

Cons: 

- You can't choose your group. Sometimes you'll fit right in and other times you won't. 

My personal experience is that group tours makes it a lot easier to build friendships than meeting people randomly in the street or in a hostel. Just make sure you pick the right tour. 

The more niche your tour is, the better are your chances of meeting people you have something in common with. Go on a Contiki tour around Europe if you want to meet 20 year olds who love to party and haven't traveled much before. African safaris attracts people who like wildlife. Tours to North Korea attracts well traveled people. Luxury cruises attracts old people with a lot of money. It's quite simple really. 

My experience is also that it's easier to become friends when you're forced to spend time together. Small groups make it somewhat easier than large groups. Tours that involve camping and full day activities are better than tours where you stay in a hotel and only see the group for a few hours each day due to lots of free time. 

Find something you're passionate about and go on a tour where you'll meet people like yourself. It could be a photography tour, horseback riding trip, diving trip or simply the destination in itself.",travel

This does not guarantee that the next person elected is any better, but, if they are, the merits of their achievements will hopefully keep them in power to keep making the right decisions. This is about the best you can hope for in a check and balance system.

One improvement might be to draw candidates not from parties which a unified manifesto, but select potential candidates through pre-decided merit. Are you a well preforming head teacher? Then you are perhaps called to be put forward with a group of other head teachers for an education ministerial position.

Wrong. And I'm going to try to show you how. I see that this isn't something you do consciously, you just don't know any better. Brevity is the soul of wit. 

You say Phds affect job quality not immigration status and I say that's untrue. In situations where your degrees are not recognized, it affects immigration status. If the United States does nos recognize your phd, then it would affect your immigration status, yes or no?

&gt;I can piss in the sea but it doesn't make the sea contaminated by piss

These kinds of statements are unnecessary. Please stop making them. 

&gt;here's not really any correlation between development of the country of origin and success rate in migration to a developed country

That information does not show what you think it does. My theory was that the people who want to migrate from developed countries have greater ability to do so than people from developing countries. Read that sentence again. By definition, that is a small group of people, most people in developed countries do not wish to migrate. You are saying that because more Indians migrate than Britons, indians have an easier time of it. That is beyond childish, it is idiotic. To do a true comparison you would need to find the percentage of Britons that wish to migrate, let's say 5% and the percentage of Indians that wish to migrate, let's say 95% and compare outcomes. Even you can do the math on that and see it's a losing argument which is why you put together that silly argument. 

&gt;I would say people migrating through marriage are rare

That is your opinion, informed by YOUR experience and it is not true. 

There are two types of immigration policies - family reunification, and skilled migration. In the past family reunificaiton was the norm, but skilled migration has taken off inthe last 40 years. 

Look at this chart- http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Research%20Papers/2013-14/FamilyMigration-2.GIF?la=en

It's from here:
http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/FamilyMigration

You can see that family migration was historically the norm and still makes up 30% of migration to Australia. That is not rare, that is ONE in THREE. 

With the stem visas, again you entirely miss my point. 

&gt; You can't just be an English teacher in first world countries, for one most of those countries are in Europe in which case good luck if you don't already have an EU passport, then there's the fairly abysmal pay.

Did you read the four categories? Because I never said anyone can move from a FIRST WORLD COUNTRY to a FIRST WORLD COUNTRY by teaching english. That is information suited for FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES to DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. Where even you, must admit, there is merit in distinguishing that opportunity by where the person is coming from and where they are going. No one is paying Indians to teach hindi in Alabama. 

&gt;As for the requirement of my mentioned areas, it's nigh on impossible to migrate to first world countries unless you're in a shortage occupation, can get a talent visa (or are otherwise established in your field), or can get some form of family reunification visa.

30% of migration to Australia is family migration. That is not nigh impossible, again, that is ONE in THREE. You really cannot see outside of your box. 

&gt;But in general they still have a strong, if not stronger, preference for local talent over foreign talent due to high unemployment and underemployment rates so if you don't offer something that locals can't e.g. a higher quality foreign education plus some experience, or native/strong English skills, or in some places creative 

Please try to be more self aware. I am from the first world and have lived in the developing world and lived in other first world countries. I can speak to that experience. I cannot speak to the experience of going from a developing country to the first world. 

You clearly do not understand the dynamics of moving from a first world country to the developing world. No one is moving there to compete with local talent at the local rice factory. When foreigners enmesh themselves into the third world it is in upper middle class jobs that are wholly connected to their status as foreigners. There are endless paths that open up for foreigners once they are on shore through other foreigners. 

You are using your own experience and extrapolating what first worlders must have to do in the developing world and it is completely wrong.

It seems Southampton have built themselves as a platform to launch careers, then to sell the player to the highest bidder, while keeping the players no one else really wants. The top players are in a revolving door onto better things, while players such as Long or Tadic stick around as this is realistically the peak of their level. This leaves a core that isn't cut out for Europe level football, and instability caused by a constant reshuffle.

West Brom however seem to have built a core from players who have stepped down for more playing time, combined with a few interesting prospects and seasoned veterans to look to. They know that if they kick up a fuss and demand to leave, they will only get cast aside rather than sold. 

I guess I see Southampton and instable, a platform you jump from, whereas West Brom have got the foundations of something that can be built upon. Which is insane considering Southampton's incredible youth system, but it seems to be working against them.

I got a decent promotion and my wife essentially just began working this year.  We have never been 'bad'. 'Discovered FI' in march 2016 and began actually trying to save, it was not hard for us as we had been using YNAB for years and don't carry debt anyway.  2016 combined income is roughly $230k.  2017 will be roughly $260k.  Two kids, 3 and 7.  I am 33 and she is 35.

At the start of 2016:

* No CC debt.
* Owed ~$10k on minivan
* Networth of -$43k.  I don't count the equity from the house, only the mortgage debt.


At the end of 2016:

* No CC debt.
* No car payments
* Networth of + $75k.  I don't count the equity from the house, only the mortgage debt.
* Maxed 401k, 403b, 457k accounts.
* Maxed HSA
* Increased emergency fund from 3m to 6m.
* Went on super-fancy disney vacation.
* Finished rec-room above garage (DIY).  Nice home theater / workout room now.

[Chart from YNAB](http://imgur.com/TcbF1Et)

2017 goals:

* Continue no CC debt
* Maybe a small car payment - I'm not opposed to a &lt;2% car loan for less than 10k as long as we save.  We want an electric car.
* Max 401, 457, 403 again
* Max HSA again
* Maybe redo the bathrooms (DIY).
* At least one big trip, yellowstone/hawaii/europe
* Put 50k into post-tax investment account or rental property

Big question to answer this year - Trying to decide between rental properties and investing.  I feel like we buy a lot of funds via the pre-tax accounts and company matches.  So many horror stories about rentals, but also a ton of successes.  I am a big DIY person and feel like I could handle it (may even be fun).  But with two working people and little kids, time is premium.  Either way, post tax or rental.  

Im sitting at a 40-50% savings rate overall.  Im probably staying here to maintain a balance between now and later.

1) The most important part of TW series was transitions between strategy and tactical part of game. Every killed soldier counted, every veteran unit was even more precious. You could win the battle with little losses but it was all eclipsed by a lost of this unit of 18 cavalryman (from original 80) with golden experience bars. That was most important success factor for me - the battles alone wouldn't be enough, although they were important in big picture. C&amp;C and Starcraft were totally different genre so I wouldn't bring them into discussion. I spent some fine time with EU 1 but it was different concept of game. 


2) It is useless feature under current flawed mechanics. If there wouldn't be this illogical maintenance cost increase with every new stack=commander there wouldn't be any additional cost. And in R1 and M2 the difference in city income (thanks to leader) was in thousands of gold every turn, not to mention being able to control taxes directly when leader was in town (there was an option to turn it off thou). Btw Medieval 2 was hight point in series so most of the time I will be comparing to that title. I can't count how many times I've used ""only cavalry"" stacks, especially on eastern parts of the map - where cities were really far far far away from each other sometimes. Anyway, it is a topic for very long discussion about strategies. 


3) The AI was always sending armies around, not to mention rebels hiding and looting here and there, so there was always a need to fight a battles. And cavalry stacks were helping a lot to speed up things. Moreover the wars in Europe were always quick, because Pope was always issuing a warning to catholic states and You always need to race against a time, storming city/castles not waiting them up. It was so interesting mechanic. Anyway, there was a need to fight enemy army first, because it would go back to surround own cities defending them in large numbers. Also I was playing always with the biggest unit size setting - because battles and campaign time was optimal then. Because of that, if I remember correctly, recruiting time for many units was 2 turns. And there was limit to how much You could train in one city/castle per turn. 



I'm always annoyed when someone tries to tell me what or why I think, especially when They are wrong. I admit I have rather nostalgic and less enthusiastic approach towards new mechanics in games but it is mostly because games in last years had some very bad turn towards faster, quicker, more shallow and simpler, better looking on twich or youtube mechanics. Probably because young generations prefer that. That is bed - IMO - therefore I wouldn't agree with these changes with exception for UI improvement which is good overall change. But I have this bad habit to try to see what could be other person point of view and understand that he or she might have different taste or opinions. That is why I prefer to firmly defend my point of view more and in the same time not to be intrusive or trying to change opinion of other person. It is a bad habit, because in these times very little persons have similar. Usually it is ""my right is the only true one so agree with me or be gone"" approach. Not saying it is Your kind of way but in last months got really bad experience and few times I broke my own rules and behave inpatient and wrongly with my replies. I was just tired of some things.  
The only thing that annoyed me in Your opinion was this assuming things and trying to tell me why they are so wrong - because I still stand by my point as my own vision of perfect game. 


I would like to apologise You for my part of this ""little escalation"". I really don't have pleasure in any kind of forcing arguments or quarrelling or trolling. You have absolutely right with discussion being best way to improve some things. I always have this problem with English being not my primary language, so everything takes me longer and simple checking spelling (even with autocorrelate on) is taking ages. Thank You for Your opinion but I think we will not agree in stacks=leaders issue, which to be honest is fine. :) We don't need to agree on everything. :)  


So in the spirit of the New Year I would like to wish all the good things and a happy New Year. :) And say sorry again for being rough or saying things that maybe I shouldn't.        ",totalwar

I am European, yes. I was raised in a bilingual home (Swedish/Finnish), and have spent 10+ years speaking English on a daily basis. I don't consider myself fluent in neither English nor Finnish, though. 

In English, my pronunciation slips when I'm tired or riled, and I make frequent slips between British English and American English vocabulary. On occasion, I find there are words I don't know and sometimes my syntax seems strange to a native-speaker. I can speak, read and write without putting much thought into it though, and I read academic English within my field well enough to not need to translate it.

In Finnish, because I've mainly used the language in speech, my reading is slow and requires focus, and my spelling is about the level of a 12-year-old. I've never taken classes in Finnish. I can read in Swedish and listen to/respond in English at the same time (and vice versa), but I have to tune people out to read or write in Finnish. Reading academic Finnish within my field would be possible, but difficult, and require translating words to English or Swedish. My pronunciation is good enough that I sound native to Finns, and my Swedish accent sounds a bit Finnish because I grew up on the border. 

I don't need to think to swap between Finnish and Swedish, or Swedish and English. I can swap in the middle of a sentence should I need to, that's how my childhood conversations worked. You respond to the language the person speaking to you is using, regardless of what language the conversation was in originally. I haven't much practice with swapping between English and Finnish, so I think that'd take more time. I also can't do conversations between all three languages at the same time without one of them suffering in some way. ",AskReddit

That battle is over - globalism is a done deal now. For Asia and other low wage economies, it's working out very well.

The only winners in disentangling are professional opportunists who will suck up a lot of the costs of change). N.B. Russia, China, ASEAN, and even EU have each been very busy assembling as large trading blocs as they can as this gives greater protection in a global context, not less.

Cats are also lactose intolerant (it's a mutation that we aren't, it's normal to not need milk after weaning) so milk and dairy should be given sparingly as a treat, if at all.

Your cat probably isn't jealous so much as territorial. Is your cat inside only? Cats rely most heavily on smell, theirs is just a bit less good than a dog's, so you'd have to get pretty far away for her not to smell the scraps you're giving to the strays. Probably off the patio would be a good start though, if you can give scraps off of your property.

Also, I'm not sure what part of Europe you're from and what animal welfare access you have, but if you hate seeing skinny cats who really need food and you're able to, try to get some/as many as you can of these strays neutered. One female cat can have ~100 kittens during her reproductive lifetime.

Hopefully some of this helps!

Oh, and if your cat isn't neutered, neutering does help reduce territorial behavior, especially as it applies to other cats. Cats will always be a bit territorial, but neutered cats need less land and resources because they aren't thinking ahead for their progeny.",Pets

It is estimated that the average electricity rate in Italy, the highest in the world, is about 21 cents (of the United States dollar) per kilowatt hour (kWh). Italy is followed by Germany, a nation known to take substantial advantage of residential solar energy panels, at 19 cents per kWh. Portugal is a little higher than Spain at 13.85 cents per kWh, and the list continues with Belgium, Slovakia, France, and other European nations until we come up with the U.S. at position 13 with an average 10 cents per kWh. Cheaper rates than the U.S. are found in Australia, South Africa, Finland, Canada, and Sweden.

The World Atlas list does not include Costa Rica, perhaps because it did not touch upon Third World countries. Still, we have the current electricity fees listed by the National Power and Light Company (Spanish initials: CNFL), which handles billing for a good portion of the Greater San Jose Metropolitan Area (Spanish initials: GAM).

As of July 2016, CNFL subscribers who consume between 0 and 300 kWh per month are charged three rates: assuming an exchange rate of 545 colones per $1, from 8:00 pm to 06:00 am, they pay 27.47 colones per kWh, which is about $0.05. From 06:00 am to 10:00 am and from 12:30 pm to 05:30 pm, they pay $0.12 per kWh. From 10:00 am to 12:30 pm and from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm, when many expats in Costa Rica watch primetime programming from the U.S. on cable and satellite TV systems, they pay $0.29 per kWh.

Once monthly consumption exceeds 501 kWh for CNFL subscribers in Costa Rica, they could pay as much as $0.39 per kWh during the peak primetime periods mentioned above.

CNFL lists average consumption for a family of four in Costa Rica to be around 200 kWh per month.",worldnews

The people that are saying he's a bad leader are the ones that are useless, they couldn't even get their shadow chancellor re-elected, lost the leadership elections and think Kesia Dugsdale is going to somehow win back votes in Scotland.

Probably agree overall. Probably don't agree in details.

&gt;The peak of demoralization is yet to come. 

You're kidding right? Demoralization? As in in: To undermine the confidence or morale of; dishearten

Or do you actually mean loss of moral authority?

Many parts of the West have been totally coasting, while important positions have been asleep at the wheel. This is not new. Seattle 99, etc. If the threat of Islamic terror (even at a much larger scale) would be all that such behavior incurred, this would be an argument *for* continuing such shitty policies.  

Compared to most any historical era we have it very, very good. I will concede that (especially the sightly younger generation) including some parts of the West do face some serious struggles (especially in immaterial or relative terms). But compared to the fall (or rise!) of the Soviet Union? Meh. 

A bunch* of refugees (and immigrants, and, yes, likely with an above average percentage of misfits, free riders, criminals, 3rd class terrorists, and people who are hard to integrate) gets your knickers in a twist to a degree that you get all emotional? To a degree that a significant minority of your crowd abandons all due process and starts burning asylum seeker accommodations insults and harms most likely innocent people? 

As long as such behavior does not get called out - at the very least in a diplomatic manner - you're harming not helping. Of course you can always blame all kinds of stuff on the rare-&gt;mythical politically correct lunatics and SJWs. But does that fix things on the ground? Does that help the debate?

Then, why on earth would I throw in my lot with a bunch of useful idiots and patsies?

&gt;Until then, hundreds of innocent lives will be taken away, and millions more put at risk in the name of tolerance and progress. Islamic terror attacks will become even more frequent.

Hundreds? Hundreds??? Have you ever opened a history book outside of a classroom? 
You're not even in deaths-by-repeat-offending-drunk-drivers, or utterly preventable rape numbers there. To say nothing of HIV pandemics posed to spill out of e.g. Russia.

I certainly can. Like any game where you receive a number or badge that is supposed to indicate your skill, people tend to get very upset when they think it is being dragged down by another.

Many games of a competitive nature presumably suffer from this, but CSGO can be particularly bad because you're stuck with these people for up to an hour. You can mute them, but that's a big disadvantage as a team.

Also I don't know how it is over in the US, I assume it's not a problem, but the language barrier in Europe is sometimes an issue, particularly with the infamous 'Ruskis' xp. Some just talk very loudly all game in Russian, and get very upset when you have no idea what the hell they're saying. Others they just ignore you all and play alone.

But for all the stick people give CSGO's Community (and rightfully so in many cases), there are some really great people playing, and basically all my Steam friends I met through CS.

Could it be that Ben sided with Snoke, pulling with him a group of these kids to form a sect of the Knights of Ren and leading them against the new Jedi Order and essentially causing lots of death throughout, making it necessary to relocate those who were left?

Modernization by the influence of Europe Africa has a good economic structure but little telephone connection, little electricity, own culture, parliament, constitutional monarchy, religion varies by region, no European gods, no European gender roles//
- hunters / collectors, own guns, feed on tubers, flesh, insects, generally plants / fruits (rare), fish only in tropical areas, clean drinking water, own fields, agriculture well managed//
Own currency depending on area,
Alliances of the empires ensures the benefits of the participants,
(United Empires), the goal is the avoidance of war, better conflict resolution, the internal market, a better solution for conflicts, general communion with sovereign empires, before UE there were wars, after that the empires remained for themselves, then they decided for mutual support and peace treaty
Monarchy works because it is democratic.
Assassins are from third world and want to rebel against neglect, problem for third world is that they are the only part of the world population that is non-alliance, other countries have had alliances for a long time prior to the UE , third world was used for raw materials, lost in wars in which Africa got through, so letters are used as a threat (eventually)

The War: How has Africa managed to get through?
- no modern weapons, but strategy and fauna (fantastic addition)
-Guerrilla wars
-ship fleet? Africa may be in disadvantage-Still in planning
European continent is more modern in the following respects:
-power / infrastructure, telephones (education / services (f.ex. medicine) that means there are pills, in North Africa pills are expensive, but there are herbs
Education in Africa there are also schools, no telephone masters except between castles because Africa can not yet pay for costs (taxes, electricity)
-&gt; Taxes must be paid for the expansion of infrastructure because Africa does not have its own generators.

Why war? Still in the planning stage

This sounds political and actually reminds one of our world situation but I wanted to give it a fantastic touch ( with the flora and fauna for example).
I also thought about it like that: The third world sees the only possibility in attacking through an assassination because it wouldn't have a chance otherwise, So it forms secret alliances to attack the African kingdom because it is the weakest yet. And maybe the other empires can't aggressively act on it because they would put their economy in danger since they rely on the third world as a source. The UE works together so they can act on it. A goal of the assassins could be to chop the mentioned phone connection so that Africa is alone.

&gt; Blackfield is a collaboratorive music project led by Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. Together with the English musician Steven Wilson, they have released three albums under the moniker: Blackfield and Blackfield II as equal partners, and Welcome to my DNA with Geffen taking a more dominant role. With the release of  Blackfield IV in 2013, Wilson is taking an even more passive role, acting only as a contributor and mixer, and played his last live show with Blackfield in April 2014.

&gt; Current band members are drummer Tomer Z, bassist Seffy Efrati, and keyboardist Eran Mitelman. Former band members include Chris Maitland (replaced by Tomer Z, 2004) and Daniel Salomon (replaced by Eran Mitelman, 2007).

&gt; Collaborative era:
Formed after a meeting in 2000, the partnership blossomed into a cross-cultural collaboration called Blackfield.

&gt; Aviv had discovered Porcupine Tree in the mid ‘90s and followed their career development. In 2000 he invited the band to perform some concerts in Israel and met with Steven in London to discuss working together. Before long they had collaborated on the first Blackfield song. In 2001 the two met in a studio in Tel Aviv with the intention of recording a one-off EP.

&gt; The results of the session were so impressive however, that the EP was cancelled and the decision was made to continue writing and recording a full length album. Over the next 18 months the pair fitted in Blackfield writing and recording sessions whenever they could between their other commitments and finally in October 2003 the debut album was complete.

&gt; The collaborative songs alongside songs written by each separately brought a unique meeting of cultures, which resulted in the self titled album, which was hailed at the time as 'hypnotically effective' (Classic Rock) and ‘another strike of genius from Steven Wilson’ (Eclipsed).

&gt; Blackfield II arrived in February 2007. The pair’s return was greeted by an equally enthusiastic media response with Clash describing it as ‘a lush but soulful mix of separate cultures, deep sounds and touching lyrics,’ and CMU proclaiming it as ‘simply another complete triumph from the duo.’

&gt; Geffen-led era:
In January 2009, to promote his first English-language European release, Geffen went on a small tour of Europe with the Blackfield live band, including Wilson being billed as a special guest. Half of the set consisted of songs from the then yet to be released first English language solo album by Geffen while the rest was a selection of Blackfield songs. Wilson would also appear on three tracks from the album.

&gt; In April 2010, Geffen and Wilson got into studio to begin writing the follow-up to Blackfield II. However, this time, all songs, with the exception of the track ""Waving"", were written by Geffen, as Wilson had been concentrating on his second solo album, Grace for Drowning, at the same time. Wilson only performed lead vocals on five of the eleven tracks, but provide backing or co-vocals on several other tracks. Their third album, Welcome to my DNA, was released on the 28th of March 2011 and supported by a European and North American tour following a kickoff concert in Israel. However, several concert dates were cancelled due to the death of Wilson's father in May 2011.

&gt; After touring for Welcome to my DNA was completed, Wilson confirmed that with Blackfield, like the majority of his other projects, he himself had no particular plans for the future, but the project wasn't necessarily over either. However, in January 2012, Geffen has announced his intentions to release a fourth Blackfield album by May 2012. This prompted Wilson to announce that his role would continue to lessen, with Wilson acting only as a contributor and mixer. Wilson said of the band's future:

&gt; ""[…] just to clarify news elsewhere of a new Blackfield album coming this year – please note that this time my involvement will be as a contributor rather than a member. I will still be mixing the album, and maybe sing on a couple of Aviv’s songs (there will be other guest singers I understand), but with my complete blessing Blackfield is now under his sole curatorship, a process which really began with Welcome to My DNA.""

&gt; Wilson later admitted that it was his own idea for Geffen to take over the project, because Wilson wanted to concentrate on his solo career and Porcupine Tree in 2012 and 2013, while Geffen wanted to do another Blackfield album right away in 2012, and Wilson felt guilty about holding him back.

&gt; On January 29 and January 30, both Geffen and Wilson were in the studio working on vocals and guitar for the fourth album. Wilson stated that he will contribute lead vocals to only one song, but is also contributing ""a bunch of guitar parts"" and ""arranging backing vocals"". Despite his lessened role, he still said that he was ""protective of the Blackfield legacy"", and that the next album would ""still sound like a quintessential Blackfield album."" One of the guest vocalists that Wilson had alluded to before, was revealed to be Vincent Cavanagh of the band Anathema, who recorded vocals for a track.

&gt; On June 14, 2012, Geffen announced he was in the final mixing stages of the album with Wilson.

&gt; In a September 2012 interview with Discord Magazine, Wilson reiterated his stance with Blackfield, stating:

&gt; ""I won’t say producing [the fourth album], I am only helping [Geffen], a bit of singing, guitar, mixing whatever it takes but I am not going to tour, it’ll be too much, I’ll kill myself, would just run myself to the ground. I won’t tour Blackfield anymore but I will do anything to keep the name going…I just don’t think that writing the kind of style that Blackfield make is where I am at right now.""

&gt; At the end of November 2012, Geffen stated that he roughly aims for an April 2013 release time frame. Wilson confirmed that he sang and played guitar on several tracks, but ""much less than before"", that Geffen was able to get ""a bunch of great singers to contribute to the record, some of whom are quite well known"", and that the album would be the first that Geffen would consent to be mixed for surround sound.

&gt; On February 25, 2013, Wilson released his third solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories), of which some copies contained a compilation sampler disc of music done by artists under record label Kscope; one track was a new track, ""Pills"", taken from the fourth Blackfield album.

&gt; On June 9, 2013, it was announced that the fourth album would officially be titled Blackfield IV, and its release date would be August 26, 2013. Read more on Last.fm.

 - As others have said, there's no need to stay in Versailles.  A day trip from Paris should be fine.


 - When in Rome, consider taking the train to [Ostia Antica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QILcwMjilgc), a large archeological site that was the location of the harbour city of ancient Rome.  It's fascinating and well preserved.


 - You may want to do some mini-trips around Tuscany from Florence.  Siena is a lovely place to visit.  A few months ago, while staying in Florence, a friend and I took a day trip to Lucca and Pisa.  It was a long day, but worth it.  Alternatively, you could stay a night or two in Lucca and visit Pisa from there.


 - While in Italy, have you considered seeing the [Cinque Terre?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP316ABiTt0)  It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of 5 towns full of colorful houses and vineyards along the beautiful Italian coast.  It's not too far from Pisa/Lucca, in fact.  Many people like to hike between the villages, but you can take the train or water taxi.


 - Make sure you have at least one night in Venice because nighttime, in my opinion, is magical in Venice.  All the cruise ship passengers and day trippers leave, the city empties out and you find yourself wandering small streets, crossing bridges and falling in love with getting lost.  As another person said, one full day and night for Venice and one day for the islands is enough. 


 - Since you're traveling with your friend, in some places AirBnB may be cheaper than even a hostel.  It's worth checking.



 - Always Google ""free walking tour [name of city]"" and find out about tip-based walking tours that may be offered.  It's a great way to see the city and meet other travelers.  




 -   Download the [Rick Steves App](https://itunes.apple.com/hr/app/rick-steves-audio-europe/id414357125?mt=8).  Since you're not from the US, you may not know this guy, but he's a pretty famous travel show host from N. America and his specialty is Europe.  Anyway, his app is FREE and includes clips from his radio show so you can listen, learn about different places and perhaps choose where you'll go when your friend leaves.  Oh, and the best part about the app is his audio guided walking tours.  He has 4 tours for Paris, 10 for Rome, 3 for Florence, 4 for Venice and probably some for other cities you'll be visiting.  Again, it's free and each tour takes 1.5-2.5 hours.  It's an excellent way to see the major sites on your own time.  Rick is great, but he's kind of down home, folksy and a little cheesy at times but his information is good and he's not as dry as some tour guides who remind you of your most boring uni professor.  Plus, it's free so you have nothing to lose.



 - I'm sure you'll be find to travel solo.  It's not a big deal, to be honest.  Just take normal precautions when it comes to scammers and pickpockets.  I've been traveling the better part of 2 years in Europe and nothing has happened to me.  Of course I'm a white guy and my personal anecdote about safety means nothing, but statistically speaking, you should not have to worry.


 - English is the *lingua franca* of travel so there's no need to worry.  Sure, it can't hurt to learn a few words in Italian, but most everyone you will deal with as a tourist in Rome will speak some English.  Even if you happen to pop into a café where no one speaks English, you'll manage with gestures, a smile and the few words in Italian you already know, like ""cappuccino"" for example.  Oh, by the way, never order a cappuccino after noon in Italy.  If I were to study any language for this trip, I would study French.  The French really appreciate if you can at least say a few words in their language.  
 - As far as where to spend your last two weeks traveling solo, I guess this will depend on a few different things.  
* Where is the final stop for you and your friend traveling together?
* Do you have any interest in staying in that area?
* Where do you want to go/see?
* What will your budget permit?
* Where is your return flight from?

 I don't know you, but if this were me, I would plan for cheaper destinations for my final two weeks.  I know I always tend to spend more when I'm traveling with someone else.  We end up going to nice restaurants, having an extra bottle of wine and just spending more money on various things.  I'm a little more frugal when I travel solo.  Knowing this about myself, I would look at more budget friendly destinations to help balance out the more expensive cities I'd be visiting with my friend.  Places like Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Croatia are all very budget friendly, offer a great deal to see and do and are very traveler-friendly.  Cities could include Kraków, Wrocław, Prague, Český Krumlov, Budapest, Split and Dubrovnik (or King's Landing if you're a ""Game of Thrones"" fan); however, Dubrovnik won't be as budget-friendly as the others.  In fact, the Croatian coast is lovely that time of year.

In general, most of Europe doesn't follow common law. As such, judges tend to have a lot more discretion and are usually not bound by precedence.

So I would argue that if people leave their religious tribe, there are plenary of other options. Nationalism is far from the best mode of tribalism, but it seems better than religion.

I also ask that people do not down-vote this if they disagree as I have provided ample resources for further reading and debate which is the point of this sub. If you find I have not provided good discussion please reply to me and state why.

Christianity, Mormonism, Judaism, Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, so on and so forth have all had their darker periods.

However most of these have had a ""reformation"" of sorts where they do not typically practice the ""orthodox"" version of their religion.  There are still some practitioners but they are not nearly as numerous. This tends to be even more true in America where even Muslims who travel here tend to be less fervent than those in the Muslim majority countries.

However the issue with Islam is that it is not just a religion with some guidelines it has very strict laws and is meant to setup a government to abide by aka ""Sharia Law"". [1](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law) Beyond this is the comparison of what are the ""seven deadly sins"" between Christianity and Islam that exemplifies a stark constrast. [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXa80iqZQqI)

The problem with the article that /u/Toastinggoodness linked is that it first discounts any terrorist attacks while the US was in Iraq. Sweeping under the rug nearly a decade worth of attacks even if they were on citizens and not US troops.

The second issue with that article is that it only considers terrorism and not actions that are violent (and illegal by our standards) but well within Sharia Law and its religious court system (such as killing non-believers, homosexuals, etc.). Thus the data is not an accurate definition of violence but simply terrorist attacks *except for those in Iraq from 2003-2011*. Using that it is easy to skew the data to make Islam look *slightly* less violent. I would suggest cation in using such data.

More importantly are the beliefs that most Muslims have. According to Pew Research here are some brief statistics of Muslims and what they believe categorized by question asked and in which area they reside: (All % are medians)(* = Significant outliers) 

Questions|South Asia|Southeast Asia|Middle East-North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa|Southern Eastern Europe|Central Asia  
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--  
Do you support Sharia Law?|84%|77%|74%|64%|18%|12%   
Should Sharia Law apply only to Muslims?|60%|55%|51%|N/A|64%|59%  
Should those who leave Islam be executed?|76%|27%|56%|N/A|13%|16%

Table Source. [3](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/)  

*Note*: Palestinian Territory (Middle East-North Africa) had ~40% for the last question. Most likely due to conflict with Israel.

This allows us to easily see the contrast between Muslims based on where they live so to some degree your environment does have an effect and the ""reform"" movement is an example of this. However that does not mean we should discount that many of the basic laws in the Quran are inherently violent and (by US standards) highly illegal and immoral. Thus the reform movement. 

It is worth-while noting that many orthodox religions (even Christianity) have this issue. They are not easily compatible (if at all) with westernized standards.

Here is Ben Shapiro (note right wing bias) going through some more Pew Research on Muslims: [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7TAAw3oQvg)  

Here are lists of terrorist attacks you are free to go through them and see which religions are causing the most of them: [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2016)  


However it is important to note that Islam is not without redemption. There are serious reform movements attempting to westernize it and of those movements the most important one to note is this one: http://www.muslimreformmovement.org/  

It is important we support these movements as much as possible.

Here is an interview from one of the people leading this reform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWNv97yq4Fc

The show and the plot is intriguing for sure. I watched both seasons. I finished the 2nd season this Christmas. 


Although you can enjoy the season as a regular audience, I noticed there are subtle brainwashing moments that most of the Hollywooders are now doing. 


If this spoils you, skip my comment. I need to because it's where the brainwashing theme kicks in. 


1. Juliana, a refugee in Nazi Reich, having a dinner with her savior family. A kid asked *""Is it true that they eat dogs in Pacific states?""* Juliana answered *""No.""* She teased **”They only eat cats.”** She later said **”I’m teasing.”**
&gt;My observation: It's not like in-your-face stereotypes, but it keeps this ""dogs/cats-eating"" east asians stereotypes going. Now if you wonder what's wrong with this. Here's what could have happened. **Horse** meat was considered States Delicacy in Europe back in the days. You eat horse meat in states dinner. These days, we don't eat horse meat. You could turn this **horse eating** habits of Europeans into European stereotypes. But Hollywood don't make it and don't promote this history. So this horse eating stereotypes disappeared, while dogs/cats eating stereotypes continues to live on.  A typical White American response would be **It's just a TV show. Don't take it serious.** 


2. I forgot her name, a Japanese American woman who became rebellious towards her own government in Pacific states. [That’s how good the show, making her name forgettable, and yet only for a sex toy.] She appeared out of nowhere. Frank Fink joined the Resistance later. Do you actually believe the sex clip between Mr. Fink and Ms.Rebel necessary in the show after they successfully retrieve a small portion of explosives? The sex was just a night. It’s NOTHING. It adds nothing to the story. 
&gt;My observation: According to Hollywood, it is necessary to have an Asian female to have sex with White looking Jews. Frank Fink has nothing to look like a typical Jews. But they make him Jews in this show. His friend could have been a real Jew with such a profound nose display. 
&gt;My 2nd observation: When a Japanese kimpeitai arrested Ms.Rebel (Remember both are East Asians), The Kimpeitai became shooting and Ms.Rebel appeared to look like **Madam in distress**. Mr. Fink appeared out of nowhere, picked a gun on the street, suddenly looked like an awaken HERO from all the rages he accumulated inside, shot the Kimpeitai. Ms.Rebel is finally released. That moment showed only a White guy can save an Asian woman from an evil Asian guy. A typical White American response would be **It's just a TV show. Don't take it serious.** 
&gt;My 3rd observation: They could have made a Japanese American guy to become rebellious, joining the Resistance and fighting against the Evil Empire. They don’t, and they won’t. Only a true freedom loving Asian girl will do so. 


Those are my take on racial dynamics from MITHC. 


If you want more, here’re more of the story I think need to happen.


1. The show cannot continue to season 3 unless they come up with some Sci-Fi thingy going on. You can’t have a guy traveling between the alternative world and the reality, hoping the audience will love this without any mention of time traveling. The only thing I can imagine, is just like *Neo in the Matrix*, those Trade Minister, Chief Inspector, Obergurper (formerly fighting for American troops) can’t spell it right), they are all living in their dreams of alternative world. 

2. The grasshopper file reels, and all others, they all have another reality recorded by someone. Unless you have some theory to explain all of this, I can see this MITHC will become another **LOST** series.

I believe we're using the 'conservative' title differently, but I'm not really sure there's a right or wrong answer. I'm guessing it's due to different cultural backgrounds, which is awesome - I always find these discussions illuminating. Perhaps a better word would be 'fundamentalist' Islam, instead of 'conservative'? For instance, I'd consider wahhabism as 'fundamentalist.' So, the correlation I was referring to was a noticed shift in popular opinion that plenty of historians have noticed. Various groups in the ancient Muslim community argued the discussions over philosophy and mathematics lead to the questioning of Muslim theology, and that such questioning was dangerous. They argued their societies ought not suffer what they'd consider apostates, and would often emphasize particular verses of the Koran that they'd interpret as less...lenient towards non-Muslims. Again, this is merely a correlation that has been noticed; though it is true that some historians try to argue it's a matter of causation. But if these movements were involved, it's sad to think they might have brought down a 'golden age' for the Muslim world.

I think I might have called this movement 'conservative' because of my own society's background. So, I'm from the U.S. Groups that I'd consider similar to the groups described above are groups such as the extremely fundamentalist Christian movements that often advocate (either implicitly or explicitly) violence towards other religious groups; claim that modern society is borderline satanic - to the point that secularism is often equated with satanism - and must be forced back into line with Biblical law (or at least their interpretation of biblical law); insist on seeing the world as west-versus-Islam; etc. They are often casually referred to as 'conservative' religious groups, as opposed to 'moderate'.

But yes, please know we're not all blind to history. It is a shame that more in the West do not realize the ancient Muslim world experienced a fascinating renaissance of culture, philosophy, mathematics, etc. long before Europe did, and that while we in the West have not just the ancient Greeks and Romans to thank for our culutural history, but also the Byzantines (shout-out to Eastern Orthodoxy), the Andalusians, the Ottomans, the caliphates, the libraries of Damascus, etc.

Anyway, I'll end this rant here as it's not relevant to the OP. I just wanted you to understand I did not mean to offend and I hope I've explained myself well enough to show that we likely agree, but the words used might differ due to our different backgrounds.

The elite also want to implement carbon credits.

Canada is starting to do so.


everyone on earth will be given the same number of 'carbon credits' so a person living in a village in India, who doesn't even own a car, will suddenly has a 1000 carbon credits. If a family in America wants to have two cars and heat their home in winter they will have to buy credits from poorer countries.

Every citizen would be issued with a carbon ""credit card"" - to be swiped every time they bought petrol, paid an energy utility bill or booked an airline ticket - under a nationwide carbon rationing scheme that could come into operation within five years, according to a feasibility study commissioned by the environment secretary, David Miliband, and published today.

The idea was floated in a speech in the summer, but the detailed proposals show Mr Miliband is serious about trying to press ahead with the radical idea as a central part of his climate change strategy. Under the scheme, everybody would be given an annual allowance of the carbon they could expend on a range of products, probably food, energy and travel. If they wanted to use more carbon, they would be able to buy it from somebody else. The report admits huge questions would have to be resolved, including the risk of fraud, the relationship to ID cards, and costs. However Mr Miliband said ""bold thinking is required because the world is in a dangerous place"".

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/dec/11/uk.greenpolitics

In a few years from now you will have another plastic card in your wallet - your carbon card. You will start the year with 1,000 points on it and each time you fill up your car, you put the card in a slot on the pump and it will deduct a few points. Each time you buy an airline ticket, it will cost you a minimum of 100 points. If you fly regularly, you may have to buy more points through the carbon market - but since it is all in the cause of reducing greenhouse gas emissions you do not mind so much.

Just like we used NGOs ( plural ) to destabilize russia, iran, ukraine, etc. By using the NGOs as fronts to fund and recruit the opposition within china? 


&gt; A lot of this law is connected to the people effected by the economic slowdown, growing information sharing ability, and loss of face as foreigners help Chinese people who the PRC and Chinese people simply refuse to help.

Yes. That's when the NGOs are the most effective. But if what you said is true, then the chinese shouldn't have let the NGOs in china from the beginning...

&gt; A huge amount of NGO work targets orphans, people with disabilities, minority groups, women and children, animals, etc.

Of course, because we are such saints... Wonder why these NGOs aren't helping out the millions of americans suffering...


&gt; You need to ask yourself why a government would restrict outsiders from trying to give these groups a better life.

For the same reason obama deported a bunch of russian diplomats and shut down two russian NGO compounds... 


Besides, if what you say is true and these NGOs are only there to help ( utter nonsense but imagine if it is true ), then there shouldn't be any problem.

Perhaps the chinese are more naive or trusting, but if they were smart they would ban foreign NGOs like russia did a few years ago.

NGOs are just fronts used by the west to destabilize other nations. No different than how european powers used to send priests/clerics/etc as the vanguard to spy on and destabilize non-european nations in the past.

&gt; The Tea Party is a Canadian rock band from Windsor, Ontario, with blues, progressive rock and Middle Eastern influences who formed in 1990 and disbanded in October 2005. They reformed in 2011 to play some shows in Canada. They have released seven albums commercially during their time together. Guitarist and vocalist Jeff Martin, who has perfect pitch, was also producer for almost all of their albums.  All three members played a range of instruments and they took up to 37 on tour with them at times in their career. They were very successful in Canada and Australia, and to a lesser extent in Europe, but never managed to crack the American market.  

&gt; The band received some media criticism for Jeff Martin's Jim Morisson-like stage persona in some of its videos and their Led Zeppelin-esq riffs, although he seemed determined to be striving to create his own image and sound.  His looks certainly do draw some comparison, however, to The Doors' late front man.

&gt; Their sound is hard to categorize as each album possessed different themes and influences.  Splendor Solis (1993) was a more acoustic, blues-based record, while  Edges of Twilight (1995) was much darker with strong Middle Eastern influences on several tracks. Transmission (1997) saw a dramatic change to a darker, more industrial-tinged sound, and it was distributed in the USA by Atlantic Records. The last three albums by the band featured various efforts to attract a wider commercial audience, with the single ""Heaven Coming Down"" reaching No.1 on the Canadian mainstream charts in 1999.  

&gt; In 2000, Capitol Records finally released a retrospective compilation in the USA of their Canadian singles entitled  Tangents after only releasing their first two albums south of the border. 

&gt; The Tea Party released The Interzone Mantras in 2001, but it did not possess the singles of its predecessors. 

&gt; In October 2005, a year after their final album Seven Circles was released, Jeff Martin left the band and embarked on a solo career, releasing an album in early 2006. Jeff Burrows (drummer) and Stuart Chatwood (bass/synthesiser) have also had post-Tea Party successes, the former in several projects and the latter in soundtrack composition. Burrows and Chatwood worked together on a new project called The Art Decay before Burrows joined Crash Karma in 2008.

&gt; On April 12th 2011, an official Facebook page was launched with a biography section that closed with ""The band is scheduled to play a select number of dates in 2011. No other info was available at this time."" The following day, the local radio station K106.3 announced the Sarnia Bayfest lineup including The Tea Party, which was later confirmed by drummer Jeff Burrows on his radio show on April 13th. Burrows further stated that a Canadian tour was also in the works.

&gt; The Tea Party performed at the Cisco Systems Bluesfest in Ottawa, Ontario on July 14th, 2011, and the band will be playing a Canadian tour commencing on November 15th, 2011 in Vancouver.  The band's website and tour is called ""THE TEA PARTY - No Politics... Just Rock and Roll"". In September 2011, the band was reportedly approached to sell its website URL for over a million dollars by the extremely popular American political movement bearing the same name:  www.teaparty.com.

They knew that educated people from poorer countries in the EU like Greece or Poland would move to Germany for better wages and opportunities. They knew it would be unlikely to cause much unemployment since uneducated people who tried to move here would likely fail (and turn to crime as we've seen).

They just didn't give a shit, because the EU makes the elites in Germany and France richer due to the massive banking and trade benefits provided by the system. By accepting the Euro, countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal, etc. lost their ability to strengthen or weaken their currency to encourage imports or exports as their economic situation dictates. Instead they are stuck with high unemployment, a trade deficit with Germany where Germany receives the agricultural products of those countries as well as other relatively cheap local goods, sends over all sorts of high priced electronics, vehicles, etc. and basically gains in every way while the majority of people in those other countries suffer. 

Then Germany pushes austerity on those poorer countries when the banks in those countries (who are often run by people essentially put into place by those high up in the EU when the Euro first started) fail, which was the logical conclusion of the corruption and cronyism that was put into place by the EU. Again, most of the brunt of austerity is borne by the poor and middle class, those struggling to get by in shitty economies. The EU is a mess, but I don't think it got this way accidentally.

Ask some emmigrants today what do the elections look like in reality. Look at their economy. Look at the crumbling healthcare, where you can't often get even the basic things, not even with bribes. Look at the various examples of absolute desregard for human lives.

The US influence is about economy. It is mostly good for both parties. Not all the time, but the other side can say no and fortunately does (at least in Europe). It is different with Russia. Look what they did in Ukraine. 

The US doesn't usually bribe politicians so much, it does't damage everything it touches. The US is a successful country, Russia is not.

Get a strong enough Russian minority, especially the very rich Russians, and your town might happen to change certain rules, for example about local nature protection, building, and such. Many russians are great people, but the problem lies in the others. Of course many leaving russians are normal, good people, as some are leaving not only because of the poverty, but for other reasons too.

The media are not free in Russia. Some online newspapers need to be published from abroad. There are political prisoners. And forget about various human rights. Homosexuals (and other people from LGBT community) don't have many rights, they can be judged for ""bad influence on youth"", or they can be killed by their ""friends"".

We don't distance ourselves from anti-semites, Nazis or Holocaust deniers, because they are part of the Alt-Right. While I might not be either of those personally, I *do* recognise that they are part of the movement and are here to stay.

I will give you my definition of Alt-Right, just to clear the air:

The Alt-Right is a movement of Right-wingers who are unified under the common goal of achieving ethnic homogeneity in each European country. That's it. That means you can have Nazis, Libertarians, Monarchists, Neo-Reactionaries, Conservatives, etc. in the group. If you desire ethnic homogeneity and the traditional family, you could be considered Alt-Right. Other beliefs are variables.

&gt;What do you advocate actually doing to achieve a racially or ethnically homogenous society?

I would argue that we need to strictly control immigration *except for returning inhabitants of the nation*.

They have specific programmes for IT technicians these days, as well as mechanics, carpenters, electricians, etc. After completing their obligatory workplace training [they can usually build on those](http://i.imgur.com/MYW9ly7.png) to get more academic degrees, protected titles etc.",talesfromtechsupport

I like this team overall but my issue is with Jesiz unfortunately. I think he's a really good League player really good. Though in my opinion, he falls into the category of a man of many things and a master of nothing.

When I think of 
Bjergsen = Great mid laner
Faker = Legendary Mid laner
Namei = Great adc laner
Doublelift = Great adc

He can play adc a little bit, he can play support a little bit and he can play mid lane a little bit. As I mentioned before he's that talented he can pull it off on a high level to some degree. 

My issue here is that even though he can play these roles a little bit can he play the support role to the standard that Fnatic are going to need and expect? My answer to my own question would probably be no.

The support role is soo complex and demanding that I actually believe that the support really needs to be the best or second best player on the team to see any real level of success. In this case, I would say he's perhaps the weakest link

On the whole though EU is looking good for this year can't wait to see some of the games.

**Dignitas	Ssumday	Chaser	Keane	LOD**

This team looks legitimately good Ssumday needs no introduction and is a really strong top laner, Chaser is an amazing jungler and I'm not quite sure how Dig got the both of them. LOD is good from what I've seen from him now and again. 

Xpecial and Keane are the question marks does Xpecial still have it in him to go another season or is he past it and has Keane sorted out his champion pool so he can play like a proper mid laner. 

**Team Liquid	Lourlo	Reignover	Goldenglue	Piglet	 Matt**

I think this team looks over-rated Goldenglue is a huge liability in the mid lane and Lourlo is a liability in the top lane. It could be a case of damage limitation for this team. Reignover would've done better for himself joining C9C. I fear he's with Liquid for a quick cash grab.

Edit: Why am I being down voted it's an opinion statement on paper Jesiz seems like the weakest link, I'm sure even he would say that I'm not being abusive just honest. Dignitas looks good and TL looks weak I'm not the only one saying that on this forum either.

Edit to follow:

Guys guys! I'm sorry! I found this post from the front page, and replied in a semi hungover state.  I never even realized which sub I was in.

u/Turbotroll, you are absolutely correct and after such a warning from their mods (or in this case your comment) an edit like this would follow!

u/ubermcwinsauce, I respectfully disagree, as even a cursory understanding of linguistics should be enough to reject the bunk put forward by u/terkala which, lacking sources to the contrary of established linguistics, needs no actual effort to rebut.  That which is asserted without evidence may also be rejected without evidence.

And now a rebuttal:

Neither Native Americans and First Nations peoples, nor far east peoples like the Chinese or Japanese cited as counter examples by OP, are my area of expertise; nor, to be fair, are linguists.  However I did consider linguistics for a while during undergrad and took a few courses in both the actual linguistics department as well as the anthropology department at my university.  All that is to say I am by no means speaking authoritatively, but rather as a semi-well informed lay person.

Now, u/terkala is, I believe, completely wrong.  Going line by line through is comment, some errors are:

1) Referring to ""European languages:"" as though they all share common roots and phonetics.  Languages in Europe are divisible into the Romance languages, the Germanic tongues, the Slavic tongues, Greek, and Hungarian.  These all interface with one another, but assuming that they are all equally able to handle Chinese and unable to handle Sioux is silly.  Also, this neglects that the OP was asking about English *in particular* and assumes that all European languages translate Native American names into their own tongue (or, presumably, into English).

2) He assumes that all European languages have no trouble pronouncing Chinese words.  That's just blatantly false.  Chinese has a tonal element that is very difficult for English speakers in particular to pronounce.  I don't know if u/terkala has tried to correctly pronounce a Chinese name or phrase, but it often takes numerous attempts.  This is why often times Chinese business men or exchange students adopt an ""English name,"" something close to their name (usually) but able for English speakers to pronounce.

3) Geographical distance has nothing to do with the phonemes present in the language.  In what I know of Native American languages, there are no phonemes I'm unable to pronounce.  I'm not saying they aren't there, but I am saying is sound similarity was the deciding factor, then Arabic names would be translated since English lacks the sounds for Haa', Saad, Daad, Taa', DHaa', 'ayn, ghayn, qaaf, and hamza.  That's a lot of letters.  And yet, Saleh al-Din we don't translate, or even attempt those phonemes. We just butcher it down to Saladin.  Contrastingly, a number of the US states and Canadian Provinces are named in Native tongues, and not butchered, likewise a number or individuals names are also not translated: u/ctrlshiftkill has a lovely list of both, above.  And to u/terkala's reply to him that place names remained untranslated for trading purposes, there are also a number of places whose names were translated, a topical example being Standing Rock.  I really doubt that pronouncability was the deciding factor.

Now, I don't have an explanation for why we translate the one but not the other, if I were to venture a guess it would be that Native Americans self translated their names so that English speakers could understand them, because they hold meaning and the Native Americans wanted to share that meaning.

And to u/terkala directly: I'm sorry my initial answer was not ""a well sourced rebuttal"" and that I didn't do ""better than"" you.  However, putting forward such an unsound hypothesis with no justification and presenting it as though it were an actual explanation from an anthropologist (is is r/askanthropology) is unacceptable.  If you're just going to guess at why and BS an explanation, please refrain from posting at all.  Likewise, if you're going to go ahead and post jibberish like your original answer, don't get snippy when it is dismissed off handedly.

The accepted story now, is that Blair and his so called sofa cabinent (i.e. just him and only a few advisors) made the decision to go to war unilaterally. A number of senior memebers of Labour disagreed (Robin Cook resigned as Foreign Sec for instance). Consequently Blair had to literally sell the war to them. And one of the costs was to ensure that all Human Rights obligations were to be meet. Though at the time they did think it was primarily going to be a Humanitarian exercise, so it would have seemed a natural thing to do.

The question becomes why when it became obvious that we had taken a deep bite of a shit sandwich, why we didn't call for opt outs then. (PS I'll try to find an article describing this concept for you). The answer to that is that for a few years we thought we were doing better than we were (I'd say it shifted in Sep 2005). Then when things started to get bad, it was too late to make changes. To admit the difficulties would have caused trouble domestically. Here this isn't a specifically Labour problem, I think any polticial party would have made the same decision. To admit we were going to roll back to some serious combat operations would have taken a specially brave Prime Minister. One we wish and hope we would have but usually don't.

I'll see if I can find an article on these opt outs.

&gt;
&gt;At the same time, however, **China’s growing assertiveness and coercion in the maritime domain** and on the diplomatic front are creating great anxiety in the region and wariness over **China’s regional strategic ambitions**. China’s self-declared “peaceful rise” is looking a lot less benign to its neighbors as it flexes its muscles **in the South China Sea** and seeks to **divide ASEAN on key issues**. In response, many ASEAN countries are seeking to balance their economic dependence on China with stronger security ties with the United States along with other regional powers, like Japan, India, and Australia.


&amp;nbsp;

Liang's comment:

It is a propaganda to describe China's defense of its sovereignty over the South Sea 9-Dotted Line as ""**China’s growing assertiveness and coercion in the maritime domain**"".  The truth is it is Viet, Philippine, Malaysia, etc. who are making invasive claim on China's sovereign waters and territories.   The US is inciting aggression in SE Asia against China in order to suppress China's rise.  At the same time, the US is attempting to subjugate the SE Asian countries by pretending to be their champion.  But once China were suppressed by the US, then the US will turn around and subjugate and dominate the SE Asian countries.  Therefore, the SE Asian countries should know that the US has no fundamental desire to help them but only seek to incite and exploit antagonism between them and China so as to divide them and conquer them individually.  

I think the SE Asian countries realize this.  This is why Philippines has turned against the US and Brunei never had any keep love or trust for the US anyway.  Viet, of course, had a catastrophic war against the US and would probably not be so stupid as to think the US now regard them with love and would want to help them fight China without any self-interest.  

Ultimately, other than the 9-Dotted Line dispute there really isn't any deep conflict of interests between China and the SE Asian countries.  Once the US has been removed from SE Asia, there really isn't any thing to make China unacceptable to SE Asian countries.  Rationally, it is obvious that China has the biggest potential to benefit SE Asia economically.  Unlike jap, US and many other Europeans countries, China had never tried to colonize the SE Asian countries.  Historically, China had brought economic prosperity and technological advancement and cultural enrichment to SE Asia.  As China's domestic economy and technologies expands and develops, it will be able to provide all the most advanced products for SE Asian countries while at the same time can invest in all the SE Asian countries to develop all the local economies.  And trade will also expand as Chinese people migrate to the SE Asian countries to increase local productions to create jobs and provide goods and services.  This will then create the fundamental development of all local economies throughout SE Asia unlike the predatory businesses of the US and jap which only suppress local industries to sell American and jap products.

Ultimately, China's relationship with the SE Asian countries will be symbiotic while the relationship of the US and jap will be parasitic.  Only China can pull the SE Asian countries up the development scale along with China's own rise while US and jap will reap profits for themselves by trampling down the SE Asian peoples.",Sino

Both of the events being the most basic celebratory occasions.

But interestingly, not everything is meant to be so cheerful in The Peasant Dance. In the same way The Hunters in the Snow have a hidden meaning, it is widely regarded that Bruegel indeed intended to send a deeper message with the painting, depicting not only the dances, but also various sinful activities (the group of people on the left of the most prominent dancing couple, but also dancers in the background with their backs turned to the church) like drinking and over-eating.

Still, I think the painting belongs here. It is the first Bruegel painting I ever witnessed, when I was younger, and which made me love all of Bruegel's work. Why? I was told it was the Renessaince - the great Italian artists were all about painting magnificent mythological and epic scenes, and Bruegel was there, painting peasants and their daily activities, the equivalent of what immeasurably important and influental European writers such as Giovanni Boccaccio (the author of The Decameron) were doing in their phenomenal works - bringing human themes into the world of art.",Exhibit_Art

Because the immediate and short term effects tend to be felt for a long, long, long time, and set historic precedence. China outright ignoring international law against it, and finding no one to enforce it, or even facing any economic backlash tells China and everyone else paying attention: If you're strong enough, no one is going to do a damn thing about it. And honestly, we just elected a President who's  far more isolationist, who wants to have the US involved less inf oreign affairs. If it's not the US doing the enforcement, either through direct military confrontation, or economic sanctions who else? The Europeans? HAH. The Russians? The Chinese? 

When you have law you need a police force to enforce it. When you have international law, you need an international police force to deal with it. Which is why the Americans have been for the last 60 years the world's Police Man. But we're tired, and it is becoming increasingly evident that our efforts are highly unappreciated. So fukkit. Let Europe deal with shit on their own. Let China dominate t he South China Sea. Let Putin rebuild the Soviet Empire. 

And if you think countries like China, India, the US, and even Russia are going to put any major economic sanctions on Israel (which is becoming a massive global trade partner to all of these countries), so they can protect the Palestinian cause, you're fooling no one but yourself.  That's the harsh reality. Even the Arab countries are willing to cooperate with Israel against the Iranians, than they care about the plight of the Palestinians (who, by the way, they treat as second class citizens).

Israel should have long ago annexed the region, began absorbing the population that was within the West Bank, and if you were an Arab with roots back in historic Palestine and you left, or no longer in that country: tough luck - welcome to how almost every other refugee group feels and has to put up with.

Well, say you spend two to three seconds trying to restart it, but for whatever reason it won't. If the bicycles are traveling at 35 mph, they are covering approximately 50 ft per second. So, in that time they've closed half the distance. Now the guy is supposed to move the bike to the side before the first bike gets there 3 seconds later? No way. A modern European or Japanese bike weighs anywhere from 450 to 600 lbs, depending on model of course. At the minimum that bike weighs close to 400 pounds, and that's if it's a 250-300cc bike.

* Ghost in the Shell – na categoria longa-metragem, simplesmente minha animação favorita. Gosto muito quando usam a ficção cientifica pra abordar temas existenciais, além de que sou fascinado pelo estilo das animações japonesas dos anos '80~90.

* Hellsing (2002) – o ""remake"" que saiu recentemente se aprofunda mais na estória, mas acaba colocando uns clichês de anime nada haver com o tom da série. Assista a primeira versão, não tem erro, tirando o final em aberto.

* Mushishi – não é bem um seinen, mas acho um ótimo anime pra quem está começando. Cada episódio é uma estória com começo, meio e fim; você pode começar assistindo hoje e só terminar ano que vem (can confirm, fiz isso com a segunda temporada).

* Jormungand – como você não gostou de Black Lagoon, talvez não goste desse.

* Jin-Rou

* Aoi Bungaku Series

* Stranger: Mukou Hadan

* Psycho-Pass

* Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin

* Deadman Wonderland

* Samurai Champloo

* Cowboy Bebop

Edit: Acho que você deveria dar mais uma chance a Neon Genesis Evangelion, não consigo pensar em outro anime que explore tão bem a psiquê de seus personagens. O começo pode ser bem clichê, mas o desenvolvimento da trama é muito bom. É a minha série animada favorita.",brasil

No one is disputing that.

Holy shit you have no idea what you are talking about, An arms race is what brought forth MAD, which was literally the only thing that stopped the soviets from Striking the USA with nukes.

You do realize they openly admitted that was not the case? 

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31796226

Putin straight up came out on TV and stated they planned it before hand, that's how little they cared.

&gt; you think we shouldn't insult them and tiptoe around the fact that they invaded another sovereign nation.

No i think we should work towards Peace. Listen, i know you democrats have been beating the Red scare drum since Hillary was running but i like living in a non radiation filled world. So unless you can actually put forth a realistic plan of some sorts ill currently stick to the one with a proven track record of working. Mainly being MAD, while working towards peace.

&gt; Putin is most certainly very happy with you and Trump. Putin now gets to build up and hang onto the Ukraine with no consequences.

Oh boy, you clearly dont see the funny part here. You see that happens either way. Or do you think calling him names some how makes him give up crimea and stop building nukes? Perhaps you dont understand this but **Russia is keeping crimea no matter what, and they are building Nukes no matter what** You calling him names does nothing to deter this from happening. Your literally advocating we do jack shit but instead act like children and call him names. Your plan is actually void of all logic.

&gt; China isn't insulted by Trump's call?

I don't give a shit if they **Pretend** to be insulted that we talked to someone. Furthermore what kind of hypocritical shit is this? On one hand you claim that we should intervene in Crimea against the Russians but then in the next breath claim we should not even so much as talk to the people of Taiwan? They literally had the exact same thing happen to them.  This goes to show the left truly has no regard for the case and is simply acting to ""spite"" the right. Pathetic.

&gt; And, we will do nothing to help Taiwan if Trump's pursuit of personal gain and blundering caused by internal factions in his administration force China's hand... that much is clear.

Help how? there part of China rofl, the USA recognizes them as part of China. 

&gt; That's a shame. Putin would be happy with that too... makes us look even weaker and sows yet more chaos in the South China Sea.

Wait wait wait...your now going to claim that Trump not being a giant pussy for China is a sign of weakness now? Like Obama was literally a pansy in this situation and Trump doing the opposite is somehow weakness that Russia likes? Im not even sure what to think of that. You cant even remain logically faithful to your own points, you are contradicting yourself repeatedly with your stances.

&gt; Good for Russia. Not for us.

No the absurd Russian claims you keep trying to put forth with Zero evidence.

&gt; The funny thing about you attempting to school me on Taiwan is that you just made my point...

My point was that you understood so little of the situation that you were unable to even understand the current situation Taiwan is in. I would say that was enough ""schooling"" as it clearly showed you have no idea whats going on.

&gt; Why do you think we have such a delicate relationship with Taiwan? Hmm...

Because the past Presidents have refused to even so much as talk about the situation. Furthermore as Ive already stated China is not on the same tier as Russia, one has More nuclear weapons than any other countries on the planet (Russia) the other has less than 1/12th the amount the USA does (China)

Its also super hypocritical of you, ""Contacting Taiwan? Fucking bad. Contacting Ukraine? Good!""

This clearly shows you don't understand the situation and you don't have a reasonable plan in the slightest.

So what is it? Should the USA try to intervene in countries that have been forcible taken over? or should they not contact them at all? You have literally made both claims.",politics

It's a collection of German dialects which differ from the ""normal"" German quite a bit but are easy to learn (at least to understand) for German speakers. I think it sounds a bit like Dutch to some.

We have quite a few interesting words in our vocabulary that differ from the German words: 

- Poulet instead of *Hähnchen* (Chicken as in food); taken from French

- Ygregg instead of *Ypsilon* in some dialects; taken from the French y greque

- Gomfi instead of *Marmelade*; taken from the French confiture

Then we have the usual suspects: Computer, Selfie, TV, Router, Adapter, Smartphone. Many words surrounding new technologies are taken directly from English.

The most interesting to me are the terms surrounding football (soccer, for y'all Americans).

- We use corner, penalty, goalie instead of *Eckball, Elfmeter and Torwart*. 

- To play soccer in Swiss German is ""tschuutte"" (choott-eh), not like the German ""Fussball spielen"". Why? Tschuutte directly derives from ""to shoot (a ball)"". 

The reason for all those words with English roots being used here but not in Germany is boarding schools. After football got popular in England, British students were sent to boarding schools in Switzerland and brought the game and terms along. The 1879 founded and today still existing FC St. Gallen is the oldest football club on the European mainland for that exact reason. ",AskReddit

You point to other countries that have historically had low gun crime rates, and lower rates of violence overall in your earlier post. The only thing I would point out is that many of those societies are significantly more homogeneous than what we have here in the US. The social cohesion that goes along with that homogeneity is a pretty strong contributing factor to the lower levels of violence that often gets overlooked. Look at the Czech Republic or Switzerland. They have some of the least restrictive gun laws in Europe but do not have correspondingly high levels of violence per the UN. While the data sources are admittedly sketchy, I don't think it's fair to make a sweeping statement that simple firearm ownership correlates to high levels of violence. Look at Central and South America. They have very restrictive gun laws in most cases but have extremely high levels of gun violence. The problem is not firearms. It's societal. To say otherwise is disingenuous and you yourself have admitted it's too hard to address so the easy route is simply to strip away our natural rights. I'm not ok with that.",guns

American-style capitalism, with the injection of Keynesian socialism in the '30s, was an anomaly as far as western economics is concerned.  That's why the economic royalists, as FDR called them, have spent the last 50 years dismantling it piece by piece.

No they wouldn't. Who are you trying to fool? If that's the case, then groups on the side of humanity from the SDF through to many other Iraqi militias would love to have you on board given what ISIS has done to Europeans and others.

&gt; What I think it does is it makes civilians flee with the IS when they retreat

Civilians don't move with ISIS. Only time we've seen civilians retreat with ISIS is when those civilians were in cahoots with ISIS (see Albu Ajil tribe in Tikrit). People say ISIS uses civilian shields because they operate out of schools, mosques and backyards deep inside civilian territory. Not because they literally have people caged as shields, that's something you only see groups like Jaish al Islam do.

&gt; Quarter of the city is recaptured, yet the UN estimates that only 100,000 civilians have been displaced, with 1.5 million still thought to be inside Mosul.

Not sure what that has to do with ISIS retreating, like what they did from most of Nineveh plain given all the propaganda they've heard about the PMU.

&gt; The IS was conquering the territory from disbelievers. They had every incentive to make people flee to ethnically cleanse the region. Glad you admit Shia militias have the same reasons to be there.

No idea what that means, but in 2014 ISIS use to release a lot of propaganda which demoralized the Iraqi army, rebels, SAA and Peshmerga causing them to flee and allowing ISIS to capture large swathes of land without problems.

[What Palin said in October 2008](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/28/palin-on-ukraine-i-told-you-so/) was:

&gt;""After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Senator Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's Putin to invade Ukraine next.""

First, Putin was not President of Russia in October 2008, [Dmitry Mevedev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev) was inaugurated as the President of Russia on 7 May 2008.

Second, [George W. Bush was President](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/world/europe/16bushtext.html) in August 2008 during the [Russo-Georgian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) so it's difficult to see what ""reaction"" Palin was talking about other than then-candidate Obama's rhetorical ones--which don't differ markedly from those of President Bush:

[Official Statements on Russia-Georgia Conflict](http://www.sras.org/official_statements_on_russia_georgia_conflict)

There is something to be said for the notion that the U.S.'s less than robust response to Russia's permanent occupation of Georgian territory might have encouraged Putin's later intervention in Ukraine more than six-years later, but there's nothing conclusive that makes the connection.
    
Predicting something will happen on the spur of the moment without making use of available evidence or data is just a lucky guess.

Something you seem to not have an appreciation for is that your ""freedom"" is really just a function of American freedom and your ""socialism"" is really only possible due to America providing and paying for your security. 

You also don't seem to understand how the ""two party system"" works in your ignorance. You think we have a two party system because you have no depth to your understanding of the genius of the American political system. But since you are such a naive fool sitting pretentiously in the Europe that we make possible for you to be so smug about, I will provide you with a lesson. Our ""parties"" are really more political, governmental, and ideological philosophies and ideals and values that all have to cooperate and negotiate and collaborate way before any election and are represented in our primaries. What you saw, if you paid attention, during out primaries was really a fight and debate by as many parties as each candidate represented. We essentially has 17 ""parties"" on the GOP side and 6 ""parties"" on the Democrat side, on the full spectrum.

What you foolishly see as a ""two party"" system is more akin to a runoff. It's the finale. It's as stupid as saying that the World Cup is a two team sport. Just plain foolish. Don't be foolish anymore. 

Your smug self-righteousness doesn't make up for being wrong, no matter how much of a smug Euro fag you want to be. I know you types well because I've spent my time in many places in Europe and with many Europeans of different persuasions and strata. Your smugness is really just hubris. 

You think you are free? You pay 45% income tax if you make even a respectable income in a country with wildly lower income levels and you pay 25% VAT/sales taxes on products that are more expensive. You want to tell me you are ""free"", when about 50% of your income is taken from you from a paternalistic socialist government that thinks it knows better how to spend your money and look out for your interests than you? You are about as free as you are taxed because it does not only drain the fruits of your own labor from you, it also shackles you to the very indenturing system, because you are dependent on it and it creates a dependency mindset that is so common among Europeans, a la, ""but I can't live without the shelter of my health care and don't know how to function if I have to make decisions and be responsible for myself"".

Here's a little secret, that ONLY works in societies that are homogenous where people have shared valued and shared goals and shared cultures and ideals and traditions. Now Norway is not as bad as the places where the ethnically native culture will be a minority in their own country, but just wait until people who do not share your interests and values start getting their hands on half of the value you produce as measured through your income. You can see a small indicator of that all throughout Europe as socialist governments everywhere are misusing and misappropriating money they have stolen from their people in order to advance and enrich and look out for the interests of people who are not those who they are legally and ethically obligated to look out for, or be a fiduciary for.

They didn't ditch their culture but they actively adjusted themselves to their new life.

The slippery slope argument is a false one. Actions don't always escalate beyond all morals that restrained them when they began. It's like saying that using imprisonment to punish offenders against the state will escalate into the state using imprisonment against anyone for trivial reasons. Sure there needs to be safeguards but either extreme is wrong.

I guess it would also help to know exactly what motivated the previous years' rapists. If it's muhammadan teaching then good luck to Germany with solving that issue.

Oh my ex is also 24 and from Zhengzhou (中不中呵呵呵).  How did you two meet?  I love Henanese people despite the stereotypes.  my ex, her older brother and the others I've met from the region seem to speak with American accents (if they can speak english at all).  

&gt; How integrated did you become with Chinese outside of the service industry or Chinese that don't interact with foreigners much/at all?

Those are the only people in my experience who generally speak English well enough to take on a accent from America/England/Australia/etc.  Hmmmm of those I knew outside the what you just set, I was friends with an accountant from Harbin, a history prof from Jiangsu, a few law profs from Shandong, CCTV travel host from Gansu, a few Uighur waiters that went to uni in Malaysia, an army lieutenant in intel, etc.  All spoke with American English accents.

Hmmmm, my ex's dad was the head of a SOE in Zhengzhou and spoke very simple english in what sounded like an American accent to me (he did business trips in Europe and Africa quite often), same with her bro and the rest of her kin that I met.  

My best pal is from Shandong and studied at a uni where people tended to go into the foreign service after graduating.  He and I met while studying in the UK and he and the rest of the folks that came to study abroad with him used American accents.  I've spoken with his parents a bit but either in Mandarin or very very easy small bits of Mandarin (his dad can say ""is it delicious?"" and the ever useful ""I think I'm/you're drunk"" he seemed to have more a Chinese accent than American or English accent).

&gt; British English is what's taught in school unless the teacher is American or studied in America.

From what I've seen they teach English with British spelling but with American accents.  At least in Beijing, Zhengzhou (maybe you can pm me what schools in the area your wife went to, my ex seemed to grow up learning english with an American accent), Shandong, Hangzhou and Fuzhou they seem to learn with british spelling and American pronunciation.  Not to mention the many people I've met from the other regions around China.  The few I met who had actual English accents went out of their way to get them.",videos

[Homemade gnocchi](http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/italy/how-to-make-gnocchi-an-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/), perfect if you're hosting a fancy dinner party and want to impress people. In my opinion, best served pan-fried in butter with cherry tomatoes and pesto or basil.

[Mushroom bourginon](https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/01/mushroom-bourguignon/), another good one for if you're having people over or just wanna be fancy.

Not a link, but my go-to easy-to-make comfort food is a vegetarian loco moco. Throw some rice in the rice maker or a pot. While that's cooking, pan-fry/grill a veggie burger (I personally like gardenburger brand, or you can make your own) and make mushroom gravy from one of the mix packets you can get at the store. Throw the rice down first, then the burger, fry up an egg real quick on the pan you cooked the burger in and put that on top. Then, the gravy goes over everything. Maybe not *the* healthiest thing in the world, but hey, that's why it's comfort food I guess.

Now, some more general advice:

1. Not everything has to be made with tofu. I personally don't like tofu at all, except occasionally in curries and Thai dishes. If you're looking for a meat substitute for traditionally meat-containing dishes, try seitan or tempeh instead. I think they both have way better texture, for starters. A BLT with tempeh instead of bacon is actually pretty damn good, if you throw some seasoned salt on the tempeh while cooking it.

2. Look into cuisines beyond standard American fare. A lot of ethnic foods use way less meat than what we're used to. Many Indian recipes, in particular, are vegetarian. [Chana masala](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/236564/chana-masala-savory-indian-chick-peas/) is a good example.

3. Field Roast. It's somewhat expensive compared to a lot of meat substitutes, but it's really, genuinely good in terms of both texture and seasonings. 

4. If you wanna go fully vegan and are looking for cheese substitutes, Daiya and the ones made from almond milk are the best. If you're going homemade, never trust any of the cauliflower-based ones, the texture and flavor will never work out.",AskReddit

To some that might be okay, but not the people in this sub. Europeans by in large will be minorities in many of their countries in less than 50 or 100 years.

Added on are the health and identity problems mixed race children can have. Organ donations are harder (HLA matching is impossible in most cases) and some diseases can be more prevalent. Think of it this way, mutations have evolved for thousands of years for people of the same race. Some of these mutations are recessive. Mix races, and that all goes away.

I also know many people who are mixed race who have a damn hard time fitting in to groups.

There are always exceptions to the rules. BUt taken all together I just don't see what whites have to gain by race mixing. And I'm not saying we should try and prevent all race mixing, some people will do it and no amount of laws will stop it.

The conversation is at a stand still becuase the vast majority of people screaming for anti-immigration refuse to believe that capitalism/imperialism is to blame for the surge of refugees. When their homes have been bombed into dust, where are they to go? Eat rats in the street? Eat each other? 

If one ""flees"" to a Neo-Nazi party because of something as callow as being called a name a few times, they are exhibiting the extent of the ignorance everyone already assumes they have. Let's not pretend that these people do their due diligence of actually reading, *critically thinking about*, and evaluating positions. No. They believe in their idiotic notions of ""white genocide."" They believe that non-white human beings are enemies and should be killed. Plain and simple. One doesn't just ""flee"" to that. That kind of hatred and ignorance is built up over *years* of conditioning via family members or community members.

The most insidious thing of all though is that the system is working exactly as intended. The system *wants* these anti-immigrant zealots to come out in full force. Anything that keeps the periphery nations down and the primary nations in full force is what's wanted and expected. The wheels of imperialism are greased with blood and oil. 

More to the point, it's easier for people to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine an end to capitalism (and thus an end to exploitative suffering) Never mind that the latter has only been around for about 200 years, a microcosm of human history. But of course, all the nay sayers will come in and speak about ""what's my motivation"" or ""it's great in theory"", etc., etc. The same tired, worn out, doggerel we've heard for decades now.

2)  Bring rockets.  To paraphrase Beagle, if you have a rocket, you have a backup plan.  Double-pod activations almost always lead to reasonably good rocket targets.  Your heavy moves LAST, if you can help it, and holds the rocket for last.

This means that we should realistically only allow some people to inbreed to minimize genetic risk (and I'm not discussing the mine field that is power-dynamic abuse).

It's an all or nothing thing and combined with the risk of power abuse even with sibling relations, it's best to say that no one should be allowed to commit incest.",AskReddit

Someone went and forged a book, but forgot that Judaism's most core tenet is the Oneness of G-d? And then somehow a huge portion of Jewish scholars, Torah giants, didn't notice that it was outright heresy, and wrote numerous books based on it? It seems a little fantastical, to be honest.

In medieval Europe, there were two different competing metaphysical schools, platonists and rationalists. Latin philosophy was in the tradition of Boethius and Augustine, and was vaguely mystically tinged. Arabic philosophy was as a rule rationalist stemming from the schools of Al Farabi and Avicenna. Both were Aristotelian, but the former was more conservatively Aristotelian. Rationalist and Islamic Philosophy, since the early days of the mutazalliah, which Saadia Gaon was, maintained the radical the unity of G-d as its basic principle. On the other hand, Platonism was redeveloped in late antiquity as a way to unify the last of the pagan traditions to define itself against the emerging Christianity. While they had a radical unity at the top of the hierarchy, their day to deities were higher non physical creative and regulatory principles. If the sephiroth do in fact map to the neoplatonist model, then these deities would be exactly the partzufim. In an ironic twist of fate, Christian platonists considered them to be the persons of the trinity and Christian theology ended up cannibalizing the Greek schools. 

So there was a language and cultural barrier with the dominant religions defining the philosophical milieu in each land. Christians would eventually embrace Aristotle and incorporate Aristotle into their scholastic tradition. But before then, there was a tremendous backlash against the works of Avicenna, Averroes, and the Rambam which purported to use rational argument to disprove the trinity. Piestic traditions had been developed inside the platonic framework. Not only did these rationalistic and scientific philosophies challenge the old ways of thinking, but because they were at odds with the piestic traditions, so these philosophies were also considered to be literally impious. You might have heard the claim that rambamists were more secular than kabbalists. This was not true, and stems from this historical prejudice against rationalism.

This was the historical context of the Maimonedian Controversies. The Church was establishing orthodoxies, prohibiting the study of philosophies at odds with these orthodoxies, and burning the people and books which did not conform. The early kabbalists used this opportunity to use the Church to stamp out rationalist school and books being translated into hebrew by the ibn tibbon family. This famously led to the eventual burning and censorship of the talmud as the Church took it upon itself to widen the scope of what they considered to be heretical. This school of early kabbalists eventually became the dominant European school [under very interesting circumstances which had little to do with theology](www.chayas.com/AntiRAMBAM.pdf). They maintained the ban on philosophy as a rational practice. Following the expulsion from Spain, Safed would become a center of mysticism. The Ashkinazi/neosephardi/tosefotist school had differences in tradition and legal method with the existing Old Sephard tradition. R’ Qaro synthesized them into a unity in the S”A, and with the spread of his law code, went his hashkapha. After that, nobody really questioned kabbalah anymore as the study of philosophy and theology as a rational practice pretty much came to an end. Philosophy was banned, and the study of kabbalah severely restricted. [Here’s a post I did on the history of kabbalah](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/3v5rey/eli_5_kabbalah/cxkqjts/), and read the Faur article.

The TLDR, it was a very minor school of thought that existed in a small corner of the Jewish world where the problematic elements would not have been obvious. Church policy caused it to rapidly spread as the competing schools were surpressed. Following some politics and the expulsion of Spain, kabbalah found itself in the heart of a mixing pot of medieval thoughts which would end up becoming the Jewish common denominator at the beginning of the modern age. After that, critical evaluation of kabbalah came to an end.

At all points in this narrative, it is reasonable that a knowledgeable rabbi would not be able to identify the issues with kabbalah. The kabbalistic philosophy is not problematic or nonsensical inside the platonic framework. He is they and they are he, and meaning it, does not pose a problem. The four worlds of platonistic philosophies are one ontological reality, and each world is the world above and below. For Platonists, the number one, a body, and an army are all different types of ones. Oneness comes in degrees. The Oneness of the One, the Oneness of the Divine Mind, and the Oneness of the Demiurge are all One. This degree of unity is fine as far as Christians and Pagans are concerned. But Judaism makes a stronger claim on the degree of unity. We believe in an absolute unity of which there is none other like it. These stronger claims are primarily in Arabic language texts. Duties of the Heart, The Kuzari, Beliefs and Opinions, and of course the Guide. These books and arguments were not available to those early kabbalists. The philosophical implications of this degree of oneness is not obvious. It needs to be explained in technical language what the problem with weaker degrees of oneness is. This is hard to do if the study of philosophy has been banned.",Judaism

""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!
Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia
in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many
countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods
of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet
rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the
next of its dignity and sanctity.

The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as
his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must
delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased
to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid
qualities - but the influence of the religion paralyses the social
development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists
in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and
proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa,
raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity
is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it
had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell

&gt; Twisted Tower Dire is an American heavy metal band formed in Chantilly, Virginia in 1995 and are now currently residing in North Carolina and are currently signed to Remedy Records. The band stated their aim as ""resurrecting True Heavy Metal"", drawing strong influence from Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Manowar and others. In 1999, the band was able to record a self produced debut after a series of demos and split records. After releasing two legendary demos, several split EPs and contributing to various sampler CD's to critical acclaim, the band began working with long time fan and Solstice guitarist Rich Walker. He had recently formed a new label called The Miskatonic Foundation and offered to support the recording and distribution of the first Twisted Tower Dire album.

&gt; The band unleashed their self produced, full-length debut in 1999. Despite a modest budget, ""The Curse of Twisted Tower"" won over many dedicated fans that appreciated Twisted Tower Dire's traditional yet unique sound. From 1999 to 2000, the band embarked on a relentless, self-financed world tour in support of ""Curse"". This tour included U.S. appearances at the Milwaukee Metal Fest, March Metal Meltdown, The Powermad Fest, Phantasmagoria Metal Fest, and The North Carolina Metal Fest. A European stretch of the tour followed with fellow metal heathens The Lord Weird Slough Feg and Solstice including several club dates and appearances at the Wacken Open Air Festival and the Bradford Metal Inquisition.

&gt; In 2001, Twisted Tower Dire released the critically acclaimed ""The Isle of Hydra"" on The Miskatonic Foundation and Hellion Records. The album featured mature song writing abilities and improved production, but retained a certain underground grit. In support they played several shows in the Mid Atlantic Region and beyond, including an appearance at the Classic Metal Festival and a second appearance at the Milwaukee Metal Festival. In July 2002, Twisted Tower Dire returned to Deutschland to continue their relentless assault on small clubs and festivals abroad with a headlining appearance at The Headbanger's Open Air Festival.

&gt; In September of that year, Twisted Tower Dire signed to Germany's Remedy Records. Their third release ""Crest Of The Martyrs"" was unleashed upon the masses on May 26th, 2003. The song ""Axes &amp; Honour"" was released as a limited vinyl single and picture vinyl single. The release of ""Crest"" was accompanied by a European tour including festival gigs at the Metal Bash Open Air Fest and the Wacken Open Air Fest. 

&gt; Twisted Tower Dire has gone through countless trials and changes through its 10 year history but the seminal vision has remained the same from early basement practices to today. The ""Tower Brethren"" continue to fight for the legacy of Classic Heavy Metal with their strongest line-up and forthcoming 4th album “Netherworlds” in 2007.

&gt; On February 6, 2010, Tony Taylor, their former vocalist, died in a motorcycle accident.

&gt; The band appreciates the support of its dedicated fans and hopes to see you soon in the audience banging your head!

In your initial response, you referenced the slaughter of indigenous populations, and the richness, whiteness, etc. of early Americans. Your dubbing this ""the topic at hand,"" is entirely made up. The topic at hand is borders, and why we should or should not have them. The beginning of my response was merely to scorch the earth of the topic of colonialism, conquest, etc. and give you no more room to work (since it wasn't the point), and allow myself to get back on track.

To the point regarding the founding fathers. Your insults were clear enough, but thinly veiled to the point that you could feign ignorance and maintain plausible deniability. You're welcome to keep up that strategy if you choose.

You seem to think that people must correct for history. They must right the wrongs of the past, in this case by binding the hands of lawmakers today. Yes, the US was a product of conquest. No, the fact that the US was a product of conquest is not a carte blanche excuse to suggest they lack the authority to maintain security. 

I can happily say that I agree that in the case of an attack, I'd prefer an armed citizen on scene than the cops 10 minutes away. However, this is a such a drastic false equivalency to make in the context of legal versus illegal immigration. Coming here illegally doesn't make someone evil or weak, or attribute to anyone any other negative characteristic. It makes them unidentifiable and unknown. Foreign people are not entitled to the rights of American citizens, regardless of profession or skill. Again, this issue is about nothing more than security. I'll get back to this in a moment. 

You seem to have disdain for insults, yet you turn on that disdain so quickly to call me a child? Interesting how long that pillar of morality held out.

To summarize my argument for borders, I would ask that you look at the mainland of Europe right now. Swathes of *unchecked and unknown* migrants/refugees are sweeping through the continent. Crime is spiking all over the countries most open to taking in these people. Germans are now selling ""safe shorts"" to women made with alarms and kevlar to help women not be raped by migrants. Stockholm has had gruesome riots. ISIS sympathizers march through cities. Entire areas were abandoned by police in France who couldn't control neighborhoods (often made of tents) so packed with unassimilated migrants.

Nor did Aegon the Conqueror. I guess his legacy is forever tarnished as well? No, of course not. Many historical figures have great legacies despite having shit children (or no children at all). 

Tywin died at almost 60, he spent 40 years as one of a handful of the most prominent people in a kingdom almost the size of medieval europe. That does not just disappear because his children are incompetent. 

&gt; and his kids are going to end up killing each other. That's his legacy.

Aegon the conqueror's son ended up killing two of his nephews. Is that Aegon I's legacy? No, of course not, the accomplishments that he did in his life are his legacy. 

&gt; All his descendants die and his branch of House Lannister is cast down. 

So? These are Houses that have lasted thousands of years. There are going to have been many, many times in these Great Houses history when a cousin, uncle or nephew succeeded a Lord. 

If Robin Arryn dies and the grandson of Jon Arryn's younger sister takes over does that mean Jon Arryn's legacy is shit?

House Lannister in the Westerlands is more than secure and that is partially in thanks to the last 40 years of Tywin's rule (both official and unofficial). 

&gt;Hell, many of the Great Houses hate House Lannister because of him. 

Not sure what this has to do with one's historical legacy?  The kings of medieval europe often deeply resented each other.

&gt; That's not how Tywin sees it. He thinks of building a glorious new Lannister era

Citation? When has Tywin ever said he was disappointed with the last 40 years of the Lannister era?

Joffrey is a Baratheon as is Tommen. He is not trying to change that. 

He is trying to maintain the status quo, the Lannisters being hugely powerful and influential. 

&gt; It doesn't look very secure. 

Evidence for this? The fact that his vassals remained loyal even when the majority of the Kingdom was against them in ASOS shows exactly how secure they are. 

The Lannisters have recent marriages into some of their most powerful bannerman, their status as a result of this is very secure. 

Daven Lannister is Warden of the West and Damion Lannister the Castellan of the Rock. Between them they are in control of the Westerlands. 

&gt; He didn't leave a worthy heir to the Westerlands.

So?

Tywin was a teenager when he took control, as was Ned, Robert a little older. There is not some special secret to ruling, all the nobles receive pretty similar upbringings and many will have relatives and Households to help them. 

As you say, Tywin's children will doom themselves playing for the Throne. When one of Tywin's nephews takes over he will be OK. 

&gt; And well, the Lannisters might not hold Casterly Rock by the end of the series. 

So? There might not be a Westeros come the end of the series? Not sure your point here? 

&gt; He didn't win it

Yeah, he did. The War of the Five Kings is over. 

&gt; Stannis is still alive and even Tywin knows that as long as Stannis is around, the throne isn't secure.

Yes, and that would be known as a different war. But the War of the Five Kings is over. ",asoiaf

&gt;That is not how it works. As long as the maternal stays within the gene pool it does not die.

If none of the women carrying it have daughters, it dies out. Sons don't pass it on to their children. mDNA is ONLY inherited through the maternal line. Why are you having so much difficulty grasping this?

&gt;If we only mated and not evolved from Neanderthals the mtDNA would have gone extinct. 

Not if those unions bore daughters who bore daughters who bore daughters... So long as a maternal line remained intact, that mDNA (plus some new mutations, but mDNA mutates slowly) would continue indefinitely.

&gt;My example of the Ötzi shows you that.

No, it doesn't. And Otzi lived long after we Neanderthals ceased to exist as a distinct population group- much like certain agents are attempting to do to the European race currently.


&gt;The fact that the Ötzi mtDNA is extinct and the Y-chromosome is not shows you that it is impossible for us to have mated with Neanderthals and still have their DNA in us.

No, it doesn't. It merely indicates he had no sisters (or female cousins) who had an unbroken line of female descendants to the current age, yet he (or his brothers, male cousins, etc) had a line of male descendents reaching the modern age- much like Ghengis Kahn. This is simple genetics.",altright

If I were you I'd buy NA-Semax (and if by the rare chance it feels too weak, go for the stronger NA-Semax A) for energy, clairity and lucid focus.  And if you have the money I'd also look into purchasing the God noots P21 &amp; N-PEP-12.  P21 is a more potent version of E21, E21 &amp; N-PEP-12 are the two neuropeptides found in the Russian pharmaceutical Cerebrolysin.  There is a lot of research behind it and has been around for decades, though few know about it.  It has been used to treat traumatic brain damage, Alzhimers, ADD/ADHD, and is routinely given to patients coming out of brain surgury.  The gains from Cerebrolysin would appear to be cummulative and permanent.  P21 has only recently come back on the market, and along with Semax (both of which are nasal sprays by the way) can be bought from Ceretropic.  The hype for the return of P21 was so great that it crashed the site a few hours after it's resurrection was announced.  N-PEP-12 can now be bought in pill form (as opposed to having to break open a Cerebrolysin ampule, filter out the broken glass from the ampule, and inject it intramuscularly), the brandname is Memoprove, you can order it online.  N-PEP-12 was shown to boost the memory of the elderly by 15% after a single month of daily use.",StackAdvice

#***Gosick***
 
It took me longer than I expected but I finally managed to complete Gosick. The setting in a interwar Europe filled with intrigue is perfect for this show. The buildup during every case was greatly handled with every detail being necessary to solve each mystery and all contributing to the main story. In some cases the relation and implications with other mysteries is very direct, like the *Death of the Fortune Teller* and *Queen Berry's Voyage* cases.
 
Towards the second half of the mystery everything started to make sense. From the predictions of the Fortune Teller to the Leviathan story and the Coco Rose murder. All these pieces together unveiled a bigger plot of military and political intrigue that led to an unavoidable World War. As an historical anime, the politics and the way of thinking of characters like Marquis Albert are actually accurate. If you're interested in how the events and characters in the last episodes are a reflection of the history Europe lived in that time, I found this interesting [review](https://tlnotes.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/historiography-in-gosick/).
 
*Final Thoughts*
 
The serious and sometimes dark atmosphere of the show really helped the buildup of every mystery, but it was sometimes ruined by the forced comedy. I didn't find Kujo as a suitable companion for Victorique, I would've preferred a more serious and mature character.
 
---
**Favorite Character**
 
*Victorique de Blois*: I'm not a fan of tsunderes, specially violent ones (Taiga was my only exception). But she had a great development with a interesting background, her character design and outfits were beautiful, and in general she's an intriguing character I enjoyed discovering the different facets of her personality.
 
**Favorite Case**
 
*Undying Alchemist Leviathan*: This arc was great from beginning to end. A murder, a story of a man that produced gold, and a book with a mystery waiting to be solved. I really wasn't expecting the solution to this mystery and how everything was linked to the alchemist story. It's also a mystery of great importance because it foreshadowed what was coming, revealed important background of the main story and has great relevance in the Coco Rose mystery.
 
---
 
**Final Score**
 
This was a hard show to rate, lots of mixed feelings. Started as a solid 7 whit it's good *mystery of the week* format. Then, even though the mysteries got better, characters as Cecile and Kujo ruined the serious atmosphere and that made me lower the score to 6. In the second half things got better with the excellent Leviathan and Coco Rose arcs which boosted my score back to 7. After all the events of the last episodes and that beautiful prologue with a happy ending, I decided to give the show a **8/10**.",anime

You're not getting my point here. Balkanization happened as multiple geographically distinct nations in one country broke off from each other. Whites and blacks are not geographically distinct in the US, and are also not monolithic nations in the first place.

And even in the case of Balkanization, that had nothing to do with race, they're all Slavs.


&gt;It certainly is with that attitude, but liberals are already pushing for separation in California

Don't perscribe that to all of liberals. And Calexit isn't happening either. It's much closer to Texans talking about seceding than Brexit. 

The EU has a specific part of their treaty that allows countries to leave if they choose to. There has only been one time that states have seceded from the US, and they lost a war over it and were brought back in.

And even if they did, that's on the basis of an already established state leaving the country, not a ""white's only state"" which can't and won't exist, it's the exact opposite of the last 150 years of legal precedent in this country. You can't restrict people's freedoms based on the color of their skin.


&gt;Yes, definitely, because there is no objective standard for racial superiority.

So you accept that the basis in which you don't like blacks isn't based on objective facts or logic and rather your feelings and emotions. ",altright

L'Allemagne profite énormément de l'euro, elle n'a aucun intérêt à ce qu'il change ou meure

L'euro est un problème qui se chiffre en plusieurs centaines de milliards d'euros pour l'Allemagne, c'est la clé de voûte du système.


Un exemple pour comprendre : avant l'euro, quand un Grec voulait importer d'Allemagne, il devait acheter des marks sur le marché des changes, et l'Allemand ne voyait que des marks arriver sur son compte. La drachme se dépréciait si la Grèce importait beaucoup.

Avec l'euro, qui est une collection de 19 monnaies homonymes avec un peg de 1:1 échangeables entre elles sans limite dans la quantité ou dans le temps, si un Grec importe de l'Allemagne, on ne passe plus par le marché des changes : l'Allemand se voit créditer des ""euro-marks"" par la Bundesbank, et la contrepartie, c'est que la Bundesbank voit apparaître sur son bilan une créance sur la banque centrale nationale grecque. La drachme ne se déprécie plus.

Et comme tu le sais, la banque centrale nationale grecque n'est pas en excellente santé. Ni les banques de l'Europe du Sud en général.
Or si la Bundesbank doit créditer des ""euro-marks"" à la population allemande, mais que les contreparties sur des banques pourries, ça revient donc à créer de la monnaie sans qu'elle soit adosée à de la richesse réelle, donc c'est inflationniste. 

Et les Allemands ont connu un tel traumatisme, la disparition de leur monnaie avec Weimar, qu'ils ont adopté comme consensus national la stabilité de la monnaie. 

Même si l'euro a permis à l'Allemagne de voler des parts de marché à ses concurrents européens, cette situation est inacceptable. Le représentant de la Bundesbank à la BCE et le gouverneur de la Bundesbank ont démissionné suite aux mesures prises par la BCE pour ""sauver"" l'euro. 


Le bilan de la Bundesbank se retrouve encore plus détérioré parce ce que certains insiders d'Europe du Sud ont déplacé leurs avoirs vers l'Allemagne, car cela transforme les créances sur les BCN d'Europe du Sud en créance sur la Bundesbank. Ils ont fait cela car quand l'euro explosera, les monnaies du Sud perdront en valeur, alors que ce sera l'inverse pour le mark.

Les créances pourries ont atteint 800 milliards d'euros au sommet de la crise, et si elle sont retombées suite au discours de Draghi (en réalité c'est probablement attribuable à une action secrète du MES), [elles sont pratiquement de nouveau à ce sommet.](https://www.upr.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TARGETS-octobre-2016-1.jpg)

Ce phénomène ne peut pas être freiné parce que cela signifierait de facto la fin de l'euro. Pour sauver les petits pays en crise, l'Italie a du s'endetter. Le soucis, c'est qu'elle s'est mise elle-même en situation délicate. A chaque fois qu'il faut intervenir, il y a de moins en moins de pays disponibles pour le faire. Et si c'était encore supportable d'intervenir pour de petits états comme le Portugal, c'est une toute autre histoire pour l'Italie ou l'Espage. Le risque est que tout retombe sur l'Allemagne. Donc elle ne va certainement pas céder à la France, peu importe le président qui est élu.

Le nouveau gouverneur de la Bundesbank a tenu des discours qui appellent insidieusement à la fin de l'euro, et on commence à l'entendre chez des personnes publiques, comme avec  le président de l'équivalent de l'INSEE allemand récemment. Je dis insidieusement, parce que l'Allemagne ne veut pas porter le chapeau, elle serait accusée de mettre fin pour une 3ème fois à un ordre européen.


SI Mélenchon évoque certains des ces sujets, il n'aborde pas les éléments les plus cruciaux, c'est-à-dire la défense des intérêts allemands tels qu'ils les conçoivent, parce qu'en tant qu'homme politique de gauche, il considère que ce sont les intérêts de l'oligarchie allemande.

The entire point of a terrorist attacker is to blend into the crowd. These guys were even supposed to have spend years in the U.S. and were fluent enough in English to take flight lessons at a random small airport flight school.

Most of the terror attacks the DHS has claimed to have stopped since 9/11 have been Americans who became radicalized. They would have passed straight through TSA, hell the shoe bomber and underwear bomber DID get through TSA. 

And of all airline bombings in history, about half have been white. Since the 70s it's been a mix of Latin American, African, Greek, North Korean and middle eastern (mostly Libyan).

Otherwise, down to business.


&gt; I kinda agree political correctness has gotten out of hand. But I think a contributing factor to that is a significant amount of people who are indeed either racist, sexist, or homophobic. The amount of hate crimes after Trump was elected, or at least the ones that I saw, rose dramatically. If they were normal hate crimes then i might write it off as just a random act of hate, but most of the ones I saw, the assailant mentioned Trump in some form.

Alrighty, so to answer this I'm going to unfortunately have to put on a bit of a tinfoil hat. Does it not seem odd to you that a **normal person** would go out and beat up someone they hate and shout their presidential candidate of choice? Seems odd doesn't it? Now I have to point this out because it was confirmed that Clinton's campaign was birddogging Trump's rallies, AND it was confirmed that it was a black member of the church that burned down the black church with Trump spray painted on the side. Just my 2c.

Also, I too saw a rising number of racist instances, mostly pointed towards ""white supremacists"", which in reality were white people that voted Trump. I've heard vile shit on both sides, so I'll agree that this year just brought out the worst in people.

&gt; Personally I don't think immigration is a huge issue. Illegal immigration has been falling for years and only something like 3% of immigrants are here illegally, and a lot of them had work visas and just never renewed them. I think the Republicans just point to the immigrants when the people complain about jobs moving over seas to cover their corporate buddies who moved the jobs to save a buck. Immigrants have been blamed for centuries anyways.

Alrighty, so here I would say correct legal immigration is not a huge issue. But the point is not legal, its illegal immigration. If you immigrate and pay your taxes, maintain your greencard or apply for citizenship, cool beans, glad to have you aboard the greatest country on Earth. If you are here illegally,  you are by default a criminal, and should be handled as such. The law/justice is and should be blind and carried out that way. 3% illegal is still in the millions and must be fixed. In my opinion, securing the border then making a way for current illegals to get amnesty/renewals on visas is the way to go, otherwise deportation station. Your last point doesn't make much sense here, I don't think anyone likes illegal immigration that strains our tax system, and exporting work overseas is not the same thing. That's just shit corporations that abuse our current tariff system.

&gt; I'm all for lowered taxes for the middles class. Not for the Upper class and corporations though. They're the ones who keep sending away jobs, cutting hours, and laying people off so that they can keep living their luxurious lifestyle. They need to pay their fair share so that the people can live decent lives. If they move their companies completely, then that's a shame. It'll leave room for other companies to grow in their place though.

Alright, so here I would say you have the common modern liberal's standpoint of tax the wealthy and we all get richer. This is unfortunately most likely just your opinion so there isn't much for me to say but explain my own side. The conservative idea of lowering taxes on the wealthy has always been trickle down, right? More money at the top means they make more jobs to make more money and its an endless loop that eventually trickles down to the poor sucker on the bottom. See, it didn't work with Reagan because he did it ""wrong"". Trump's idea to fix this, which I agree with, is to do this but to fix the loopholes. Tax (tariff) products imported by american companies overseas a shitton to discourage leaving, thus forcing MFG jobs and growth back into the domestic zone, raising the GDP and creating jobs for the lower classes all at the same time. Works in theory, we beta test this year coming.

Your other problem here is ""fair share"". See, in my mind we already pay our fair share, all of us. The only way to make it better is to eliminate tax write offs and institute a flat tax that is somewhat bracketed for the classes. Fair share is simply a broken idea, because highly taxing the wealthy makes them leave with their money, damaging the economy and taking money out of the local area. Your local Whole Foods doesn't survive from the poor family on welfare, they survive from the rich dude who wants fancy product. You want nice things, you have to let the rich keep their money to waste on nice things. If you want nice things, make a niche or new product for the rich to waste their money on, that's capitalism at work. 

&gt;I feel like we could cut back on some military spending. We may need to protect ourselves but we're not in a way. We spend more on the military then the next 10 countries combined, and they're all our allies. We're also part of NATO, so if anyone attacks us, Canada and Europe will be on their ass as well as Australia since we have a defense pact with them, as well as Israel and South Korea.

Okay, so actually Trump is a somewhat your solution here. He wants more military spending. This is, contrary to common belief, a good thing. You might want the money elsewhere, but the only way tech moves forward is if we can use it to kill someone. Its an unfortunate truth, but nonetheless true. GPS? So we can find people and make better maps. Internet? Military comms. Radar? Airplane detection. Military makes magic happen. Look at the Navy lasers and railgun, cool as fuck that would never happen otherwise. The bloated defense beast must live if we want cool shit.

Okay so to the part where Trump is your savior. Trump agrees; we spend a LOT on military. This is because our allies don't spend shit on theirs. We demilitarized much of the world because we were the world police, the ones with the biggest stick. Trump wants our allies to either pay for their own shit, or pay us to effectively ""rent"" our military. Instead of us paying to rent land to base on, they pay us for putting the giant ""don't fuck with us"" marker that is a U.S. Military base.

Continuing, look I like NATO. I really am uninformed of why its bad now and why Trump doesn't like it. I'm sure he has his reasons but NATO was neat to me. Its a bit dated now, since Russia doesn't really gives us the Reds issue anymore, but beyond a bit of renegotiating, I don't see why we would dissolve it.

&gt;To me legalizing marijuana is a no brainer. It's essentially proven to be relatively harmless, if anything it's beneficial to many conditions and acts as a safer and healthier alternative to a lot expensive and addictive prescription pain killers. It's also way safer and healthier for recreational use than tobacco and alcohol. Legalizing it and taxing it gives us a huge amount of money to invest in education and infrastructure. And legalizing it will reduce drug related violence and cause cartels/gangs profits to fall.

Yep, and Trump agrees. Let the states decide who wants it. I personally just don't want weed smoke everywhere tbh. Also I smoke pipes/cigars and I hate that I have a stigma but smokey joe the pot head is cool. I think that shit is dumb. Either hate all smokers and start moving towards vape only or let people smoke what they want. I understand the difference and one is ""more harmful"" to breath in, but tbh, I'd rather cough a bit walking through cig smoke going to work than have a contact high. Yes I've smoked weed and I know this isn't necessarily how it works, just a bit of hyperbole.

&gt;I shouldn't even have to explain climate change. Even if someone doesn't believe it, there's still many reasons to invest in renewable energy and ditch coal/oil. There's a limited supply of coal/oil and we'll run out eventually. We'd may as well switch now to avoid problems in the future. Plus pollution ruins the air and water, causing health issues for people and the oceans to die.

Okay, so you don't have to. Because it has literally become a moot point because people are idiots and don't know how to compromise. It is my belief that climate change is natural. Before you get upset, I do agree humans have a role in it. Not a large one, but a role. I also believe it's pointless to get in a hissy fit over people not believing. I think Trump is going to invest in both renewable and non renewable. He's a businessman, if it'll make money he'll invest.

My personal opinion here (beware its shitty), is that even if we do cause it, we are the apex species. We evolved and adapted to get to this point. If we cause changes, other species will evolve to survive or die out. Such is the harsh ways of evolution. Pollution is shitty, and I do not encourage it. But legislating companies into the ground because they do not agree with your policy opinions is petty at best, and stupid at worst. By eliminating oil and gas you are eliminating one of the highest and most taxed commodity being imported. That's a lot of money for the gov't that comes back to us through public services. It may just be a necessary evil.

&gt; Anyways, those are just my views.

sorry, i really think you're biased here. i'm not positive in saying that, but my impression is the SJWs trampling on free speech in universities etc. gets a bit too much play in conservative media, and all i mean by that is that it skews perception of how frequent it is. I do, however, agree that that movement is a threat to free speech and I'm even open conceptually to some aspects of things like the right to not bake a gay wedding cake. I'm undecided, i haven't thought about it enough.

okay so my point in what i just said basically is that i think we need to be clear that your label is only applied to an accurate number of ""progressives"". let's grant that.

&gt; As far as foreign policy goes, the USA is an empire ...

you're a classical liberal, we see eye to eye-ish here.

i don't think people on the left want war with russia. I do think the assumption a no-fly zone by hillary would be WW3 was complete bullshit. seriously, we'd go to brinksmanship over a no-fly zone? tangent..

&gt; Personally, Vietnam was a war to slow the spread of Communism and it was justified as far as I'm concerned.

I dont know enough history to say you're wrong or right confidently. I can understand why you'd feel that way.. but think about how our anti communist stance meant we supported an incredibly unpopular undemocratic dictator, killed millions of civilians, and bombed cambodia and laos and helped destabilize cambodia. in retrospect you'd be a psychopath to support the vietnam war. if communism across the board is as bad as you say then why did vietnam transition to what it was? the answer is the domino theory was bullshit, and we probably would have been a much more favorably looked-upon world leader if we hadn't had the CIA and military playing world cop for sixty years. Communism in the USSr is not the same as communism elsewhere, couple that with lives lost due to famine etc. and I think your argument is pretty tenuous. I disagree here, i just would very much struggle justifying a war like that over the concern of communism over diplomacy or even just letting be, but your point isn't lost on me.

&gt; An empire can't be expected to behave fairly.

i think that's total bullshit. to be clear, i think any other country would do if they were the world superpower... maybe differently. american style imperialism is american. i want to aspire to something better, i think that's fundamentally a progressive value. where we are willing to criticize american policies conservatives seem to get offended.

&gt; If you knew there was a place where they were killing babies, you'd go do something about it too.

right.

&gt; The left thinks the right is evil, literally evil.

i often do, but i often check myself... it's pretty fuckin hard when i visit r/the_donald on a daily basis. i do check progressives hard for doing this though, i think both sides seem to jack off to memes showing how absurd the other side is... not an accurate picture of the world at all.

&gt;  Mitt Romney was literally a binder-woman hating dog-abusing Mormon bastard

lol.. who puts their dog on the fucking roof though? but yeah, i agree with your sentiment. i think mitt had a good hearted, faus paux with the binders thing but man the liberal machine ripped his ass for that.


&gt; CNN, MSNBC, NYT, WaPo--these are all hysteria factories.

i used to watch/read, i haven't really in years but i do check out NYT. NYT is socially liberal, from my experience it's borderline centrist on foreign policy but seems more left in recent years. I'm not sure these are your hysteria factories.. and i know i just admitted i don't watch, but here's the thing: young progressives don't watch them either.

&gt; Islamism has to be destroyed.

i don't think the conventional american approach is going to work here. i'm open to knocking out isis, i'm not sure that's enough. those same cold war policies were applied in the middle east -- 1953 overthrow of the iranian president to insert the shah led to the iranian revolution, you had the secular government in egypt overthrown, obviously we trained the taliban, support the saudis now..  i think the islamism problem is unique. i think the solution is long-term, unfortunately. i don't think religion has nothing to do with it -- it does. but i think geopolitics and politics have defined a lot and i don't know if more US intervention will work.

&gt;  We've got people losing their minds over transgender bathrooms

works both ways, but yeah we agree basically.

&gt; China is kicking our ass at trade 

dono enough about china or economics, but from what i know at least 40% of chinese exports are from american owned companies (IIRC). we are walloping china in terms of GDP, just cause they export more doesn't mean we're losing to them.

ISIS isn't a threat to the US at all, europe is a different issue, and i think they're almost wiped out in syria and iraq? 

&gt; I see the left as whiny children that need to get out of the way so the real issues can be dealt with

i think this is from too much conservative media. most young progressives care, like myself, mostly about addressing income inequality, long term sustainability of the US economy, climate change.. i think climate change is the biggest threat to what i value.

a classical liberal is a lot easier to communicate with and agree with as a progressive. to summarize how i feel about what i just read, i generally agree. i do think there's some distortion about how the average progressive values what's important.. and i think the media factor is huge there. issues like gay marriage are seemingly binary ethical issues for progressives so it's easy pickings for the media to rally behind. for the longest time i had the opinion that the media does this same thing (some 8 years ago), they seemingly dodged all conversations about income inequality until recently. i'd obviously very much disagree with a classical liberal on economic issues, but i think those are less charged somehow.

edit: tl;dr sure, i think some small number of progressives are very down with shutting down free speech, but enough of us care who also identify as progressive to stop that... i think it's already being addressed at a level. so i'd overall not agree the ""left"" is like the communist left.",TrueReddit

What I would point out is;

a) There is a common theme to these threads. Eurosceptics seize on stories like this to claim that national interests are overriding the collective European interest, and thus the EU is a failure, whilst seizing on stories where a national interest is sidelined to show the usurping of sovereignty. This clearly isn't a mature debate, though one can be had.



b) In EU history one way of bringing difficult states on side is to give the most reluctant state a leading role in the shaping of policies. The argument goes that once they have responsibility for the objective, they will engage in constructive policy making rather than obstructing all action. Whilst this may not move into a policy space preferred by the most enthusiastic actors, it will at least produce something that can pass in the end. Think of the UK's Commissioner getting responsibility for the financial services portfolio in the Commission, or the UK's top civil servant in the Commission, Director General Faul, being made the head of that department under a French Comissioner in the Barosso Commission. This got the two most opposed states on the direction of financial services legislation to work together rather than antagonise each other.

in fact i cannot remember for the last 2 weeks when I lost when I was playing talon in place of adc position.

this is in kr server btw idk how it may play out in na/eu",leagueoflegends

Personally I'd get a much cheaper 1080p display like 34um67 or 34um68 for ~400€ . For the amount of money you want to spent I'd definitely get a 1440p display, as it's way more futureproof.
