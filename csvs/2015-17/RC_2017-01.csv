This is the exact stated purpose of the Gigafactory -- to cut out these suppliers (and the overhead, and the inefficiency, and the shipping cost). Raw material from the mine enters the factory (*one* sourcing step), and completed EVs and stationary batteries come out the other end. All powered by solar power: Tesla cut and capped the natural gas pipeline that originally came in to the Gigafactory.

The plan for multiple factories around the world also reduces the ecological impact of shipping (both raw materials and finished cars). Currently a Europe, Asia, and possibly South America Gigafactory are expected, each fully powered by renewables.

---

&gt;* ROME: Italy will seek to deport more migrants who have no right to be in the country and will open new detention centers to hold them before their expulsion, according to a written directive and a ministry source.

&gt;* Police chief Franco Gabrielli sent a two-page directive to stations across the country on Friday ordering them to increase efforts to identify and deport migrants a week after Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri was shot dead near Milan.

&gt;* The directive, seen by Reuters, says police should take extraordinary action before the growing migratory pressure in an international context marked by instability and threats to control and remove irregular foreigners.

&gt;* Interior Minister Marco Minniti plans to open several new detention centers that hold migrants prior to their expulsion, a ministry source said, in line with repeated requests by European Union partners.

&gt;* German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also called for greater efforts to deport those who do not qualify for international protection, but the process is slow and expensive, and it requires bilateral agreements with the countries of origin.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

IMO China is all that matters when it comes to the bitcoin price.

&gt;If so, is it reasonable to assume Bitcoin is a good investment to buy into at this price (£781.13)?

I wouldn't invest at this price just because I know its going to get cheaper than this eventually.

&gt; Regina Spektor (born Regina Ilyinichna Spektor on 18 February 1980 in Moscow) is a Russian-born American singer-songwriter and pianist. Her music is associated with the anti-folk scene centered on New York City's East Village.

&gt; Spektor studied classical piano from the age of six, practising on a Petrof piano given to her mother by her grandfather. She was also exposed to the music of rock and roll bands such as The Beatles, Queen, and The Moody Blues by her father, who obtained such recordings in Eastern Europe and traded cassettes with friends in the Soviet Union. The family left the Soviet Union in 1989, when Regina was nine, during the period of Perestroika when Jewish citizens were permitted to emigrate. The seriousness of her piano studies led her parents to consider not leaving Russia, but they finally decided to emigrate, for religious and political reasons.

&gt; Travelling first to Austria and then Italy, the family settled in the Bronx, New York, United States where Spektor graduated from a middle school yeshiva. She then attended the Frisch Yeshiva High School in Paramus, New Jersey on a scholarship for two years, but, feeling out of place, eventually transferred to a secular public school, Fair Lawn High School, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she finished the last two years of her high school career
.
In New York, Spektor gained a firm grounding in classical music from her piano teacher, Sonia Vargas, a professor at the Manhattan School of Music. Spektor studied with Vargas—whom Spektor's father had met through violinist Samuel Marder, Vargas's husband—until she was 17. Although the family had been unable to bring their piano with them from Russia, Spektor found a piano on which to practice in the basement of her synagogue, also utilizing tabletops and other hard surfaces for this purpose.

&gt; Although she had always made up songs around the house, Spektor first became interested in songwriting during a visit to Israel with the Nesiya Institute in her teenage years. Attracting attention from the other children on the trip for the songs she made up while hiking, she realized she had an aptitude for songwriting. Following this trip, she was first exposed to the work of Joni Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, and other singer-songwriters, which gave her the idea that she could create her own songs. She began writing her first a cappella songs around age 16, and wrote her first songs for voice and piano when she was nearly eighteen.

&gt; Spektor completed the four-year studio composition program of the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College in Purchase, New York, including one year's study in London, at the University of Middlesex - graduating with honours in 2001. Around this time, she also worked briefly at a butterfly farm in Luck, Wisconsin. She gradually achieved recognition through performances in the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, most importantly at the East Village's Sidewalk Cafe, but also at the Living Room, Tonic, Fez, the Knitting Factory, and CB's Gallery. During this period, she sold her self-produced CDs 11:11 (2001) and Songs (2002) at such performances.

&gt; The All The Rowboats Songfacts states that What We Saw From The Cheap Seats, Spektor's sixth album, was recorded by the singer with Mike Elizondo in Los Angeles during the summer of 2011. It was released on May 29, 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

I know that sounds hypocritical, but Arab nationalism didn't take on the fascist character of European 19th century movements. Zionism promoted ethnically homogeneous enclaves, purity of descent, race pseudoscience, etc. Which it inherited from 19th century European movements. Which is understandable since that's where its earliest thinkers came from. Herzl was in his youth a member of a German nationalist club, but had to leave when it got too anti-Semitic. Apart from a few fringe movements, Arab nationalists did not promote racial pseudoscience nor ethnic homogeneity or superiority. It was aware of Arab ethnic and religious diversity, hence its early promoters being Christians. It really evolved as a response to rising Turkish nationalism under Ottoman rule.

I just remember there being an approximate cutoff number, depending on the game difficulty, where you'd slowly start to not have enough funds for basic building/functioning/expanding, and would be on a downward spiral from there on.

Granted, it may not be as bad as I make it sound. It's just the way they did the satellites was the biggest thing that bugged me in the base game, and was a welcome change in the Long War (being able to win countries back).

Edit:

 Another tip that I have, whether you play EU, EW, or Long War, is to play on a lower difficulty, but with IronMan mode on. 

Granted, there's a chance of Save Game corruption and stuff, so might want to look into finding where your saved games are, and back that folder up every few hours, or once a day, just in case of glitches/corruption.

But, the ironman mode makes SUCH a big difference, in a good way. I used to save-scum my way through the original X-Com games, and most other games such as Jagged Alliance 2, and the new X-Com was no exception.

But then I tried to start on Easy or Normal, with Ironman mode on, and, while the game was a bit easier, it made it SO much more intense, being scared to bum-rush Aliens as I would if i was able to re-load, panicking a little bit if one of my guys got hit with a critical hit or got ambushed.

&gt; Spawned from the vernal heat of the Florida swamps amidst swirling patterns of pine orchards and pre-Columbian artifacts, Prince Rama was whispered into the ears of Taraka Larson, Nimai Larson, and Michael Collins in the summer of 2007 by the clanging of prayer bells and goat-skin drums. They left the Hare Krishna farm where they were staying to go to art school and form a creative nucleus in Boston. There, their engaging and often unpredictable ritualistic live shows attracted a rapid cult following, replete with collective chants, werewolf summonings, Sanskrit invocations, and the distribution of various handmade percussion to members of the audience.

&gt; In a short time, the trio was picked up by British-based label, Cosmos Recordings who released their first collection of lo-fi bedroom recordings as Threshold Dances and flew them out to the UK to tour and record the cinematically orchestrated Zetland. At this time, Taraka also began working for the controversial visionary artist Paul Laffoley and began composing Architecture of Utopia inspired by his paintings, an album that explores mapping utopic space via the mandalic architecture of the vinyl record. In spring 2009 the group departed from Boston and went on a series of extensive tours across the US and Europe, culminating in a tragic car robbery in which all their equipment got stolen. Thanks to an overwhelming outpouring from friends, family, and fans, the group was catapulted to rebuild and reinvent themselves from the ground up to make a unique new sound surcharged with a renewed sense of awe, gratitude, and urgency. The trio moved to Brooklyn, and with their new instruments wrote and recorded Shadow Temple, produced with the help of Dave (Avey Tare) and Josh (Deakin) of Animal Collective for release on Paw Tracks in August 2010.

&gt; Theresa May has used her new year message to reassure those who voted for Britain to stay in the European Union that she will fight for their interests &amp;quot;Around the negotiating table in Europe this year&amp;quot;.

&gt; &amp;quot;We all want a country that is fairer so that everyone has the chance to succeed. We all want a nation that is safe and secure for our children and grandchildren. These ambitions unite us, so that we are no longer the 52% who voted leave and the 48% who voted remain, but one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future. So when I sit around the negotiating table in Europe this year, it will be with that in mind - the knowledge that I am there to get the right deal not just for those who voted to leave, but for every single person in this country.""

&gt; In last year&amp;#039;s new year message from Downing Street, David Cameron promised &amp;quot;To fix the things that most annoy British people about our relationship with the EU&amp;quot; before a referendum.

O batea noaptea si se trezea dimineata cu vanatai pe tot corpul. Nu vedea niciodata nimic, doar auzea ""zdupaituri"" prin casa. De pe pat pe dulap, de pe dulap pe masa, de pe masa pe podea, ca si cand un animal se deplasa pe mobila. S-a mutat in SUA cand eram eu mic, si 'dracul' a continuat sa o chinuie si acolo. O data, un unchi, A., povestea ca a fost in vizita la ea, ca nu a auzit zgomote, dar cand a incercat sa doarma, ""cineva"" i-a tras doua palme peste fata, in somn. Cand s-a trezit, nu era nimeni in camera cu el. A plecat in noaptea aia si n-a mai calcat in casa aleia de atunci. Femeia a murit in SUA, singura in apartamentul ei, copiii ei spun ca nu s-a mai intamplat nimic ciudat in casa ei de atunci.

&amp;nbsp;

Alte intamplari ciudate, la care am fost si eu de fata, s-au petrecut la o nunta, cand eram mic. In noaptea dinaintea nuntii a fost un accident in care au murit o matusa, D., si doi unchi, A. si I. (erau toti in aceeasi masina). Rudele s-au decis sa tina secret decesele pentru ca nunta sa continue (mirii si socrii nu au stiut). Mai multi invitati au fost implicati in accidente minore pe parcursul zilei. Un cal s-a speriat si a sarit cu copitele pe masina lui taica-miu. O alta ruda era cat pe ce sa se rastoarne intr-un sant cu noi in masina. Unul din cadourile miresei a fost o cutie freaky cu niste fulgi de gaina, frunze uscate, crengi de copac, o foarfeca si o papusa. La 2 zile dupa nunta mireasa si parintii ei au plecat cu banii stransi de la nunta si a vrut divort.

&amp;nbsp;

O alta chestie care mi-a fost intiparita in minte, legata de cei morti in accident: In sat la bunica-mea, era un tanar ucenic la biserica, despre care lumea spunea ca avea 'har'. Unul din unchii mei, A., mort in accident, a fost adus la bunica-mea in casa, pt priveghi. Tin minte ca ma jucam prin curte, printre oamenii care au venit la priveghi, cum se obisnuia prin sat. Tin minte, cum din vorba in vorba, tanarul ucenic s-a uitat fix spre usa de la intrare, si a spus ceva de genul: ""I-am vazut (n.r. pe cei morti), cum au intrat in casa. D. si A. au intrat fericiti si s-au imbratisat. I., a intrat la urma, cu capul plecat, posomorat si trist"". Am aflat apoi, de la ai mei, ca cel ""trist"" nu a murit in accident, ci la morga. Doctorii nu i-au dat sanse de supravietuire, fiind in varsta, si l-au dus direct la morga, unde si-a petrecut noaptea pe targa. A murit abia dimineata. Singur, in frig si intuneric.

&amp;nbsp;

A. a fost plecat in razboi, timp in care nevasta-sa si familia nu au stiut nimic de el si au presupus ca a murit pe front. Nevasta-sa a plecat. Nu mi-e clara ordinea in care s-au intamplat lucrurile, dar bunica-mea povestea cum, A., in timp ce se intorcea acasa pe jos de pe front, s-a oprit in fata unei case cu fantana, fiindu-i sete. In timp ce scotea apa din fantana, o femeie a iesit din casa sa-l intampine. Era nevasta-sa, care se recasatorise intre timp. N-a fost o intamplare horror, ci mai degraba o coincidenta super ciudata, si ca unchiul A. nu s-a mai casatorit de atunci.",0,3,snek_plissken

Only in America do we have rivals in other states/time zones/even nations (at the league club level). 

Without really knowing it at the time, I had the privilege of attending two of the biggest rivalries ever. One was the Millwall/WestHam game, held at the Den near the docks in SE London sometime in the 70's  where I heard a grandfather tell his grandchildren how he beat up some guy sitting on the other side of the fence **50 YEARS AGO**, both teams being **5 Miles** apart, or when I went to the Permian, Odessa and Midland Lee, High School football game in the 80's that brings in a standing room only crowd of 20-30K in a HS stadium bigger than most MLS stadiums, a rivalry dating back to WW2 with both High Schools being about 19 miles apart. The book and TV show *Friday Night Lights* was based on that rivalry. 

So the bar, for me, on a real rivalry is not some hyped event or invented to drum up interest. As a Tucson FC supporter and a proud Cactus Prick, I can vouch that the rivalry over The LV Mobsters or ALB is more hyped than real, but it is new, although maybe if I give it 50-100 years, it will be better (lol)",0,2,orgngrndr01

This is insanity. Thought crimes that are not precisely defined and depend of the feelings of other people. And I was in a CS department, but still I didn't dare to speak about politics.

And when I started looking for work in other universities I saw written black on white ""we are especially looking for female candidates"". This is institutional discrimination against people like me (aka men).

And I'm lucky to be in Europe where race discrimination against Europeans is not as strong as in the US.

And even when looking for work outside of the academic world, large corporations more and more have discrimination in the job offers because discrimination is mandatory by laws thanks to SJWs.

So SJWs can ruin my life and my carrier and they force me to self sensor while working at a university (precisely because there is no clear line about what is thought crime and what is ok, so you do not say anything). Christian nuts cannot. As someone against authoritarianism and with a left wing sensitivity, I am more and more leaning toward the anti-SJW right, not because I like their policies but because they are the only ones capable of protecting me from SJWs.

And while I was a student I joined an entrepreneurship program, it was also written black on white that groups with female members were more likely to be selected. I specificaly looked for a girl for my group to increase my chances of being accepted. I consider this violent sex discrimination against men. And during the introduction in the entrepreneurship program, the organisers were happy to say that the number of women was increasing and that this was great to see more equality. Of course it was increasing, when you write black on white that you discriminate against men who don't have women in their group.

My first wig was treated Asian hair (my hair was curly and brunette so I wanted the same thing) - it had been stripped of the black color, dyed, and permed.  It didn't look great to begin with, but within four months it looked terrible and I hated it.  My second wig was virgin European hair that was about shoulder-length, and it still looks gorgeous nearly 7 years later (I have had it ""refilled"" with hair so to speak a few times but the cap is fine).  From my experience, it's best to buy the best quality you can manage financially because you'll feel the most confident in it and it'll age well.  On a related note, when I buy a wig, I get a prescription from my doctor listing it as a ""cranial prosthesis"" which I can then submit to the state (I'm in NY) as a medical expense to get the tax refunded.


Anyway, anecdotes aside, I'll just give you all the information I can think of:


**Wig basics**


*Synthetic vs human*


With wigs, I’ve generally found that you get what you pay for.  Synthetic wigs are more affordable and can be lovely if you get a good one, but I’ve found them to be warmer to wear than human hair which I dislike.  I like to wear a synthetic wig to the beach or pool if I’m going in the water because I like to preserve my human hair wigs.  You do have to be careful with heat and synthetic hair; if you open the oven and get blasted with heat, the hair can melt, and you have to be careful with the temperature if you heat-style them (although most synthetics don’t need much if any styling).  My oldest synthetic wig is probably six years old, but it hasn’t gotten six years worth of wear because I only wear it when I know I’m going to get sweaty.


There are different levels of quality for human hair with Asian/Indian “ranking” as below European hair.  “Virgin” hair just means it’s undyed and untreated which generally makes it easier to work with.  My favorite wigs to wear are definitely the human hair.  They’re pricey, but they look beautiful, feel comfortable, and last very well.  You can heat-style them without worrying about the hair melting and as long as you care for them properly, they’ll last years.  For me, the cost is worth it because they’re more comfortable and generally look more natural.  Obviously the hair that they shed (all wigs shed) doesn’t grow back, so you do need to add hair every few years or so.  My oldest human hair wig is nearly seven years old and the cap is just starting to show some wear.


It’s definitely a personal decision because I know people who are happy with their synthetic wigs.  Regardless, I recommend buying something that you know is good quality (ie not a crap costume wig) because you’ll feel better and it’ll look better.


*Monofilament tops*


All the human hair wigs I own have monofilament tops.  This basically means that they’re hand-tied and you can move the part around without worrying because it looks like natural scalp.  Regardless of whether you go for synthetic or human hair, I would definitely recommend looking for the monofilament (“mono”) top because it looks so much more natural.  I uploaded a picture of myself to imgur [here](http://imgur.com/rYUBV8X) so you can see what I mean; the wig I’m wearing there is virgin, European hair (that was coming up on needing to be washed) with a mono top.


*Adhesive and clips*


When I started wearing wigs, I didn’t have enough hair left to use the clips that come in a lot of wigs, so I’ve never used them and therefore can’t speak to them.  However, if you do have hair, you can just clip the wig in using the clips that come in most of them.  Since I don’t have hair, I use daily adhesive ([this one specifically]( http://www.hairdirect.com/store/clear-a-contour.aspx) doesn’t irritate my eczema-prone skin).  If I’m doing something really intense, I’ll use supertape, but it’s more difficult to remove.  It’s not generally advised to stick any tape directly to the wig cap to avoid damaging it, so I sew in patches of “skin” - essentially a thin polyurethane material - where I want to place the tape and then apply the tape to that.


**Where I buy**


I purchase most of my human hair wigs from a local Orthodox Jewish woman who sells them.  I honestly don’t know the brand because it’s all in Hebrew, but I know they're all kosher, virgin European hair.  [Wilshire Wigs](http://www.wilshirewigs.com/) runs great sales and has some beautiful wigs; I’ve ordered synthetic wigs from them and enjoyed them.  [Yaffa wigs]( http://www.yaffawigs.com/) also has some good ones, and they have [an outlet]( http://www.yaffawigsoutlet.com/) from which I’ve purchased a human hair wig that I enjoy.
 

**Wig care**


Since wigs don’t produce oil like normal hair does, they don’t need to be washed as often.  For me it’s generally every 4 weeks, sometimes a little longer in the winter.  For synthetic wigs, I wash them in a basin with a shampoo/conditioner from Revlon that’s designed for synthetic wigs.  For my human hair wigs, it’s ideal to wash them on your head to minimize shedding.  I use whatever shampoo and conditioner is around and rinse very thoroughly to make sure no product is left in the hair.   Sometimes I’ll use dry shampoo on my human hair wigs between washes if they do start to get oily (generally from me touching them).  I don’t do much styling so I can’t really help you there.
 

**Scalp care**


I currently have no hair, so I just wash my head with baby shampoo because it’s gentle.  I have dry, eczema-prone skin on my body which includes my scalp, so I like to gently exfoliate with a washcloth because it helps keep my head less itchy although this might not be a problem for you.  I also apply lotion (currently the First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream) to my head at night to moisturize and wash my head in the morning before putting the wig on to keep the cap clean.
 

**Resources**: The National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF) [website](https://www.naaf.org/) is a decent place to start.  [Bald Girls Do Lunch](https://www.baldgirlsdolunch.org/) is a really nice organization - I've met the founder - that also has a lot of information, and Thea herself is great.  [Alopeciaworld](http://www.alopeciaworld.com) is a social network that also has a lot of information and someone on there is probably in your area.  I don’t know anything about you, but the black community tends to do a ton of hair replacement and black women you know might be able to help point you in a helpful direction.

&gt;You don't know much about history of a genre and what was the major things that made it popular in times when games at least tried to be complex. And no - it wasn't Hollywood battles in first place.   
    
Mate shogun total war released when EU 1 released. Shogun 1 and medieval 1 are less complex then C&amp;C and starcraft; If total war didn't had the big number Hollywood like battles, it would have died along side many RTS that come from that time (like age of empire, empire earth ,etc.). Take a look at cossacks which has numbers as bigger then total war but doesn't have the flair of graphics. you can even take a look at imperial glory!  
  
&gt;just for Your information: economical leaders were the normal ones but with really good economy stats and perks, that people liked to leave in towns to boost economy and control taxes, using other leaders for leading armies.  
  
I know that, it is just a ""useless"" feature. The amount of money you get that way is LESS then using that leader with an army and go sacking/conquering nearby-ish regions. The fact you use these ""economical"" leaders means you are just shooting yourself in the foot. It's like saying you won't use cavalry with rome because your legionaries can beat everything in 1-1 fight, it's technically true but not really the best way to play. The only reason to have economical leaders is if all your armies have 2-3 leaders and you can't make one yet; after all the bodyguard unit in rome 1/medieval 2 can beat most early units easily.  
  
&gt;So much for hard AI.  
I never said the AI is hard.  
  
&gt;   Leaving behind artillery or even foot soldiers to go full cav, was the easiest way to catch slower armies. Any TW veteran remembers that.  
 
Any TW veteran would also remember that it's pointless to fight enemy armies in the old games because your priority is the enemy city which can retrain half of your army in 1 turn. If that stacks comes to reconquer the city you now have walls plus healed half your troops.  
  
  
all that said the ""problem"" is really     

&gt;nostalgia is important feeling for me if it comes to Total War or other series. It helps to keep things in correct perspective and aiming hight in expectations.

There are thing old games have better (like contact between groups, better siege layouts, more varied general speeches, etc.) but for the most part they surpassed by later games.      
 
&gt; One advice from me: less arrogance and more empathy   
   
Being ""diplomatic"" correct is not my forte  and i as always i acknowledge that there are better less aggressive ways to write my ideas, i just don't have the capacity to do so; while i'm aggressive by nature and enjoy discussion but i lack the literrary skills to have well thought out paragraphs; that said i always admit when i'm wrong and if i offend you in any way it was never meant as a personal offense but a way to ""homerun"" my ideas.  
I thought i showed empathy by not downvoting because i see where you are coming from but IMO it's coming more from nostalgia than ""fun"" ( as in a well designed game feature); that said i normally go for reditetiquete and only downvote when the person is spreading lies/hate.    

&gt;   I'm sure You had a good intentions to teach me about few things, unfortunately this wasn't a case this time.    

My intentions are to discuss, because it is from discussion that great ideas are born. In this case i think you are a bit too clouded by nostalgia and should evaluate each feature by themselves instead of being aprt of that great game.   
I also appreciate that you took the time to actually have a well thought out answer instead of a 2 phrase answer which i normally get on reddit, the few people like you that ""lurk"" in this reddit is what's keeping me here, i'm normally active in NeoGAF which has a higher barrier to entry and is highly moderated so there aren't trolls as easy.

Objective: To evaluate objective criteria for identifying patients with OHCA with no chance of survival during the first minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to enable prompt orientation toward organ donation.
Design: Retrospective assessment using OHCA data from 2 registries and 1 trial.
Setting: France (Paris Sudden Death Expertise Center [SDEC] prospective cohort [2011 to 2014] and PRESENCE multicenter cluster randomized trial [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01009606] [2009 to 2011]) and the United States (King County, Washington, prospective cohort [2006 to 2011]).
Patients: 1771 patients from the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort (2011 to 2012) and 5192 from the validation cohorts.
Measurements: Evaluation of 3 objective criteria (OHCA not witnessed by emergency medical services personnel, nonshockable initial cardiac rhythm, and no return of spontaneous circulation before receipt of a third 1-mg dose of epinephrine), survival rate at hospital discharge among patients meeting these criteria, performance of the criteria, and number of patients eligible for organ donation.
Results: In the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort, the survival rate among the 772 patients with OHCA who met the objective criteria was 0% (95% CI, 0.0% to 0.5%), with a specificity of 100% (CI, 97% to 100%) and a positive predictive value of 100% (CI, 99% to 100%). These results were verified in the validation cohorts. Ninety-five (12%) patients in the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort may have been eligible for organ donation.
Limitation: Several patients had unknown outcomes.
Conclusion: Three objective criteria enable the early identification of patients with OHCA with essentially no chance of survival and may help in decision making about the organ donation process.




Discussion 

The findings of this study can help out-of-hospital EMS teams employing physicians or paramedics in the process of deciding between early transport to the hospital or termination of resuscitation when OHCA is not witnessed by EMS personnel, there is a nonshockable initial cardiac rhythm, and ROSC does not occur before receipt of a third 1-mg dose of epinephrine. Both the specificity and the PPV (for death before hospital discharge) of these objective criteria were 100% in 3 cohorts. On the basis of the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort, one can be 95% certain that the specificity would be no lower than 97%. In some cases, refocusing efforts toward the maintenance of potentially viable organs for donation might make it possible to save other lives. A rapid medical decision to transport patients for organ donation with ongoing resuscitation efforts based on these reliable and objective criteria could result in reaching the hospital earlier.

Resuscitation must always focus first on the patient's survival: UDCD can be considered only after achievement of this primary goal is no longer feasible. Our results will enable futile prolonged resuscitation on site to be limited when patients with OHCA could be directed to an organ donation center. Continuation of futile resuscitative efforts among patients with no chance of survival could lead to physical and psychological pain for patients and their relatives and could divert care and resources from patients who are more likely to survive (12). Unfortunately, the current requirement of 30 minutes of CPR before on-site patient extrication (imposed by the French national protocol for kidney retrieval from UDCD) may partially explain the need to discard potential grafts, which has been reported in the literature (17).

In Europe, UDCD data show that organ transplantation programs are beneficial in terms of successful transplantation, although the transport time targets set by UDCD protocols can be difficult to achieve (31–34). In 2006, the Institute of Medicine projected that nationwide implementation of UDCD protocols could generate an additional 22 000 donation opportunities annually in the United States, thus substantially reducing wait times for transplantation (35). Our results and those of Roberts and colleagues in the United Kingdom (36) support this idea by specifying the potential number of patients with OHCA who are eligible for organ donation. However, our results may be overestimates because some UDCD eligibility criteria may be difficult to verify on the scene. In real-world practice in France, after cannulation, potential donors are actively screened for infections and pertinent medical history that might preclude donation, and approximately 30% of them are refuted for medical reasons (37). In addition, although our findings allow improvement of early assessment for UDCD protocols, several ethical, legal, and organizational issues raised by UDCD transplantation must be carefully considered before local implementation of these protocols (6, 38, 39). Most important, UDCD should be considered only when available therapeutic options are unsuccessful or are not clinically indicated to avoid denying optimum treatment to patients who might recover (40). In addition, this emergency procedure with specific time constraints requires highly coordinated multidisciplinary teamwork to preserve organ function.

All communities should optimize retrieval of tissue and organ donations in patients pronounced dead in out-of-hospital settings (6). Emergency medical services agencies should develop protocols and implementation plans with their regional organ and tissue donation program to optimize donation after OHCA (6). We believe that EMS personnel should implement our 3 objective criteria in their updated protocols for cardiac arrest. All patients who meet these criteria, whose organs are reasonably likely to be suitable for transplantation, and who would otherwise have termination of efforts should be considered candidates for organ donation. Rapid referral to an organ donation institution under mechanical ventilation and continuous automated external cardiac massage should be considered for patients with no chance of survival. In the United States, however, initiation of organ preservation without prior patient consent is not allowed; eligibility for UDCD is restricted to previously registered organ donors (41).
Our study has limitations. One patient in the Paris SDEC 1-year cohort and 9 in the Paris SDEC validation cohort had missing outcome data. However, the results of the sensitivity analyses that included these patients were consistent with the results of the main analyses. Second, the King County cohort was restricted to patients aged 18 to 54 years (the age range for UDCD), with no survivors to hospital discharge among those meeting the objective criteria. It is unlikely that older patients with OHCA who were not included in our study would have better outcomes (42–44).

Our study also has several important strengths. The data were collected prospectively in the SDEC and PRESENCE cohorts and were based on Utstein definitions (21). Our study design reflects the experience of 3 cohorts of patients with OHCA managed in 2 EMS systems, which optimized the clinical relevance of our data. The internal validity of these data is robust with narrow CIs, and external validation supports their generalizability. Inclusion of additional traditional criteria, although associated with poor outcomes, would not contribute more but may be taken into consideration. Finally, the implementation of these objective criteria for patients with OHCA is an important topic in revisions of the international CPR guidelines.
In conclusion, these data from 3 cohorts of patients with OHCA receiving advanced life support from paramedics or physicians suggest that there is essentially no chance of survival in patients whose OHCA is not witnessed by EMS personnel, who have a nonshockable initial cardiac rhythm, and in whom ROSC does not occur before receipt of a third 1-mg dose of epinephrine. Our results may help in decision making about UDCD.",0,26,Not_for_consumption

* Rumors spread about internal conflict in the team a few months ago. I do know people have come and gone. Not sure if amicable or not. Could explain someone more confused decisions.

* I believe during the patch that they introduced Trials and the Trident, they also silently introduced some form of matchmaking. Since the game was getting still a couple of thousand of players and I faced HybridPanda about four times consecutively, I'm *inclined* to believe this. Assuming that is correct, a bunch of people confused it with the combat becoming terrible (or maybe the combat was always terrible but only noticeable when you had people of relatively equal ability facing off, if you're cynical). To quote one fan ""Sacriel used to win/top-well about 20 times a stream, now he only manages 1-2, what else changed besides the combat?"". According to a dev who isn't around anymore, some higher profile players left not far from that patch. (I might have the wrong patch specifically but I do think it was close)

* They were ridiculously fucking slow on defining their position on teaming and enforcing anything against it. Does anyone else remember the days where you would find 3-5 mans teams not only in OCE but also EU/NA? I honestly believe that is what dealt the killing blow to OCE and it hasn't recovered since.

I can think of two actual fascist parties with anything more than fringe (less than 1% support), that would be the Syrian Social Nationalist Party which is active in Syria amongst anti-Arabist secularists (especially non-Sunni Muslims) in Syria and amongst the Greek Orthodox community in Lebanon and Golden Dawn which is active in Greece and commands popular support as a result of reckless treatment of that countries by the banking community and the European Union specifically regarding the financial crisis and the intense migrant flows to the country.

Most British people who aren't specifically interested in the Syrian Civil War wouldn't know that the SSNP existed, and Golden Dawn got more mention a few years ago after their militants killed a rapper than they do now even though they're more popular now (steadily polling at 25% of the vote sometimes going up to 30% and surpassing Syriza as opposed the average of 12-15% in 2014-15).


Let's make some things clear shall we? Fascism is a specific thing, it is not a nebulous label that we can apply to any right wingers we dislike.

Anti-immigrant politics are not intrinsically fascist.


Social conservatism is not intrinsically fascist.


Being nationalistic is not intrinsically fascist.


Fascism is an ultra nationalist ideology that *rejects democracy*, either seeing it as a failure and useless or more commonly openly referring to it as a means to an end and promising to use the power to they're given by voters to abolish democracy outright. Fascism goes beyond the average of national pride, nationalism or patriotism and believes in the concept of a national cult — where the nation itself is elevated to almost being a God to be worshipped. Oftentimes fascism will conflate the party and the nation to be one and the same. Fascism is revolutionary not reactionary, unless you live in a state that used to have a fascist state and now doesn't (so Iberians, Italians, Croatians, Austrians and Germans) than fascism is separated from conservatism or reactionary politics by the fact that unlike social conservatives *they have no desire to go back to how things were* but instead *fascists want to create a whole new society*. The difference can be observed by reading about the antipathy between the Nazis and the large traditionalist movement in Weimar Germany. Unlike the traditionalists and monarchists, the Nazis were disdainful of the old nobility and had no desire to re-empower them or reinstate the Kaiser, unlike the traditionalists and monarchists the Nazis and Italian fascists were irreligious and distrustful of Christianity in general but especially Catholicism (the only relevant Christianity in Italy) because Catholicism is under the control of the Pope which is a foreign power is and unlike the various Protestant denominations could not be co-opted to serve fascism. The fascist usage of religion (especially in Germany) was very cynical and not much different from the Dawkins types' view of religion — that it is something that can be used to control and pacify stupid people. If you would like to see a great example of the tense relations between the Nazis and German conservatism then read about the relations between the Nazi German government and arch-conservative philosopher Ernst Jünger and how he was slandered in the Völkischer Beobachter and only spared imprisonment because he was and is very much loved by wider society and considered a national treasure.

Fascists are suspicious of capitalism, since it is by nature an internationalist dynamic and thus outside of the limits of state control. That's why fascism is very enthusiastic about government control in the economy and strives for autarky so that the nation can be removed from [the power of] the international system entirely. Fascism is unapologetically pro-violence, unlike most politicians across the spectrum who see usage of the military as an unfortunate reality of statecraft that should be used only when other options are exhausted fascism sees violence as integral to the maintenance of the nation's virility and masculinity and sees any form of pacifism as tantamount to treason for that reason. Other politicians see state violence as a means to an end, to stop an enemy country or maintain law and order but fascism sees violence as the means itself.


If you'll read above you'll find that most so called fascist parties from Ukip to the AfD to the GOP under Donald Trump are conservative parties, even reactionary in some respects but not fascist parties.

Enoch Powell made the same clarification many years ago when he was called a fascist and a Nazi for the '*Rivers of Blood*' speech. He wasn't a fascist or a Nazi by any definition, neither were similar elements to him like the Tory Monday Club — they didn't want to create a whole new society based upon anti-democratic values, a national cult and glorification of violence they were simply traditionalists who wanted to return society to how things used to be. Whether you think that's good or bad is of course up to you, but what isn't up for debate is what fascism is.",0,136,AidanofLindisfarne

A note for laymen: 

* GSM is marketed as ""2G""
* CDMA is marketed as ""3G""
* LTE release 9 is marketed as ""4G""

2G is the shittiest, 3G is okay, and 4G is the best. 

The LTE standard is designed so that you only ever use 3G or 2G if you *really* have to (i.e. if you can't get the better technology, which is 4G).  Whenever you have 4G coverage, your phone will try to use the 4G cell signal. This means that where there's 4G coverage, people use 4G before they're forced to fall back to 3G or 2G.

The coverage maps show that Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T do indeed have large 4G coverage in the U.S. So it really doesn't make sense to call Verizon a CDMA company. And it *really* really doesn't make sense to say that T-Mobile or AT&amp;T are GSM companies.

Look at the French Revolution.  They overthrew the monarchy, only to usher in a period so dark and bloody that it's now called ""The Terror.""  Then almost immediately afterwards, Emperor Napoleon rose to power to make a mockery out of the unfocused egalitarian ideals of the revolution.  On the other hand, the American Revolution had a very clear goal at the outset - creating a new form of democratic republic inspired by particular philosophers - and on the whole managed to successfully remain on-track towards that goal.  They were against the king *and* for a new democracy.

Fair criticism on the forcing part, especially because of the prestige classes, but not quite what I was talking about.

&gt; What is 'fucking cool' about being lectured by the writer for daring to like Star Wars games enough to buy his drivel in the first place?

Yes. The game is a deconstruction of Star Wars. I love Star Wars, but complicated it ain't. It's very black and white, and the Jedi Code break down pretty damn easy. The Sith are straight evil, so of course that's a shit show. I ENJOY the deconstruction of that. I think it's fucking cool. I like picking ideas apart and looking at the pieces. The hag berates you for either choice because the Jedi/Sith teachings are ridiculous in real life. So when developing the EU, the the force ends up having to drive the users to extremes in order for those philosophies to make any sense. Kreia don't like it.

I can enjoy exploring those flaws and still enjoy a simple good vs evil fiction story. The original trilogy was fuckin great, and Star Wars is super fun. I've never played NWN2 and so I don't have an opinion on that one. I might agree on that one though, who knows.

I said worker cooperatives. That denotes collective ownership of some sort possibly with a measure of worker self management, all within a capitalist environment.

I said nothing about abolishing the private property systems or creating communes. This would be inside of countries like the United States, and it has nothing to do with places like Cuba, which from a worker labour perspective are also not socialist in the least bit.

Anyway here's a reddit with lots of links in it. https://www.reddit.com/r/cooperatives/comments/4cbh0e/worker_cooperatives_are_more_productive_than/

&gt;I'm always baffled by the great lengths people try to go to label it as something else.

Well you brought Cuba up totally unprovoked so clearly you had a reason but in the end Cuba isn't a socialist society because socialism is not state ownership by an authoritarian regime of the means of production. Its the exact opposite. Just because Castro said he was a socialist doesn't mean he acted as one.

When a country acts like the Soviet Union or Cuba its collectivizing ownership under the state and so it becomes state capitalism. Socialism cannot tolerate a private property structure that sees the state own what should belong to the people when the people have no democratic control of that state. In reality socialism cannot tolerate private property schemes like this. A state maybe, but not state ownership of the economy. That's not socialism, whatever you've been told.

Socialism at its core is a value system about economic freedom and economic democracy. So in this sense a place like Cuba is as socialist as most people see the crony capitalism of the west as a true free market, that is to say not at all. So when libertarians in America criticize the American government for subsidizing corporations unfairly its not wrong to say that its not a true free market as a result. In the end the same is true of saying a place like Cuba is not socialism, because its most basic functional realities diverge from the most basic principles of socialism - worker self management, democratic economic control, no tyrannical owners. In Cuba the tyrannical owner is the state under the Castro regime. In the Soviet Union it was the Communist party and its authoritarian bureaucracy.

In the end its worth noting that Lenin himself said that this was not socialism because to anyone who actually read a lick of socialist literature it obviously wasn't, the same way government intervention isn't true free market capitalism. Its obvious so he justified it as necessary because in the end the Soviet Union wasn't in a position to be a socialist society, both because it was being attacked by Europe and without a powerful state and army it would have been overthrown (you can argue the provisional government that Lenin overthrew could have negotiated a better situation with Europe but that's all questionable particularly since the provisional government was fucking about not getting elections going) and because it was preindustrial and since Marxism basically outlined the Communist revolution as having to come from a post industrial society that collapses it didn't match even his own ideology. That's what late stage capitalism is supposed to be, a society that has gone through industrialization and lead itself to ruin. Maybe that will happen one day, maybe not, but in any event Marxism doesn't match what was going on in Russia and Lenin couldn't lie about that and many Communist in his day also thought it was ridiculous for Lenin to have lead his coup over the March revolution.

So the lengths one must go to not label such a thing socialism is the exact lengths it takes to understand the nature of socialism and history around it, which is barely more than it takes to explain fundamental capitalist ideas and how free markets diverge from the corporatist state capitalism we see these days. Would you say its fair to start calling crony capitalism or state capitalism or corporatist capitalism instead free market capitalism because whole generations of people were deluded into thinking that what isn't a free market is one? That's basically the same thing as calling non socialist regimes socialist. Its like saying that North Korea gets to redefine what a democratic republic is because they put it in the name.

Socialism is not safety nets, its not state ownership. Its abolishing the private property system and devolving economic decision making to the lowest levels. I defy you to find me a single place people in the west call socialist in the 20th century that properly did this. Its no different than saying a democracy that only allows one party is democratic.

But anyway, that's all beside the point. We were talking about worker cooperatives in a capitalist society.

Esidisi was something like a historian or scribe in Pillar Man society; his close relationship with Kars was in part because he jotted down all his research and was closely involved in his evolving philosophy. 

Pillar Man society in general is possibly matriarchal, given how the old woman seemed to be their leader. They also don't really seem like a warlike race given they supposedly ""knew no strife"" and had no competitor species. Instead, Whammu, Esidisi, and Kars learned about warrior culture from the nations in Europe. Their different status' also explain their different takes on it:

 - Whammu was a child and grew up in the culture, and so he follows it reverently

 - Esidisi found it interesting as a historian and so he studied it like a hobby, hence his less serious take on it

 - Kars simply learned it as an academic, so he knows how it works but he doesn't actually follow it

Joseph saying ""my own grandson doesn't even know my face"" isn't referring to the fact that he's never visited, but rather that he hasn't been able to visit specifically in the last few years, during which time lack of Hamon practice hit him especially hard and he aged considerably. Relatedly, this explains why he still looked like Jotaro/his younger self only five years before SC when he met Tomoko.

Suzi Q and Jotaro have an especially close bond. This is why (in the anime scene during the High Priestess fight) Jotaro is quickly able to reassure her of Joseph's safety. This is also why Suzi trusts Jotaro enough to tell him that she knows what's actually going on. Joseph didn't tell Suzi about Holly because he didn't want her to worry, but Suzi has already dealt with the Pillar Men so she's (a) intuitive enough to figure it out on her own and (b) strong enough to face the dreadful prospect with grace. So instead, Suzi doesn't tell Joseph that she knows because she doesn't want him to worry about her, instead confiding in Jotaro.",0,56,WhenTheWindIsSlow

&gt; Michael Kiwanuka is a British musician of Ugandan heritage who writes songs combining soul and rootsy folk influences and sings them with a deep, husky soulful voice. After signing with Communion Records, Kiwanuka recorded his debut EP, Tell Me A Tale, with the help of Paul Butler from The Bees, who took the Muswell Hill, London native to his Isle of Wight studio to record the songs. The record came to the attention of Adele  who invited Kiwanuka to support her on the singing star’s 2011 European tour. The BBC announced on January 6, 2012 that Kiwanuka had won their Sound of 2012 poll, an annual survey of music critics and industry figures to find the most promising new music talent.

&gt; The Church is an alternative rock band which formed in Sydney, Australia in 1980. Initially linked in with neo-psychedelia acts of the period, their music later became largely defined by the interplay of guitarists Marty Willson-Piper and Peter Koppes coupled with the abstract lyrics of bassist/singer Steve Kilbey. Their debut album, Of Skins and Heart (1981), earned them their first radio hit ""The Unguarded Moment"". They were originally signed to EMI's Parlophone label, but record company dissatisfaction led to them being dropped overseas, which limited their exposure early on. 

&gt; After signing to Arista in 1988, they saw their largest international success with the album Starfish and the American Top 40 hit ""Under The Milky Way"" which resurfaced on the soundtrack of the cult movie ""Donnie Darko"". Whilst the band remain feted by their peers, subsequent commercial success proved elusive: 1990s follow-up album ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" failed to capitalise on their success, and the band weathered several line-up changes after its release, first losing long-term drummer Richard Ploog, then Peter Koppes following 1992s ""Priest = Aura"". That album baffled and confused many fans upon its release as to what band The Church was considered to be, but is now considered a seminal album and one of the most revered by Church connoisseurs. The vacant drum-stool on Priest=Aura being occupied by Jay Dee Daugherty of Arista labelmate Patti Smiths group, and it was produced by Gavin MacKillop of Moose.

&gt; Reduced to a two-piece, Kilbey &amp; Willson-Piper re-grouped with the assistance of drummer/producer Tim Powles to record 1994's ""Sometime Anywhere"", concluding their obligations to the Arista and Mushroom labels. The commercial decline, combined with the Church being ignored again by a music press more focused on the Nineties' music trends, could have brought about the demise of the band, had it not coincided with the breakthrough of the internet, thus enabling  direct  communication from the band to its passionate cult fanbase.

&gt; This brought about a new beginning for The Church, with Peter Koppes rejoining the band for recording 1996s ""Magician Among The Spirits"". The band (with Koppes back into the fold, and Powles now as the permanent drummer ), hit a re-newed creative surge and with regained selfconfidence, released ""Hologram Of Baal"" 2 years later, and toured Australia, the USA and Europe. 

&gt; The first decade of the 21st century found the band releasing severeal highly critically acclaimed albums, like 2002's aptly named ""After Everything Now this"" and 2003's ""Forget Yourself"", the latter breaking new ground with bandmembers swapping instruments in the recording process. Live performances stray from high profile events like the 03 concerts at Sydney Opera House and the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, to low-profile gigs for smaller audiences, often confusing old 80s fans, surprised to find the band still playing, wrongly assuming the band just being one in the never-ending string of reunion acts.

&gt; 2009's album ""Untitled#23"" marked yet another highlight.. its essence represented in just 10 songs, and with a strong less-is-more approach, the albums core identity being on par with Starfish, it also finds Steve Kilbey breaking new ground as a vocalist.

&gt; 2010 saw their 30th anniversary, with extensive touring in the US and Australia. Their unique position and importance in the australian music scene was recognized with an ARIA award. Read more on Last.fm.

The U.S. is absolutely enormous, with plenty of local climates, terrains, and even cultures (albeit generally more similar to one another than in Europe).  A much more fair comparison would be between the U.S. and Europe or some other continent, as one country there is more like one of our states.

Ok, with that said, I have to take a weasel answer here. Everyone has different priorities. If you're looking for a place with great healthcare, the U.S. not only isn't the best, it's awful. Well, maybe unless you're rich. If you want to be somewhere progressive, you'd probably be better off somewhere else, though we certainly have our areas where that's easy to find.

- Public transportation (Especially Trams in Mid-Sized cites) is heavily favored

- There is typically an old and new city center, the old one being the densest with tight alleys and corners, as you go out from the center wider boulevards may be noted with several roundabouts and open-space.

&gt; ROME Italy will seek to deport more migrants who have no right to be in the country and will open new detention centers to hold them before their expulsion, according to a written directive and a ministry source.

&gt; Police chief Franco Gabrielli sent a two-page directive to stations across the country on Friday ordering them to increase efforts to identify and deport migrants a week after Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri was shot dead near Milan.

&gt; Gentiloni&amp;#039;s predecessor, Matteo Renzi, agreed to set up &amp;quot;Hotspots&amp;quot; to identify and fingerprint migrants who arrived on Italian shores, but he refused to build large detention centers to hold migrants who did not qualify refugee status.

Steve Rowe, M&amp;S’s chief executive, angered small own-label suppliers in November when he promised to protect shoppers from the impact of sterling’s drop since the Brexit vote.

Rowe ruled out passing on price rises to consumers, and his buyers refused to negotiate with trading partners based on the currency swing. He said M&amp;S would cancel out the pain of more expensive raw materials through “optimisation of our supply base” and by selling in greater volumes.

Rowe was likened to King Canute trying to hold back the tide and his pledge was described as “rubbish” by some suppliers, who said they would stop shipping food and drink products to M&amp;S in the new year unless it paid them more to compensate for sterling’s depreciation. The pound is down 17.4% against the dollar and 11.1% against the euro since the EU referendum in June, making it more costly for British companies to buy ingredients from overseas.

M&amp;S is understood to have backed down and agreed price increases of up to 15% over Christmas with some suppliers. The ceasefire raises the prospect of higher bills for shoppers and a squeeze on its profit margins. One supplier predicted shelf prices would rise 8%-10% for items such as chocolates and confectionery, nuts, tea and coffee.

He said M&amp;S had put itself in a “ridiculously hopeless situation” with its promise. The store’s commitment to responsible sourcing, known as Plan A, left it with fewer choices than many rivals in terms of switching suppliers, he added.

Inflation of up to 3% this year and slower wage growth caused by employers’ Brexit jitters are set to squeeze retail spending, piling pressure on a sector that is already wrestling with online competition.

Companies such as Birds Eye and Unilever have been accused of “Brexit profiteering” for demanding price rises for products such as fish fingers and Marmite. However, consultants have drawn a distinction between multinationals and smaller suppliers, some of which are said to be on the verge of collapse.

M&amp;S said it stood by Rowe’s promise not to raise grocery prices. “We never comment on commercial discussions with suppliers. We remain committed to competitive prices and offering our customers great value,” it said.

NHS on alert
Whitehall has ordered the NHS to block Brexit-related price rises requested by suppliers.

The Department of Health sent a memo to the NHS on November 30 saying the pound’s value was “only one of many factors that go into pricing considerations. It is the responsibility of suppliers to manage these . . . risks,” it said.",0,12,BritRedditor1

There's a bit of racial tension with middle easterners (Pakistani), especially in areas with high immigrant populations, and as I said, nationalism (white polish/eastern european) but Indian, Asian and black people aren't subject to the institutionalized racism that they are in America. Part of that is because of Britain's colonial history - plenty of PoC were citizens of the empire, and treated as such (after the taking over, of course.) Part of it is because forced slave culture never really happened along racial lines in Britain, so British black culture isn't as strongly separatist as American black culture. Britain never codified separatism or racism into law, it was never illegal to marry interracially, and British citizens of all races have always had the vote, so there's clearly a massive difference in the attitudes toward PoC.


Most of the racial hate crimes are in NI, and I have never been to NI so I can't speak first-hand on that, but if I'm not mistaken it comes out of the militant Protestant movement there, and is directed almost entirely at the Roma and Pakistani populations.

In particular, a se vedea sfatul de la sfarsit:

&gt; I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that most people in the tech industry have one asset which is orders of magnitude larger than all their others: the present value of their future career. Optimizing for the returns of this asset beat the heck out of optimizing for the returns of your portfolio, one reason why you should spend less time on trying to eke out an extra 1% on $100k in your IRA and more time on developing skills to get you your next career upgrade. (If you’re in business, substitute “increase revenue” for “career upgrade” — though everyone in business is in a career and everyone with a career is in business, at the end of the day.)

nu sunt in mod necesar de acord cu opinia lui ca ""buying books has ridiculously high ROI"" pentru ca presupunerea pe care o face el (""assuming you read and get value out of them"") e nerealista - nu prea ai cum sa stii cat ""value"" scoti din cititul unei carti (daca o citesti). Dar, merita sa va ganditi la asta:

&gt; anything else which meaningfully bends the curve of your business or trajectory upward.

Pot fi cursuri pe coursera, pot fi ""side projects"" pe github, poate fi participarea intr-un proiect ""open source"" care estimati ca va deveni popular, poate fi un MBA, poate fi o incercare (chiar esuata) de a face un startup... variaza de la om la om; da' merita acordata multa atentie acestui aspect, mai ales daca sunteti tineri.  In special, nu lasati companiile sa profite  exagerat de mult de oe urma voastra - ganditi-va mereu si ""ce castig eu"" (in termeni de experienta, ""marketable knowledge"" etc - nu doar bani). Incercati sa nu fiti ""de neinlocuit"" (cel putin, nu inainte de a avea 50 de ani :)), pentru a nu va plafona.

---- 

[edit] Si un  ultim sfat: in software, cu cat esti mai aproape de ""client"" (de bani), in general faci si tu mai multi bani. E pur si simplu trista realitate - daca lansezi un feature care aduce direct bani, esti mult mai apreciat decat daca faci un tool intern care imbunatateste productivitatea intregii companii. Desi al doilea s-ar putea sa fie si mai valoros, si mai ""challenging""/ greu de facut uneori. Asta se traduce in practica in doua chestii concrete - pe care eu personal le-am observat si in experienta proprie:

A. Firmele al caror produs e ""software"" (care vand soft, produs de ele; nu care ""inchiriaza programatori""; nu care fac soft pentru nevoi interne (e.g. banci); nu care vand hardware si au nevoie si de software pentru a-l opera) tind sa aprecieze cel mai mult programatorii, si sa le ofere cele mai bune salarii, conditii de munca si de dezvoltare ulterioara a carierei.

B. Nu prea e profitabil sa lucrezi la ""systems programming"" (sisteme de operare dedicate/embedded; compilatoare; soft de virtualizare folosit ""in-house""; etc). E munca interesanta, ai de multe ori colegi destepti, si poate sa ti se para ca ""asta e programarea adevarata, nu ce fac toti fraierii cu pagini web"". Well, asa-i, e interesant si e o provocare continua - da' fraierii s-ar putea sa castige mai mult ca tine. In special daca factorizezi si ""skill""-ul (i.e. un programator mult mai slab ca tine poate castiga din web comparabil cu cat castigi tu... daca te-ai reprofila pe sisteme distribuite, si te-ai angaja la o companie  ""potrivita"", valoarea viitoare a salariului tau probabil ca ar creste considerabil). Corolar la corolar: hardware (system verilog, vhdl, etc) e in general mai putin profitabil decat ""systems programming"", si mult mai putin profitabil decat ""client-oriented programming""",0,7,s-o-r-o-sh

Besides, real life tribal structure is very highly familial and federalized, it could very well be an easy sell to say not only the patriarch of each family holds sovereignty over their tribal lands. This idea would naturally develop into small democratic city states sending representatives up to regional governments that in turn send representatives to national government.

Good players get very similar results across DD, cruiser, and BB. If any class stands out its CV. For example [Flamu's alt](https://eu.warships.today/player/539072843/El_GringoPotato) and [RNGsama](https://eu.warships.today/player/500701135/RNGsama) both have even slightly lower solo winrates on battleships than on cruisers and DDs, and much higher ones on CV.


Although BBs do produce the highest damage numbers, they generally deal the least valuable damage (very little to DDs, very much to other BBs) and offer the least utility. They are also the most reliant on their team. DDs and cruisers can just go elsewhere when there is nothing good to do on their flank, while BBs are pretty boned when that happens. This forces them to play very central positions, which can be quite dangerous if the team doesn't cooperate well.

I think there are two reasons people complain so much about battleships:

1. RNG citadels. Some ships are more vulnerable to this than others (like [Nürnberg](https://streamable.com/umb40) and Chapayev) but its generally kinda bullshit when you dodge and angle at 20 km and 2 shells with maximum dispersion randomly find your citadel rear and take off half your hitpoints. Thankfully it gets a lot better at T9 when cruisers get heal, but in return they see a lot of Yamato which is a great ship at randomly dealing shitloads of damage.

2. Bad players. BBs are the easiest class to play and it takes some skill to counterplay them. Players who are not good at keeping map overview, using concealment, and angling/dodging can get rekt by BBs quite easily.",0,3,Roflkopt3r

&gt;Im happy to see that you're comfortable enough to advocate for a WASP ethnostate at the expense of alienating most of White Americans when we're currently teetering on the edge of third world nonwhite destruction. 

Why not go one step further? Why not just accept the Muslims and the Jews? I'm happy to see that you're comfortable enough to advocate for Christian ethnos late at the expense of a meeting most of the followers of Abraham while we're currently teetering on the edge of  third world non abrahamic destruction... or why not accept anybody who fights against the Communists? Or anybody who's against the Muslims? Once you accept the premise, why draw some arbitrary line? You're willing to go one step, so why not to? 2 steps, so why not 3? You've already accepted- even advocated for- the premise.


&gt;This country is 63% non-Hispanic white and declining. Focus on preserving all White Americans first yeah? 

And you've already redefined that to include Southern and Eastern Europeans who were not accepted before. Why not one step further and accept the mischling? Why not one step after that and accept European Ashkenazi Jews so long as they do not accept Zionism? Why not one step after that and accept the Sephardim as long as they embraced Western culture and capitalism and fight against the Muslims? Even Germany accepted the mischling. You've already impressed the premise.

&gt;Principles don't mean jack shit if they aren't practical.

By that reasoning, you should give up your white ethnostate in North America. It's not going to happen. It's not practical. Reduce immigration, fight foreign influence, but you'll never get rid of the blacks and Mexicans that are here. So it doesn't mean jack shit according to you.


&gt;The American Party died because they suffered from the same exact narrow mindedness that you do. They would've been much better off forming alliances with the Irish and pushing for blacks to be deported back to Africa and keeping our government safe from Jewry.

By your reasoning, we would be best off forming alliances with the blacks to fight against the Jews. After all, the Nation of Islam is no friend of the Jews. Or maybe we'd be better off siding with the Jews against the Muslims. you've already  advocated the principle.

&gt;Instead they were too busy fighting the Irish and not combating the African invasion that was occurring in our southern states.


Yeah, a lot of that African population is actually here because of the Jews bring them here against their will. So you can actually blame slavery for a lot of that. It follows, then, that the Confederacy was also wrong, because it would likely have continues slavery and if feasible continued to import slaves and further add to the black population.  therefore one would have to side with those who opposed slavery from the beginning  inside with the Union against the Confederacy during the Confederate war for independence. But that's just another implication of your premise.

Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation, HM Government, March 2015:

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/408604/2903652_RotherhamResponse_acc2.pdf

Page 6:

""People who abuse children must be stopped. Their race, age or gender is irrelevant. In Rotherham, the majority of the known perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage – but misplaced concerns about political correctness stopped any proper action being taken. 
This is not acceptable. We cannot allow professionals to avoid tackling the sexual abuse of children by members of ethnic minority communities for fear of being seen as racist.
Child sexual exploitation is not exclusive to any single community, race or religion. There is no culture in which sexual abuse is not a serious crime."" 

So obviously the Pakistany sentiment is not completely unfounded.

Are Asians disproportionately represented in prosecutions for sex offences?

https://fullfact.org/news/are-asians-disproportionately-represented-prosecutions-sex-offences/#anchor

It's an older article but it has some further information regarding the topic. Here is a part of the conclusion as a tl;dr:

""While both the HM Prison Service and CEOP datasets have problems associated with them, there is nevertheless some evidence to suggest that sex offenders are 'overwhelmingly white' in terms of the raw numbers.

However while just under 82 per cent of inmates incarcerated for sex offences in 2007 were classified as white, this was actually lower than the overall proportion of the population that were similarly classed, which stands at 87.5 per cent (for England). At six per cent, the proportion of sex offenders in custody that were classed as Asian almost exactly matches the proportion of the population classed similarly.

Looking at grooming offences collected by the CEOP, while the white ethnic group makes up the largest proprotion of all offenders, it is far below the proportion of white people in the general population. Meanwhile, those of Asian origin are indeed disproportionately represented here.""

About ""Asians"":

The fact that many articles and reports use the term Asians is caused by the definition used by the ONS itself. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/480250/bulletin.pdf

Page 97: ""Mapping of different ethnicity categorisations""

They use ""White, Black, Asian, Mixed, Chinese or other and not stated"". Asian includes Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, other. 

Therefore official reports and documents often just use Asian. Most statistics I checked adhere to these definitions. So there is no ""language policy"" it's statistics. 

About child sexual exploitation:

Interesting read regarding the problems of gathering meningful data and compiling statistics about CSE:

https://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/1in5/Source/PublicationSexualViolence/Lalor-McElvaney.pdf

also an interesting read about CSE in Europe:

http://www.ecpat.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Regional%20CSEC%20Overview_Europe.pdf

Page 12-13:

""In  some  European  countries,  child  domestic trafficking for sexual purposes has been reported to be growing and to have become increasingly complex. In the UK, for example, a recent report by the children’s charity Barnardo’s warned that the trafficking of British children around UK cities for sexual exploitation is rising, with the average age of victims falling from 15 to about 13 over five years. Grooming methods have also become 
more sophisticated as abusers now use a range of technology – mobile phones, including texts and picture message;...the “inappropriate relationship” usually involves an older abuser with 
control over a child. Known also as the “lover-boy” phenomenon, this method was first identified in the Netherlands and is now being detected and reported in  other  European  countries,  including  Austria and Ireland. In the Netherlands, changes in how “lover-
boys” operate have been noted recently, with an increasing use of blackmail and violence against the girls and some victims being used to recruit new girls (these girls are called “lover-girls”).""

You can read the rest yourself. It's quite interesting.

So boys and girls, here you have some information which maybe will actually help you to get an informed opinion.

As I understand it? Yes. The EU has undercut the sovereignty of its member states. I don't know exact details, but I do know that a lot of issues Europe is facing can be traced back to decisions, made by the ruling council of the EU.

&gt;Last month neo-Nazi killer Thomas Mair was handed a life sentence after murdering Labour MP Jo Cox at the height of the UK’s EU referendum campaign.

These are just random paragraphs thrown onto the end of the article. You know, just in case it wasn't already clear from the rest of the article that Trump and Brexit are basically on the same level as KKK, Nazis and fascism. It's laughable.

If you look at the questions asked, they were directly about facism. Not Trump or Brexit. The Independent has artificially drawn those conclusions for you. The majority of this article is based on those artificial conclusions. 

Aside from all of that, it's worth mentioning that The Independent themselves commissioned this survey and surprise surprise, they got the result they wanted. We don't know who responded to this poll or how informed those people were or how leading the questions were (i.e. in what context they were asked). But what I do know is that the majority of random people in the UK would not be able to give a sufficient description of what fascism even is.

It's a fact that people are blind to propaganda if it happens to support their pre-existing bias. For some reason liberals think that propaganda and bias only exists on the right. Is this perhaps the greatest lie that the liberal media tells its readers?

Adam Curry, one of the hosts and a pilot who ran an aviation company for some years, typically goes into depth on such aviation-related news.

Curry put forward at the time that the rebels were indeed responsible but crucially it was a mistake owing to malicious transponder jamming in what appeared to be a framing attempt. In the first half of 2014 there had been NATO military exercises observed by Germany and others with the ability to disrupt the transponders of civilian aircraft, which are used by radars on the ground to distinguish between civilian and miliary craft among other things. Mere days prior there were international [reports](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/10898385/13-planes-vanish-from-radars-over-Europe.html) of over a dozen civilian aircraft that had disappeared from radars around Europe, with these NATO military operations being suspected as the cause for the disruptions.

Leading up to this incident Ukrainian aircraft had also been observed in videos by nearby witnesses shadowing civilian aircraft. Given the ability of transponder jamming and had the military plane aligned itself within line of sight of the ground radar it would have appeared to be the only plane in the air to the rebels and would have been used to paint the target for the surface-to-air missile.

The thesis follows that the rebel ground troops, who had been monitoring for Ukranian aerial milliary craft attacking the region were mislead, tragically, by a jammed transponder on the civilian plane, and seeing only the shadowing military plane displayed on the radar fired the surface-to-air missile in the direction of MH-17.

It should be noted this September in a press briefing Russian military intelligence stated no other large aerial craft were observed in the vicinity during the incident, apart from one UAV, according to their radar data which collects both reflected data from the sky and also transponder codes. It's unclear however whether shadowing another plane in such a way would have been detected using this system, but from the presentation it appears there was no visible termination of the transponder signal. It nonetheless made for a rather compelling possibility.",0,2,Okatis

&gt; Ludovico Einaudi (born 23 November 1955 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian composer and pianist particularly noted for the use of developing melodious phrases in his piano compositions.

&gt; He began his musical training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan, gaining a diploma in composition. Later, he studied with Luciano Berio. In 1982 he gained a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. He currently resides on a vineyard in the region of Piemonte.

&gt; Although Einaudi would prefer not to be labeled as any particular type of composer, he is generally considered a minimalist.

&gt; ""In general I don't like definitions, but 'minimalist' is a term that means elegance and openness, so I would prefer to be called a minimalist than something else."" - Ludovico Einaudi

&gt; Official website: http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com

&gt; (2) Pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi was born in Turin, November 23, 1955. His mother, also a pianist, would play for him as a young child, planting the seeds for what would become a fruitful, illustrious career. Einaudi studied under Luciano Berio at the Conservatory of Milan, graduating with a diploma in composition. In 1982 his talents would win him a scholarship to the Tanglewood Music Festival. The experience opened Einaudi's ears to new ideas like minimalism, world music influences, and aspects of pop music. He spent the next several years composing for the ballet, including Sul Filo d'Orfeo (1984), Time-Out (1988), and The Wild Man (1991). Einaudi turned a corner in 1996 with the release of his first collection of solo performances, entitled Le Onde. This record started Einaudi down the path toward becoming one of Europe's best-selling pianist/composers. 1999's Eden Roc and 2001's I Giorni, both for BMG, captured the solo piano world's attention, both remaining best-sellers for years to come. While seemingly at the top of the composition world, Einaudi ventured into the world of film composition, a journey punctuated by his Best Film Score award in 2002 for his work on Luce Dei Miei Occhi. Einaudi noted in interviews during that period that he missed concertizing, and began performing again regularly. New works blossomed from this effort, including 2004's Una Mattina and 2006's Diario Mali. 2007 welcomed Einaudi's seventh studio album, titled Divenire, where he was accompanied by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. The follow-up, 2009's Nightbook, was much more self-consciously reductionist, featuring solo piano minimally adorned with electronics, and saw Einaudi begin to be appreciated by fans of the ""post-classical"" school that he had arguably, at least in part, inspired. A double-disc best-of, Islands, was released in 2011, and at the beginning of 2013 he signed a new deal with Decca and unveiled the long-gestating In a Time Lapse, which had been recorded in a remote monastery near Verona and saw a return to a more ""classical"" chamber music sound. 2015 brought the release of Elements, which featured violinist Daniel Hope, the Amsterdam Sinfonietta, electronica's Robert Lippok, and Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco, among its several guest performers. Recorded at his home studio in Italy, it was inspired by nature, math, science, music, art, and how parts connect to form a whole. ~ Evan C. Gutierrez Read more on Last.fm.

On the other hand, a majority of the 'normal' muslims in the western world are not entirely (or even at all) aware of this fact (this is why there is no large scale jihad in America or Europe right now) and follow a watered down version because they were brought into the faith at birth but have been exposed to western culture all their lives.

According to Islam, everywhere where sharia is not implemented, is called the ""House of War"", and they are technically supposed to be in constant jihad with the house of war.

Oh and fyi, all non-muslims in a sharia country have to pay extra tax and are looked upon as dirt by muslims, this is the reasoning behind why german/swedish women get raped by islamic immigrants, the immigrants are true muslims and all those peace loving liberal muslims you might have encountered are just 'normal' heretic 'muslims'

Eh, sorry but radical left wasn't much about the disaffected youth, or armed propaganda had not much to do with ISIS style terror attacks other than both using violence.

&gt; They're an off-shoot of Turkish far-left at the start. If you read memoirs and interviews you find that they were together with other armed far-leftists in Syria when the coup of '80 hit them all (tho the complaint from the far left was that they were too murderous and ensured the Ocalan faction survived by killing off the competitors). 

Ocalan faction survived by working with the state, and while they were with the other armed factions, they left even claiming that they're some radical left group not even a decade after they were formed.

&gt; Yet, we don't see terror presented as part of class struggle any more, do we?

Give it time mate. Europe haven't seen such for some decades as well, than they started again. Left is just weak.

&gt; You truly think Turkey cannot crush ISIS within its borders? Why? 

Because you cannot really crush such organisations, especially when Turkish government is a one like that they can't really even go with policies that would dry their social bases. ISIS is not some huge organisation within Turkey, so as other armed Islamist groups, yet a couple cells are enough to terrorise the country.

&gt; ISIS isn't like the PKK where the recruitment can happen in a specific region and the youth can be completely surrounded in a PKK-friendly environment.

&gt; The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, spent years in his previous role as Luxembourg&amp;#039;s prime minister secretly blocking EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance by multinational corporations, leaked documents reveal.

&gt; The leaked cables reveal how a small handful of countries have used their seats on the committee to frustrate concerted EU action and protect their own tax regimes.

&gt; The Guardian spoke to another former member of the code of conduct committee, who did not want to be named but corroborated claims in the leaked cables that Luxembourg was regularly among those looking to frustrate EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance.

&gt; MADRID Around 1,100 sub-Saharan African migrants tried to cross into Spain&amp;#039;s North African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco on Sunday by storming a border fence, though most were eventually turned back, the Spanish government said.

&gt; Spain&amp;#039;s two enclaves in Morocco, Ceuta and Melilla, are often used as entry points into Europe for African migrants, who either climb over their border fences or try to swim along the coast.

&gt; In early December more than 400 sub-Saharan African migrants managed to force their way over the Ceuta border fence.

Wrong. And I'm going to try to show you how. I see that this isn't something you do consciously, you just don't know any better. Brevity is the soul of wit. 

You say Phds affect job quality not immigration status and I say that's untrue. In situations where your degrees are not recognized, it affects immigration status. If the United States does nos recognize your phd, then it would affect your immigration status, yes or no?

&gt;I can piss in the sea but it doesn't make the sea contaminated by piss

These kinds of statements are unnecessary. Please stop making them. 

&gt;here's not really any correlation between development of the country of origin and success rate in migration to a developed country

That information does not show what you think it does. My theory was that the people who want to migrate from developed countries have greater ability to do so than people from developing countries. Read that sentence again. By definition, that is a small group of people, most people in developed countries do not wish to migrate. You are saying that because more Indians migrate than Britons, indians have an easier time of it. That is beyond childish, it is idiotic. To do a true comparison you would need to find the percentage of Britons that wish to migrate, let's say 5% and the percentage of Indians that wish to migrate, let's say 95% and compare outcomes. Even you can do the math on that and see it's a losing argument which is why you put together that silly argument. 

&gt;I would say people migrating through marriage are rare

That is your opinion, informed by YOUR experience and it is not true. 

There are two types of immigration policies - family reunification, and skilled migration. In the past family reunificaiton was the norm, but skilled migration has taken off inthe last 40 years. 

Look at this chart- http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Research%20Papers/2013-14/FamilyMigration-2.GIF?la=en

It's from here:
http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/FamilyMigration

You can see that family migration was historically the norm and still makes up 30% of migration to Australia. That is not rare, that is ONE in THREE. 

With the stem visas, again you entirely miss my point. 

&gt; You can't just be an English teacher in first world countries, for one most of those countries are in Europe in which case good luck if you don't already have an EU passport, then there's the fairly abysmal pay.

Did you read the four categories? Because I never said anyone can move from a FIRST WORLD COUNTRY to a FIRST WORLD COUNTRY by teaching english. That is information suited for FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES to DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. Where even you, must admit, there is merit in distinguishing that opportunity by where the person is coming from and where they are going. No one is paying Indians to teach hindi in Alabama. 

&gt;As for the requirement of my mentioned areas, it's nigh on impossible to migrate to first world countries unless you're in a shortage occupation, can get a talent visa (or are otherwise established in your field), or can get some form of family reunification visa.

30% of migration to Australia is family migration. That is not nigh impossible, again, that is ONE in THREE. You really cannot see outside of your box. 

&gt;But in general they still have a strong, if not stronger, preference for local talent over foreign talent due to high unemployment and underemployment rates so if you don't offer something that locals can't e.g. a higher quality foreign education plus some experience, or native/strong English skills, or in some places creative 

Please try to be more self aware. I am from the first world and have lived in the developing world and lived in other first world countries. I can speak to that experience. I cannot speak to the experience of going from a developing country to the first world. 

You clearly do not understand the dynamics of moving from a first world country to the developing world. No one is moving there to compete with local talent at the local rice factory. When foreigners enmesh themselves into the third world it is in upper middle class jobs that are wholly connected to their status as foreigners. There are endless paths that open up for foreigners once they are on shore through other foreigners. 

You are using your own experience and extrapolating what first worlders must have to do in the developing world and it is completely wrong.

For example,  the Bernie Sanders campaign in America was just as populist as Trump's, the difference is one resides on the left and one on the right. Obama's entire campaign was much the same, they also had their ""bad guys"" they were going to protect the vulnerable, screwed over masses from.

However, when it's Brexit, it suddenly becomes a dirty word because most of the mainstream parties, media outlets and business interests were against it. 

Now, that's not to say that Brexit is necessarily good, or Trump, or Bernie Sanders, or any of these things are necessarily bad... but the use of the term populist now in a negative way simply reflects the fact that those who have benefited from very little political, economic etc. change in the past decades are upset about potential changes now. 

The term nationalist is much more difficult to pin down, and often mixed with isolationism and so on, that's why there is more use of the term ""nationism"" now, which is the preference for sovereign nation states that cooperate with trade, security and such, but make their own laws and no external laws are superior to their own. So for example, nationists in the UK would oppose the EU because of the ability of the European Commission to make laws, or the European Court of Justice to outrank British courts. Yet, you could be a nationist and still love Europe, and not be xenophobic or anything like that.

Putin is not a good guy, Russia has been acting as an aggressor, these things are true, and it's also true that Eastern Ukraine, and particularly Crimea, have been filled with Russians since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine by the Soviet authorities under Khrushchev was not done with public consent, and when the Soviet Union was crumbling there was plenty of desire for Crimea to rejoin Russia or to be independent. At one point, the Crimean parliament declared independence from Ukraine and set a date for a referendum on independence, but the government in Kiev declared it unconstitutional and through backroom dealings managed to make the referendum go away.

But Crimea has been a pro-Russian region ever since, as are large parts of Donbass. When, in early 2014, a populist movement overthrew a democratically elected government, many parts of East Ukraine descended into protest. What they saw was the pro-Russian President, who they voted for, overthrown by people waving EU flags, and later the installation of a pro-EU government. Nobody seems to bat an eyelid at that in the West, it's very strange.

That doesn't excuse Putin pushing into Crimea and holding a referendum there, or Russia's involvement in East Ukraine, but jesus christ let's stop pretending that this conflict and unrest just fell out of the sky, and also remember Ukraine is not the only country with large pro-Russian regions.

Hapa guys on average do ok with minority/mixed women. And despite what many on this sub think, Asian women are without a doubt the group that hapa men do best with. No hapa with a clue would ever say that hapa men are not generally popular with Asian women. If anything, there is a disinterest in full Asian women by male members here that seems to be a pretty common.  

White women tend to be more of a crapshoot.  It is commonly thought on this sub that whiter features = better, but the correlation between dating success and how white a hapa looks isn't *that* strong because even in a society with Caucasian beauty standards there are certain ""non-white traits"" that are considered attractive.  Plenty of whiter looking hapas have weak facial structures, twink-like builds, and really no sex appeal to speak of.  Plenty of more Asian looking hapas have masculine physiques with masculine features inherited from the Asian side like prominent cheekbones. This lottery of features of varying degrees of attractiveness/unattractiveness a hapa can inherit is so varied that it is easy to either conclude false extremes such as the whole eurasian beauty myth or that hapa guys are generally ugly.

Your argumentation begins with an Arnold Toynbee quote. Which shows me you do have an interest in history and so you might know that the trend you're referring to (multiculturalism will end civilization) is not something that we can actually see looking at history. Actually most of the rich nations became so rich because of an influx of immigrants and cultures (e.g. Ancien Greek colonial diversity, hellenistic diversity or the Dutch 17th century tolerance that led to their golden age). 

To be frank the 'social cohesion, and nationalism' was actually propagated by Napoleon because he saw that it was much cheaper to invent a fake 'social cohesion' (by culture, skin color or religion) and let the people fight for 'their country' than hiring soldiers to fight. Historian David A. Bell has a great book about this subject.

"" later are wiped out by opportunistic invaders. That is, they lose social cohesion and become chaotic, which leads to opportunism by the powerful and prole revolts that the leaders buy off with bread and circuses."" 

If you said this was a Marx quote i would have believed that easily. This fits with the traditional leftist view that is why the left is eager for a party that tries to inhibit that kind of opportunism at the expense of the full working class (for if the working class is all white, black, or diverse the opportunist will still exploit them) that way i fail to see what multicultural diversity has to do with this part of your argument. 

""Diversity is what industry and government demand so that (1) government has permanent Leftist voters, which supports more government and thus finalizes its power and (2) to keep wages low so that workers are essentially slaves."" I do agree with your second point but i also fail to see the problem of industry and government demanding diversity. Looking at Post-war Europe 'diversity' was needed by government and industry because the workers that came East-Europe would help build their shattered countries up, and even in the sixties when working class immigrants were requested to come from Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Italy etc. to do low wage paying jobs that the people of the country did not want to do themselves. It seems like the only one not benefiting from these deals are the immigrants when people get mad at them for 'taking their jobs' while the people are fine with governments allowing and companies hiring immigrants, giving them even lower wages. The immigrants nor the people that are left with no jobs are on the wrong side here. 

I personally thing that this cycle of government and industry requesting immigrants and immigrants and their cultures that need jobs to survive alway ends in a confrontation with the people of the country stuck in between the two sides. Nationalism is a revolt indeed, against humankind. I see a lot of nationalist easy tell immigrants their religion is made up and invented but they fail to realize how culture gets constructed by humans as well. The nurture part of your existence is filled with culture so it is understandable that people will cling to that so that the world will make more sense. But in these kind of situations i think it's important to look at how culture becomes culture, how norms become norms and how diversity is inevitable but has no moral ground. Diversity is not bad, nor is it good, it is inevitable because we we humans. Being human means nothing other than having a certain mental capacity that gives you the freedom to choose what kind of human you want to be. 

It is a choice to cling to a construction like culture, religion, divide in skin color. People choose to live by identifying themselves as one of those constructions, which is completely understandable, i'm in the same boat. Even by referring to myself as a 'leftist'.

Also, not comparable. The one's in charge of the car (the driver) aren't the ones who are also designing and legislating it.


&gt;Not really, no. You cannot be in the European Union without giving the other members the mandate to influence you. That's just how it is. And given that you haven't left yet... It would be the same shit if Scotland decided to leave the UK. And besides, Trump isn't president yet.

Am iesit din comunism, si am intrat direct in situatia asta de propaganda politica mincinoasa. In alte tari, populatia a avut timp destul sa isi formeze o opinie critica. La noi, inca se mai controleaza opinia de catre clasa politica, prin intermediul presei. Noi nu am avut niciodata ocazia sa vedem ce inseamna sa ai o clasa politica cinstita. Singurele arhetipuri de lideri cinstiti le avem de dinainte de comunism - majoritatea chiar din evul mediu.

De acord in mare parte, dar intrebarea mea initiala ramane: chiar crezi ca se va schimba situatia asta vreodata brusc si radical, cu 180 de grade? Educatia este unica solutie, educatia civica si implicarea populatiei, dar asta este un proces care dureaza. Si nici macar aia nu e o solutie perfecta, nici macar aia nu duce la garantia ca vei avea vreodata partidul ala squeaky clean asteptat de unii si de altii. Uita-te prin ziarele din alte tari ce parere au locuitorii despre politicienii lor, ai putea fi surprins. Da, e cate un politician chiar apreciat, dar sa crezi ca *toti* membrii unui partid sunt de calibru mare... cum ziceam, ai putea fi surprins.  

Also, mi se pare amuzanta (no offence) ideea de ""trebuie sa aratam EU faptul ca nu suntem multumiti de clasa politica actuala"" :) Una la mana, ce poate face EU, vin ei cu politicieni straini, sa faca aia partidul cel ideal la care viseaza unii? Si apoi, cine nu e multumit de clasa politica actuala? Eu si cu tine si inca o mana de oameni. Restul sunt fie complet neinteresati de subiect, fie sunt fericiti c-a iesit PSD. in nici un caz nu poti zice ca majoritatea e nemultumita. Cat despre prezenta slaba la vot, e un fenomen raspandit (uita-te in America ce putini au votat la alegeri, sau si la Brexit de exemplu vezi cati au participat), si chiar daca nu era, chiar daca eram noi unicul stat al planetei cu prezenta scazuta la vot, asta nu indreptateste EU sa intervina in treburile interne ale unui stat suveran. Pur si simplu nu e treaba lor asta. Suna bine ideea ca ""sa vina EU si sa ne salveze de noi insine"", dar in realitate nu prea merge asa. Mai ales ca EU are probleme mai mari si mai serioase decat ce e prin Ro, daca iese Le Pen la alegeri in Franta chiar nu se stie ce se va intampla cu EU mai departe, si cat o sa mai existe.

Other than that, I try to leave them alone as much as possible. I find that touching them, washing them or having anything at all touch them leads to greater pain and itching. Sometimes the itching is worse than the pain, I swear I can feel the pus gathering and rupturing my follicles. 

I tried going paleo to clear my skin, but that seemed to make it worse until I realised that if I stay away from eggs then they go away. Paleo is so egg-heavy that it made me worse until I stripped the eggs altogether. Now I just get much smaller pimples and blackheads on my chin. I still have some pitting, but otherwise it's just purple discolouration that fades after about six months. I never thought I'd be so happy to have basic, boring whiteheads on my chin, but it's so much better than the agony of cysts. Good luck and best wishes. ",0,1,maramoomoo

I dunno how much you follow French politics. There's a guy named [Jean-Luc Mélenchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M%C3%A9lenchon) he was the 4th person in the last presidential election, and has a significant support and weight in french politics. This guy is as anti-EU as it gets, most of his programme regarding the EU is very very similar to Marine Lepen's before 2011. (In 2011 since people were afraid of Marine Lepen's anti-EU policy, she soften a lot her policies towards the EU and the Eurozone before the 2012 presidential election.)

Of course, his reasons are totally different, on Marine Lepen side it's sovereignty. Jean-Luc Mélenchon is more anti-german, and anti-single market

Some other anti-EU parties include Podemos, Syriza and the Five Star Movement.

Most far-right people are pro-free market, which is what the EU excels at right now. And once in power, they realize that they can't do much against the EU and start softening a lot. Viktor Orban and Andrzej Duda are two good examples of this. On the other hand, Alexis Tsipras tried to hold an anti-EU referendum (even though he softened a little bit as well)

Hint from a Jew with supposedly high verbal IQ: **stop letting language fool you**. The word ""Turk"" will confuse you forever if you don't think about it clearly. There are NO Turks in Turkey. They speak Turkish, some of their cultural heritage is Turkish (yoghurt and ayran), but that's about it. Genetically, they have very little relation to Turks (i.e. Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Uyghurs of China); and you don't have to be an anthropologist to know this, just compare them visually. Genetically, they are Anatolians, or in other words, pretty much a fucking wildcard. There is no such thing as ""half-Turk"" in Turkey, not in any way that there is in the US or Europe.. their identity revolves around the Turkic culture they inherited and the nationalism forged by Atatürk. So I'm afraid to tell you nobody in Turkey is Turkish, they ARE a bunch of Albanians, Greeks, Kurds, Pontic Greeks, pre-historic Anatolians.. almost every single Turk you come across will be ""BUT HE'S HALF-X"". And that's the problem. A Turk isn't white or not-white; it's case by case. If it's still confusing, think about how the old Byzantine Empire and its citizens spoke of itself as ""Rome"" and ""Romans"" even though to us now it makes little sense apart from a Roman Catholic standpoint (nobody there called it ""Byzantine"".. just like nobody in Vichy France government called themselves ""Nazi occupied France lelelel""); to them, they were culturally and spiritually very much ""Roman"" despite being Greeks. Or hell, look at Indians, how come they worship hawks and shit and live in teepees if they're supposed to be Hindu? Oh wait, that language thing again.

&gt; Describing 2016 as a year that gave many the impression that the world had &amp;quot;Turned upside down,&amp;quot; Merkel urged Germans to forsake populism and said Germany had an interest in taking a leading role in addressing the many challenges facing the European Union.

&gt; Merkel, who is seeking a fourth term, has made security the main election platform for her Christian Democrats.

The universe is still expanding, just in a different direction and different way than it was before. Finally the EU was turned into Legends for creative reasons.

1) The most important part of TW series was transitions between strategy and tactical part of game. Every killed soldier counted, every veteran unit was even more precious. You could win the battle with little losses but it was all eclipsed by a lost of this unit of 18 cavalryman (from original 80) with golden experience bars. That was most important success factor for me - the battles alone wouldn't be enough, although they were important in big picture. C&amp;C and Starcraft were totally different genre so I wouldn't bring them into discussion. I spent some fine time with EU 1 but it was different concept of game. 


2) It is useless feature under current flawed mechanics. If there wouldn't be this illogical maintenance cost increase with every new stack=commander there wouldn't be any additional cost. And in R1 and M2 the difference in city income (thanks to leader) was in thousands of gold every turn, not to mention being able to control taxes directly when leader was in town (there was an option to turn it off thou). Btw Medieval 2 was hight point in series so most of the time I will be comparing to that title. I can't count how many times I've used ""only cavalry"" stacks, especially on eastern parts of the map - where cities were really far far far away from each other sometimes. Anyway, it is a topic for very long discussion about strategies. 


3) The AI was always sending armies around, not to mention rebels hiding and looting here and there, so there was always a need to fight a battles. And cavalry stacks were helping a lot to speed up things. Moreover the wars in Europe were always quick, because Pope was always issuing a warning to catholic states and You always need to race against a time, storming city/castles not waiting them up. It was so interesting mechanic. Anyway, there was a need to fight enemy army first, because it would go back to surround own cities defending them in large numbers. Also I was playing always with the biggest unit size setting - because battles and campaign time was optimal then. Because of that, if I remember correctly, recruiting time for many units was 2 turns. And there was limit to how much You could train in one city/castle per turn. 



I'm always annoyed when someone tries to tell me what or why I think, especially when They are wrong. I admit I have rather nostalgic and less enthusiastic approach towards new mechanics in games but it is mostly because games in last years had some very bad turn towards faster, quicker, more shallow and simpler, better looking on twich or youtube mechanics. Probably because young generations prefer that. That is bed - IMO - therefore I wouldn't agree with these changes with exception for UI improvement which is good overall change. But I have this bad habit to try to see what could be other person point of view and understand that he or she might have different taste or opinions. That is why I prefer to firmly defend my point of view more and in the same time not to be intrusive or trying to change opinion of other person. It is a bad habit, because in these times very little persons have similar. Usually it is ""my right is the only true one so agree with me or be gone"" approach. Not saying it is Your kind of way but in last months got really bad experience and few times I broke my own rules and behave inpatient and wrongly with my replies. I was just tired of some things.  
The only thing that annoyed me in Your opinion was this assuming things and trying to tell me why they are so wrong - because I still stand by my point as my own vision of perfect game. 


I would like to apologise You for my part of this ""little escalation"". I really don't have pleasure in any kind of forcing arguments or quarrelling or trolling. You have absolutely right with discussion being best way to improve some things. I always have this problem with English being not my primary language, so everything takes me longer and simple checking spelling (even with autocorrelate on) is taking ages. Thank You for Your opinion but I think we will not agree in stacks=leaders issue, which to be honest is fine. :) We don't need to agree on everything. :)

No, I disagree. We simply want ethnic Europeans to be dominant in Europe again. We desire homogeneity, but that doesn't mean we want to harm non-whites or non-Europeans like the SJWs want to harm us. 

&gt;throw tantrums when anyone questions your ideas

This is an over-generalisation. Come on, *every* political ideology has these kinds of people. Even Anarcho-Capitalists can be like this. It's not just the Far-Right and Far-Left that have these kinds of people.

&gt;seem unable to form an argument that isn't ""you're a cuck"" and generally don't seem to understand that you're just another side of the same regressive coin. 

No, we have evidence behind us. For example, would you deny that there are genetic differences between the races? Do you deny that tribalism is part of human nature? Would you deny that the free market works?

&gt;There is no better example of horseshoe theory than the alt right

I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but the horseshoe ""theory"" is really just lazy argumentation. You're just saying ""X group and Y group share a similarity that I disagree with, and therefore they're both the same and wrong.""

It's intellectually lazy and dishonest, and it poisons the well too. Debate the individual ideas and arguments. Don't just slap a big 'BAD' sign on something you disagree with.

&gt;Regressive

How is this any different from 'cuck' or 'racist' or 'Statist' being used to discredit ideas? See? You're doing the very same thing that you're criticising me for. See, I can play the ""Le Horseshoe"" game too.

EDIT: I would say the one thing SJWs and the Alt-Right agree on is the importance of groups. Groups matter.

Yes, advanced countries may experience declining birth rates, but this ignores the issue of immigration. Less advanced countries with higher birth rates just keep sending over more people, and those immigrants will likely have higher birth rates. This is why only countries like Japan - which allows very little immigration - really see declining birth rates.

Also, you have to consider the effects climate change will have. If coastal areas become uninhabitable, especially in poor countries, refugees will be flooding into Europe, America, etc. That's the real danger of overpopulation - what is stable today could become overpopulated tomorrow not because the population goes up but because there is less ability to support the same number of people.

Including lots of gut-wrenching details about all the shit he stole, the numerous security controls he overrode, how he almost got caught a couple times, and how none of facts back up his claims of simply wanting to be a whistleblower.

Here's a few random excerpts:

&gt;A few months after starting in [redacted] Snowden asked to apply for a more senior position in [redacted] as a regional communications officer. His supervisor did not endorse his application. When he was not selected for the position, Snowden responded by starting ""a controversial e-mail exchange with very senior officers"" in which he questioned the selection board's professional judgment.

===

&gt;Snowden also modified CIA's performance review software in connection with his annual performance review, by manipulating the font. This behavior led to Snowden' s recall for ""professional consultations"" with the head of all CIA technical officers in Europe. This was the first but not the only time more senior CIA officers attempted to correct Snowden' s behavior.

&gt; Modern Talking was a German pop music duo consisting of composer/producer/background singer Dieter Bohlen and singer Thomas Anders founded in Berlin in early 1983. It was the single most successful pop group in Germany (by sales).

&gt; First formed at the end of 1984 (Anders was 21), they unexpectedly became immensely popular with their standalone disco hit ""You're My Heart, You're My Soul"", which was then followed by ""You Can Win If You Want"" and ""Cheri, Cheri Lady"". They released two albums a year from 1985 to 1987 while also promoting their singles on television all over Europe. After splitting up in 1987, the duo reunited in 1998, at first only testing the waters with new versions of hit singles and again reaching the top of the charts unexpectedly. Bohlen and Anders split again in 2003 due to irreconcilable disagreements (they had never been friends in the first place). Thomas Anders started another solo career immediately, while Bohlen had by now begun devoting most of his time to new talents, especially those he discovered on the German edition of the TV show Pop Idol/American Idol.

&gt; Global sales of Modern Talking records were 120 million units, according to BMG in June 2003, and they have become the biggest-selling German music act in history, so far outselling even Frank Farian's projects Boney M and Milli Vanilli, Michael Cretu's Enigma, Sandra, the Scorpions, Snap! and Rammstein.

&gt; Modern Talking were successful in Europe, Asia, South America and some African countries. In the United Kingdom they reached the top ten only once with the song ""Brother Louie"" (in 1986, #4 UK). They did not feel very good about promoting their singles there due to being marketed in England as a gay group like Erasure and Culture Club. Indeed, in the UK ""Brother Louie"" is regarded by those who remember it as nothing more than a novelty record by a one-hit wonder.

&gt; They were almost unknown in North America by mainstream standards, never appearing in the charts there, and due to lack of backing from a record company and lack of time did not go there to promote their music. Composer Dieter Bohlen employed mood-evoking lyrics and intellectually-designed, synthesizer-based music which was out of vogue in the U.S. before Modern Talking even formed.
In 2006 Bohlen included a secret message in his song ""Bizarre Bizarre"" which was played backwards: ""There will never be an end to Modern Talking"". However, Bohlen said ""he meant to say that the music of Modern Talking will live forever"" [4]. Anders has kept the Modern Talking songs in his repertoire and produced songs in a similar vein for his solo records (""Independent Girl""). In 2006 he produced an album of Swing and Jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books, one of which also detailed Modern Talking's history from his perspective, and sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with.

Thailand's view of LGBT people is... not very good. As a Thai myself, I can attest to that fact. The words they use to describe non-straight people are a strong example. Femboys are called ""Second catergory girls"", which belittles their status and further perpetuates the local stereotype that gay people are just women in men's bodies. 

Yes, Thailand has long been a haven for LGBT compared to its neighbours (except for maybe Singapore), but it's still leagues below how Europeans treat gay people. Men acting girly is a common target for comedy. In the eyes of others, gay people are ripe targets for comedy and belittling.

I'm still glad that it's changing, however- young people in Thailand are becoming more and more tolerant, and as more and more Thai celebrities come out as gay, we will most likely see society push toward equality.

The problem is that the British also know nothing (as a group) about brewing tea. Individuals from Britain will all tell you they know the one true way to brew tea, that no one else in the country would agree with.

Also, British people in general don't quite get how weird it is to drink tea.

Basically no one in the west cares about tea aside from Britain.

#United States of America  
  
&gt; You are organizing a peace summit in regards to the Syria Civil War. Who do you invite, and what are you demands?  
  
The principal invitees to the summit will be Russia, Syria, Turkey, the Free Syrian Army, and the Kurdish people of Rojava. Also invited will be France, the United Kingdom, and a delegation from the European Union.  
1. My primary demand is for a peaceful and diplomatic discussion to determine a beneficial end of hostilities for each party to the Syrian Civil War. This is relatively up in the air as to what that will be but it is in the United States and the worlds best interest that Syria be kept whole for the most part.  
2. A determination for the result of Rojava must be worked out between the Syrian Arab Republic and Kurdish people of Rojava. At the very minimum, some form of autonomy should be given to the region.  
3. The constitutions of Syria and Rojava must be worked to run parallel with one another as well as represent the best interests of the whole of the people in Syria and not just one political or ethnic group.  
4. All those in attendance must agree to the terms set forth in these peace talks. Those failing to do so will be seen as warmongers by the United States and will lose American support or see a direct intervention into the conflict by the American military in favor of the opposing side.  
5. Upon an end to hostilities by all parties invited to these talks, all sides must agree to turn their focus on eliminating ISIL from Syria.  
6. After all hostilities within Syria have been brought to a close, a further meeting must be held to determine the return of refugees fleeing from the crisis in Syria in a responsible manner.  
  
&gt; Brazil is found to in possession of weapons grade uranium. Outline your response strategy, assuming they reject American intervention.
  
While Brazil is certainly capable of developing and handling weapons grade uranium, it is irresponsible to allow them to do so. At this time, no nation needs to be armed with nuclear warheads, especially a nation that does not currently have a need for them. My first course of action is to telephone the President of Brazil secretly to give them a chance to dispose of the uranium on their own with US inspection. If that does not reach the desired outcome, I will threaten to bring up evidence to the UN and call for a vote to allow UN inspectors to investigate the claim. When the investigation turns up positive, I will then call up for a UN embargo of Brazil as well as begin seeking the ability of other South American nations to place anti-ballistic missile systems within their nations in preparation. In the event that Brazil appears to be preparing a nuclear weapon for launch (including a test), the US will slip a covert team to sabotage the launch and make the launch failure public for the Brazilian people and the world to see. From there, a proper response can be determined.  
  
&gt; A war in East Asia cripples Chinese infrastructure and leaves a gaping hole in US trade. How do you react ?
  
My first approach is to focus on US allies and who can fill in the trade gaps the quickest. In particular, I would focus on India, Japan, and South Korea with Taiwan and Thailand being included. I would then call a meeting with all major companies that relied upon China for their production to reform their manufacturing practices so that instead of rebuilding fully in China, they plan to move their supply lines primarily to America and more stable nations with a limited focus on China instead. I would also push for some inclusion of Latin American and African nations to be included as well. This will provide jobs for American workers and begin to distribute more of US trade throughout the world instead of piling all into one nation and creating a reliance of that nation. It will also help underdeveloped nations grow their economies and in turn, we can grow business in those places as well.  ",0,1,brantman19

This war seeks, at home and abroad, to erode our values, our democracy, and our institutional strength; to dilute our ability to sort fact from fiction, or moral right from wrong; and to convince us to make decisions against our own best interests""

""the wider battle is more subtle, a war of subversion rather than domination. The recent interference in the American elections means that these shadow tactics have now been deployed – with surprising effectiveness – not just against American allies, but against America itself. ""

""This Russia does not aspire to be like us, or to make itself stronger than we are. Rather, its leaders want the West—and specifically NATO and America — to become weaker and more fractured until we are as broken as they perceive themselves to be. No reset can be successful, regardless the personality driving it, because Putin’s Russia requires the United States of America as its enemy.""

""We can only confront this by fully understanding how the Kremlin sees the world. Its worldview and objectives are made abundantly clear in speeches, op-eds, official policy and national strategy documents, journal articles, interviews, and, in some cases, fiction writing of Russian officials and ideologues. We should understand several things from this material.

First, it is a war. A thing to be won, decisively — not a thing to be negotiated or bargained. It’s all one war: Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, the Baltics, Georgia. It’s what Vladislav Surkov, Putin’s ‘grey cardinal’ and lead propagandist, dubbed ”non-linear war” in his science fiction story “Without Sky,” in 2014.

Second, it’s all one war machine. Military, technological, information, diplomatic, economic, cultural, criminal, and other tools are all controlled by the state and deployed toward one set of strategic objectives. This is the Gerasimov doctrine, penned by Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, in 2013. Political warfare is meant to achieve specific political outcomes favorable to the Kremlin: it is preferred to physical conflict because it is cheap and easy. The Kremlin has many notches in its belt in this category, some of which have been attributed, many likely not. It’s a mistake to see this campaign in the traditional terms of political alliances: rarely has the goal been to install overtly pro-Russian governments. Far more often, the goal is simply to replace Western-style democratic regimes with illiberal, populist, or nationalist ones.

Third, information warfare is not about creating an alternate truth, but eroding our basic ability to distinguish truth at all. It is not “propaganda” as we’ve come to think of it, but the less obvious techniques known in Russia as “active measures” and “reflexive control”. Both are designed to make us, the targets, act against our own best interests.

Fourth, the diplomatic side of this non-linear war isn’t a foreign policy aimed at building a new pro-Russian bloc, Instead, it’s what the Kremlin calls a “multi-vector” foreign policy, undermining the strength of Western institutions by coalescing alternate — ideally temporary and limited — centers of power. Rather than a stable world order undergirded by the U.S. and its allies, the goal is an unstable new world order of “all against all.” The Kremlin has tried to accelerate this process by both inflaming crises that overwhelm the Western response (for example, the migration crisis in Europe, and the war in eastern Ukraine) and by showing superiority in ‘solving’ crises the West could not (for example, bombing Syria into submission, regardless of the cost, to show Russia can impose stability in the Middle East when the West cannot).

The spiky nature of that data makes it difficult or impossible to see trends in the data. The spikes also tend to over-emphasize unusual occurrences rather than what is actually going on.

A longer answer follows.

In EVE terms, daily averages emphasize outages or days where there are unusually high or low numbers of logged in players (such as an event day for a high or a patch day for a low). EVE log-ins are also very cyclical, with the peak every day around 1940 and the low every day at 1100, plus local peaks and lows.

Even longer answer:

For, say, temperature charts, that information is very useful. But for tracking players logged into EVE, it's counter-productive. For example, Quant gets too focused on averages and even rolling averages for PCU: the highest number of people logged in each day. But if there's an outage at the peak time, the PCU is unusually low, rendering this data less useful. Or if the outage is long but not at peak time, the PCU won't reflect what actually happened that day. Averaging on PCU also over-emphasizes the European player base. During this past summer, there were periods where European player trends and American player trends were different. My daily averages show that. A PCU average doesn't.

Example: look at the following two charts.

http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-players-2016.png

http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/eve-pcu-rolling18months.png

The first one is rolling averages. The second is rolling PCU averages. The second chart will over-emphasize European player activities. Look at late March on the PCU chart. See where the 7-day average (blue line) dips? That was a European low-point. Now look at the same place on the first chart. The blue line there is spiking hard upward.

First of all, lane = / = everything.

Rekkles has never had trouble being at least even in lane even with extremely shitty supports.

Mithy has been playing really not like the best EU support. He was by far their most useless player in worlds. He single handedly lost them 2 games before 10 minutes by extremely bad timed roams which led to Zven getting fucked over because of mithy's mistake.

Soaz has not been too great in s6 but he is not as low as expect. Perkz has also been kinda down and he has been steadily decreasing since the ending of spring split.

Arguably you have top laner that will lose against Soaz.

Mid laner that is being hyped up to be an insane mechanical god versus someone who has been rather bad recently so at worst it should be expected for mid to go even. Of course we can't know how good caps actually is but from what we've seen I think it's not too far fetched to say that he can go even vs Perkz.

Then you have bot lane. ADCs in lane are only as good as their supports most of the time. You can't really solo win lane as ADC. You just follow up on the support and if Mithy is still not back to his usual form and makes bad plays which lead to putting Zven behind then he won't be able to pop off and carry G2. And Rekkles has always been a very good ADC and he is famous for always being at least average. He is known for being even in CS even in a 1vs2 when YS was constantly roaming. Unless there are really disadvantages bot lane match ups, Rekkles will go even.

All in all you have:

top that loses

jungle that is way better

mid lane that will most likely go even

bot lane that will go even.

Then it's all about marco and teamfighting and g2 were far from macro geniuses as we saw them getting styled on at worlds.

You look at difference in the table and in one year they finished on 72 points but were back in 5th place, to me that shows the real difference last year was the underperformance of the ""bigger"" teams inflating Spurs' position rather than them stepping up a gear.

Spurs came to life last season. The season before they were just the Spurs we've known for so long. They didn't start the season well at all, they were very unlucky putting in some good performences but not getting results. The transition wasn't seemless hence the point total - but equally you could see there was more to them, just like Liverpool when they clicked. They picked up 3 points from their first 4 matches. As the season came to a close they mentally fell apart which is understandable for such a young and inexperienced squad - only 4 of the first team regulars were over the age of 25 and very few of them had challenged for league titles. 

I know its easy to cherry pick stats but if you look past their terrible start and finish to the campaign, they picked up 65 points from GW 5-34, for a PPG average of 2.24, title winning form. And in that period they comfortably looked the best team in the league.

But again, the point I was making wasn't just that Spurs were as good as some were making out, it was also that the big teams didn't underpreform, they just weren't very good. City, Liverpool, Chelsea and United all have far far better squads (and managers) now than they did last season which is why Spurs no longer standout, but it doesn't mean they don't have the resources to challenge for the title. Liverpool, City, United, Arsenal and Spurs have all looked favorites to win the title at some point this season and Chelsea will slow down though are the clear favorites as it stands. All it takes is one poor run of form to take you out of top 4 in the current state of the Prem.

&gt; Lets just say it's not a surprise to me that Spurs are back in the battle for the top 4 this season rather than looking like title challengers.

Does it also surprise you that City and United, two teams below Spurs in the table don't look title challengers? I'd guess so because they were the two clear favourties to the title at the start of the season. Chelsea may well run away with the title but its not like their squad is considerably better than any other. As well as they've played, they've also been very lucky not having to juggle European football and having virtually no injuries. Imagine if Chelsea had lost Costa for 5 matches, Luis for 8 or Kante for 8 matches? Would they be 6 points clear at the top? would they fuck.",0,18,ReflectingGod

Top kek.

Forg1ven is probably the happiest man on earth. Getting invited to a team and basically getting a free ticket to semi finals. Out side of the 2 games versus EDG(where he wasn't even respected and EDG got a weaker lane vs them) he has been as invisible as you can get. Farm, farm, farm, farm, farm, farm, turret, farm, farm, oh random kill because your team came to your lane because they saw you are not moving, farm, farm, farm. 

Jankos ,Odo AND Ryu were carrying everyone in H2k. I don't know where you get this bullshit about Forg1ven carrying them but you obviously either have almost no knowledge about what's happening in league past bronze level or are oblivious or didn't watch the games.

Sure, Ryu struggled against Crown but overall he performed better than Forg1ven. Anyways even if we say that they were even or forg1ven was better(which he wasn't), he was still no where close to what Odo and Jankos did for the team. They practically put everyone on their back for 90% of the tournament. Jankos solely gifted Forg1ven the best possible laning phase he could have vs ssg game 1 and fed him as fuck with his constant camping and forg1ven was still close to as irrelevant as a scuttle crab.

More farm and gold than Uzi who is practically the only and main carry in his team when you are a 3rd priority carry that doesn't even fight. Smart. I wouldn't be surprised if had the largest difference between DPS and EGPM and gold allocation in the team. It's laughable to have to many resources thrown into you and do 400 damage. The only times where h2k didn't manage to get them a heavily winning lane he looked lost. Winning a lane you are supposed to win = / = you are a good laner.

Biggest meme 2016 is that forg1ven actually played good when he came back in h2k.

He was for sure at least top 2 in spring and played really well but his performance after coming back was laughable and extremely overexaggerated and extremely is an understatement. Replace him with any of the top ADCs in EU and you'd have h2k still in semi finals.",0,5,Balgar_smurf

North Africa main Kingdom//
Alliance to Europe (coast and centre)//
Modernization by the influence of Europe Africa has a good economic structure but little telephone connection, little electricity, own culture, parliament, constitutional monarchy, religion varies by region, no European gods, no European gender roles//
- hunters / collectors, own guns, feed on tubers, flesh, insects, generally plants / fruits (rare), fish only in tropical areas, clean drinking water, own fields, agriculture well managed//
Own currency depending on area,
Alliances of the empires ensures the benefits of the participants,
(United Empires), the goal is the avoidance of war, better conflict resolution, the internal market, a better solution for conflicts, general communion with sovereign empires, before UE there were wars, after that the empires remained for themselves, then they decided for mutual support and peace treaty
Monarchy works because it is democratic.
Assassins are from third world and want to rebel against neglect, problem for third world is that they are the only part of the world population that is non-alliance, other countries have had alliances for a long time prior to the UE , third world was used for raw materials, lost in wars in which Africa got through, so letters are used as a threat (eventually)

The War: How has Africa managed to get through?
- no modern weapons, but strategy and fauna (fantastic addition)
-Guerrilla wars
-ship fleet? Africa may be in disadvantage-Still in planning
European continent is more modern in the following respects:
-power / infrastructure, telephones (education / services (f.ex. medicine) that means there are pills, in North Africa pills are expensive, but there are herbs
Education in Africa there are also schools, no telephone masters except between castles because Africa can not yet pay for costs (taxes, electricity)
-&gt; Taxes must be paid for the expansion of infrastructure because Africa does not have its own generators.

Why war? Still in the planning stage

This sounds political and actually reminds one of our world situation but I wanted to give it a fantastic touch ( with the flora and fauna for example).
I also thought about it like that: The third world sees the only possibility in attacking through an assassination because it wouldn't have a chance otherwise, So it forms secret alliances to attack the African kingdom because it is the weakest yet. And maybe the other empires can't aggressively act on it because they would put their economy in danger since they rely on the third world as a source. The UE works together so they can act on it. A goal of the assassins could be to chop the mentioned phone connection so that Africa is alone.

Are the small and midtable teams really as good as we make them out to be ? Realistically nothing will top the Leicester thing in any league ever again. The closest thing I can think of recently is when Montpellier won Ligue 1 with Olivier Giroud being amazing. 

This has been repeated before but it has to be said again . Mid Table sides overspend on mediocrity with a few gems here and there that dont tend to last long at the club.The money helps but you hit a point of diminishing returns.  This isn't a video game . Even if Watford make 100 million they can't spend 60 million and buy Lacazzette .As much as people make it out that football is all about the money (and to an extent it is) the athletes have to think about prestige and image cause those things correlate to money coming in from sponsorships. Not to mention that you don't just get to that point without having some sort of desire to be the best (obviously not everyone has it to the same extent a.i. Oscar leaving to China but Ibrahimovic allegedly declining such a move.)

Another example of what I mean can be brought back to our unlikely winners who carry the torch of the PL's unpredictability. The missing cog in Leicester
title winning squad Ngolo Kante left previous champions and current CL participants Leicester to join us , 10th placed Chelsea. And therein lies the problem ambitious players who give it their all want to play for Chelsea , Madrid , United etc. 

Being a Lyon player means more than being a Watford player even if the pay is less . The sponsorships of getting European football and playing for a historically significant side makes up for that while being more meaningful to him. Just like being a Chelsea player means more to Kante than being a Leicester one and being a Madrid player would mean more than being a Chelsea player to most players (and trust me saying/typing that was hard)

Money is an important resource in anything but it alone can't account for the football culture that still exists.  There are counterexamples to my words but the extreme amount of spending that clubs like PSG have done has only got them so far and the same could be said for City and even us ... albeit imo to a far lesser extent.

I honestly doubt that but I'd be interested in your reasoning.

&gt;High level corruption (the only one present in Italy), while being a huge problem, is not the direct cause of this economic mess (just take a look at the growth figures during Craxi government, one of the highest in more than 30 years, if don't know who Craxi were look it up).

Isn't it the european union that is acknowledging all these issues? Wasn't the Commision for example one of the ones that were heavily in favour of a Hotspot/Distribution Quota system to tackle the refugee crisis? That would certainly have been to the benefit of Italy. 

The EU fundamentally has in my oppinion a fundamental problem in that it can be paralyzed by small groups of member states tht it needs consensus and a lot of national politicians seem less interested in that, but are rather going for quick political points at home.

* I really didn't want to do any tourist things in Brazil.  I've lived there before, visited several times and just didn't want to visit the hot spots.  In fact, I was there during carnaval and didn't even go to any celebrations.  I also didn't see a single beach while I was there.

* Some of the activities are free.  For example, walking around the historic center of Split or hiking in Cabo Verde are both free once you're there.

* I don't feel the need to visit every museum.  I know I sound like some sort of hillbilly, but I suffer museum fatigue after some time.

&gt; My point is just that Latino ancestry cannot be as generally held accountable as white aggressors, mostly because many Latinos are the product of this aggression, but whites in the US are beneficiaries of this aggression.

I find this to be an exhausting game of Semantics.
Absolutely no culture on earth is free of these kinds of Atrocities. Before The Europeans showed up, the Meso-Americans had been fighting each other over tribal lands and customs and a number of other conflicts.The strongest/most advanced won and enslaved or totally destroyed the other and so on. 

Are you familiar with the Aztecs? They were a brutal empire that enslaved neighboring Tribes for centuries. When the Spanish showed up, it was not only the Spanish that whipped them out, they were assisted by neighboring tribes who has been victims of their ritual sacrifice and subjugation for a very long time.

The Natives and Early Europeans in the US (which is different than the Spanish Latino history you originally mentioned) was a different story as well. The Early American settlers fought back and forth for hundreds of years with the Indigenous people, Entire settlements were whipped out, women raped, children disemboweled and impaled on spikes, of course the commonly know scalping and so on. I was not a smiple matter of the Europeans just waltzing it and destroying the ""innocent"" tribe.

The show and the plot is intriguing for sure. I watched both seasons. I finished the 2nd season this Christmas. 


Although you can enjoy the season as a regular audience, I noticed there are subtle brainwashing moments that most of the Hollywooders are now doing. 


If this spoils you, skip my comment. I need to because it's where the brainwashing theme kicks in. 


1. Juliana, a refugee in Nazi Reich, having a dinner with her savior family. A kid asked *""Is it true that they eat dogs in Pacific states?""* Juliana answered *""No.""* She teased **”They only eat cats.”** She later said **”I’m teasing.”**
&gt;My observation: It's not like in-your-face stereotypes, but it keeps this ""dogs/cats-eating"" east asians stereotypes going. Now if you wonder what's wrong with this. Here's what could have happened. **Horse** meat was considered States Delicacy in Europe back in the days. You eat horse meat in states dinner. These days, we don't eat horse meat. You could turn this **horse eating** habits of Europeans into European stereotypes. But Hollywood don't make it and don't promote this history. So this horse eating stereotypes disappeared, while dogs/cats eating stereotypes continues to live on.  A typical White American response would be **It's just a TV show. Don't take it serious.** 


2. I forgot her name, a Japanese American woman who became rebellious towards her own government in Pacific states. [That’s how good the show, making her name forgettable, and yet only for a sex toy.] She appeared out of nowhere. Frank Fink joined the Resistance later. Do you actually believe the sex clip between Mr. Fink and Ms.Rebel necessary in the show after they successfully retrieve a small portion of explosives? The sex was just a night. It’s NOTHING. It adds nothing to the story. 
&gt;My observation: According to Hollywood, it is necessary to have an Asian female to have sex with White looking Jews. Frank Fink has nothing to look like a typical Jews. But they make him Jews in this show. His friend could have been a real Jew with such a profound nose display. 
&gt;My 2nd observation: When a Japanese kimpeitai arrested Ms.Rebel (Remember both are East Asians), The Kimpeitai became shooting and Ms.Rebel appeared to look like **Madam in distress**. Mr. Fink appeared out of nowhere, picked a gun on the street, suddenly looked like an awaken HERO from all the rages he accumulated inside, shot the Kimpeitai. Ms.Rebel is finally released. That moment showed only a White guy can save an Asian woman from an evil Asian guy. A typical White American response would be **It's just a TV show. Don't take it serious.** 
&gt;My 3rd observation: They could have made a Japanese American guy to become rebellious, joining the Resistance and fighting against the Evil Empire. They don’t, and they won’t. Only a true freedom loving Asian girl will do so. 


Those are my take on racial dynamics from MITHC. 


If you want more, here’re more of the story I think need to happen.


1. The show cannot continue to season 3 unless they come up with some Sci-Fi thingy going on. You can’t have a guy traveling between the alternative world and the reality, hoping the audience will love this without any mention of time traveling. The only thing I can imagine, is just like *Neo in the Matrix*, those Trade Minister, Chief Inspector, Obergurper (formerly fighting for American troops) can’t spell it right), they are all living in their dreams of alternative world. 

2. The grasshopper file reels, and all others, they all have another reality recorded by someone. Unless you have some theory to explain all of this, I can see this MITHC will become another **LOST** series.

  It does seem much more viable than something arbitrary like tiny leaders, with it's restrictions and deckbuilding requirements but does frontier threaten to implode competitively if there is the best deck far and ahead the next tier, at least until some new powerful card(s) or interactions allow some decks to provide counterbalance?

  
  Should there be some concern for a format where the best spells exist in the first few sets of the format? There is an active push to make instants (and sorceries to a lesser degree) less powerful and efficiently costed to push a creature based game, with less of room for draw-go style decks. Seems concerning only from the direction R&amp;D is taking standard for new cards to be relevant in relation to eternal sets.

  
  Speaking to the state Modern is in, what are those issues? Is it because the competitive format is too fast? The number of competitive decks.in the top tier? The cost of the best cards? If Frontier takes off the cost will approach Modern for the best decks (given enough time). However except for khans fetches you.may get cheaper manabases.

  
  You're probably right about it's place in 2-3 years and is the short term cheap nature/access to recently printed cards (M15-Origins) along with hype for a new range of sets to 'brew' from (Standard + two Core sets &amp; Khans block) enough to sustain gameplay until we have a more diverse pool of cards to pull from? Perhaps even if it sustains enough play and participation in Japan it will catch on as a new source of content for articles and podcasts which is enough to eventually catch fire stateside (sorry I'm unfamiliar with MtG in Europe)

If light infantry gameplay is either a strength or a skill you are looking to develop, the 173rd Airborne Brigade might be just what you're looking for! Our unit is based on the real-life 173rd Airborne Brigade that has a history dating back to WWI.

If jumping out of helicopters and transport aircraft with 40 to 80+ soldiers from across the U.S. (plus some soldiers from Europe as well) sounds like fun, you'll definitely enjoy what our unit has to offer.

**CHECK OUT ONE OF OUR SWEET OPERATION VIDEOS!**
https://www.youtube.com/user/173rdairbornedivison

While our unit operation takes place on Saturday evenings, there are other events that would interest you that take place throughout the week.

To be an *Active Duty* soldier you are required to attend at least 2 out of 3 of your required weekly events (squad training, platoon training, and the unit-wide combat operation). This amounts to between 4-6 hours each week (if you plan on attending all 3 events). If you don't have that much time to devote you may enlist as a *Reserve Duty* soldier and only be required to attend 1 event every other week (that event lasts approximately 2 hours).

If you're interested but still need more information feel free to check out the unit's [About Us](http://173rd.us/index.php/page/aboutUs2016.html) page, or you can come talk to a recruiter on our [TeamSpeak Server](http://www.teamspeak.com/invite/ts3.173rd.us/?channel=Request%20a%20Recruiter%20%28Read%20Description%29).

If you've heard all you need to hear visit our website and [register an account] (http://173rd.us/index.php?app=core&amp;module=global&amp;section=register) and submit an [enlistment application](http://173rd.us/index.php/index.php?app=perscom&amp;module=enlistment).

If people don't believe in the promise, the paper is worthless.

An analogy. Fred tells you he's broke now but he'll pay you back for the meal you give him when he gets paid on Friday. Do you give him that meal? What happens if on Friday he doesn't pay you? Will you give him another meal when he promises you he'll pay in the future the next time he's hungry?

Now substitute the US for Fred (US has 20 trillion in debt - basically broke), substitute China and/or Europe's export goods (cars, electronics, foods)  for the meal, and 'when the economy recovers properly' for 'on Friday' and you can get an idea of how a fiat currency can collapse.

The US has no hope really of paying back that debt. It's just that every other country has reluctance in being the first to rush for the door and say 'The Dollar is worthless!' and being left with piles of worthless paper dollars that they (and everybody else) will have to throw away as junk.

First and foremost: Someone who helps the poor because his faith of choice considers it a virtue does good. But because of the wrong reasons. Because the virtue is not solidarity or empathy - those words may be used - but some metaphysical entity which is greater than every human and humanity and the absolute authority - if it were real. Gods don't make history. Humans do. And religion is just a very effective ideology. Particularly effective in making good people do evil things. Because they don't believe that they know the will of said entity, but evil people do - may the reason be honest faith or ruthless exploitation of those who seek guidance.

Many evil deeds  - especially if you are thinking about jews in europe - are not done out of greed, but out of ideology. Whoever participated in cleansing in the middle age thought they did the right thing, nazis thought they did the right thing, the mullahs in Iran are thinking they are doing the right thing. To cleanse the world of the filthy jews. Because they do not care about humans, about human well being, about human rights or even about this world - they are the sevants of their metaphysical authority. God, the aryan race or allah.

This authority is the antithesis to the autonomous, rational individual.

The mentioned ""people who's hearts are full of love and trust"" are just good people. Not because of their religion, but often despite of it.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/2072405c49ca47efb79a4f5c7c4ccb7b.png)  

&gt; Barış Manço (also spelt Baris Mancho or Baris Manco in some European album releases) (1943 -1999) was a Turkish singer, composer, and television producer.

&gt; Manço was born on 2nd January 1943 in Istanbul. His mother, Rikkat Uyanık, had been a famous singer in the early 1940s. His older brother, who was born during World War II, was named Savaş (""war"" in Turkish) while he was named Barış (""peace"" in Turkish) by his parents to celebrate the end of the war.

&gt; While at secondary school at the Galatasaray Lisesi (and later at Şişli Terakki High School) he formed his first band, Kafadarlar (""The Buddies""), all students of a nearby highschool. Asaf Savaş Akat, who became a famous economist, played saxophone, and guitarist Ender Enön made his own guitar because it was difficult to find a real one on the market at that time. In 1962 and 1963, with his next band, Harmoniler (""The Harmonies""), he recorded cover versions of some popular American twist songs and rearrangements of Turkish folk songs in rock-and-roll form, marking the beginning of the Anatolian rock movement, a synthesis of Turkish folk music and rock. In this period, his key visual and musical influence was Elvis Presley.

&gt; After leaving school in 1963 he won a scholarship to the Belgian Royal Academy, and went to Belgium to study graphics and art. He toured with his band Les Mistigris (not related to Mistigris) in Germany, Belgium, France, and Turkey until 1967, when he was in a serious car accident, after which he started to grow his signature mustache to disguise his scar.

&gt; Frustrated by the difficulties of working with musicians from different nationalities, he formed Kaygısızlar (The Carefrees), featuring Mazhar Alanson and Fuat Güner, future members of the band MFÖ. He recorded several singles and toured with the band, both domestically and internationally, until the band members revealed that they did not want to live abroad. In 1970, he formed Barış Manço ve... (""Barış Manço and ...""), again with foreign musicians, to record his first hit single, both in Turkey and in Belgium, ""Dağlar Dağlar"" (Mountains, Mountains!), selling over 700,000 copies.

&gt; After the success of ""Dağlar Dağlar"", Manço recorded a couple of singles with Moğollar (The Mongols), another influential Turkish Anatolian rock band. He then decided to return to Turkey where he recorded with the reformed Kaygısızlar for a short period. In 1971, his early works were compiled under his first full length album Dünden Bugüne, today commonly referred to as ""Dağlar Dağlar"".

&gt; In 1972, he formed Kurtalan Ekspres, the band that would accompany him until his death. He continued to release singles until 1975, when he released his first non-compilation album,  2023, a concept album that included many instrumental pieces.

&gt; As a last attempt to reach international success, he released the album Baris Mancho (1976), mostly with the George Hayes Orchestra, in Europe and South Africa. Although the album did not bring the fame he was expecting, it did reach the top of the charts in Romania and Morocco. The following year the album was released in Turkey under the title Nick the Chopper.

&gt; From 1977 to 1980,he released three more albums in Turkey, partly consisting of compilations of older singles: Sakla Samanı Gelir Zamanı (1977), Yeni Bir Gün (1979), and 20. Sanat Yılı Disko Manço (1980), all with a similar sound to his earlier album 2023. All these albums are now rarity items, but most of the material from the era is available in the later compilations Ben Bilirim and Sarı Çizmeli Mehmet Ağa.

&gt; In 1981 Manço released Sözüm Meclisten Dışarı with Kurtalan Ekspres, containing many hit songs including ""Alla Beni Pulla Beni"", ""Arkadaşım Eşşek"", ""Gülpembe"", ""Halhal"", and ""Dönence"". The album remains one of their most popular works, and boosted Manço's popularity in the 1980s. ""Arkadaşım Eşşek"" (""My Friend Donkey""), quickly grew very popular among children (the song is about rural nostalgia ,and was not initially intended as a children's song). Throughout his career he went on to write many other songs primarily for children. On the other hand ""Gülpembe"", composed by Kurtalan Ekspres bassist Ahmet Güvenç, a requiem for Manço's grandmother, caught the attention of older audiences, and is probably the artist's most popular song, competing only with ""Dağlar Dağlar"".

&gt; In 1983, Estağfurullah, Ne Haddimize was released. It contained the hit songs ""Halil İbrahim Sofrası"" and ""Kol Düğmeleri"", a new version of the artist's very first song. ""Halil İbrahim Sofrası"" exemplified Manço's signature moral-themed lyrics, a rare feature in Turkish pop music. In 1985, 24 Ayar Manço which included ""Gibi Gibi"" and a long conceptual song ""Lahburger"", was released. It marked the beginning of the shift in Manço's sound characterised by the heavy use of synthesisers and drum machine, in contrast with his older works consisting of a rock-based sound.  Manço went on to release Değmesin Yağlı Boya (1986), Sahibinden İhtiyaçtan (1988), and Darısı Başınıza (1989), each containing a couple of hit songs and demonstrating his new sound.

&gt; In 1988 7'den 77'ye (From age 7 to 77), a television series directed and presented by Manço, began to run on TRT 1, the national TV channel of Turkey. It was a combined music, talk show, and documentary programme which was a major hit during the eight years it stayed on the air. Manço travelled to nearly 150 countries for the series. ""Adam Olacak Çocuk"" , a part of the show, strengthened Manço's acceptance among children

&gt; Although his popularity continued mostly due to this series, his musical work in 1990s wasn't so well received. The albums Mega Manço (1992) and Müsadenizle Çocuklar (1995) were considered the weakest of his career, despite the limited success of the 1992 children's hit ""Ayı"" (The Bear). On the other hand, in 1995 he toured in Japan with Kurtalan Ekspres, leading to Live in Japan (1996), his first and only live album. He released two albums in that country with some recognition as ""the man who writes songs about vegetables"", referring to ""Domates, Biber, Patlıcan"" (""Tomato, Pepper, Aubergine"") and ""Nane, Limon Kabuğu"" (Mint, Lemon Rind), two of his hit songs from the 1980s.

&gt; Manço died on 31st January 1999 of a sudden heart attack, just before the release of his newly finished album Mançoloji (Mançology) (1999), a double album containing new recordings of his hit songs along with an unfinished instrumental song ""40. Yıl"" (""The 40th Anniversary""), celebrating his fortieth year in music. Over his career he had composed about 200 songs, some of which were translated into a variety of languages including Greek, Bulgarian, Romanian, Persian, Japanese, and Arabic.

They knew that educated people from poorer countries in the EU like Greece or Poland would move to Germany for better wages and opportunities. They knew it would be unlikely to cause much unemployment since uneducated people who tried to move here would likely fail (and turn to crime as we've seen).

They just didn't give a shit, because the EU makes the elites in Germany and France richer due to the massive banking and trade benefits provided by the system. By accepting the Euro, countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal, etc. lost their ability to strengthen or weaken their currency to encourage imports or exports as their economic situation dictates. Instead they are stuck with high unemployment, a trade deficit with Germany where Germany receives the agricultural products of those countries as well as other relatively cheap local goods, sends over all sorts of high priced electronics, vehicles, etc. and basically gains in every way while the majority of people in those other countries suffer. 

Then Germany pushes austerity on those poorer countries when the banks in those countries (who are often run by people essentially put into place by those high up in the EU when the Euro first started) fail, which was the logical conclusion of the corruption and cronyism that was put into place by the EU. Again, most of the brunt of austerity is borne by the poor and middle class, those struggling to get by in shitty economies. The EU is a mess, but I don't think it got this way accidentally.

Marx addressed the Communist League by saying that it is necessary the revolution remain permanent until the propertied classes are ousted of their ruling position in not one but all leading countries. Marx and Engels, however, happen to say very little about leading a country out of feudalism without a Bourgeois revolution. He also says revolution begins as a national question iirc. I do not think that contradicts Trotsky and that he would probably agree. 

Permanent revolution is mostly not discussed until after Lenin's death; I believe Lenin had agreed with Trotsky and showed some idea of the theory in the April Theses, and he too had thought that Germany and other developed countries would spark a Europe-wide revolution, but I think he denied that the revolution HAD to be permanent, and figured a Democratic Dictatorship could fulfill the tasks of a liberal democrat Bourgeois revolution with Councils controlling the economy (Soviets).

I believe the theory of permanent revolution is correct, and that it is both in line with Marx and a development of his thought. I think it is clear to see Socialism in One Country inevitably fails to do it's job, and that the revolution must be permanent and global, just like Capitalism. ",0,1,[deleted]

I understand that this person specifically said ""in the west"", but the west is really a merging of many cultures so a lot of this applies across the board. 

In Western cultures, a wedding ring is traditionally worn on the ring finger. This developed from the Roman ""anulus pronubis"" when the man gave a ring to the woman at the betrothal ceremony. Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride's finger dates from the 11th century. In medieval Europe, the Christian wedding ceremony placed the ring in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers of the left hand. The ring was then left on the ring finger. 

In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, a Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. 

In England, the 1549 Prayer Book declared ""the ring shall be placed on the left hand"". By the 17th and 18th centuries the ring could be found on any finger after the ceremony — even on the thumb.

The wedding ring is generally worn on the ring finger of the left hand in the former British Empire, certain parts of Western Europe, certain parts of Catholic Central and Eastern Europe (and some not so), and Mexico. These include:Australia, Botswana, Canada, Egypt, Ireland, New Zealand,South Africa, the UK, and the USA; France, Italy, Sweden, and Finland; Czech Republic,Slovakia, Switzerland, Romania, Croatia, and Slovenia.

The wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand in some Orthodox and a small number of Catholic European countries, some Protestant Western European, as well as some Central and South American Catholic countries.[4] In Eastern Europe, these include: Bulgaria, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, (Catholic) Poland, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. In Central or Western Europe, these include: Austria, Denmark, Greece, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands [if not Catholic], Norway, and (Catholic) Spain. In Central or South America, these include: Colombia, Cuba, Perú, Venezuela.

The ring is worn on the right hand until the actual wedding day, when it is moved to the left hand in Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria as well as in Brazil. 

In traditional Jewish wedding ceremonies, the ring is placed on the index finger, but other traditions record placing it on the middle finger or the thumb, most commonly in recent times.[5] Today, the ring usually is moved to the ring finger after the ceremony. Some Jewish grooms have adopted wearing a wedding ring.

In Sinhala and Tamil culture, the groom wears the wedding ring on his right hand and bride wears it on her left hand ring finger. This can be seen in countries like Sri Lanka where there is a rich Sinhala and Tamil cultural influence in the society.[6]

We don't distance ourselves from anti-semites, Nazis or Holocaust deniers, because they are part of the Alt-Right. While I might not be either of those personally, I *do* recognise that they are part of the movement and are here to stay.

I will give you my definition of Alt-Right, just to clear the air:

The Alt-Right is a movement of Right-wingers who are unified under the common goal of achieving ethnic homogeneity in each European country. That's it. That means you can have Nazis, Libertarians, Monarchists, Neo-Reactionaries, Conservatives, etc. in the group. If you desire ethnic homogeneity and the traditional family, you could be considered Alt-Right. Other beliefs are variables.

&gt;What do you advocate actually doing to achieve a racially or ethnically homogenous society?

I would argue that we need to strictly control immigration *except for returning inhabitants of the nation*.

I never made a statement about all Blacks. The crime statistics show the vast majority of crime is committed by Blacks and there is an unbelievable amount of Black on White crime in this country that is never mentioned in the media. Do the facts not appeal to your liking?

&gt;also this land never belonged to white people it belonged to the native Americans who we slaughtered.

Indians are Asiatic peoples. We have no idea who were there before they arrived; in the words of a Quroa.com poster Joseph Guindi, the land of America was 'stolen' from Indians 

&gt; No more than any other group of people throughout history. The whole history of Europe is one of migration, displacement and conquest, and the Americans were no better or worse than that.

&gt;What we currently call Anglo-Saxons comes from Northern Germany and Eastern Netherlands. ""Anglo"" denotes the region of Angeln in Northern Germany. ""Saxon"" denotes the region  of Old Saxony and more specifically the region of Lower Saxony, just South of Angeln. These people then did the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain and effectively displaced the existing Celtic cultures of England.

&gt;These people were then invaded by the Franco-Normans, who then invaded France and then put a large portion of the world into their empire, and eventually came to migrate to the United States, Canada, Australia, which combined constitute nearly 30 million km².

&gt;Slavic peoples, Germanic peoples, Celtic peoples, Turkic peoples, Semitic peoples, all of these essentially ""stole"" someone else's land.

&gt;This is even the basis of the Bible, where the Jews were given Israel as their promised land from Yahve.

&gt;Look at a map of Finno-Ugric peoples:
&gt;Now how do you figure they got there? Well, they moved there. What if someone else lived there?

&gt;This happened everywhere, in Africa, Asia, etc.

&gt;Today we would call this ""stealing"". But for a long time, this was considered acceptable behaviour.


Moreover the Indians had peace with the Puritans in Massachusetts who arrived sick and dying and barely made it across the Atlantic to escape persecution by the Roman Catholic inquisition and the Jesuit-controlled Anglican Church. White Protestant settlers were never aggressors to the Indians, actually it was the other way around. The Jamestown colony was attacked three times by Indians without provocation before the settlers retaliated. Every square foot of Rhode Island, every square foot of Pennsylvania was purchased from the Indians. Every foot of my hometown of Haverhill MA was purchased from the Pawtucket Tribe and a savage Roman Catholic Indian captured one of our White Puritan women and her child before she valiantly managed to escape. 

It was Jesuits and Roman Catholics in the 1800s like Philip Sheridan who said ""the only good Indian is a dead Indian"" who were responsible for the great plains massacre and the murder of the Indians, not White Protestant people. ",0,6,Veritas__Aequitas

The ""leader"" of the Alt-Right, Richard Spencer, came to Texas A&amp;M, my alma mater, to give a speech less than a month ago. The public condemnation couldn't have possibly been any stronger. The University - which was forced to allow him to speak due to 1st Amendment rights as they pertain to public forums - opened up Kyle Field, a 100k+ seating football stadium, to throw a Unity event. 

Thousands showed up to counter-protest these neo-Nazis, and the numbers of their supporters were staggeringly small. There were a few Aggie students who wanted to troll by starting a ""Europeans Aggies"" student organization, but they chickened out once they realized how strong the backlash would be.

Yes, it's anti-American to deny free speech based solely on content. And yes, Nazism is unamerican. That's why they used the equal right to protest to condemn these people and show that society at large does not agree with or tolerate these views. It's the proper American response. 

Edit to add: Regarding taking them seriously - that's one of the lessons I learned from what happened at A&amp;M. Don't. Richard Spencer proved why these people are not to be taken seriously. The majority have to hide in the shadows, and the few that do speak publicly like Spencer are weak-minded faux-intellectuals who get destroyed the moment they step into an academic arena.

Stop repeating yourself like a parrot. I never denied that fact. lol, you're failing miserably and these red herrings aren't gonna save you

What does that have to do with Islamic terrorists? What's with all your red herrings? Either you're trying to claim the Muslim terrorism is not religious or you're trying to drag the conversation into unrelated avenues to avoid discussing Islam

Whether you're trying to or not, that's what you're doing. 

&gt;What you're doing is trying to use her as an example to make a case for female contribution to advancement of civilization. And it's just not doing that.

Yes it is. She helped advance civilization. Your argument is basically that since a man could also have done it, then it doesn't matter that it was a woman who did it and that it had no impact. And that's ridiculous. Whether a man could have done it or not is irrelevant; *she* is the one who did it. *She* is the one whose name is in the history books. *She* is the one whose contribution helped change the course of our civilization. I don't know why that fact seems to threaten you so much. But that's the thing about facts...they exist independently of our emotions.

&gt;The clue to your mistake is on your own wording ""joining in"". 

""Joining in"", meaning that women were generally not permitted to contribute to the building of historical (and even modern) civilizations in the same way men were. Women were not permitted to get involved in politics. Women were not given the same opportunities for education. Their contributions were not welcomed and were in many cases, in many societies, outright rejected. I know you think this is just a ""cheap excuse""...but as I've said before, that only speaks to your ignorance about history. For fuck's sake man, look at the middle east if you think this is bullshit - if you think that the way things are over there is something new, think again. That's a pretty damn accurate picture of what life has been like all over the world, many times over, for thousands of years. I know that there were many ways in which the average man was also held back and kept down - education, more ""elite"" professions, and political involvement were generally the realms of men with wealth, while the poor were the ones scraping out a living in the dirt, both men and women. So let me make it clear that I am not saying women were the only ones who have faced oppression or who've had to struggle hard for any basic rights. Men have too. History was not kind to most humans who've ever lived. But even taking that into account, there really have been ways in which women got an even shorter end of the stick. When European and, later, North American society started becoming more advanced, and education became more accessible, and more and more people were able to do things other than farming for a living, women still didn't have the same opportunities and choices that men did. 

At this point you're probably rolling your eyes and thinking I'm some stupid feminist Women's Studies graduate. You should probably know that I'm not a feminist at all and that I don't accept their revisionist version of history. I have simply found that learning about history results in the discovery that these things are true.

&gt;Oh it's not hip to work in a tunnel? Doesn't go with your sexy outfit? Damn that patriarchy. And you expect to be taken seriously.

Wow, you are efficient - building that strawman and then knocking it down all by yourself! Now I see why men build everything. Y'all are so damn GOOD at it!

&gt;What did patriarchy do for those who didn't?

Patriarchy would have to actually exist in order to do anything for anyone. At any rate, people don't control the elements, so nobody is really to blame for the dangerous conditions for their voyage. And unless the men on board were forced into it by a press gang or sold into servitude aboard the ship, they were all there voluntarily, knowing the risk. Any sailor with any kind of experience knew how bloody dangerous even a short voyage could be. Come on.

&gt;It's pretty clear that women are highly passive members of society

What...? Where do you live? And how do you define ""passive""? It would appear that there's a shit ton of evidence to the contrary. But go ahead and explain...I'll bite.

Enfim, você está procurando por seinens, animes com um tom mais sério e que abordam temas adultos. Segue uma listinha de alguns do gênero que eu conheço.

* Ghost in the Shell – na categoria longa-metragem, simplesmente minha animação favorita. Gosto muito quando usam a ficção cientifica pra abordar temas existenciais, além de que sou fascinado pelo estilo das animações japonesas dos anos '80~90.

* Hellsing (2002) – o ""remake"" que saiu recentemente se aprofunda mais na estória, mas acaba colocando uns clichês de anime nada haver com o tom da série. Assista a primeira versão, não tem erro, tirando o final em aberto.

* Mushishi – não é bem um seinen, mas acho um ótimo anime pra quem está começando. Cada episódio é uma estória com começo, meio e fim; você pode começar assistindo hoje e só terminar ano que vem (can confirm, fiz isso com a segunda temporada).

* Jormungand – como você não gostou de Black Lagoon, talvez não goste desse.

* Jin-Rou

* Aoi Bungaku Series

* Stranger: Mukou Hadan

* Psycho-Pass

* Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin

* Deadman Wonderland

* Samurai Champloo

* Cowboy Bebop

Edit: Acho que você deveria dar mais uma chance a Neon Genesis Evangelion, não consigo pensar em outro anime que explore tão bem a psiquê de seus personagens. O começo pode ser bem clichê, mas o desenvolvimento da trama é muito bom. É a minha série animada favorita.",0,3,Strogonovsky

I think that the more you play the more you pay attention to other countries and that's when you realize you want to play as them. My first two games I didn't pay attention to anybody but myself and that's when I had trouble picking. 

Since you have enough time in to know the basics I would suggest attempting a more intermediate nation. Milan or Florence are a blast and forming Italy is almost never the same twice. Austria is also a good starting nation, especially if you like the HRE. 

Outside of Europe there are lots of great nations. Morocco comes to mind. It was definitely a challenge but an alliance with France and the Ottomans could keep you safe from Iberia. I controlled all of the colonial eastern America with them and was ranked 5th largest economy. 

Overall I would say that the reason you are having such a hard time in picking a nation is that you just finished another game and starting over does suck. 1444-1500 is honestly so boring. Your economy needs constant checking and wars are just slow imo. But you just need to force yourself. Eu4 is the most intricate and rewarding game I've ever played.

This happens time and again in history.  It's happened in the US.

""World War I, however, strained this division of labor. During the worldwide grain shortage, members of the Church were encouraged to plant more wheat, and Relief Societies without granaries were asked to have wheat and flour on hand even if it had to be kept in the members' homes. Prudently, the Relief Society guarded its wheat by removing it from commercial elevators to Church-owned facilities.""

""As the Church stepped up its grain programs, the United States government in the spring of 1918 asked that all surplus wheat be sent to Europe to feed allied and American soldiers. Federal food administrators in Utah and Idaho approached ward Relief Societies and asked them to sell their grain.""

""Local organizations requested advice from the Relief Society General Board and the Presiding Bishopric. Bishop Charles Nibley said on May 2 that the grain was not to be sold and that when the government understood the program they would not demand the sale.""

""However, within two weeks, the food controller for Utah told Bishop Nibley's counselors, Orrin P. Miller and David A. Smith, that the grain was needed immediately. The women could refill their granaries with the fall's bumper harvest. As a final ounce of pressure, he called the sale a 'matter of loyalty of the Relief Society to the government.'""

""Bishop Nibley, out of town, returned to find a letter from the federal food administrators asking once again for the grain. Because of this pressure, the Presiding Bishopric asked the First Presidency how they should handle the request. Anthon H. Lund and Charles W. Penrose, President Joseph F. Smith's counselors, told them to comply.""",0,4,justanothercap

&gt;A report released by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in November 2015 found that over the period January–September 2015, the crime rate of refugees was the same as that of native Germans.[58] According to Deutsche Welle, the report ""concluded that the majority of crimes committed by refugees (67 percent) consisted of theft, robbery and fraud. Sex crimes made for less than 1 percent of all crimes committed by refugees, while homicide registered the smallest fraction at 0,1 percent.""[58] According to the conservative newspaper Die Welt's description of the report, the most common crime committed by refugees was not paying fares on public transportation.[59] According to Deutsche Welle's reporting in February 2016 of a report by the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation, the number of crimes committed by refugees did not rise in proportion to the number of refugees between 2014-2015.[60] According to Deutsche Welle, ""between 2014 and 2015, the number of crimes committed by refugees increased by 79 percent. Over the same period, however, the number of refugees in Germany increased by 440 percent.""[60]

&gt;In May 2016, Politifact deemed Donald Trump's statement that ""Germany ""is crime-riddled right now"" because of migration to Europe"" as mostly false.[61] The fact-checker noted that Germany's crime rate, particularly the violent crime rate, is far lower than in the United States, and that data suggest that the crime rate of the average refugee is lower than that of the average German.[61]

From Christian Pfieffer head of the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony:
&gt;The longtime head of the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony pointed to police crime statistics: Murder and manslaughter rates, he said, had gone down by 40 percent since 2000. Sexual violence is also at its lowest level in a long time.
""Rape also continued to fall in 2015 compared to previous years, even though we had very large-scale immigration, especially of young men,"" he said. ""Yet there is not a single violent offense that has risen in frequency.""
&gt;In some areas, Walburg said, crime did indeed go up: ""Specifically, for some years there has been an increase in burglaries. Another offense that has greatly increased in number is pickpocketing."" But Walburg says that has nothing to do with the current high level of immigration, as these rates had already been increasing for years.

In regards to this:

&gt; I absolutely think some kind of league and a re-balancing of the economics within the Dota space is vital if orgs are going to continue to be interested in Dota 2 as a tier 1 Esport.

How is this re-balancing going to occur in your opinion? The league structures prevelant in CS:GO and LoL just don't happen, would you want region locked leagues? With NA/EU/CIS/SEA/China locking?

From my limited perspective, I think profit-sharing based on Leagues is simply not possible within the Dota ecosystem. I think a sticker-based profit share is infinitely more viable, where perhaps there could be team color/logo specific euls/blink/tp animations that are sold, and profit shared with teams. I think cosmetically, there are a lot of places where you could profit share. You could have map skins that add team logo overlays in the base/lanes so it looks like you're playing for EG/CoL/VP/Wings, etc, that would be pretty cool and could be sold as well.

I think that is the way to go for profit share in Dota, maybe less so for leagues. The whole concept of a league and even its execution seem incredibly foreign for the dota community, and I think it would meet tremendous resistance from the pro playerbase.

Anyway, if you don't mind responding to your thoughts on my comments, I'd really appreciate it, if not, no worries you've been kind enough! Best of luck in 2016, and I hope you guys do well at DAC/Kiev. ",0,1,Jinxd0ta

umm Turkey are not fully bound by the Geneva Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees as they didn't sign one part. so the refugees would only get temporary refuge then forced to leave, Plus legal barriers in countries like Jordan, Turkey and lebanon means they have to take jobs with little to no rights and minimum pay. 
according to the UN 62% are from countries like Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea, and if you take places like Iraq, Somalia, Darfur and some parts of Nigeria that rises to 70% so they don't qualify to be economic migrants.
As for the crimes, the German Federal office of Criminal Investigation found that in 2015 the crime rate for refugees was the same as native Germans. Only 1% were sex crimes and 0.1% were homicides, the vast majority of those crimes (67%) were to do with theft, robbery, and fraud. Even in Sweden,the sex crimes have remained relatively the same since 2005. Furthermore, the US a ""bastion of the west, untouched by the refugees"" has a much higher  incidence in crimes. Also side note, refugee crimes are falling, while crimes against refugees are skyrocketing.

(1) Citation about those recoveries that occurred without any government spending whatsoever?

(2) Citation that individuals were in the same position to stimulate the economy as a whole as was the government?

(3) This is just some dumb bitcoin libertarian nonsense talking point that doesn't hold up to the slightest scrutiny.  

(a) Market inflation is inevitable, at least as long as markets are not completely closed systems.

(b) When bonds come due, governments simply issue more bonds to finance their redemption; they rolled over the debt.  That’s what happens in 99% of the cases in every modern economy, and you can see this by looking at how small and infrequent fiscal surpluses actually are.

(c) All government economic activity is about borrowing from some people to pay other people, and paying back these debts -- should it ever happen, which it will not -- simply reverses that flow.  Either way, money is transferred from one group to another at the same point in time.

(d) Austerity would have been the worst of all options, as European countries that leaned into austerity like Spain demonstrate.  If capital markets are frozen because nobody in the private sector has an incentive to spend for fear of devaluing their currency holdings, then *nobody will spend anything, ever.*

(e) The amount of 'borrowing' (either from other countries or the nebulous future) to finance fiscal deficits is not any kind of direct function of the deficit size but of whatever determines the government's position for repayment -- that is, current and capital accounts.  It might be true in some circumstances, but to make the case that government borrowing automatically increases the account deficit, you have to, you know, actually make the case instead of supposing it.

(f) Obviously, deficits aren't completely great or free of problems. The selling of bonds and the permission structure that allows those bonds to be fulfilled have to be stable, but that's far less difficult than the converse -- where private markets have to spontaneously find the means and incentives to pull themselves out of a spending freeze without any government-backed guarantees in the form of bonds.

**For individuals, borrowing is truly borrowing from the future since their repayment must occur in a closed system -- their own finances.  At the population level, borrowing is necessary to create assets and liabilities across different people, times, markets, and material circumstances.  Those two are not the same.  Your argument relies on an analogy that does not hold up to even the slightest scrutiny.**",0,24,mdawgig

You saying something doesn't make it so. The fountain of truth does not originate from your lips. 




&gt; That's an all inclusive statement.



Yep, you just generalized an entire group of people simply because they don't agree with you. As if you are the only person with facts and truth on your side. 




Such statements are RARELY* true. So there's lie one.



There, FTFY. And in this case, grossly off base. 




&gt; No Obama was a man who spoke well and thoughtfully and had experience.



Oh yes, even Obama's detractors admit he made great speeches. Nuanced speeches. Like how he promised that Jerusalem would remain the undivided permanent capital of Israel. And then promptly called to have it divided. If I had a buck for every pretty lie told by Obama I could have a massive blowout party to celebrate his departure from the White House. 



[Politifact has a short list of his 100 biggest whoppers.](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/statements/byruling/false/)




Experience? What experience. 



&gt;Barack Hussein Obama II is an American politician and the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to be elected to that office and the first president born outside the contiguous United States. Wikipedia
Party: Democratic Party
Presidential term: January 20, 2009 – January 20, 2017
Vice president: Joe Biden (2009–2017)
First day in office: January 20, 2009
Previous offices: Senator, IL (2005–2008)
Organizations founded: National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform,




That's it. That's all he has. 



&gt;No candidate has ever been more incoherent and less experienced for the job than Trump. Only unintelligent people would actually want that as our president. He is an embarrassment to our country.



And everyone said he would never win election. Keep talking. The one who should be embarrassed is you. For yourself. 



It's time for straight talk. Not a smooth talking liar in chief. We've had enough of that. Obama got us ISIS. Hundreds of thousands of people beheaded, burned alive, drowned, and tortured. And that's just civilians. Millions of people displaced and living in fear. That's what the smooth talker got us. And for eight years at every problem, instead of manning up and handling it, he whined about how it was all because of BOOOSH!. Russia went in and kicked ISIS out of Aleppo. Meanwhile in Mosul USA is still dragging it's feet and blaming everyone but itself for failure. Maybe Obama can go over there and talk ISIS to death now that we don't need him as president. 



&gt; Trump supporters/voters are literally and factually the most unintelligent people in the country.



Like I stated before, just you saying it, doesn't make it so. And generally, all inclusive statements are fairly false in nature and reveal your own ignorance and bias rather than the other way around. 





&gt; No, not that, unintelligent. Simply unintelligent. Trump supporters were incapable of hearing the clear as day bullshit coming from his mouth every time he spoke. They lack something in their brains that most Americans do have. They are the most unintelligent people in the country.



And you just revealed how biased and ignorant you are. BTW, the election is over. Your side lost. Deal with it. 




&gt; Trump supporters are not allowed to tell anyone anything related to intelligence and inability to tell fact from fiction.



Sure. Meanwhile you still believe Obama was a great president. Sure. He was a failure in almost every way. Oh, he had his moments to be sure. But mostly, he failed. Badly.  



&gt;Trump supporters are the least intelligent people there are and continuously accepted Trump's easily fact-checked lies as truth.



Your own left leaning fact checker has to admit that Obama is a straight up liar. Still lying. 




&gt; No its a fact, but you don't get that because you are also utterly racist. You are a despicable racist person which becomes clear when we get to...



Right. You know, the sting of calling ""white"" people racist lost it's edge long ago. Don't even care now. I'm mixed race. My daughter was half Latino. I don't even have any white friends. But ya, anyone who doesn't agree with you is obviously racist. I get that. 




&gt; Like damn dude, you are a horribly racist person with no empathy.


I'll keep that in mind. I will never give a thing to a black person again. Or help a black person. Since I am all racist and all that, then I'll own up to it. I'm a racist because people like you taught it to me. Labeled me. And now, I'll stick to it. I'll stick to my mixed race heritage. There, happy now? You convinced me I am racist. 




&gt; But here's a fact, Obama wrote in his book that he hated white people.



&gt; White people literally enslaved black people and took away their humanity, dignity and history. 



Wow. Now I know where you get your racist hatred from. Lies. It was black people enslaving black people who sold them into slavery. Mostly to Muslim traders. At the height of the Golden Age of Islam when the Caliphate ruled most of the known world of that time slavery was at it's height in their world. Did you never wonder what happened to all the black slaves who were marched north out of southern Africa? They were castrated. Worked to death. Most died on the march. White people were also slaves at that time. It was a huge problem for early America dealing with the Islamic slave traders. Also it was the Christians of Europe and Northern America who campaigned successfully to end slavery. You should read up on this. And Muslims to this day are engaging in slavery. It never ended.  


Jewish people were slaves for generations in Egypt. We celebrate the end of this slavery every year at Passover. You should read up on this. My family left Germany to come to USA long after slavery ended. We were happy to come here and escape persecution for our ethnicity and religion.  



&gt;It makes sense for black people to be pissed at white people.



It makes you a racist bigot. It's also stupid and irrational. You don't know one person who was ever enslaved. You have never met a person who owned a slave unless you went to the middle east and met a Muslim slave owner. 



 &gt;It's actually nice as hell that they haven't murdered all white people for revenge.


You really are mentally ill. You don realize that on some level I hope. 



 &gt;But they're smart enough to know that doesn't do shit. So they just fucking accept the racism they feel and experience everyday. And that sucks. You clearly have no ability to imagine how anyone else's life could possibly be. Learn some empathy and get less ignorant.



And you're calling me ignorant. Wow. The kettle calling the pot black.

You do it because you have free will. Exactly. I pray to God because I have free will too. You don't pray. And therefore you don't know my experience. Therefore how can you judge my results if you don't even know me

I can go through life without prayer but as I explained I pray for many things. Some that come when I put action. Some that don't. But I know prayer works. I know God is real. I've experienced him. Where are you from. America? Europe? Where have you traveled? Been everywhere in the world to try and actually seek God? Or do you simply research books made by western society that say it?

This logic is quite comical honestly😂

&gt;Race is absolutely not an illusion, race (genetic divergence) is a universal trait of all living things. You might as well say ""species are an illusion"".

Race and species are two different things that have nothing at all to do with one another. If you can procreate with someone they are of your species, everything else is skin deep, IE, irrelevant unless you harbor really arcane ideas. 

&gt;In a certain sense settling in europe made us dominant but that is only because the harsh seasonal climate killed off our low intelligence ancestors, causing us to evolve high intelligence and strong social bonds. There is far more food and resources and germs in Africa.

Not true and lol, that isn't how evolution works. Every other race is just as intelligent as you are. Ideas of racial superiority were disproven long ago. 

&gt;There is far more food and resources and germs in Africa.

At the Nile, maybe. But the closer you get to the equator, the less grains and other sources of carbs you find that can be stored long term. Starchy foods don't store well long term. But grains do. Whichever culture settles in an area that has abundant grains wins the game. Full stop. It was just dumb luck, bub. 

&gt;We are special. We are superior. A world that is genetically african would be apocalyptic. It would be the IQ equivalent of a world of 11 year olds or a world of mentally retarded people.

Everything you just said is opinion. Opinions are worthless unless you have facts to back then up. If you're just going to spout your beliefs all over the place, that's fine. But don't expect anyone to listen or care. 

Since the human brain is universal across all humans, if you put Africans in Europe, they would have made you their slaves instead of the other way around. That's reality, and facts matter. 

&gt;We are special. We are superior.

How? Why? Please tell me how as a white man, I am entitled to more rights or w/e than non-whites. What is the elusive 'thing' that makes me superior? 

&gt;This is the reality. America as we know it can not exist without a white majority. It is fundamentally biologically impossible.

More gobblygook KKK nonsense. Again, this is your opinion. Opinions are worthless. 

It sounds like your self-worth is tied to you being white. You might want to readjust your perspectives, because like it or not, we are going to become the minority eventually.

Lance Armstrong passed drug tests for a decade, but that in no way made him a natural athlete. Everyone in the UFC is also using, and a lot of them also pass drug tests, does that mean they're natural? Nate Diaz admits that everyone is on steroids.

I pass drug tests because I don't use anything.  I'm not sure if you're stupid or uninformed, but I'll be charitable and assume the latter.

There are a few major differences between doping in cycling and doping in strength sports, and there are a few major differences between attempting to get away with doping in the late 90s-mid 2000s (Lance's era) and trying to get away with doping today.

For starters, the most effective compound a cyclist can take is EPO.  EPO is easy to use for a few reasons.

1) It's naturally occurring in the body, and is released in a pulsatile fashion.  For that reason, actual blood levels of EPO aren't incriminating (since there are huge swings throughout a day), and there's no metabolite test that can catch it.  It's also a peptide hormone, and synthetic peptide hormones are chemically identical to naturally occurring peptide hormones; i.e. there are tests for steroid hormones like testosterone that can distinguish synthetic from natural, but (as far as I'm aware) there aren't similar tests for peptide hormones like EPO.

2) It's easy to monitor yourself to make sure you didn't inject too much EPO.  Since you can't test for the hormone itself, instead they make sure your hematocrit (the portion of your blood composed of red blood cells) doesn't get suspiciously high.  If you have a needle and a centrifuge, you can check your hematocrit levels for free in a matter of minutes to make sure you're always going to pass the test.

Now, Lance was also taking testosterone.  How they test for testosterone has changed dramatically since his day.

They used to just use a testosterone to epitestosterone ratio, which is generally 1:1 to 2:1.  It's extremely rare to find someone whose natural ratio is 4:1 or higher, so a T:E test above 4:1 flags as a positive (if it's close to the cutoff, it means further testing and if it's way above the cutoff, it's automatically a failed test).  All you need to do to beat a T:E test is microdose to ensure you never have enough test in your system to push the ratio too high.

Now, however, they're using carbon isotope ratio tests (CIR).  As mentioned before, you can tell the difference between natural and synthetic steroid hormones using this method.  In essence, your body manufactures all of your steroid hormones from cholesterol (either cholesterol you've eaten, or cholesterol your body's produced).  Since all of those hormones are coming from the same pool of cholesterol, they'll all have basically the same ratio of Carbon-12s and Carbon-13s.  So, you can look at the ratio of C-12s to C-13s in someone's testosterone, and compare it to their cortisol, estrogen, androsteindione, DHEA, etc.  If you're not using, your testosterone's CIR will be the same as every other steroid hormone in your body.  If you are using, your CIR for testosterone will swing more toward C-12, since synthetic testosterone is made primarily in genetically modified plants (mostly soy, iirc) which produce steroid hormones with more C-12.

CIR tests can still bust people who are microdosing, unlike T:E.  If it was around when Lance was competing, it would have busted him.  It's very effective and very sensitive.  The only way around it is to cycle off, but that doesn't work with random testing; even test suspension has a half life around 24 hours, so if you injected enough to do literally anything, you'd still fail a CIR test 2-5 days after your last injection.

Finally, in 2014, the metabolite tests for other compounds with short half-lives got a LOT better.  That's why so many weightlifters from 2008 and 2012 got busted on retests (mostly for turnibol and stanozolol).  It used to be that if you cycled off of those compounds 1 week or two out from a contest, their metabolites would be below detectable levels.  Now, the window of detection is 4-6x longer.  In other words, if you've used then in the past ~2 months, you'll get popped on an unannounced random test.

That is the reality of modern doping and drug testing.  Using Lance as an example shows you're either misinformed or disingenuous, since his case is apples to oranges.  The only ""safe"" compounds are mostly peptides (which, with the exception of EPO, don't really do much in isolation), and apparently they're getting easier to test for as well (though I'm not entirely sure how they're doing it, to be honest).  For example, Pat Mendes failed *two* tests for growth hormone, which is very similar to EPO testing-wise (short half-life, peptide hormone, huge diurnal swings, etc.).  They're still very beatable if you have a state-sponsored program (i.e. Russia), your organization tells you beforehand when you'll be tested (i.e. the NFL, as far as I'm aware), or your organization isn't really trying to catch people in the first place or using state-of-the-art tests (i.e. there are rumors that the NBA treats it that way).  But a true random, unannounced test using the best detection methods?  They're really, really fucking hard to beat, ESPECIALLY for anabolics.

&gt;People assume that top-level athletes are on drugs because those athletes are on drugs most of the time; Not to mention the number of steroid scandals there have been in basically every sport. You can't compete at the top level without taking drugs, it's sad but true.

You also can't compare powerlifting to basically any other sport on the planet, for two major reasons:

1) Incentives are WAY lower.  The only people who actually make any money off the sports (via sponsors who pay or via winning meets with meaningful payouts) are the untested lifters.  The pinnacle for a tested lifter is winning and IPF gold, which gets you absolutely nothing.  In most countries, you actually have to spend your own money to go compete, losing several thousand dollars for the chance to become a ""world champion.""  It's not the NFL where getting away with steroid usage may mean the difference between not making a team and getting paid a few million per year.

2) *There's untested powerlifting.*  At least in America, Canada, a lot of Europe, and Australia, if you want to use steroids and compete in powerlifting, you can just fucking do it without having to cheat.  This is a HUGE difference between PL and pretty much every other sport in existence.  If you want to use gear and compete in the 100m dash, you can't just sign up to the untested Olympics.  I know people think that drug-tested PL is just teeming with people who are using drugs and beating tests, but that really just doesn't happen very often at all (at least in countries that have plenty of tested and untested meets; it's probably different in countries where the IPF is the only game in town).  People compete tested, and then when they start using, they start competing untested, and don't need to make a big fuss about it.

Finally, there are real disincentives for lying about using and getting busted.  PL in a small world.  When you fail a test, everyone finds out about it, and everyone hates you basically forever.  The tested lifters hate you because you tried to cheat and compete in a tested division, and the untested lifters hate you because you were a pussy who didn't just go on gear and compete untested like everyone else. Someone like Ed Coan gets a bit of a pass (since he's the G.O.A.T., and since there weren't many untested options in his day), but for the most part, PL operates like a large, dysfunctional family, and failing a test earns you a ton of scorn and gets your ostracized by basically everyone in the sport (this only applies to anabolics; no one really gives a shit about failed tests for stimulants).

There are plenty of reasons to try to get away with doping in pretty much every other sport on the planet.  I get it, and we're on the same page there.  In powerlifting, the risk:reward just doesn't make sense.  Anyone who'd use gear and try to compete tested is, quite frankly, a fucking idiot.

&gt;I have no doubt that genetics plays a role in lifting, however, genetics can only get you so far. A 750 squat is just impossible naturally period.

Do you actually have any evidence whatsoever to back up that claim?

&gt;People like you have skewed what is possible naturally, you are the ones that are responsible for male body dysphoria, making people believe that their 405 deadlift is a beginner weight, or their 250 bench is pins.

No, it's actually you skewing what is possible naturally.  Because I know, for a fact, that at minimum a 750 squat at my weight is possible naturally, because I've done it.  You're trying to turn a normal distribution into a skew left distribution.  Literally skewing.

And no, I'm not responsible for making people believe a 405 deadlift is beginner weight or a 250 bench is bad.  If someone put in a lot of work to hit those numbers, I give them kudos for it.  I always tell people to just concern themselves with the next 5-10 pounds on the bar, and ignore the rest.

&gt;The point is that I know you're not natural, you didn't post this because you want to convince me, but because you want to keep your audience believing in this lie.

You really think /r/nattyorjuice is my audience?

3rd, fun fact the GOP isn't ""to the right of mystery country"" the GOP doesn't care about your piss pot of a country. No one cares. That's the difference between America and Europe. You small little people cling to your ""long standing history"" hoping someone will give a shit. Americans just do, knowing the world cares very deeply on our every move.  Your jealousy doesn't go unnoticed. It's that it's only noticed by other jealous Europeans.

It's worth noting, for a start, that globalism and globalization have related, but distinct meanings: 

Globalization is the interconnectedness of cultures and economies primarily through trade and technological innovations that allow for people to communicate effeciently despite traditional limitations.

Globalism is a propensity towards coalition or world government that have some degree of power over constituent nations. There is a set of globalist values, which I think are well-intentioned in theory, but terrible in practice.

There are many ways that globalism conflicts with national values. The example that seems most obvious is Britain and the EU - where the former felt that it did not have enough control over certain regulations and policies (immigration was the big one), and decided to leave. The UN and EU have power to influence the policies of nations, either by incentivization or punishment, and this can be disasterous when national interests come into conflict. America has a distinct set of values, rights, and interests. Other countries have their own, and they have the right to self-determination, as we do. Globalism would have us compromise on some of the things that I think should be held sacrosanct, such as our system of individualism, human rights, and the national soverignty which gauruntee them.",0,13,010110101110

Hi all!!


I have been traveling a lot this year (nearly 40% of the 2016 traveling), and it took its toll on me. No regrets but spent 3 months in Europe drinking awesome wine, eating amazing cheese and tons of baguettes and pastries. So yeah, got home, dared to step on the scale, and saw a number higher than I have ever seen. My weight has been creeping up for the past few years so it seemed like the time to take action. Started CICO on December 10th, and had a bumpy first week after a trip to NYC, but feeling more confident now, and down 6lbs.


Goals for January:


* Limit alcohol to 3 drinks for the month (a few special occasions I'm allowing myself one drink if desired!)
* try (5) vegetarian recipes for husband's desire to eat less meat
* use elliptical 3x week and increase 5min each time until at 45 mins",0,2,AgentAM

Oh my ex is also 24 and from Zhengzhou (中不中呵呵呵).  How did you two meet?  I love Henanese people despite the stereotypes.  my ex, her older brother and the others I've met from the region seem to speak with American accents (if they can speak english at all).  

&gt; How integrated did you become with Chinese outside of the service industry or Chinese that don't interact with foreigners much/at all?

Those are the only people in my experience who generally speak English well enough to take on a accent from America/England/Australia/etc.  Hmmmm of those I knew outside the what you just set, I was friends with an accountant from Harbin, a history prof from Jiangsu, a few law profs from Shandong, CCTV travel host from Gansu, a few Uighur waiters that went to uni in Malaysia, an army lieutenant in intel, etc.  All spoke with American English accents.

Hmmmm, my ex's dad was the head of a SOE in Zhengzhou and spoke very simple english in what sounded like an American accent to me (he did business trips in Europe and Africa quite often), same with her bro and the rest of her kin that I met.  

My best pal is from Shandong and studied at a uni where people tended to go into the foreign service after graduating.  He and I met while studying in the UK and he and the rest of the folks that came to study abroad with him used American accents.  I've spoken with his parents a bit but either in Mandarin or very very easy small bits of Mandarin (his dad can say ""is it delicious?"" and the ever useful ""I think I'm/you're drunk"" he seemed to have more a Chinese accent than American or English accent).

&gt; British English is what's taught in school unless the teacher is American or studied in America.

From what I've seen they teach English with British spelling but with American accents.  At least in Beijing, Zhengzhou (maybe you can pm me what schools in the area your wife went to, my ex seemed to grow up learning english with an American accent), Shandong, Hangzhou and Fuzhou they seem to learn with british spelling and American pronunciation.  Not to mention the many people I've met from the other regions around China.  The few I met who had actual English accents went out of their way to get them.",0,0,komnenos

[That soup I just mentioned](http://www.food.com/recipe/spicy-african-peanut-soup-with-chickpeas-339766). Side note, make sure you have some clean tupperware handy when you make this, because it yields a *ton* of food. Luckily, it also freezes really well.

[Pot pies!](http://minimalistbaker.com/1-hour-vegan-pot-pies/)

[A whole repository of recipes from the Thug Kitchen](http://www.thugkitchen.com/recipes). It might seem really gimmicky, but I've actually loved pretty much every recipe I've tried from this cookbook.

For breakfast/brunch, [sweet potato zucchini hash](http://www.food.com/recipe/sweet-potato-and-zucchini-hash-208382)

[Homemade gnocchi](http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/italy/how-to-make-gnocchi-an-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/), perfect if you're hosting a fancy dinner party and want to impress people. In my opinion, best served pan-fried in butter with cherry tomatoes and pesto or basil.

[Mushroom bourginon](https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/01/mushroom-bourguignon/), another good one for if you're having people over or just wanna be fancy.

Not a link, but my go-to easy-to-make comfort food is a vegetarian loco moco. Throw some rice in the rice maker or a pot. While that's cooking, pan-fry/grill a veggie burger (I personally like gardenburger brand, or you can make your own) and make mushroom gravy from one of the mix packets you can get at the store. Throw the rice down first, then the burger, fry up an egg real quick on the pan you cooked the burger in and put that on top. Then, the gravy goes over everything. Maybe not *the* healthiest thing in the world, but hey, that's why it's comfort food I guess.

Now, some more general advice:

1. Not everything has to be made with tofu. I personally don't like tofu at all, except occasionally in curries and Thai dishes. If you're looking for a meat substitute for traditionally meat-containing dishes, try seitan or tempeh instead. I think they both have way better texture, for starters. A BLT with tempeh instead of bacon is actually pretty damn good, if you throw some seasoned salt on the tempeh while cooking it.

2. Look into cuisines beyond standard American fare. A lot of ethnic foods use way less meat than what we're used to. Many Indian recipes, in particular, are vegetarian. [Chana masala](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/236564/chana-masala-savory-indian-chick-peas/) is a good example.

3. Field Roast. It's somewhat expensive compared to a lot of meat substitutes, but it's really, genuinely good in terms of both texture and seasonings. 

4. If you wanna go fully vegan and are looking for cheese substitutes, Daiya and the ones made from almond milk are the best. If you're going homemade, never trust any of the cauliflower-based ones, the texture and flavor will never work out.",0,7,pdxemf

You haven't answered my question: 'What are you talking about?' The quy I'm currently dating doesn't belong to a tribe. How does this influence his life? I belong to a tribe, but if I were to go live with them I would not feel at ease as an atheïst.

&gt;I read a story about a European family adopting an Indian girl. There was this moment where the parents were lying in bed with their biological son, and the Indian girl crawled in bed inbetween them. They described how the child smelled different from their own child, how it felt like it came from a different nest. How it became clearer than ever that this child was someone else's.

&gt;It's disturbing to me that this girl would have to spend her life with parents who felt this way about her.

This is just one story, though.

Even then, it **is** someone else's child. She isn't their biological child. It doesn't mean that they love her less. It just means that they were reminded of the fact she has different ancestry.

&gt;We differ greatly in this.

I'm sorry to hear that.

&gt;But good for you.

Thank you :).

&gt;Because I descend from a very long line of people who fought, suffered, were raped, enslaved and were persecuted in other ways before eventually dying for their beliefs and ways of life. Some of these people still are today. 

&gt;A lot of people have similar backgrounds.

&gt;For such people to voluntarily turn their backs on their traditions and beliefs - to assimilate to such a degree - makes the hardships our ancestors faced meaningless.

All types of people of all types of color/races/ethnicities have suffered through hardships, time has spared no one.

However, why should this influence my love life? 

I can care about my culture or throw it all away. In the end, I'm going to die anyway. I get that traditions/culture are important to some people, but I don't have an obligation to anyone, to uphold them.

&gt;I'm not. I was merely stating how I felt. I do not act on these beliefs in ways that intrude on others lives. 

You've acted on these beliefs by replying on my comment. You clearly care for some reason.

&gt; 
&gt; * Larger map - 5k as opposed to the standard 4k on most other Rustafied servers
&gt; * Monday wipes - In the interest of providing a fresh wipe experience for those who aren’t around on Thursday’s, we’ve decided to try out a different schedule. It’ll wipe Monday’s at 5pm GMT (Or when an update forces).
&gt; 
&gt; This server is live now on the official list. This Monday will actually be the only Monday where it doesn’t wipe (given it just opened and a forced wipe is coming on Thursday). We may tweak things about this server due to popular demand, so if you’d like to see some changes, please let us know!

And that after whatever re-organization happened after that war, which would have had to take place in the context of whatever power-blocks fought in that war and who won, with a LOT of people dead and cities destroyed, coupled with reduced religiosity and first contact with aliens, it was simply not an issue in the sense that it is today.

Remember that Earth had had a single world government for a while before forming the Federation. It had enjoyed global peace for decades at least.

So, while people probably came from Jerusalem or Tel-Aviv, just like they came from Idaho or Alaska or Mogadishu, it wouldn't really have been 'countries' in the way that we think of them.

Local regions with at least some responsibility of planning infrastructure and such, but not countries in a real sense.

Also, let's not forget that they're also largely post-scarcity, so the fight over resources wouldn't have been a source of conflict either.

I think these elements. Restructuring after a devastating world war, re-unification in response to alien life, new technologies that elevate us past fighting for scarce resources and the diminishing of religion would all make it pretty much a non-issue.

P.s. It's rather grim, but if we want to go there, then it's also possible that the region took a pretty hefty beating in WW3, perhaps decimated in terms of population and had to be basically resettled. I mean, if WW3 were to break out, I think it's reasonable to assume that besides the major cities of superpowers like the US, China, Russia and Europe, the middle east would probably be a hot spot in the conflict.",0,4,Iplaymeinreallife

Then I started singing in choirs. Then doing music theatre for a few years into my early 20s.  Then I moved into band gigs.  Wedding bands, ""function bands"", events, fairs, cruises, jingles, etc. Lots of funk, soul, pop, and classic rock.  During that time I was also doing voice competitions at state level.  Basically ""Pop Idol"" type thing .. except back then nobody really cared too much.  Most people just considered it ""glorified karaoke"", but whatevah.  And what was I competing with?  George Micheal stuff.  Father Figure, One More Try, Kissing a Fool, etc.  I ended up doing a few George Michael ""soundalike"" projects too.  My voice was pretty much somewhere between George Michael and Sting with some Stevie Wonder chops that I worked at.  High pop/rock tenor. Anyways .. that was pretty much my 20s in the 1990s.  Bands, musicals, competitions, recording, cruises, fairs, corporate events, jazz combos, hotels, whatever paid the bills and kept me singing.  Managed to actually live off only music for a few years.

Then I had some shitty throat surgery in 1998 and that pretty much put an end to that.  So I went back to school and did a degree in audio production.  Did that for a while.  Moved to Europe in 2001.  Did live sound for a while.  Worked at a studio in Berlin for while.  Now I run a tour company.  Life is funny.

So I don't need to ""look this stuff up"".  George Michael would not be able to handle the heavier Queen material.  He was not ""hiding"" some powerful rock voice throughout his career.  If he had it in him it would have been apparent *somewhere* in his repertoire.  You don't only use a ""rock voice"" in ""rock songs"".  *Not* every mediocre singer can pull off an authoritative rock voice ""in some way"".  Rock singing is not ""unpleasant"" to a hell of a lot of people.

You are a genius and an excellent person, completely disregarding your life and that of your loved ones in order to defend a criminal subhuman. Congratulations.

Someone's been watching a few too many movies. You know, it's pretty easy to gauge a situation if you just think clearly and not with a veil of paranoia. If you determine the intruders are there to rob your shit, chances are they're not willing to risk a move like that on a guy holding a gun. If you see a gun in one's hand then that's a different story. 

Believe it or not though, not a lot of people have the incentive and willpower to kill a man during a robbery, even if they have a gun. Shooting first is more likely to escalate the situation and get you shot instead, especially if there's more than one intruder. If you shoot one, the other's going to realize it's now a life or death situation, and if he has a gun you can bet he'll use it. OR you can tell them to get out and that you have a gun and avoid the whole situation altogether. 

&gt;If he has the intention of robbing me of my priced and hard earned possessions or money, then obviously he has no morality to speak of. 

Actually I believe someone who puts possessions and wealth over human life has no morality to speak of.

&gt;And really, when someone invades your house the most normal thing to do is to just shoot him as you can.

Yeah it's pretty normal if you're a schizophrenic but otherwise I'm not so sure.

I'd say I'm pretty well off but I've had my house robbed before. Unfortunately they hit the basement so nobody even heard them and they got away with some expensive equipment.

They weren't being harmed but some folks still wanted to be buddy-buddy with RUS rather than the EU, which is what the government was moving away from. Areas in eastern Ukraine have a large Russian population who werent ok with this.

Now I may be a little off on these next parts being American and not exactly having the best news media to consume but this was used as an excuse for Russia to ""protect"" the russians in Crimea.

The thing about Crimea is that its a fairly big area and having it under Russian control would be a nice addition. It has access to the black sea which would give Russia additional ports for trade and military. Primarily it was a power grab to secure Russian interests in the area.

That being said...Russia isn't ""at war"" with Ukraine, at least not officially, there are Russian soldiers fighting alongside the rebels, with Russian weapons, and vehicles, and money...but Russia isn't ""involved"".

The official line is essentially ""Some Russian citizens have gone to voluntarily fight, its not our fault.""

Oh. Also the area has possible oil and gas reserves and if Russia owns it they have control over anything found there...like oil and gas which the black sea is suspected of having a lot of right now. This is while the oil economy in Russia is starting to wane as reserves in Siberia slowly dry up. 

Also there are benefits such as deep water ports, an oil pipeline plan that would be cheaper with Crimea under russian control, trade, etc. etc.

""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!
Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia
in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many
countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods
of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet
rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the
next of its dignity and sanctity.

The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as
his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must
delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased
to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid
qualities - but the influence of the religion paralyses the social
development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists
in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and
proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa,
raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity
is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it
had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell
the civilization of ancient Rome.""",0,2,TheDeadBeatLebowski

**A maximum of 3% of the German population is from the greater islamic world.**

If we take that most recent yearly rape statistic, and determine what portion of it might realistically have been committed by migrants, using the number 160 which was reported by a conservative think tank, we get roughly 2% of rapes being committed by less than 3% of the population. Even if you use the most strict criteria when determining how much of that 3% are migrants, you don't find a disproportion worth making noise about. **Europeans are still responsible for 97% of rapes in Germany, and by targeting specific communities, German police turn a blind eye to the reality that all communities engage in rape.**",0,1,MCskeptic

Let me remind you it was your choice to engage me with a smart ass comment so if you are offended or find yourself upset at the candor of my comments then perhaps you should choose your words a bit more wisely in the future.  Before I started my current company I worked for an exceptionally large and publicly traded company I will call ABC Company.  Behemoth sounds douchey but in reality they are.  Your lecture about not seeing the writing on the wall is comical for it was this very reason I left the exceptionally large and publicly traded ABC Company and started my company which specializes in (we'll just leave it at ""cloud"").  I was pushing cloud applications before anyone even knew what the hell cloud was.  I've been through the entire evolution of off shore and near shore outsourcing and guess what?  It was a speed bump.  The off shore model only affected companies like mine for a brief period of time.  Plenty of enterprise companies have already gone through nightmare projects managed by off shore resources and the results were disastrous.  I work with plenty of tier 1 clients who will never do the off shore model again.  But when H1B came along that changed everything.  Now the offshore worker could come to the US and be an on-site or near site resource.  No more 9 hour time difference.  We now import our replacement and these guys have it down to a science.  They will jump from company to company working the system.

The reference to Brexit was to more clearly define to you what ""globalism"" actually is since you repeatedly and incorrectly reference ""globalization"" as a negative which it is not.  However ""globalism"" is the reason why the US IT worker is in danger.  You are wrong in your understanding of what globalism is.  This is my point in referencing Brexit.  Globalism is an ideology and Brexit is the result of a globalist ideology which the EU is built upon.  This is not my opinion.  This is fact.  For someone as educated as you seem to be you are grossly uneducated on the reality of what globalism actually is.  To further clarify for you H1B is an aspect of globalism as it imports foreign workers into our country to displace our resident workers.  The purpose and intent of the globalist mindset is to dilute our cultural and economic system with foreign workers.

I had to look up what a Goldwater Republican actually was because it was before my time.  I still can't locate something the clearly defines this so if you would like to elaborate then please do.  There are quite a few conflicting definitions but most point to varying degrees of libertarianism and some even to socialism.  Bottom line is this.  What you accuse me of as nationalism and isolationism makes you sound very liberal because you are making a huge and unfair assumption.  Since when has it ever been wrong to put you and your family first?  You understand the difference between macro and micro right?  Why is it if someone says, ""America first"" they are immediately assumed to be an isolationist or a nationalist?  What is the difference between you putting your family first before others and another person desiring to put their country first?  There is no difference except when one wishes to politicize and unfairly label a group of people.  This is what you did and quite frankly it is a calling card of liberals.  So for someone claiming to be a conservative you sure don't sound conservative.  To clarify for you I am a patriot and a moderate.  I've also served in the US Army and have been deployed in a combat role on 2 deployments meaning I saw and did a lot of shit.  More shit than you will ever imagine.

Most IA merch is actually not limited. I bought 2 of the same white IA Rocks shirt 1 year apart, but made by 2 different company. 


&gt;  But from an objective economic standpoint she just doesn't have enough songs.

Unless you have some financial information behind 1st Place that we don't know about.  I have to argue that her concert tour is quite successful, consider her first NA live concert, her Japanese, and the two Chinese concert were all sold out.  I have also been to a movie screening, and those are bit of hit and miss, since it's not a full on ""live"" performance. 


If you only count the official song, she has nine CDs released by 1st Place (00, IA Rocks, 01, 02, 03, IA/VT, circuit beats, guitar magazine x IA, and mekakucity records).  There are some overlaped song in the albums, but if you count all the songs 1st Place released with Queen's Label, that's 13 IA the World CDs.  So I would said that IA has enough popular songs to fill a 2 hour concert.


&gt; She isn't popular enough to have large scale investments.

What do you mean by large scale investments? First, you have to understand that 1st Place is relatively small company compare to Crypton Future Media (CFM), so their budget will naturally be less than what CFM can spend on their Vocaloids.  second, I would not call a concert tour across NA, Europe, and SEA a small investment by any mean, just consider the Live concert alone, 1st Place is shipping million dollar equipment and all the staff + the band members all around the globe.  And if what you mean by large scale investments is a partnership with Good Smile Company (GSC) or Sega.  There is no way that 1st Place can have a partnership with GSC or Sega, since CFM is defiantly their biggest partner in terms of Vocaloid merch, there would be a conflict of interest for GSC and Sega to produce any IA merchs.



And if you are talking about the rarest IA merch [this](http://i.imgur.com/3GklkfS.jpg) has to be it, I am the only person outside of 1st Place to have these posters.  I had to attend AX and pester Ms. Murayama for them. Aside from that I would say, the IA Aria on the Planetes 1.5 figure would be quite rare as well, since they are out of production and you can only find them on ebay for $250.

Tell them why you want to visit by being specific. For example the Lasceaux cavern museum I just visited is mindblowing: to see the early cultural expressions of men. So beautiful and so ancient!

&gt; Benjamin Scott Folds (born September 12, 1966, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina) is an American singer-songwriter. He is widely known for his prowess as a pianist. Ben Folds' musical career started to get off the ground in the late '80s, as bassist for band Majosha, after playing bass and piano at Pinehurst, in a group known as the ""Caroliners"" with cohort Millard Powers in 1985-1987; he also played drums as a session musician in Nashville. As well as appearing in Pots &amp; Pans - now known as the Snuzz demo, as a pianist in Britt Harper Uzzell's (aka Snuzz) band.  Folds is best known for his later work as the frontman and pianist of Ben Folds Five and as a solo artist. Folds's compositional and playing technique remain wholly unique, combining elements of the typical 'singer/songwriter' genre, jazz, and power rock. Indeed, his music is evocative of artists such as Joe Jackson, Todd Rundgren, and Sir Elton John, with an added edge and bold infusion of energy and wit. Although his music has no distinctive genre with which it is associated, the terms piano rock and indie are often used to describe his unique style. It is worth noting that popular, piano-centric artists such as trio-based Keane and solo artist Matt Hales, a.k.a. Aqualung, began their rise to popularity after Ben Folds' three-member band, Ben Folds Five, broke up in 2000. The other two members of Ben Folds Five were Robert Sledge (bass) and Darren Jessee (drums).

&gt; As of fall 2006, Ben Folds has released five solo LPs. His first album, Fear of Pop: Volume 1, an album of spoken word and instrumental compositions, was recorded and released while Ben Folds Five was still together. Since it was an uncharacteristic release, and officially released under the moniker of 'Fear of Pop', it is widely considered that his first ""proper"" solo album was Rockin' the Suburbs (2001), on which he played all the instruments by himself. A year later, in 2002, he released Ben Folds Live, a collection of live solo recordings. In late 2003, two solo EPs, Speed Graphic and Sunny 16, were released, with a third entitled Super D released in mid-2004. In 2005, Folds released a second studio album called Songs for Silverman. Most recently Folds has released the album ""Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp"" a compliation of his EPs, a The Bens track called ""Bruised,"" ""Still"" from the motion picture of 2006 ""Over the Hedge"" for which Folds wrote all the songs, his cover of the Dr. Dre song ""Bitches Ain't Shit"", and, with the kind permission of his good friend Neil Hannon, a cover of The Divine Comedy song ""Songs of Love"".  ""Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp"" otherwise includes remastered takes from the three internet EPs from 2002-2004. Ben claims that he wanted to have the CD in hard format so he could ""put it past him.""

&gt; Ben resides in Nashville with his wife, Fleur.  He often tours the United States, the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe, Japan, and Australia.

&gt; Folds' tours are famous for his solo act as ""Ben Folds and a piano"", often having the audience become involved by ""playing"" the accompanying instruments (such as the trumpet and saxophone harmonies in ""Army"") and singing choir-like backing vocals on ""Not the Same"". His concerts are charismatic, yet calm - an enjoyable experience for most. And although Folds is constantly putting out new songs, his concerts rarely omit classic fan favorites such as ""Philosophy,"" ""One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces,"" and ""Army."" Also, a seemingly fan favorite that started in Chicago, IL was ""Rock this Bitch,"" a song where Folds has to come up an impromptu new tune with the words ""Rock this Bitch"" in it; though the song seems to be phasing out, it still makes appearances on tours, such as the November 2006 tour and the Spring US College tour of 2007 and 2008.

&gt; Folds also produced and arranged the William Shatner album, Has Been (2004); he previously worked with Shatner on the songs ""In Love"" and ""Still in Love"" for Fear of Pop.

&gt; Folds described his former band, Ben Folds Five, as ""punk rock for sissies,"" and his oddball lyrics often contain nuances of depression, melancholy and self-conflict. Folds also provided a number of songs for film soundtracks. Some of these include ""Lonely Christmas Eve"" for the Jim Carrey film How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (2000), and a rendition of the Beatles' ""Golden Slumbers"" for the film I Am Sam (2001). He (as The Bens) has also done charity compilations, from singing ""Wicked Little Town"" (from film and stage show Hedwig and the Angry Inch) on the benefit album ""Wig in a Box"" (2003) to appearing on No Boundaries, a benefit album for Kosovo refugees, with the song ""Leather Jacket."" (written by Darren Jessee)

&gt; On a planned tour of Australia, Folds teamed up with solo artists Ben Kweller and Ben Lee to travel the country together as The Bens, at the suggestion of a fan on Ben Kweller's official website. The trio also went on to record a four-track EP together, entitled The Bens.

&gt; In summer of 2004, Folds co-headlined an American tour with fellow rockers Rufus Wainwright and Guster. His second solo studio album, entitled Songs for Silverman, was released in the U.S. on April 26, 2005, featuring Jared Reynolds on bass, and Lindsay Jamieson on the drums, thus returning to the trio format, which had been so successful earlier, in earnest. This album includes the track ""Late,"" a tribute to the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, and also features backing vocals from ""Weird Al"" Yankovic on ""Time."" (Folds had played piano for Yankovic's song ""Why Does This Always Happen to Me?"" and ""Weird Al"" directed Folds' music video for Rockin' the Suburbs). In January of 2007 Lindsay Jamieson left the band and was replaced by Sam Smith, of The Comfies on drums.

&gt; Folds performed with Rufus Wainwright and Ben Lee in the summer of 2005 as part of the ""Odd Men Out"" tour. In addition, Folds has performed with many other famous musical names, including Weezer. Folds has also shown the complexity behind his authentic sound by performing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, in March 2005, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in November 2005. A DVD recording of Folds playing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra was released in December, 2005.

&gt; Folds was the first artist to do a ""Live at Myspace"" concert, held on October 24, 2006 in his recording studio in Nashville, the show was an hour long and had requests from the internet submitted via Myspace's Messenger. It also entailed several stunts, including a suicide attempt, and a falling audience member during ""Jesusland"". The DVD of the broadcast (almost whole) was released in February of 2007. 

&gt; 
Folds supports the independent music scene, creating his own record label (Attacked By Plastic) and doing promotional work for independent record stores across the country.

&gt; In 2008, September 16 marked the release of Amanda Palmer's solo album which was produced by Folds. Two days following that release, Ben Folds Five had a one-time reunion concert held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the same place the band was formed. Weeks later, he released his third solo album entitled Way To Normal, released on September 30. Folds also recorded a fake album that was leaked intentionally during the summer to please fans and in an attempt to stop the real album from leaking. The fake tracks were recorded and mixed over a period of only several days. The leak contained 6 fake songs with names similar to the real songs or the album, and three songs from the actual release (except the song Cologne, which was an orchestral version of a song by the same name on the final album).

&gt; Since December 2008, Folds has been collaborating with English novelist Nick Hornby, writing the music while Hornby writes the lyrics. This album was originally planned to be recorded over a course of 3 days, the same amount of time in which the fake album was recorded, but Folds has since been recording the album in a more standard format, albeit attempting to retain the live recording format. He has also played several songs from the upcoming album at live shows since mid-2009, and the album is slated to be released on September 27th of 2010.

&gt; From December 14 through 21, 2009, Folds was featured as a judge on NBC's a cappella competition The Sing Off alongside Nicole Scherzinger and Shawn Stockman and offered insightful, constructive comments and criticisms to the contestants. On the final show, in a departure from his a cappella purism, showcased his talents and played the roaring, riffing piano background on ""Why Can't We Be Friends?"" sung by the two finalist groups, Tufts Beelzebubs from Tufts University near Boston and Nota, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He again returned for the show's second season, and has been confirmed to return for the third season in September 2011 alongside Stockman and new judge Sara Bareilles.

&gt; Recently Ben Folds was assumed to be the anonymous pianist playing songs to random ChatRoulette users, named ""Merton."" Although Ben Folds has admitted to NOT being Merton, he paid tribute to the YouTube star at a concert in Charlotte in ""Ode To Merton."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; A group of 1,100 people from sub-Saharan Africa trying to reach Europe stormed the border fence just after 4am on New Year&amp;#039;s Day in an &amp;quot;Extremely violent and organised&amp;quot; way, said the central government&amp;#039;s representative office in Ceuta.

&gt; According to local authorities, of the 1,100 migrants who stormed the border Sunday, about 100 managed to climb up the external fence and stayed on top for hours.

From 1980 to 1985 the Italian economy didn't grow *at all*. In 1991, the Italian economy went through recession and it didn't come back to pre-recession level until after it adopted the euro. This means that it had zero growth from 1990 to 2000. The 90s were a totally lost decade for Italy. After adopting the Euro, from 2000 to 2008, the italian GDP grew 70%. 

This proves that the Euro has nothing to do with inhibiting growth, it's your own economy and instituions that are too weak and got blown away by the crisis. 

And by the way your 3% number is totally wrong. Since adopting the Euro, the italian economy has grown 13%, which is much higher than the growth it experienced from 1990 to 2001.

I understand that Christianity has changed much and has shaped a lot of Europes, and white people's, history. From Crusades to Rome to the 30 years war and everything in between.

With European art, such as Michelangelo's [David](http://www.italianrenaissance.org/wp-content/uploads/Michelangelo-David-e1429028121909.jpg), being made by Christians.

But all in all, there are some reasons why Christianity isn't compatible with the Alt-Right.

**1)** Judeo-Christian tradition is rooted in, well, Judaism. This whole concept of promoting weakness rather than strength. This, ""lowest common denominator"" idea that we hate Marxism, and Marxist-derived ideologies for, is also apparant under Christianity.

Traditional European gods promoted strength, Zeus, Thor, Wodan, Mars and others. Christianity, on the other hand, follows the Marxist path. Jesus wasn't strong, but rather, forgiving. The story of Jesus is almost antithetical to the traditional stories of the Trojan wars, pagan creation stories, and others. Rather than a hero who defeats the enemies with the power of god, Jesus was killed and forgave everyone.

Kind of hard to dislike Marxism for it's protection of weakness when Christianity does the same. It's 'Judeo-Christianity' for a reason, despite all the Roman influences.

That brings me to my second point.

**2)** It's just not European. Culturally, European-Pagan religions originate from the Indo-European culture. Ergo, the Romans, Greeks, Germans and other Europeans, worshipped what was essentially, the same panthion. Compare the concepts of Zeus and Thor/Odin. Or Odin and Wodan. Aphrodite and Venus.

Christianity, like Judaism and Islam, is Afro-Asiatic.

**3)** Christianity goes against what was essentially, *the most European empire of all time*, Rome.

No one will deny that European culture has been shaped by Graeco-Roman culture, or even just Roman culture as it was an amalgamation of Greek- and Etruscan cultures anyway.

Christianity traditionally shuns nudity. The Romans, and other European civilizations traditionally embraced it as a form of beauty. Aphrodite as the epitome of female beauty and Mars and the epitome of male beauty. Both were shown, commonly naked. Christianity is against that.

Not to mention the downward spiral the empire had as soon as the importance of Christianity grew. From making everyone in the empire officially ""Roman"" to making Christianity the state religion during Constantine. Also funny how making everyone Roman, despite ethno-cultural bounderies *does* indeed fit with the traditional Judeo-Christian thinking.

Or how the Thermae, bathing houses, were hated by the Christians in the empire, which led to masive disease outbreaks that weakened Rome heavily, all because of Christianities hatred towards nudity.

In the end, Christianity spread in the empire in the same way Jews spread in the Middle Ages. Not by direct war, but by subversion and fraud.

**4)** All in all, Christianity might've influenced important parts of European history like the Crusades or the forming of Prussia, but it's opposition towards Graeco-Roman culture and it's promotion of themes such as ""everyone is equal under the eyes of god"" are the basic reasons why Christianity and the Alt-Right run into problems together.

And Jesus was, after all, a *Jew*.

Then again, I hate pagan LARPers with their ""hail Odin"" far more. Tbh Atheism fits the best with the Alt-Right as religion but when it comes to culture, Atheism lacks certain elements such as established morals that the Bible can provide easily.",0,5,SoefianB

&gt; It's a lot easier to help a developed country recover from a devastating event than it is to teach people how they are supposed to act in order to be a first world country.

Cultural values matter: Look at Canada &amp; Australia and their indigenous population. Nation-building doesn't even work within a country.

Thought experiment: Consider that the North Korean regime was to collapse tomorrow and the South Korean government was to lock the borders for fear of a flood of refugees. There is an orderly transition to a democratic government, but the only investment is from foreign companies (no foreign aid). What do you think the growth rate would be for NK? At least 10% for 10 years would be reasonable?

Now consider Afghanistan, a country with roughly the same per-capita GDP as North Korea, where 70% of the government budget is foreign aid receipts and in 2011 was equivalent to 100% (!) of GDP. This is nation-building on a scale beyond an NGO's wildest dreams. Yet GDP growth in the last 10 years has averaged less than 4% (and has been steadily declining over the past few years).

**Here's how to achieve really rapid economic growth:**

* Transplant an existing wealthy society (US, Canada, Australia)
* Rebuild an existing developed society after a war (Europe after WW1, WW2)
* Natural resource boom with (comparatively) low levels of government corruption (eg Botswana)
* Single or de-facto single party state focusing on economic development - the Asian model: Singapore, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China. Usually leads to greater political freedom later (China may disprove that part)

I'd love to hear counter-examples, but Japan Germany and Korea all fit into the above model as either a heretogenous single-party system or reconstruction of a preexisting economy.

A better question would be: apart from your cited examples, when has foreign nation-building ever *worked*?

Think of it this way: the HRE of a 769 start represents the Carolingian Empire because that empire had still not been formed by the start date, while the HRE of later start dates represents the German HRE founded by Otto I, since by 867 the Carolingian Empire was gone but Otto's empire still not founded. Both used the same title historically.

Personally I'd prefer to found the HRE with any Catholic, whether German, British, Spanish or Hungarian, over any of the ahistorical de jure empire around Europe, e.g. Carpathia or Hispania.

sorry, i really think you're biased here. i'm not positive in saying that, but my impression is the SJWs trampling on free speech in universities etc. gets a bit too much play in conservative media, and all i mean by that is that it skews perception of how frequent it is. I do, however, agree that that movement is a threat to free speech and I'm even open conceptually to some aspects of things like the right to not bake a gay wedding cake. I'm undecided, i haven't thought about it enough.

okay so my point in what i just said basically is that i think we need to be clear that your label is only applied to an accurate number of ""progressives"". let's grant that.

&gt; As far as foreign policy goes, the USA is an empire ...

you're a classical liberal, we see eye to eye-ish here.

i don't think people on the left want war with russia. I do think the assumption a no-fly zone by hillary would be WW3 was complete bullshit. seriously, we'd go to brinksmanship over a no-fly zone? tangent..

&gt; Personally, Vietnam was a war to slow the spread of Communism and it was justified as far as I'm concerned.

I dont know enough history to say you're wrong or right confidently. I can understand why you'd feel that way.. but think about how our anti communist stance meant we supported an incredibly unpopular undemocratic dictator, killed millions of civilians, and bombed cambodia and laos and helped destabilize cambodia. in retrospect you'd be a psychopath to support the vietnam war. if communism across the board is as bad as you say then why did vietnam transition to what it was? the answer is the domino theory was bullshit, and we probably would have been a much more favorably looked-upon world leader if we hadn't had the CIA and military playing world cop for sixty years. Communism in the USSr is not the same as communism elsewhere, couple that with lives lost due to famine etc. and I think your argument is pretty tenuous. I disagree here, i just would very much struggle justifying a war like that over the concern of communism over diplomacy or even just letting be, but your point isn't lost on me.

&gt; An empire can't be expected to behave fairly.

i think that's total bullshit. to be clear, i think any other country would do if they were the world superpower... maybe differently. american style imperialism is american. i want to aspire to something better, i think that's fundamentally a progressive value. where we are willing to criticize american policies conservatives seem to get offended.

&gt; If you knew there was a place where they were killing babies, you'd go do something about it too.

right.

&gt; The left thinks the right is evil, literally evil.

i often do, but i often check myself... it's pretty fuckin hard when i visit r/the_donald on a daily basis. i do check progressives hard for doing this though, i think both sides seem to jack off to memes showing how absurd the other side is... not an accurate picture of the world at all.

&gt;  Mitt Romney was literally a binder-woman hating dog-abusing Mormon bastard

lol.. who puts their dog on the fucking roof though? but yeah, i agree with your sentiment. i think mitt had a good hearted, faus paux with the binders thing but man the liberal machine ripped his ass for that.


&gt; CNN, MSNBC, NYT, WaPo--these are all hysteria factories.

i used to watch/read, i haven't really in years but i do check out NYT. NYT is socially liberal, from my experience it's borderline centrist on foreign policy but seems more left in recent years. I'm not sure these are your hysteria factories.. and i know i just admitted i don't watch, but here's the thing: young progressives don't watch them either.

&gt; Islamism has to be destroyed.

i don't think the conventional american approach is going to work here. i'm open to knocking out isis, i'm not sure that's enough. those same cold war policies were applied in the middle east -- 1953 overthrow of the iranian president to insert the shah led to the iranian revolution, you had the secular government in egypt overthrown, obviously we trained the taliban, support the saudis now..  i think the islamism problem is unique. i think the solution is long-term, unfortunately. i don't think religion has nothing to do with it -- it does. but i think geopolitics and politics have defined a lot and i don't know if more US intervention will work.

works both ways, but yeah we agree basically.

&gt; China is kicking our ass at trade 

dono enough about china or economics, but from what i know at least 40% of chinese exports are from american owned companies (IIRC). we are walloping china in terms of GDP, just cause they export more doesn't mean we're losing to them.

ISIS isn't a threat to the US at all, europe is a different issue, and i think they're almost wiped out in syria and iraq? 

&gt; I see the left as whiny children that need to get out of the way so the real issues can be dealt with

i think this is from too much conservative media. most young progressives care, like myself, mostly about addressing income inequality, long term sustainability of the US economy, climate change.. i think climate change is the biggest threat to what i value.

a classical liberal is a lot easier to communicate with and agree with as a progressive. to summarize how i feel about what i just read, i generally agree. i do think there's some distortion about how the average progressive values what's important.. and i think the media factor is huge there. issues like gay marriage are seemingly binary ethical issues for progressives so it's easy pickings for the media to rally behind. for the longest time i had the opinion that the media does this same thing (some 8 years ago), they seemingly dodged all conversations about income inequality until recently. i'd obviously very much disagree with a classical liberal on economic issues, but i think those are less charged somehow.

edit: tl;dr sure, i think some small number of progressives are very down with shutting down free speech, but enough of us care who also identify as progressive to stop that... i think it's already being addressed at a level. so i'd overall not agree the ""left"" is like the communist left.",0,6,rastermasster

Any possibility of electric cars being ""extremely competitive"" are reserved for the time slot when at least the first Gigafactory is completed, running at full production and a good deal of its production quota isn't sold to Panasonic. Or other projects that require high capacity batteries. So, like 2025. in the earliest just for one part of the US. GF2, slated for the European market, doesn't even have a land lot, so the proliferation of electric cars to a mainstream degree in the region is at least 2 decades in the future for that region too. Even if the technology to reduce costs is there in 10 years, the production capacity/infastructure/safety regulations/transport network/political movements won't be for decades to come. And all of that is heavily predicated on the wild guess that hybrids aren't simply a superior mid-term solution to the problems. To me it seems that the automotive industry will transition (and is transitioning for a few years already) into hybrids in the coming decades and that electric cars will be a niche market for the US/EU until at least 2035., when another transitional period towards full electric will start and won't achieve market majority a decade. At that point developing nations of the era might start that transition.

Then you realise Costa Rica isn't even an OECD country, let alone Norway or the Netherlands.

Syria completely boggles my mind in that we have handed over our civil liberties in the name of ""the war on terror"".  What are we doing in syria giving arms to terrorist groups?

The US overthrowing the syrian government for a pipeline is how assads father came to power in the first place.  History is repeating itself here.  We are using terrorists to fight a government we disagree with.  

Our actions in yemen are the most egregious.  We sold saudi arabia the bombs theyre dropping on hospitals and food production sites (farms/livestock, slaughterhouses, markets, etc).

The ""current"" population is made up of both native Germans and previous immigrants, and ""comparable groups"" is a weasel word to hide the fact that it's not referring to the total population, but just to a smaller high-crime demographic, probably in some low education, low income bracket.

In reality, [migrants and asylum seekers specifically commit an absurdly disproportionate rate of crime](https://i.imgur.com/im3m8vz.png), based on [actual direct data](http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2016/05/pks-und-pmk-2015.html) from the German Interior Ministry (note the URL).

&gt; Even in Sweden,the sex crimes have remained relatively the same since 2005.

Your own source says that the rate has gone from 41.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 63.5 in 2010. If we look at the helpful page ""[rape in Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden)"", we discover it was also 69 per 100,000 in 2014. Pray tell, how does a 50% increase equate to ""relatively the same""? you are, once again, outright lying about the content of your sources. By the way, [77% of rapes in Sweden are committed by the male Muslim population, which is 2%](https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/sweden-77-6-percent-of-all-rapes-in-the-country-committed-by-muslim-males-making-up-2-percent-of-population/).

Way back in the day it was pretty common to hire separate people whose entirely job consisted solely of bagging things. Baggers, we called them., or the gendered name ""bag boys"". Was a lot of teenagers first jobs. You still occasionally see them or if an extra cashier is around or something on occasion they might show up and start bagging your stuff. But by and large they no longer exist (I'm sure it's a massive cost saver thing) and then it's about 50/50 on whether you're expected to bag your own or the cashier will do it (and they do it as they're ringing stuff up generally so I mean not like you can stop them). It's all kind of weird now that I think of it but I'm pretty sure the prior years of separate baggers is exactly why Americans still aren't used to bagging their own stuff and why cashiers ended up doing it.

Well, insulting the person you're replying to will certainly win them over.

I presume you've watched interviews with the guy. He gets flustered and angry easily.  He's just embarrassing with the media.

Aside from on one occasion, all the speeches I've seen him do are as inspiring as a wet lettuce.

He has made more gaffs than I can remember any leader doing..some are truly cringeworthy.

Don't even get me started on how much presence or gravitas he (doesn't) have.  This is the guy that is wanting to represent our country.

&gt;He's been elected and won every political challenge he has personally run in and pretty much always with huge margin. 

He's won two leadership elections. Granted the membership like him, but the electorate certainly don't.  He's divisive.

&gt;As an MP his constituents absolutely love him, his voting record is better than any other MP in the house and he campaigns tirelessly for what he believes would help them. 

Don't think anyone would question his performance as someone who represents his constituents, my MP is good too, but would I want him as PM?

&gt;As leader of Labour party he has pretty much single handedly tripled the membership base to become the largest political party in  Europe with aim of 1 million members and cleared the parties enormous debt and put them into surplus. Every mayoral election contested has been won and the at the local councils elections nearly every seat was held. 

Again, he's divisive. The membership may like him, but he's not liked by the electorate (just look at his popularity ratings) and they're the ones who will matter in the end.

I'm sure Sadiq Khan would have a little to say on the idea that his win had much to do with Corbyn.

The local elections were pretty awful. Seats were lost when the opposition is expected to gain..the only plus is that *it wasn't as bad as expected*.  Lost seats in Scotland and Wales. The local MP by-elections have gone as expected. Council by-elections have been pretty poor and the polls generally have looked tragic.

&gt;The people that are saying he's a bad leader are the ones that are useless, they couldn't even get their shadow chancellor re-elected, lost the leadership elections and think Kesia Dugsdale is going to somehow win back votes in Scotland. A large chunk of the party is virtue signalling, ex-spad spinners who have the charisma of a corporate helpline. It will be interesting to see what happens when the boundaries get changed and they have to convince their local party members the reselect them. 

Your dreams of deselection will make sure that the Tories are in power for a lot longer and risk UKIP really getting a foothold in parliament..but I guess that's ok because..

Last year the thousand Africans raped and robbed countless women. This year the same group of people were racially profiled out... And guess what, the mass rapes did not occur.

Sorry but this does not logically follow. The first and most important thing to point out that this is not the ""same group of people"" as you imply but, rather, the same *race* of people. We know nothing of the motivations of this new group of people. We know only that they share the same *race* as the *previous group*.

What you are saying implies that this *race* of people is prone to mass raping. However, we know that this same *race* of people is all over Germany and, indeed, Europe, yet we have not seen constant mass raping throughout Europe. How do you explain this then?

The other significant factor is the increased police presence in general. How can we know that this wouldn't have been sufficient last year? There are sexual assaults at other large gatherings of people, so how can we know that the key factor isn't police presence rather than race?

We can't know. It could be race. It could be police. It could be religion. It could be that particular group of people in 2015/2016. It could be any number of things. The point is that we don't know.

When my parents immigrated from Africa they stayed in Sudan (which neighbors the nation from which they fled) just long enough to get the money they needed to fly to the states and request Asylum.

Because believe it or not there were more of their people here than there were in Sudan, so even from a cultural perspective it was the better choice.

This margin is pure profit, they have no expenses and their only contribution is offering the medium, for which they are already richly paid.

All of those sellers are compensated for their apps and they have agreed to that compensation. They can sell their apps through third party app stores if they want to.

&gt;If I got you right, your premise is the people should pay for the infrastructure, education and all out of their wages, and companies are contributing only by paying wages. 

No I'm not saying that. I'm saying that Apple is paying for all those services even if it's not paying for them directly. They are paying the workers, their suppliers etc. Said distribution company is the one that is directly using those roads and it's perfectly reasonable that it should be the one that is paying for it.

Claiming Japan was not a industrialized country because they didnt meet up with nations like France and the US is just over simplified.

The Industralization of Japan wasnt much later than that of mainland Europe. Factories were being built in mainland Europe significally later than in the UK and US because of continental wars (napoleon). When industralization did pick up in the 20s, 30s and 40s of the 1800s, Japan soon followed. With a Dutch proposed tour around the worlds leading industrial nations, the Japanese representatives returned home in the 1850s to jumpstart the industrial revolution in Japan.

I sense that you watched a few ww2 docus where they tell you that Japan took over parts of Asia to be able to counter western industrial capacities, mostly that of the US. Thats true. Japanese industry was lacking compared to the US, but so was basically the rest of the world. Japan its main source of concern however was lack of raw materials, not per se industry.

But the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars complicated matters and once a war starts, it is really hard to reverse that. Europe learned that the hard way with the Yugoslav Civil War 20 years ago where a ""token effort"" is no way to prevent violence, culminating in the Srebrenica massacre (8,373 civilians read in a week due a peacekeeping force ill-equipped to counter an aggressor against civilian targets). To end that particular conflict, NATO (and by extension the EU in later years - see [EUFOR Althea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUFOR_Althea)) - an alliance that was at the time geared and ready to face off against a superpower that no longer existed, had to step in to break up the conflict through a mixture of brute force, careful diplomacy and reconciliation/rebuilding that lasted more than a decade.

Hence the task of ending conflicts is never simple or easy. For the Syrian/Conflict, it is a solution fraught with preconditions. You'd have to first get into a situation where all warring parties would be willing partners in peacetime. Then you'd have to get all external powers - EU/NATO, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia - to agree on common execution of post-conflict peacekeeping and rebuilding with UN mandate.

It is not an entirely honest article. The guy is mixing documented decisions/rejections with undocumented ones. He cherry picks those to fit his narrative. E.g. he says there is no documented Syrian rejection over the pipeline, but insists that Saudi Arabia would likely not supporting it just because in general they don't support such stuff. 

He said Syria did not reject any plan in 2009, because the (Quatar-Tyrkey) group to build the pipeline was formed only in October 2009. This misses 2 options - Syria rejected the idea unofficially prior to October 2009, and/or Syria rejected the idea in November or December 2009. 

In one case he questions the credibility of an unnamed EU diplomat on the ""Syria rejected the plan"" hypothesis, but 2 paragraphs later he embraces the opinion of a ""Middle East geopolitical analyst"" that Saudi Arabia was the country that blocked the plan. In both cases there are no documents or records, but he chooses one speculation over the other.

I am not conceding to the whole actual increase in rape. I said that because first that it did not have anything to the sex crimes or crimes in 2015/16 as it was by 2010. furthermore you clearly didnt read my source. I dont quite understand what you mean by the whole citing links.
For the 77% rape being down my Muslim's i didn't say that's a good thing, i said that irrelevant to the refugee crisis. Secondly, as some one mentioned it's not even from the government data, as the government doesn't keep stats on immigrants when it comes to sexual crimes anymore. They haven't for 20 years. The definition of rape did not stay the same. 
As for the last part i dont quite understand what you mean, you said that all those rapes were done by muslims, but the source says foreign born.

the source also says
 ""One type of crime that has received a lot of attention in public discussions are sexual crimes. It is relevant to point out that the portion of people born outside Sweden who have been suspected of a sexual crime during the period is less than half a percent, and the portion suspected of rape or attempted rape is less than 0.3 percent.""

 As someone pointed out 'One comparison from the table on p. 66 is that among men born 1945-1981 who are born in Sweden with both parents born in Sweden, 2.1 per 1000 were suspected of rape one or more times during 1997-2001, while the same number for those born abroad was 5.7. However, since there are many more times as many people in the first category, and the second category also contains many Europeans who are unlikely to be Muslims, the number 77.6% is clearly false even when looking at the data.'

Bom em vários países de primeiro mundo tem várias pessoas obesas. A maioria das mulheres em geral se importam muito com a vaidade. Se o cara não gosta disso então que pegue uma white trash ou crack whore que não liga para isso ou  se case com uma muçulmana, já que a religião diz que elas devem serem modestas. Embora elas compensem a vaidade com hijabs enfeitados.

&gt; Alguns amigos que nunca tiveram muita sorte antes de conseguir a primeira namorada sempre me falam que chove mulher quando vc tá comprometido...Como nunca tive um relacionamento, já pensei em fazer um pequeno experimento: comprar aquelas alianças de namoro, o mais barato que eu conseguir e parecer convincente, e sair pra algum bar ou local público que eu sei que tem bastante mulher. Fazer isso por uns 2 ou 3 meses e ver o resultado.

Cara mais barato tu contratar uma acompanhante que faça o estilo namoradinha e ponto. Tem lugares em minha cidade que cobram 50,00 por uma hora de diversão. Outras mais tops cobram R$ 150,00 por hora de diversão. Elas verdadeiras mulheres de negócio. Tudo tem um preço!!

&gt; [SIC] E as mulheres são propensas a desejarem caras já acompanhados ou comprometidos, nada de novo aqui. Não julguem todos por alguns.

TL;DR - Melhor go MGTOW.

&gt; Olha, eu nunca parei pra pensar por esse ponto, na questão da pontualidade e tal.

Em uma cidade como SP, com os engarrafamentos que tem para quem trabalha no centro é complicado. Tem apartamentos em SP capital que custam para lá mais de um milhão. 

&gt; Já morei em interior e em capital, e o problema é o mesmo. O foda é quando você é uma pessoa quieta, reservada (tipo eu) e alguém te interrompe quase toda vez que você vai falar. Já aconteceu de eu ser interrompido três vezes seguidas em uns dois minutos de conversa; depois disso eu desisti de falar e fiquei quieto. Pior ainda: é esse tipo de coisa ser recorrente com você e ainda ter que escutar que você tem que ser mais falante.

Se te interroper fale mas alto e em voz grave e alta: ""Me escute"", ""Deixe-me falar"" e que se dane. Eu não tenho mais saco para isso.

&gt; Por curiosidade, quais regiões tem esse costume? Nunca morei fora do estado de SP, já morei em 3 cidades diferentes e se alguém tinha esse costume, nunca reparei. O que costuma acontecer comigo é pessoas oferecendo comida ""por educação"" e levando numa boa se eu recuso; talvez porque a pessoa nem quer que eu aceite :p

That said, if you must self-learn, I would recommend getting Alfred's Adult All-in-One course and learning more into theory. The Royal Conservatory of Music has some great things, including a syllabus for piano (as well as the same syllabus for popular music) and a theory syllabus. I'll link it all below. Work through the first book until you have that material down. Also check out musictheory.net for their tutorials, as the theory can get tough very quickly. Once you have worked through those pieces, try looking at some real piano literature (e.g. Pezold: Minuet in G major) and complementing it with the scales, arpeggios, broken chords, etc. that the RCM syllabus can provide. If you are into classical music, there is a published called G. Henle Verlag that grades all of their pieces on a scale of 1 to 9 that helps a lot if needing help choosing pieces. Escalate the difficulty bit by bit. Links below!

Welcome to British politics. Our dear Prime Minister has spent 6 months not answering the question that was asked.

Where the woman prepared to call Conservatives the 'Nasty Party' went, I have no idea.

In the short term perhaps, but in the long term it will remove the Wallonia-shaped millstone from around our necks and allow us to make full use of our considerable legacy in the developing world to trade with emerging economies. Also, what trade benefits would we lose by leaving the EU's political union and remaining in the EEA? We get the best of both worlds that way, we keep our trade with the Continent but without being shackled to it, we could make our own free trade deals without drawn-out compromise with 27 other nations!

&gt;Leaving the EU means more government and more bureaucracy. We will be duplicating functions that were previously done by the EU and adding more on top.

I have to disagree here. Not only is the EU is incredibly inefficient by its very nature, Brussels also has the highest concentration of lobbyists per square mile of anywhere on Earth. Not only can we make our duplicate processes more efficient as there is no longer a need for endless bickering compromise and yards-long lists of exceptions, we can also remove an avenue for corruption. Just look at Barroso, the former Commission president holidaying on the yachts of shipping billionaires, do we really need that kind of thing in our trade policy?

&gt;Certainly it's possible to become a more liberal economy outside the EU, but most people realise that's not going to happen, perhaps you don't.

I do not share your pessimism here, the British are a pragmatic people and once we've left, the concerns of international business will trump those of Nigel Farage.

&gt;You're not voting for a more liberal Britain, that's not what most people want and thus isn't what we will get.

I voted to open up the UK to the rest of the world, my conscience is clear in that respect. The vote was simply on our EU membership, not what kind of Brexit we would have and I trust the traditionally pro-business party to act in the interests of international business (even if I don't trust May's government to do anything else).

&gt;There's a reason the Lib Dems are so pro-EU while calling themselves an internationalist party.

The Lib Dems have their ideology and I have mine. My internationalism happens to extend further east than the Urals and further south than Gibraltar though.

See here for a more detailed breakdown:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash#Impacts


&gt;Electricity
&gt;Electrical insulator flashover caused by volcanic ash contamination.

&gt;Volcanic ash can cause disruption to electric power supply systems at all levels of power generation, transformation, transmission and distribution. There are four main impacts arising from ash-contamination of apparatus used in the power delivery process:[36]

&gt;Wet deposits of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around or over the surface of an insulating material).

&gt;If the resulting short-circuit current is high enough to trip the circuit breaker then disruption of service will occur. Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (bushings) can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.

&gt;Volcanic ash can erode, pit and scour metallic apparatus, particularly moving parts such as water and wind turbines and cooling fans on transformers or thermal power plants.

&gt;The high bulk density of some ash deposits can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or the lines and structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) and there has been ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., &lt;0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.

&gt;    Controlled outages of vulnerable connection points (e.g., substations) or circuits until ash fall has subsided or for de-energised cleaning of equipment.

&gt;Land transport

&gt;Ash may disrupt transportation systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash will reduce the visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous.[23] In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings.[23] Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.[23]

&gt;Marine transport can also be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.[23]

&gt;Communications

&gt;Telecommunication and broadcast networks can be affected by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, there have been reports of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication.[34] Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.[45]

&gt;Telecommunication equipment may become damaged due to direct ash fall. Most modern equipment requires constant cooling from air conditioning units. These are susceptible to blockage by ash which reduces their cooling efficiency.[46] Heavy ash falls may cause telecommunication lines, masts, cables, aerials, antennae dishes and towers to collapse due to ash loading. Moist ash may also cause accelerated corrosion of metal components.[34]

&gt;Reports from recent eruptions suggest that the largest disruption to communication networks is overloading due to high user demand.[23] This is common of many natural disasters.

&gt;Interdependence
Interdependency of volcanic ashfall impacts from the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruptions.

&gt;Critical infrastructure and infrastructure services are vital to the functionality of modern society, to provide: medical care, policing, emergency services, and lifelines such as water, wastewater, and power and transportation links. Often critical facilities themselves are dependent on such lifelines for operability, which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from lifeline disruption.[55]

&gt;The impacts on lifelines may also be inter-dependent. The vulnerability of each lifeline may depend on: the type of hazard, the spatial density of its critical linkages, the dependency on critical linkages, susceptibility to damage and speed of service restoration, state of repair or age, and institutional characteristics or ownership.[28]

&gt;The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted the impacts of volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010.[56] Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.[35]",0,7,blablablablabla78

&gt; Eight people have been detained by police and are being questioned in connection with the attack, according to Anadolu, Turkey&amp;#039;s state-run news agency, as well as state broadcaster TRT. Earlier on Monday, the Kurdistan Worker&amp;#039;s Party, or PKK, distanced itself from the attack, which took place at the Reina nightclub during the early hours of January 1.

&gt; Footage of the attacker shooting a security guard and police officer at the entrance of the nightclub has emerged, lending credence to Turkish authorities&amp;#039; claim that he carried out the attack alone.

Also, the Great Famine in Western Europe, 1315-1322, was utterly brutal on peasant farmers on up to the nobility.

The nobles had extra padding in that they could shift from collecting rents/tithes in kind (crops) to cash, and try to buy food from far away, but even this didn't last.

And then imagine having to walk (or bike) to get your groceries - fuel  would be reserved for military/government use and essential industries, electricity would probably be rationed, too. Most likely, the cities would go completely dark at night (which would be great for astronomers).

In the 1815-aftermath, food was actually rationed and bakers, butcher etc. were forbidden (offenders faced the death penalty) to sell anything to anybody beyond what they could get on their food-stamps.

&gt; Spoon is an American indie rock band from Austin, Texas. The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer/guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno. Current members also include: Eric Harvey (keyboard, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Rob Pope (bass, backing vocals - replaced Joshua Zarbo in 2007).

&gt; After releasing their debut LP Telephono on Matador Records, the band signed with Elektra in 1998, but the contract was dropped soon after the band released A Series of Sneaks. In response the band released a two-song single titled The Agony of Laffitte (referring to Elektra A&amp;R man Ron Laffitte). Eventually they signed to Merge Records.

&gt; Spoon has been met with widespread critical acclaim. Girls Can Tell, released in 2001, sold more copies than both their previous releases combined. Kill the Moonlight accomplished the same feat a year later. Gimme Fiction was released on May 10, 2005 and continued the trend of increasing popularity for the band.

&gt; Britt Daniel wrote much of the soundtrack to the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. Four tracks by Spoon are also featured.

&gt; The band released their sixth studio album Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga on July 10, 2007; those who purchased the first pressing also received a bonus disc titled Get Nice!.

&gt; Transference is their seventh studio album. It was released on January 18, 2010 in Europe, and on January 19 in North America, to moderately positive reviews.

This is how I know you're a middle-class SJW cuck—you seem to think:

a) That Spanish itself has only existed for *a few centuries* (lol) and that the only two languages spoken in Mesoamerica were Nahuatl and Mayan. What about Totonac? Zapotec? Hokan?

b) That Mexicans are natives. [We're ethnically *mestizo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo) and our pure native tribes are considered protected peoples, much like your Native Americans (except we didn't condemn our natives to reservations.)

c) That meso-americans were not [themselves constantly oppressing each other.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_war) The oppression by the Aztec-Mexicas toward the surrounding tribes was legendary and included such things as rape, murder, and ritual sacrifice. Like another commenter said: Why should I speak Nahuatl, the language of the tribe that conquered my people?

d) That a language that unites people can somehow, abstractly, represent some historical event such that it carries a “stain” on it ([obsessed with purity much?](https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind))

e) That the Nahuatl that can be learned today is somehow identical to pre-columbian Nahuatl and that most of it hasn't been irrevocably lost.

f) That there is such a thing as an official “Mexican.” Let me clarify, cuz it seems you've never opened a single book about Mexican history: The political identity known as Mexican is a fabrication. It's a made up concept created in the 1800's and imposed by those who won the Revolutionary war when it became politically prudent to unite the population into one homogenous identity by super-imposing upon them all the history and culture of the elites from Tenotchtitlán, a small cadre of elites that most of us don't even descend from (my native ancestry is Tepehuán, from Durango, and we didn't speak Nahuatl.)

**So here's a real history lesson for you:**

Everything from the indigenous uprisings in Chiapas to the wiping out of non-Aztec culture is rooted in the need to unite the country under one flag: [The one representing the origin story of the elites from Tenochtitlán.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Mexico) 

All branches of government have a vested interest in [*massaging out* non-Tenochtitlán culture](http://istmo.mx/index.php/2013/09/25/identidad-mexicana-construida-desde-el-corazon/) and imposing things like Day of the Dead (a vague and parochial set of rituals that most of mesoamerica didn't practice until 40-50 years ago, when it began to be heavily marketed in public schools as a way of [bolstering Mexican identity.](http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/son-altares-de-muertos-tradicion-prehispanica-reconocida-por-unesco))

I could go on and on about the self-mutilation we have done to ourselves, but I can assure you, nobody is sucking Spaniard dick in Mexico anymore unless you're some backwater hillbilly. We all know that Spaniards are the “negros” of Europe ~~and have had it far worse than we have.~~ 

**EDIT:** As usual, my fellow Mexican neckbeards cried [“False!”](https://asexblogofonesown.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/false.jpg?w=288&amp;h=300) at my purposeful exaggeration here. It is typical for us Mexicans to be full of pride at [how much worse we are off—even when it's not true.](http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/01/04/mexico-vs-spain-no-contest/) That link, by the way, is a financial blog explaining how Mexico's economy has done far better than Spain's ever since the economic downturn of 2008.

And also quite popular pretty much anywhere in Europe in apartment buildings built post-WWII. There used to be a ""washing room"" in the basement, the nicer houses had a big semi-automatic washing machine, the poorer just bunch of raised tubs so you don't have to bend over all the way to wash the clothes. Women would meet usually in groups, help each other washing the big items like bed sheets and stuff. My grandma lived in such apartment building, and it was kinda nice, as a kid. It was warm, smelled nice, and the other little kids were there too and we could play with toy boats in one of the tubs. When the fully automated washing machines became popular (and in soviet-satellites also affordable..and available, because you usually had the money (there was nothing to spend the money on) but had to use a network of contacts to get a place in a waiting list for the appliance, and if you were lucky, in a year or two you could buy one. at a premium) these rooms were either not used anymore, used as a bicycle storage and such (and the farther to the east as drug dens once all bikes were stolen), or in the nicer neighborhoods people kept their washing machines in the room.

Except alternate history is not synonymous with ""make up whatever the fuck you want"".

Just like in the science fiction community how there is a strong thread of fans who desire their SF to have strong science literacy rather than throwing in meaningless technobabble, in the alternate history community there is a strong thread of fans who desire historical literacy (and accuracy) in their AH.

Those are the people you see talking about ""plausibility"" or saying that something is an ""ASB""¹.

The ""pompous pricks"" you talk about, I totally get where they're coming from. Bad, horrible, uninformed, illiterate and poorly thought out ATLs base around World War 2 are so freaking common that many AH fora on the internet have made rules about posting such ATLs that can get your post or comment deleted or even get you temp-banned if it fails to show some basic literacy with the subject.

Not that there's anything wrong with ASB stories - ""1632"" is the most well-known example that springs immediately to mind, but (and let's face it) most of us in the AH fan community are not the talented, skilled prose fiction writers we like to think of ourselves as being. So most scenarios that are called (or ""insulted"", if you wish) ASBs are the uninformed, illiterate and poorly thought out ATLs because the lack of literacy has them making jumps that are, to the more historically literate, just as implausible as the town of Grantville suddenly ending up in 17th century Europe. So they more often than not just plain shitty prose fiction. The historical illiteracy and poorly thought out scenario with most ASB stuff tends to result in stories that are not internally consistent nor internally plausible - and that is probably the cardinal rule of writing fiction that applies to all genres.

As a result ""ASB"" has become almost synonymous with shitty, unenjoyable ATLs, and that's why people, myself included, become those pompous pricks that you decry.

It actually takes a lot of imagination - in addition to the historical literacy - that is both historically plausible *and* interesting even when you are not writing character-based prose fiction about it but rather more of a wikipedia/encyclopaedia article about it that does not directly reference the way things happened OTL but only tries to give clues.

1. Why do these migrants/refugees think they can survive in Spain or Europe for that matter? Many otherwise menial processes are automated, so I don't really see them getting any jobs. Even the destination countries have their own unemployed to whom the jobs might be offered first. In light of this, what would they do for a living when they get to Europe? To make matters worse, Europe *et al* tends to favour, economically, people with higher education far more than it does people without. So, without a higher education that meets European standards, does every migrant think that he can somehow make it in Europe?

2. Why do they feel the need to cross to Europe? Apart from the language barriers, won't the cultural barriers be an even worse problem? One can at least argue that an American can survive in Scotland. Scottish English is somewhat incomprehensible, but Scots and Americans both love fighting and fried food, so they might get along a little. However, it's clear that there's a strong disjoint between European (i.e. 'Western') culture and either African or Middle Eastern culture. For one, there's Europe's attitude towards sexuality, which is markedly different from the Middle East/Africa's attitude. Europeans are probably used to girls walking around in short shorts or boys walking around shirtless, but how would someone from a more conservative part of the world even begin to react? That's just one example of a cultural disjoint and with all this, there is bound to be an inevitable culture clash. What would they make of gay people? It would be like landing on a different planet entirely. But I suppose people fleeing violence or poverty wouldn't have that as a high priority regard.

3. Continuing from #2, aren't there many countries or places where they could easily migrate to, and are much more similar in culture and stuff like that? I'm not trying to shoot down any refugees or migrants and there might be some variable I'm not seeing, but wouldn't it be better for West African refugees for example, to relocate to the safer West African countries, and for Middle Eastern/North African refugees to relocate to safer Middle Eastern/North African countries? Why would anyone take the risk of crossing hundreds of kilometers of desert, passing numerous countries, crossing a deadly ocean when there are places in proximity that are at least livable?

4. Why does everyone want to go to Europe? This might sound surprising coming from me (I tend to lean left on most issues), but if every refugee is heading to Europe, then what about the people already there? If history (and nature documentaries) has (have?) shown us anything, it's that any mass migration of that sort into a territory already populated by some other organism will lead to competition. In the case of humans, it will most likely inevitably lead to violence. The Europeans arrived in the US, but people were already there. What happened next is history. I don't know much about Europe (except the UK) but I think Europe's economy and society was constructed to support those who were already there, culture, demographics and all. Europeans tend to have fewer children, which is why their welfare systems and other systems work there. If it's suddenly overburdened by refugees, that could only mean a significant population increase along with a strain on the existing system? Keeping territory constant, an increase in population would likely cause an increase in competition within that territory. Wouldn't the cultural disjoint between the immigrants and the locals make things even worse?

The only way a large number of refugees can 'survive' in Europe is if many others like them are there. But that is problematic for the cultural reasons I mentioned. I don't have a citation for this, but I think people tend to culturally 'terraform' places they relocate to. Of course, there are exceptions (imagine a Canadian or Swedish man who dislikes gay people and is obsessed with Bible verses, etc. moving to the American South, or a Moroccan man who drinks like a fish and loves death metal moving to Germany as examples. It would more or less be an issue of like-minded people congregating) and in some cases, said 'terraforming' is more or less benign in nature (I don't see how Chinese restaurants or Jewish holidays harm anyone), but in some cases it can be disastrous, especially considering that a host culture might already be present.

IMO, it's far better in the long run for everybody if *fewer* migrants and refugees were let into Europe. My rationale is that there are people of the same ethnic persuasion *already* in the host countries (think British Indians or Chinese Swedish if that exists), and those ones for the most part aren't causing much friction with the local population because they either migrated there naturally (studied there, made friends there, got a job, married, etc.) so they would more or less be considered 'Europeans' at that point, even if honorary. However, if a large mass migrants suddenly flooded Europe and brought all aforementioned problems, it might become difficult or impractical to distinguish between the naturalised migrants and the ones who suddenly arrived there. That would mean trouble for ALL the migrants in the host country, naturalised citizen or not. It would cause a very strong backlash against ALL types of foreigners, regardless of whether they caused the problems or not.

It wouldn't even be an 'individual thing', as there must be at least one good person amongst the population no matter how cartoonishly evil it is. It would basically be 'one population versus another'. Society will be reduced from anthropology to ecology.

A internet via wifi funcionava perfeitamente, mas quando ligada no cabo ela caía várias vezes ao dia, e só voltava reiniciando o modem (quando caía no cabo, continuava funcionando no wifi, só o cabo era afetado). Eu no começo ignorava e reiniciava o modem, mas aí começou a cair nessa frequência, tipo 10 a 15 minutos.

Como o problema era sempre ""resolvido"" reiniciando o modem, o suporte nível 1 não seguia em frente, eu tive que pedir ""na marra"" para irem além e me transferiram pro suporte nível 2 onde fui muito bem atendido e a atendente fez um reset remoto do meu modem (desconfigurou até o wifi) e, a partir de então, o problema não se repetiu.

Here's the text, recovered through [Ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5lh1ik/cologne_police_defend_use_of_racial_profiling_on/dbwfkxp/):

&gt;We're seeing a shifting paradigm wherein multiculturalism in western, democratic, liberal countries is ever decreasingly assumed to be a basic principle and good. People are being faced with harsh realities in Europe and America and they can either confront them and seek to understand them or simply ignore the problems that come with mass immigration. Fewer and fewer people are satisfied to simply ignore the problems, and that's what we're seeing here, as even reddit, which is extremely left-libertarian on average, is shifting toward more conservative positions on things like immigration and profiling. It's no longer automatically racist to question immigration and to implement some profiling policies. Your confusion is justified because this is a big change. In my view, it is a natural and inevitable consequence of the very lax immigration policies that have been in place for so very long, as well as the cultural incompatibilities in many cases. In this sense, it's not necessarily a bad change, though I would caution that these sorts of movements can have the tendency to swing too far in a particular direction. This should not be seen as a justification of bigotry and racism, but a sobering up about the importance of not simply sweeping discussions about race, religion, and culture under the rug for fear of being labeled as such.

Also, would really appreciate if someone can confirm this post isn't sha/dow=bann!ed, I get the feeling linking to that site does just that.

Etruscan is one of those languages which really attracts amateurs, probably due to the whole mystique of it being 'undeciphered', a window into pre-IE Europe, etc. You can find random amateurs all around the internet, some claiming they have proof that it's IE, some that it's Finno-Ugric, some that it's related to Basque, some that it's related to Sumerian, and so on. Completely well-intentioned amateurs, but amateurs nonetheless. Mel Copeland seems to be one of these: he titles himself an 'independent researcher' and his stuff isn't published in anything peer-reviewed, that I can tell. I can't even find a review of his stuff; it's gone completely ignored by mainstream academia. Obviously, that in itself doesn't make him wrong, but he certainly should not be considered as a reliable view of the state of current scholarship; quite the opposite. I'd be very careful with his work.

As you say, the scholarly consensus is decidedly against any IE origin for Etruscan. Unfortunately, we don't have that many scholars writing things giving more general overviews on the Etruscan language, especially if we're just going to talk about things written in English. Helmut Rix, above all, though, is (was) pretty much the god of Etruscan; you might want to read his chapter on Etruscan in [The Ancient languages of Europe] (http://www.cambridge.org/il/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/european-language-and-linguistics/ancient-languages-europe?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521684958), published by Cambridge. Rex Wallace's *Zikh Rasna* is also a solid book. Bonfante's *The Etruscan Language* does leave to be desired, but it's still by far a much more reliable source than Mel Copeland. James Clackson, a very reputable scholar, also gives a nice discussion [here] (https://www.academia.edu/9537334/_Local_Languages_in_Italy_and_the_West_in_Christer_Bruun_and_Jonathan_Edmondson_The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Roman_Epigraphy_2014_Oxford_699-720), and that's not behind any paywall.",0,7,Alajarin

&gt; Peter Brötzmann (born March 6, 1941 in Remscheid, Germany) is a German free jazz saxophonist.

&gt; Brötzmann is among the most important European free jazz musicians. His rough, lyrical timbre is easily recognized on his many recordings.

&gt; He studied painting in Wuppertal and was involved with the Fluxus movement, but grew dissatisfied with art galleries and exhibitions. He has not abandoned his art training, however: Brötzmann has designed most of his own album covers. He first taught himself to play various clarinets, then saxophones; he is perhaps the only jazz musician to play the tárogató. Among his first musical partnerships was that with double bassist Peter Kowald.

&gt; For Adolphe Sax, Brötzmann's first recording, was released in 1967 and featured Kowald alongside drummer Sven-Åke Johansson.

&gt; 1968 saw the release of Machine Gun, an octet recording often listed among the most notable free jazz albums. One critic has written Machine Gun offers ""a heavy-impact sonic assault so aggressive it still knocks listeners back on their heels decades later.""

&gt; The logistical difficulties of touring with an octet resulted in Brötzmann eventually slimming the group to a trio once again, the most notable and lasting one with Han Bennink and Fred Van Hove.

&gt; In the 1980s, Brötzmann flirted with jazz fusion and noise rock in the avant-garde supergroup Last Exit.

&gt; Brötzmann has remained active, touring and recording regularly. He has released over thirty albums as a bandleader, and has appeared on dozens more, with groups such as his Die Like A Dog Quartet (with Toshinori Kondo, William Parker and Hamid Drake, being loosely inspired by saxophonist Albert Ayler, a prime influence on Brötzmann's music), Sonore (a reed trio with Ken Vandermark and Mats Gustafsson) and Full Blast (with bass guitarist Marino Pliakas and drummer Michael Wertmuller). He's also recorded or performed with many other musicians, including Cecil Taylor, Evan Parker, Han Bennink, Bill Laswell, William Parker, Willem Breuker, Ken Vandermark, Conny Bauer and Brötzmann's son, Caspar Brötzmann, a notable guitarist in his own right.

""........From what I've learned just from voat, some how syria is in the way of a having a oil pipeline being run from qatar to the EU.. So america started an artificial rebel resistance in syria to try to over-throw (regime-change) the leader of syria (Assad) in order to install a US-backed puppet in to syria so that that puppet would approve the pipeline plan.. That is why the MSM always tells you Assad is evil, because he is standing in their way for the pipeline and won't co-operate with the US..

The US does any thing possible to keep every one in the world using the dollar to trade oil/gas in (that is why it is called the petro-dollar).. I would imagine it has some thing to do with the ""federal""-reserve being able to print out infinite amounts of fiat dollar currency.. If people are trading oil in some other currency, the US can't just print any currency in the world, it can only print US dollars, so it wants every thing to remain in US dollars..

Russia doesn't really think the US's excuse to be in syria holds much water.. Russia is trying to protect its friend (syria) and trying to make sure that Assad doesn't get over-thrown.. The US is actually backing the terrorists groups in syria, in hopes that those terrorists will over-throw Assad, but at the same time the US has to be *pretending* to fight those same terrorists.. Russia eventually noticed that US is hardly fighting the terrorists in earnest, and so Russia decided to start fighting the terrorists its self, even though the US said ""No wait! Don't attack the terrorists yet! Just wait a while because we need to seperate some of the good guys out of the terrorist group before we attack them!"" (Russia did wait for a long time, but got tired of waiting and attacked the terrorists any way, which pissed the US off)..

The US keeps ratching up the pressure against Russia and now the US is threatening to impose a no-fly zone over syria.. Russia will see that as an act of war because from Russia's point of view, the US can't just come in to a country that isn't their's (syria), uninvited, and then have the audacity to declare a no-fly zone even though the US has absolutely no authority to do that in syria.. It is possible that the Russians would ignore that no-fly zone, seeing as how US doesn't have legal power to do that in syria, and might keep flying Russian aircraft around to keep fighting the terrorists, and then US might think ""We can shoot any thing down now since there is a no-fly zone now!"", then US would shoot a Russian aircraft down and Russia would declare nuclear war.. The end (of humanity)..

Any sane person would back off from instigating that much in a country that they weren't invited to and have no authority in.. Trump wants to have a strong country, but he also wants to be friends with all of the countries and just work on making great trade deals with all of the countries..  
hillary on the other hand isn't an autonomous being.. She is a complete puppet robot that is taking 100% of her actions from the commands of her lizard masters.. And her masters want nuclear war.. obama is also taking orders from those same masters, so if you want to imagine what it would be like to have hillary in office, it would be this exact same status-quo path in to decension that we have been on.. We will 100% with out a doubt be at war with Russia is hillary is elected..""







""...........................Everything that happens, happens for money. People like to think Putin is a badass, wants to conquer the world, and that is why he is in Syria. It's what you were taught. We learned Russia is evil and all about the ruling of peoples. We’re taught that America is good. We're all about liberating people from tyranny. That's why we are taking on Syria. It's why we allow Al Qaeda and ISIS to take on Assad.

The real reason is money. As always, it's just money. Russia makes its living selling Oil and Natural Gas to Europe. Americas allies in the Gulf make their living off of selling Natural Gas and Oil. Oil is cheap and easy to transport by ship, Natural Gas is not. Russian Natural Gas is therefore cheaper in Europe.

America is hell bent on helping its partners in the Gulf. One way we helped was turning Ukraine from a friend of Russia to a foe. Russia's pipeline to Europe runs through Ukraine. Rule Ukraine and you can effect the supply and cost of Russian Natural Gas. Suddenly our Gulf partners earn more.

Clinton was a major player in the Ukraine Revolution. She, with the CIA, assisted Billionaire Viktor Pinchuk of Ukraine to lay the groundwork for unrest in Ukraine and to prep a replacement government. For her help, he donated to the Clinton Foundation. The democratically elected government was overthrown.

http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2015/03/clinton%20foundation%20donations.jpgJPG

Next stop is Syria. If America can make Qatar and Saudi Natural Gas and Oil cheaper, it will pretty much destroy Russia's economy. The easiest way to do this is to 1. build a pipeline from Qatar to Europe and 2. convince the Saudis to over produce oil. Over production has worked well. Americans are happy with cheaper gas and Russia is in deep economic trouble. The pipeline however needs to run through Syria, Russia's friend.

http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/qatar-seeks-gas-pipeline-to-turkey

http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/turkey-touts-proposed-gas-pipeline-from-qatar

To accomplish this goal, the Assad Government must either agree to the Qatar pipeline or be overthrown. Assad has rejected the plan in favor of a pipeline from Iran through Syria and Cypress in to Europe. This pipeline will be developed by Gazprom of Russia. At this time, Clinton declared that Assad must go.

http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/335809bc5a4500918ff797c8a540c039

For her part, she got this:

http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/11/exclusive-persian-gulf-sheikhs-gave-bill-hillary-100-million/

So, essentially, we care about Syria not for its people, but for a pipeline. The right pipeline makes our Gulf partners richer, bankrupts Russia and deeply harms Iran. The wrong pipeline in Syria gives Russia some breathing space, give Syria some income and helps Iran compete.

Nobody cares about Syrian people dying in this conflict. It's all about the trillions to be made on Natural Gas and whether we can tank the Russia economy.

This, ""lowest common denominator"" idea that we hate Marxism, and Marxist-derived ideologies for, is also apparant under Christianity.

TIL promoting **charity** is Marxism. I guess we all ancaps now. 

&gt; Traditional European gods promoted strength, Zeus, Thor, Wodan, Mars and others. Christianity, on the other hand, follows the Marxist path. Jesus wasn't strong, but rather, forgiving. The story of Jesus is almost antithetical to the traditional stories of the Trojan wars, pagan creation stories, and others. Rather than a hero who defeats the enemies with the power of god, Jesus was killed and forgave everyone.

So apparently our goal for society should be to... kill everyone? I'm not exactly sure what you mean here. Why would a God who is a brute be worshiped instead of a God with infinite wisdom? This sound like some ooga booga ape shit. 

&gt;  Christianity goes against what was essentially, the most European empire of all time, Rome.

Ah yes, the great Roman empire. Where child sex slavery was a common practice. Clearly everything they did was morally great! 

&gt; Christianity traditionally shuns nudity. The Romans, and other European civilizations traditionally embraced it as a form of beauty. Aphrodite as the epitome of female beauty and Mars and the epitome of male beauty. Both were shown, commonly naked. Christianity is against that.

So now you're just confirming what I've know, you're not a anti-theists because you're altright, you're a anti-theist because you refuse to accept common morality. 

&gt; Not to mention the downward spiral the empire had as soon as the importance of Christianity grew. 

The Roman empire fell due to sexual liberation/degeneracy that led to far worse outcomes. You're delusional. 

&gt; everyone is equal under the eyes of god

If Christianity thinks everyone is equal, why then did Christians go against this so much, and continue to go against it more than atheists? 

&gt; Tbh Atheism fits the best with the Alt-Right as religion but when it comes to culture, Atheism lacks certain elements such as established morals that the Bible can provide easily.

That's the problem. It doesn't matter if Christianity is correct, it gives us by far the best moral code to employ onto the average man. You cannot reason most people into morality, so blindly making them believe in it is the best we can do. ",0,1,NESIRGNIK

It's especially true in France where, compared to the Germans &amp; the Brits, our history is far more intermingled with Roman's history.

It's also a bit rich to see you argue that you're some sort of direct descendant of Rome's culture when you're an American with Sicilian roots dating back to 1300 (long after the WRE fell and at a time where Sicily was ruled by a Spanish King who took the throne from... a French King), if you take a look at the history of Sicily you'll quickly realize that it's not exactly the case (it was culturally Greek even when it was under Roman control, in fact even a thousand years later the main languages of the island were Greek and Arabic).

&gt; Jagwar Ma is an Australian psychedelic/dance band formed in Sydney in 2011, consisting of members Gabriel Winterfield (lead vocalist/guitarist), Jono Ma (synths, production, guitar), and bass guitarist/vocalist Jack Freeman (joined 2012). The band name is derived from a satirical compound of the word ""jaguar"" and Jono’s surname.

&gt; In 2013 Jagwar Ma signed with record labels Mom+Pop (US) Marathon Artists (EU) and Future Classic (Australia) and released their debut album ""Howlin"". Howlin’ received high acclaim from music press like The NME, Pitchfork and the London Times as well as praise from several iconic figures and more contemporary artists Foals and The XX, who they went on to join on tour. Now based in the UK, Jagwar Ma are currently touring ""Howlin"" and have begun preparation for their Sophomore album.

&gt; Jagwar Ma are the producers of some quality electronic vibes that swim through the rough terrain of yesteryear, but warps them for modern senses. ”Come Save Me” is 60s bubblegum pop crystalized into tribal neon (much like TV Girl does) and features the vocals of Gabriel Winterfield (Ghostwood), additional production from Ewan Pearson and additional percussion from Stella Mozgawa (Warpaint). ”What Love” is a slow building trance that picks up substance along the way, but still continuing the hypnotic thump.  Keep an eye/ear out for these dudes. Read more on Last.fm.

It wasn't until later that we decided on a standardized system based on realistic units. (The metric system.) For instance, the American measurements (inches, feet, etc.) are based on body parts (foot) and god knows whatever they chose for a yard.  
When Napoleon came along, the French took over quite a bit of Europe and they introduced base10 into everything.

I have been looking at the AT-LP120, and i'm fairly certain this is what i'll be getting.

As for speakers, the main focus will be music playing from the turntable, other than that the occasional movie and other from the pc/TV
This is what i've been looking at:

* Argon Octave5A
* Audioengine A5
* Yamaha HS7. 

I read in a earlier thread, that with the first two you could get something better, around the same price. The latter seems a bit pricy, but since i've been looking at it, that should not be too big a problem. 

I was suggested NAD PP2e as pre-amp, but it doesn't seem to have any volume control, which i would like.

But I think you are just talking about in general costs on a country level, in which case that isn't necessarily true.

While the US has much higher costs than many of its European counterparts, you are mistakingly classifying the US as ""privately paid healthcare"". The fact is, the US government accounts for roughly half of all US healthcare expenditure. There are too many third parties involved in US healthcare to really consider it a private system. The mixture of private/public the US has doesn't do any side (private or public) justice. The two ways of managing healthcare are butting heads, and resulting in the one of the worst possible outcomes. We know state run healthcare is more cost effective than what we have now based on the examples of many other countries, but we don't really know how cost effective a truly more free market system would be. What proponents of a free market system support, has really never been utilized in recent history for us to see its impact. At this point the argument is pretty theoretical until someone tries it. 

The real question is, is truly state run, or truly free market healthcare, or some combination of the two that differs from what we have now the best?

I think either of the above would be better than what we have now, the problem is, each side thinks their ideal system is the best, and if they ever want to make that system a reality, it is not in their interest to budge any bit on their position, even if it means bettering healthcare compared to what it is now. This is because it will then be that much harder to gain any ground back towards their own position.

This statement needs to be unpacked a little because it is hard to draw a straight line from anything to multiple different points-- which is what you are advocating here. Post-nationalism and multiculturalism are two different things. Arguably they work in tandem when they are instituted together within a state, but they remain distinct none the less. Liberalism also does not require multiculturalism and it is therefore hard to draw a line from it. Japan, for example, is a liberal democracy but has an extremely homogeneous society.

There is certainly a compelling line of thought that maintains that post nationalism is an extension of liberalism and an evolution of the concept in the modern world (see the EU), however the jury is far from out of whether or not it is lasting implication. There is much to be said about concerns over increasing globalization without having to address liberalism in any regard-- in fact that concerns can be brought to light as a result of liberalism within a state. Kerry is simply advocating for a point of view that although popular is not exactly set in stone. I could easily use Mills to justify unity, community and identity for example, including religion, which I would argue can all exist within a liberal democracy.

I've always been fond of the idea of the polite and open-minded Canadian but I find this to be an inherently Liberal (with a capital 'L') impression of patriotism that is largely based in contrast to the United States.

Those differences affect appearance, so that it is possible to look at someone and know their ancestry comes from Sub-Saharan Africa or from Northern Europe, for example. This is what we call race. There also seem to be differences in things like average IQ between different groups.

Narrowing things down to the US, there is a group of people called ""whites"" who have predominantly European ancestry and can be largely distinguished by appearance. Some people, however, are not easily categorized as white or non-white, as would be expected due to race mixing, and because racial groups were originally a continuum. Generally this situation poses no particular problem for government policy.

The government currently uses racial distinctions for its affirmative action and non-discrimination policies. It enforces an arbitrarily defined but useful distinction between child and adult, drawing different lines for different purposes. Actually, if you think about it, drawing arbitrary but useful lines is a big part of what government does. And except for immigration, I don't really see a need for an increase in racial assessment by government.

We live in a world where entire countries can be vaporised in seconds by nuclear fire. We live in a world where people commit the most terrible acts upon one another for the simplest and most asinine of reasons. We live on a dying world with an exponentially growing population and need for resources.

In this uncertain future, we need more than ever to be united, to work together and face whatever problems come towards us. Islam has shown again and again, it cannot properly integrate in modern western society. They are right now stuck in a stage that the christian faith went through during the reformation, but with modern weaponry and sandwiched between the US and Russia while sitting on massively valuable fields of oil. In other words, it's a fucking shitstorm and neither the region or the ideology are going to calm the fuck down. 

It's not because innately evil or brown or because they're da muslim boogyman hurr durrr like you want to think I believe. It's a complex, multifaceted issue that isn't going away anytime soon. Of course they're just people. Nazis were just people. The Japanse who ripped babies from their pregnant mothers in Nanking were just people. The man who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was just a person. People are fucking terrible. 

I feel sorry for them, I really do. But we've got our own worries to deal with. And the last thing we need as a country right now is to import Islamic immigrants from Syria. Refugee camps are not astep away from concentration camps, that's fucking retarded. If they don't want to live in the refugee camps they can just go back to Syria. Our only obligation should be to provide them with refuge until they can safely return to rebuild their homes. There is no need to bring them here. The last thing we need to do right now is inject our muslim community with fresh radical blood straight from a warzone. 

Large Islamic populations cannot currently live peacefully with larger groups of people of any religion other than their own. You just need to look at India, how the Hindu and Muslim populations simply could not coexist- ultimately leading to a massive genocide and split between the two nations. 

You talk a big talk about ""being better than they think we are"" and rising above fear. The reason many want to kill us is because we don't follow Islamic law. Because we don't stone homosexuals and allow women to drive. Because we don't believe in their god or his prophet. That is why they call us infidel. There is a fundamental cultural and ideological difference, a void that will not heal until the middle east has been calm and without war for several decades at least. 

And it's great that you want to rise above fear, but no nation wants to have to rise above the fear of being shot or blown to pieces in the street. It's a great thing to talk about, rising above the fear of terrorism but it simply won't happen. It's like trying to talk someone into not being afraid of school shootings because of the low statistical chance of their kid dying. People will always be afraid of terrorism, and they will always let it affect their vote and other decisions in life because that is how people are. Trump wouldn't have been elected without ISIS and the sudden increase of terrorist attacks in europe, which coincided with their rapidly rising muslim population. 

If Trump is america's response, then what will Europe's be if the attacks continue?",0,1,CrystalMagicChamelon

The streak of issues with vendor ROMs is usually the same, you get the following symptoms:

* GPS refuses to do anything until you kill MIUI Optimization (which is bugged on the vendor ROM)
* Google may face issues with its services, such as PlayStore, updates etc
* Very notably Google Sync will often fail
* Unable to authenticate in Pokemon GO
* SafetyNet fails
* Unable to update MIUI using the Updater app from Xiaomi

All this nonsense is because these phones are sold with vendor ROMs in Europe (maybe elsewhere too, I can't say).

&gt; Dire Straits were a British rock band from Newcastle, United Kingdom,  formed in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (guitar and vocals), his brother David Knopfler (guitar), John Illsley (bass), and Pick Withers (drums), and subsequently managed by Ed Bicknell. Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late '70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band's music was offset by Knopfler's lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-'80s helped make Dire Straits' fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood - became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock &amp; rollers in the late '80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band's international success, they couldn't sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.

&gt; Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called ""Brewer's Droop"" at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing ""Sultans of Swing"" on his BBC show Honky Tonkin'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit ""Sultans of Swing"", Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.

&gt; The LP ""Dire Straits"" established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, ""Communiqué"" (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, David Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, ""Making Movies"" was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Skateaway"". Dire Straits followed the album two years later with ""Love Over Gold"", an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single ""Private Investigations"", which became a number two hit in the United Kingdom. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of ""Love Over Gold"", former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.

&gt; During 1982, Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film ""Local Hero"" and playing on Van Morrison's ""Beautiful Vision"". Apart from releasing the ""Twisting by the Pool"" EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's ""Infidels"", as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote ""Private Dancer"" for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name. 

&gt; In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album ""Alchemy: Dire Straits Live"" and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. 

&gt; Released in the summer of 1985, ""Brothers in Arms"" was Dire Straits' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for ""Money for Nothing"", a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the '80s. ""Walk of Life"" and ""So Far Away"" kept ""Brothers in Arms"" in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. 

&gt; Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins: ""Neck and Neck"" (1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, ""Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time"", became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.

&gt; In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released ""On Every Street"" in autumn 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations - it only went platinum in America but went to number one in the UK charts and most of Europe - it failed to generate a hit single in the UK.  The tour embarked on was massive but may have been a bit of a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album ""On the Night"" was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. 

&gt; Dire Straits released one last album in 1995, Live at the BBC, as a contractual album release to Vertigo Records.  That same year, Knopfler disbanded the group.

&gt; In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career. Read more on Last.fm.

1. If the EU maintains the status quo, where the member states have most of the power, an EU army could be based on [EU Battlegroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU_Battlegroup), that is, rotating battalion size forces that EU member states temporarily put under the command of a permanent EU army control structure. Each member state would be required to provide a minimum number of troops and capabilities to the EU army. EU member states would also need to have a joint military research and acquisition programs. Since the member states are the ones with all the power they would negociate how many troops to provide and what capabilities. France would probably not put it's nukes under EU army control. As for funding, since the troops are part of a member state's regular army, that member state would be responsible for the funding, so the costs would be the same. The EU army permanent comand and control structures would require extra funding, but they could get this from the EU buget, and it's should't cost that much. We would probably need to enforce a minimum % GDP spending on the military, and should restrict EU funds if the target is not met by a member country. Regarding NATO, EU member states that aren't in NATO could still participate in a EU army without having to join NATO. In case Article 5 is triggered, EU member states that are in NATO would fulfil their individual obligations. In the worst case, they would provide a lower number of troops and capabilities to the EU army and that would require non-NATO EU member states to fill the gap.

2. If the EU moves to becoming a federation, where member states would give control over foreign affairs and security matters to an EU government, that would need careful considerations. First of all, since member states would loose their power to enforce international treaties and their control of their militaries, the EU Federation (with all it's member states) would need to either join NATO, or stay out. Since most of the EU members are in NATO, a EU Federation would most likely also join NATO, but that poses a problem for the EU member states that aren't in NATO and don't want to join. When the EU Federation Constitution or Treaty is ratified, each country would have to decide if it wants to join the Federation, meaning it would implicitly join NATO, or if wants to remain in the [EEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area), or something else entirely. Each country would have to decide if the membership perks outweigh the costs. Also, in a EU Federation Constitution, there could be an article that says in case a member state leaves, and that member state had a nuclear arsenal when it entered the Federation, the nuclear arsenal is returned to that member state, provided it can protect it. In this case a EU army would be just line a normal army, although integrating all the different armies would be difficult without some sort of existing structure, that's why I believe we should do 1. first even if we never do 2.",0,5,HdFub

Lybia has one of the longest coastlines on the med at almost 1800 km.  And a lot of the craft we're talking about are quite small and can be launched off of a ramp or a beach.

&gt;Seed in some operatives as would-be immigrants, find out who they need to contact in the ports, and then send in the special forces to take them out, dead or alive.

This seems like a difficult operation.  Assets who can plausibly blend in with North African and Middle Eastern refugees are hard to come by for western intel agencies.  Even harder to come by are ones willing to risk their lives for a country that is not their home.  The Italian government can't sent Marco from Naples on this job.  He'd be caught in a second.  You would find very few people who would do this for you - and they'd be much more valuable as assets for other jobs.

&gt;Oh I never said it should be clandestine. I'd be happy if the EU was perfectly open about what they were doing.

So now your assets will _definitely_ get killed.

&gt;That's not a reason to not take action against one entryway. Just because water is leaking into a boat from two holes, and some is already in the bottom, doesn't mean you should give up on plugging one of them. This operation would, in my ideal scenario, be part of the larger work of reducing illegal immigration and deporting those already here, not the entirety of it.

It is a reason to avoid draconian and highly provocative actions.  An active bombing and spec-ops campaign in Lybia is going to have huge negative PR consequences for the states undertaking it.  Sometimes drastic and unpopular measures can be worth it if they result in big benefits.

In 1803 things were just warming up for Napoleon, who was serving as the First Consul of the Republic of France. He would become Emperor in May of the following year. France had regained La Louisiane from the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso on 1 October 1800. Napoleon had run into a small problem with the Haitian Revolution. As a result, he decided to sell off his colonial possessions in North America. He planned to use the money to invade England as a part of the War of the Third Coalition. After coming to an agreement, the United States still needed a way to pay for the deal. Even though we are commonly told in school that Louisiana was bought for “dirt cheap” this was not the case. The agreed upon price of eighty million francs was a ton of money for a newly emerging country to pay. That amount of money could not be taken out of tax revenue from the expanding nation or borrowed from American investors. The US had to go to the English and the Dutch to be able to afford the purchase. 

The John and Francis Baring Company, with the help of Hopes of Amsterdam were able to finance the deal. Twenty million francs were put down immediately by the United States government. The other sixty million francs were paid in US government bonds (something had had not yet been used in European markets). According to The Baring Archive, the bonds were payable two times per year with a six percent interest rate, and they were originally redeemable between 1819 and 1822.The banking houses later purchased the bonds from the French government for fifty-two million francs. The dealings consisted of a down payment on six million francs, followed by two million francs for a period of twenty-three months.

I hope this answers your question!

The circumstantial evidence is that Obama activly persued the so called arab spring while having to know that there is big potential from radicals profiting of it.

Very excited! Tonight I get to taste the 21 year old Lagavulin bottled in 2012, a legendary bottling which is hard to come by nowadays. A friend of mine got the chance to buy this bottle and he decided to share it with our club at cost.

I also take this opportunity to retaste the 8 year old which was released this year. I’ve tasted it once (at the distillery) and was not impressed at all (I found it too immature). But after that I’ve read a lot of good reviews for this scotch, also by people I highly regard in their tasting abilities. So after the xxxxth good review I’m starting to think something is wrong with me. That’s why I decided to give it another go. As a reference dram I’ll be using the good old 16yo.

To top things off, I’ll also throw in a bottling for the Friends of the Classic Malt, a 12 year old which was bottled in 2008.

**Lagavulin 16 years old**
Bottled: ~2016
ABV: 43%

Nose:
Earth, warehouse, dirt, raw peat, smoldering fire. A bit of leather and some spices: cayenne pepper and nutmeg. 

Taste:
Warming. Some sherry influences detectable in the spices. Keeps having that earthy tone. Some smoked bacon in there as well. Quite timid peat.

Finish:
Long, earthy tones.

Comments:
This was the first whisky I truly loved. Still the love is there. Such a well balanced characterful dram. Only downside is that it maybe lacks a bit of body.

85/100

**Lagavulin 8 years old (200th anniversary)**
Bottled: 2016
ABV: 48%

Nose:
Immature. Spirit driven. Lavender, floral. Some baby vomit in there. Youngish peat. Yeah, I was right the first time…

Taste:
First thought: gasoline? A bit bitter. Still that spirity floral notes. Feels young. Peat certainly more present than with the 16.

Finish:
Quite long. A mixture of floral notes and peat.

Comments:
Nope. I simply don’t like this one. I find that there are too many off notes of the spirit still in there, which gives it an unfinished feel to it. Simply not my kind of whisky. (But still, it is not a bad dram, just not as good as I am used to with Lagavulin)

78/100

**Lagavulin 1995 Friends of the Classic Malt**
Distilled: 1995
Bottled: 10-6-2008
Age: 12 years
ABV: 48%
Casks: European First Fill Sherry Oak Casks

Nose:
Ooh! This is nice! Lots of sherry influences, mostly nuts (sweet almonds) and some winter spices (aniseed?). Quite dry. The warming sherry spices integrate beautifully with the distinctive Laga peat. I say distinctive, but actually this peat has a more burned/smoky feel than Lagavulin normally expresses, makes me think of a fireplace that just went out.

Taste:
 A really dry mouth. Sucks the saliva right out your mouth. More spices (cinnamon?) emerge, again with the burned peat. And, I must say, something that really reminds me of sulpher. Makes the taste quite bitter. That’s a bit of a let down.

Finish:
Long, warm and dry.

Comments:
A great sherried Lagavulin. Something that you don’t come by too often. The only downside is that the taste is perhaps a bit too bitter.

89/100


**Lagavulin 21 years old (2012)**
Distilled: 1991
Bottled: 2012
Age: 21 years
ABV: 52%
Casks: 1st Fill Ex-Sherry European Oak Casks

Nose:
Sweet, sweet sherry. Dried fruits, nutmeg, cloves. All this sherry sweetness lies on an earthy bed of smoked ham (&lt;- I think I just described this amazing nose in one sentence). A powerful older Lagavulin profile shines as much as it can.

Taste:
Bacon, smoked ham, peatsmoke, dirt. That were the first flavours that attack the mouth. Only after that the dried fruit and sherry tones make themselves present. And how! One big taste-explosion in the mouth!

Finish:
Long, dark, beautiful. Just stunning.

Comments:
This is one of those drams you won’t easily forget. Lagavulin at its best. That combination of mature spirit, well balanced sherry and earthy peat is a sheer unbeatable combination. Hats off to this dram.

""There is certainly no such support for a genetic interpretation...It is sometimes suggested that the Black/White differential in psychometric intelligence is partly due to genetic differences (Jensen, 1972). There is not much direct evidence on this point, but what little there is fails to support the genetic hypothesis.""

However, the APA does concede that no one knows for certain the cause of the gap.

As other have pointed out stereotype threat is a factor. Also, studies show that black kids with high European ancestry aren't better at cognitive tasks and IQ tests than black people with low European ancestry (Moore 1986).

* r/AskEurope is more left-leaning and more pro-EU than the average population. There are a few more right-wing comments every now and then, but they get down-voted and the posters seem to give up after a while. 

* Compared to r/AskAnAmerican , r/AskEurope is younger on average. I think it shows in the comments, the opinions and the actual content that people here a mostly &lt;35, while in r/AskAnAmerican I often read comments by older people with longer careers, families, or whatever comes in your 30s, 40s, etc. 

* I guess you could say people here are more ""internationally oriented"" than the average European. Many people in Austria, Germany and I'm assuming other countries use social media in their own language. Coming here, communicating in English on a worldwide site may be a statement in itself. 

* More critical of US than average. This part I still haven't quite figured out yet. It seems like there's above average criticism of the US here, but that *may* only be a weird reddit-dynamic where mutual trolling or inconsiderate comments lead to a kind of distrust over time. Anyway, I've never seen a European treat an American badly IRL so I don't know why fights seem to be more common on reddit. 

* More educated`? Not sure if true, but in our country sub, I think there are more people with higher education than the avg. Austrian. Maybe the fact that most people here speak nearly flawless English means they are more educated than Johann/Janos/Jose/Jan Average. ",0,33,Turtle456

Previously the proxy country changed quite often while on the bridge mode. But now its stuck onto this one country like forever. Maybe its an update to TOR browser ( I did update the whole bundle recently and started afresh) thats causing this static proxy, I dunno.  

So considering that they dont get blocked, how often do I change them?

Donc 1 commissaire français sur 28 en admettant qu'il défende les intérêts nationaux...ça nous fait une belle jambe.

&gt; Mais en même temps cela a permis au européen de l'est de s'enrichir.

Ça a surtout permis aux entreprises et à leurs actionnaires d'empocher la différence.

&gt; cependant les écarts de salaires peuvent tout de même aller du simple au double.

https://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/salaires-medians-europe.jpg

&gt; Cependant l'injustice va dans les deux sens. En même temps que les travailleurs occidentaux sont concurrencé par des salaires faibles. , le patrimoine industriel oriental subit la puissance industrielle occidentale. En effet l'ouverture des marché pose un problème de concurrence entre des industries naissante et les mastodontes occidentaux.

Ben non figure toi, parce que les pays qui réussissent n'ont pas accepté la pleine et totale liberté de mouvements de capitaux imposée par l'article 63 du Traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne. S'ils veulent faire du protectionnisme, s'opposer souverainement à une OPA, ils le peuvent. Pas nous. Les ouvertures sont asymétriques.

&gt; l'ouverture du marché du travail permet au travailleur d’Europe du sud et de l'est de trouvé de meilleur opportunité et de meilleur salaire.

Et au travailleur français de se retrouver à pôle emploi, s'il ne s'agit pas d'un agriculteur, [dans quel cas il a plus de chance de se suicider](http://www.ouest-france.fr/economie/agriculture/crise-agricole/crise-agricole-les-appels-au-numero-decoute-sur-le-suicide-en-hausse-4039479)

&gt; C'est pourquoi j'estime que dans 15-20 ans il y aura un alignement des salaires et des normes européens.

Si les populations ne se révoltent pas. On devrait avoir le Brexit dans quelques mois, [l'Allemagne est en train de lancer des ballons d'essai d'une sortie de l'euro](https://www.upr.fr/actualite/crepuscule-de-leuro-targets-degel-de-pensee-vincent-brousseau), et l'UPR se développe bien.

2) Pretty much we all have diesel since it's cheaper.  
3) There is no need to pay for road taxes, everything is taken care of when you pay insurance, before insuring your car you will however need to take it for a technical test in the authorised shops. This will costnyou an additional 60-70€. So simply go and have a talk at a local insurance company I'm pretty sure you'll easily find people who speak English at their office, they'll guide you where to do the car testing.  
4) The plate part is not important at all as you can travel everywhere around Kosovo, whether you  have the 01 plates for Prishtina but live in Prizren is not important  
5) Can't really answer this for sure.    
6) Yeah that's common I'd say although most locals would also take it to a mechanic for an inspection but that might be a bit hard for you   
7) Let's assume you have found your car and now in order for it become yours you and the owner need to go to the local notary's office and sign  a contract there. This is the only thing you need to do as there's no need to contact other institutions, this is what makes it official and makes you the owner. There should be plenty of notary offices in bigger cities such as Prishtina and Prizren and finding them will be easy. The notary office will obviously charge you for their services (anywhere between 10-30€ I'd say). Make sure you
 send the money to the previous owner via the bank and save the purchase just as a precaution.  
8) No, our insurance isn't valid in the EU because the insurance companies are ripping millions of euros out  of our diaspora every time they come to to Kosovo, so why bother?  And yes, it is valid for the neighboring countries.   
EDIT:. 
just noticed that scardian.com has an option charges an extra 20€ for validility of your insurance in EU countries  
9) Everytime you cross the Serbian border you will be provided with alternative plates by the Serbian border police, so you keep the plates Serbia gave you while you're in Serbia and you can put the RKS back on once you've exited Serbia.
