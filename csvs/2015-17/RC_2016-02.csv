If you've ever played a sport, there'll be people you play with that you want to be as good as. It doesn't matter if you're never as good as someone, just matters if you're improving or not. 

I think that's what makes Europe so successful in the past. A policy can be implemented in one part of Europe and if it's successful it will be implemented by neighbors, if it's bad you can tell it's bad by comparing to other countries. 

I'm no socialist, but i'm guessing you are so i'll use an example of basic income. Basic income is a big change. And a big risk if it doesn't work out well. Wouldn't it be better to have it tested in a small country that's more socialist and more willing to make it work than to force it on all of Europe, including areas that would be dead set against it?

Our league games are against AVL and SUN, and as it stands now we have a weeks rest between the Europe League games with the return leg fortunately being at home.  If we beat West Ham we can send out the youngsters against Blackburn and then with City we'll be more in less in the same position physically once the league game rolls around after the final.  

My biggest concern at the moment is away to a very well rested Leicester side that has everything to play for now.

If you mean how colorism came about at all, I don't know that it's an either/or situation. Skin color is just an adaptation to environmental conditions. How different groups reacted to differences in melanin probably had to do with the interaction of a whole group of factors.

Some colorism emerged with colonialism and slavery (whites placing themselves at the top of a hierarchy that placed darker skinned black slaves at the bottom, people in between being given marginally more status than darker slaves, etc). 

Colorism also developed in some agrarian communities as a mark of social status (people who worked the fields were likely to be darker, so lighter people were assumed to have less reason to be outside, therefore not peasants/farmers/serfs/whatever).

I'm an American (you as well I presume?), so I think I understand where you're coming from. Something I noticed growing up was that there seems to be a varied, but overall generalized taboo in broader American culture regarding the overt celebration of sexuality in public. This is paradoxical of course because we'll have magazines that sell millions of copies through the creation of unrealistic expectations for one's body/relationship (i.e. photoshop everywhere, pages of shit one-liner dating advice, etc.). 

But then as soon as a realistic portrayal of sexuality/human physique, or the celebration of the human body is expressed in other facets, people seem to go batshit crazy (not referring to you per say &lt;3) thinking it must be or is somehow an insult or a negative. 

As I explored and visited other cultures and countries, I quickly found that many others do not hold this taboo to nearly the same degree, or at all in some places. For example, nude beaches in parts of Europe, completely exposed chests/genitals in tribes in parts of Africa, or attitudes towards prostitution across the world. The converse being places that are less sexually expressive like in the Middle East, but we already know here the reason being religious belief. Even within our own culture, if the women didn't want themselves to be seen like that, or if they were uncomfortable with it, they have plenty of choice to dress differently.

http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/short-courses/languages/courses/portuguese/level-1

Or in a languages school.

http://inlingua-edinburgh.co.uk/foreign-languages/portuguese/

In any case below are a few resources I noted down as I recommended them in other situations. Hope at least some of these may suit you. Cheers!

---

**Audio Courses**

Michel Thomas uses European Portuguese.

http://www.michelthomas.com/learn-portuguese.php

The focus is spoken language, and I really like their teaching methods. Note the very first lesson uses a beep to remind you to pause and answer questions yourself. It is annoying in my opinion, but they stop doing it after the first lesson.


---

**Written Courses**

The orthography of Portuguese changed recently (the so called AO90 orthographic agreement). So you should make sure written material complies with the new system.

This is the section of Portuguese for Foreigners in Wook, a really nice online bookstore in Portugal.

http://m.wook.pt/home/index?restricts=8066x5839x18010x18163

This one makes it explicit that it follows the new orthographic agreement so it's a very safe bet.

http://wook.pt/ficha?id=11352870

These also follow the orthographic agreement. Learning book plus exercises. Looks quite nice.

http://wook.pt/ficha?id=196038
http://wook.pt/ficha?id=222484



The FNAC bookstore in Portugal also has quite a few. This collection seems pretty good. They comply with the new orthography. Made at the university of Lisbon. 

http://www.fnac.pt/Aprender-Portugues-1-Nivel-A1-A2-Manual-do-Aluno-Varios/a620488

http://www.fnac.pt/Aprender-Portugues-1-Nivel-A1-A2-Caderno-de-Exercicios-Varios/a623474

Those are the level 1 learning and exercise books. You can find the reminder on the website. Look for the ones with similar covers:

**Online courses**

The 'Practise Portuguese' site teaches European Portuguese.

https://www.practiceportuguese.com/

---

**Online lessons**

The 'Portuguese with Carla' online lessons site seems quite professional. 

http://www.portuguesewithcarla.com/

There is also of course italki.

https://www.italki.com/

---

**Language Exchange**

Hellotalk has a good reputation.


http://www.hellotalk.com/       
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hellotalk


---

**Games**

'Memrise' has European Portuguese flashcards. Note Memrise is also available as a mobile app.

http://www.memrise.com/courses/english/portuguese-european/



https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion


'Learn Portuguese - 6000 words' has flashcards and more.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion

---

**Reading Material**

The op-ed by Lucy Pepper in the online news site Observador, always each piece in both Portuguese and English (she's originally British, living in Portugal for 25 years).

http://observador.pt/opiniao/autor/lucy/

The Portuguese version always comes first. Scroll down for the English text.

---

**Portuguese TV and radio**

There is RTP Play. It includes all the RTP (public television) TV channels and radio. Both live and on demand.

http://www.rtp.pt/play/      

There are apps available.

In Europe, similar trends in distilled drinks popped up in the 17th century but ended significantly quicker, but in Europe this didn't happen until, just like in Europe, the alcohol-making industry consolidated and thus caused the withering away of local brewing. Forgive me if I made it seem like women didn't participate, it's that their participation was decidedly for the majority of this time on unequal grounds and female drinking was seen significantly differently than males on the whole, with different levels of tolerance during different periods.",,False,t1_czj1n96,,2,t5_2ssp3,False,1454288515,0,1458209361,

That 2nd part is really interesting, and I would not have guessed either of those things. I can admit that I was ignorant about the actual statistics behind this, so that's interesting. Although this is anecdotal, this is something I have observed:

It seems easier to raise venture capital in the United States and get something going. There seem to be more people and organisations willing and wanting to make that happen. In Europe, the start-up situation is more negative and slow. 

That's just my experience though. Perhaps people are more likely to quit everything and become artisanal jam makers or bee keepers in Europe, but are more like to create an actual ""start-up"" in the US? I dunno. ",NETH,False,t1_czj53pf,,1,t5_2qh4j,False,1454288642,0,1458209396,The Netherlands

* The size of the earth was KNOWN at this point. One of you has the excuse of Columbus's brother and his ignorance of that fact, but a ""spice route west"" was KNOWN to be unavailable due to the sheer size the ocean would be were it not for the Americas.

* Nobody cared about the new world until Spain started hauling fleetloads of gold into europe, and even then, a century passed of pirating, simple explorers, and no major efforts before the French and English decided to attempt something. Without the gold input, nobody should have any interest.

* Places like Scotland should not have the resources to put together major colonial expeditions anyways. Historically they put everything they could into a single one and it failed spectacularly. The only reason Spain and Portugal got the head start was a very long period of peace following the reconquista. Granted, all the other major powers have gone the route of ""let's forget all our past hatred and be buddies"" but still.

In the US it's great because we're offered so much less PTO than European countries. At all previous jobs I was given ~10-15 days of PTO a year that would accrue per two weeks.

Ilostmynewunicorn,1,portugal,czj8tbw,0,t3_43kexz,"As pessoas usam humor para lidar com uma má situação. Sempre foi assim, e ainda bem. Faz com que as pessoas se sintam mais calmas e com que ajam com naturalidade.


No caso do tabaco, as imagens têm um impacto diferente porque há uma estratégia e um bem-estar inerente. Deixa de fumar, e isto não te acontece. No teu caso essa estratégia e bem-estar não existem. Tu só estás a tirar as pessoas a sua base de comforto, sem motivo nenhum, sem justificação, sem nada. Percebes? 


Facto #1: O humor ajuda a lidar com situações deste género.


Facto #2: Os terroristas têm como objectivo espalhar o medo numa nação para que se ajoelhem perante deles.


Facto #3: Todo o teu argumento consiste em dizer ""Parem de se armar em engraçadinhos e levem isto a sério"", como isso só em si fosse ajudar alguém. Na verdade, se as pessoas levassem isto tão a sério como tu estás a dizer, havia uma desordem pública, um stress generalizado, tudo por causa duma ameaça inexistente. Mesmo que argumentes que a ameaça é real, não justifica este stress. Se houver um incêncio, qual é a regra nº1 de emergência? ""Entrem em pânico e comecem aos gritos e a saltar das janelas""?


Ou seja, não ajuda. Só faz com que as pessoas vivam a medo, que é exactamente o trabalho de um terrorista. O humor é uma arma contra o terrorismo, porque une a nação, e mostra que não são ameaças vãs que nos abalam. E mesmo que haja um atentado, o humor pós-atentado é das coisas que mais causa frustação nos terroristas, porque mostra exactamente que não nos deitaram abaixo.


Percebes onde quero chegar? É que desde o teu primeiro comentário que eu acho que neste preciso momento estou a falar com um terrorista. Podes não ter acesso a armas, podes não fazer parte da ISIS, mas não estás a agir como cidadão normal e consciente.

Thatzionoverthere,7,history,czj8w82,0,t3_43jdy7,"Weird. I don't know where you got this theory from but it's completely incorrect. For one it holds a blaring misconception. The Canaanites were not known as the Phoenicians, the Phoenicians were Canaanites, like the Israelite were Canaanites. With the canaanites being the original cultural identity the various tribes like the edomites, israelites, jebusites, moabites all split off from.

We know the Phoenicians were closely related to the later Hebrew civilization due to the fact ancient Phoenician and ancient Hebrew were mutually intelligible to eachother. So yes the pheonicians were a semitic people. 

The sea people you mention is in reference to the philistines, not the Phoenicians, while the Phoenicians did create a maritime empire, were the first to circum navigate africa and did establish the later carthaginian empire along with a number of coastal merchant cities in north africa. The sea people primarily refers to the greek invaders that came later into canaan. 


Furthermore DNA has already shown the closest related population to the Minoans are Europeans. If they were the founders of Canaan the closest genetic population would be in the Levant.

divorceadvicepls,1,offmychest,czj8zut,0,t3_43bbrr,"Thank you for responding.  I love Reddit, where you can always find a sympathetic ear.  My therapist has this idea that you have to be able to tell your story to three different people to help process things, so thanks for taking the time.  And getting things out on here helps get through the day without being the person who always complains about her divorce . . .

I do try to be as detached as possible in my communication with him.  After sleeping on it last night, I wrote back this afternoon restating my position that I was unwilling and unable to voluntarily lower support payments.  I tried not to be accusatory, but I explained that the fact that he won't be able to afford his big house in the nice neighborhood, and continue to fly to Europe every two months, if he has to pay the same support really isn't my problem.  

There was one comment in his letter that my mind keeps being drawn back to.  It's a [long story](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3tiew8/my_44f_exhusband_46m_wants_to_visit_with_our_kids/cx6gkok), but he's supposed to have the kids 25% of the time (every-other-weekend, plus 1/2 school breaks), but 50% due to him being an ass, 50% the kids being stubborn, he's only had them overnight 8 times since he moved out July 2014.  At this point the kids are barely tolerating seeing him for a few hours on his weekends.

So the comment that is not sitting well with me is that part of his money trouble is having to pay for dinner with the kids.  At this point, he takes them for dinner every Wednesday and then for lunch every other Saturday.  He provides 6-7 meals per month.  I don't understand why he doesn't see how clueless it is to complain to *me* about that.  Does he not realize that I'm the one picking up the slack?  Heck, this is supposed to have been his weekend, but he texted the kids a photo earlier this afternoon from a NYC airport; he's already in Spain by now.  Antics like that just annoy the kids, but when they complain he says they are just jealous he's with someone new.  Give me a break.

I've sent a letter to my lawyer explaining the situation.  She's said before not to worry, that he has enough assets that he'll be expected to pay even if he loses his job, but I want to get an idea of what to expect.  If she thinks a judge would lower the payment, I don't want to spoil what little goodwill we've built up by standing my ground.  And I should think he'd have to wait until he's actually been unemployed for a few months before he can request a reduction, so there's probably no use being upset about it now.

Thank you again for your kind words of support.

And, no need to apologize for 'proper prick'; he's been called far worse ;)

France germany and england, three of main european groups involved in the crusades arent invloved in any muslim conflicts at this point. also the cordoba one is sketchy, id need to see the demographics of cordoba at the time. itf half the population was killed in muslim spains most prominent city by muslims, its a good chance many muslims were killed too. 

but what it really looks like what your missing here is that there was absolutley no concentrated effort by the muslims before the crusades to invade europe. they were in disarray due to the weakening power of the abbassid caliphate. the christians were fighting off warlords or provincial governors around the medditerranean, striking the seljuks in the holy wont stop raids off the coast of italy. im not saying the crusades were some ""big mean white males abusing the innocent muslims"" but it definitely wasnt ""holy men standing up for civilization against heathen invaders"" either",,False,t1_czj7yor,,1,t5_2qh13,False,1454293243,0,1458210682,

F0rFr33,1,archeage,czj9g9u,0,t3_43iivv,"Personally I believe **Battlerage** and **Auramancy** are too good right now.  
Battlerage offers:  
  
* Damage  
* Tankyness  
* CC  
* Skillshot Mobility  
* Target Mobility  
* Anti-CC  
* Reset on the above    

The only downsides of this class are:  
  
* Close Range (Tankyness reduces the importance of this downside)  
* No Heal (can be skilled as 2/3rd set in Songcraft/Vitalism/Defense) not counting pots.  

On top of this there is a TON of gear for melee classes, whether in Plate or Leather, Agility/Str, Str/Sta or even pure Str.  
The weapons (like SS/Katana) are also too good since they allow for huge flexibility of classes while still being BiS.  

Auramancy offers:  
  
* Mobility  
* Damage  
* Reduced Damage  
* CC  
* Anti-CC  
  
Downside:  
  
* No heal  
  
This class is also mostly gear-independent, meaning any class can use it to almost its fullest.  
  
**Worst** class is clearly **Archery**, in my opinion.  
Advantages:  
  
* Long range  
* Good PvE - specially for bosses  

Downsides:  
  
* Low damage  
* High number of skill points required  
* Synergy/other classes dependent  
* ""0"" Mobility - 8% Movement speed is not relevant when Battlerage has +40%,  
* Low range - When compared to other classes
* High mana costs  
* Low/No CC  
* No Anti-CC  
    
This class also has a low amount of options when it comes to gear, being between Crafted (Gale/Squall), Obsidian or Auroria. Almost no gear can be found for this class in dungeons.
  
I would also like if there was a Tank Archer for Arena, seems to be the only class that doesn't have it.  

I believe Trion needs to step in and make Balance themselves rather than just being ""OK"" with whatever changes XL makes. Merv talked about this last Live Stream and he said that XL has a team for balancing and so he doesn't want to touch any of the changes, partly because he doesn't want to be responsible for making any class OP, but the truth is the game in EU/NA isn't the same as in KR. Combat Mechanics (SkillQueue...) and in Class choices are very different, while in EU/NA there is a majority of Battlerage/Defense/Auramancy and many times combinations of the same, KR they have a very high number of Sorcery (if I recall correctly), it's perfectly normal that KR doesn't feel like Battlerage is OP on a Mage dominating zone, but in a Archer/Battlerage zone this game is very unbalanced.

shas_o_kais,1,news,czj9ya3,0,t3_43j7pr,"Yeah some people would be bad regardless of religion. But religion causes many to have hatred and prejudice in their hearts because of the very strong beliefs their own religion espouses. Do you really think that a world-wide jihad would exists if Muslims were far more secular? Or if Islam didnt exist? There are movements that have raised the black flag of jihad from North America, to Europe, throughout north africa, Pakistan, India, all the way to the Philipines.

And yes, any ideology has the potential to be evil. The difference is that religions are a particularly vile subset of ideologies because they are propped up by holy writ, which are uneffected by logical argument. The tenets of Nazism, Communism, fascism, and various other malignant yet secular ideologies were defeated because they didnt have that luxury. Sure, neo-nazis exist, and modern day hippies won't shut the fuck up about how totally awesome communism will be, but they are a small minority with no real clout and many change their beliefs as they grow older.

Religion's grasp is much stronger and much harder to uproot because it works on the basis of faith, which connot be logically argued against. I used Scientology as an example of a growing religion that deludes people into joining it despite mounting evidence that not only is it a pyramid scheme but a dangerous cult whose members have taken part in kidnapping, intimidation, and and by some circumstantial evidence possibly murder.

Where do arguments against evolution come from if not a religous origin? Arguments against sex education? Arguments against homosexuality? Prohibition against alcohol? 

And even if you try and rationalize all of that away, you're still left with the fact that religion preaches falshood and offers an unscientific view of the world. Whether Allah or Vishnu or some dying giant had a hand in creating the universe, it's all fucking nonsense.

Youre completely right that it will be impossible to keep Ukraine in one piece with the Russian rebels having lost their homes and friends to this bloody war and the Fascists in Kiev, who want to eliminate all Russians plus all the people that have of course died on the Side of the Regime as well.

What interests me though is the question about when and how this conflict will be resolved most likely? I think that the only way to accomplish some kind of peace would be too split Ukraine along ethnic borders, but I doubt that the US and EU would let go so easily, even though Russia would probably be okay with such a solution. Will it end when there has been enough blood spilled on all sides that no one is able to fight anymore, the eastern regions being completely devastated by the war? Or maybe Russia intervening more aggressively than they do now, although I consider that unlikely.

The other likley option I can think off is Europe getting so overstrained with their inner conflicts in the face of the Refugee flood from the Middle East and Central Asia that more and more countries will stop hurting their own economy because of US interests and lift the sanctions and maybe strenghten their bonds with Russia.

The other guy estimated somewhere below 100 miles for the actual SW fights. I am rounding up for convenience sake. 

&gt;While I do agree with that as being an engagement range for any interstellar fight, they never do fight at that sort of range, (at least in the films).

Also a major issue is that none of the Canon turbolasers / blasters / missiles / torpedoes shoot at FTL or relativistic speeds, while ST Impulse drives are roughly 1/4 c, and ST weapons are either near instantaneous FTL or fractional relatavistic speeds.

The speed of weapons is a major problem for SW weapons systems. They aren't fast enough to catch up to their own enemies, let alone ST ships. Again, I see why SW capitals can't defend against fighters. The nature of their sensor and weapons systems make them lag behind their targets. 

Their capital ships effectively don't move, but ST ships? They constantly manuever. . . and far faster than SW weapons guidances / speed can keep up with.

Personally I would absolutely lean towards the car with highway miles, less wear on brakes, suspension components and gearbox as well as less hill starts, and stop and go conditions to cause clutch wear. 

Also, the car with higher highway miles should also have its major service intervals looked after already due to its mileage (timing belt/water pump/ etc service interval likely being around 120k km).

* Scandinavia’s progressive tax systems fail to protect their citizens from staggering personal debt.

* The electoral success of moderate and conservative parties throughout Scandinavia is at once a rejection of progressive policies and an endorsement of free markets.

* Many leftists extol the limited successes of Sweden and Finland without ever acknowledging Switzerland.

Switzerland, a VERY CAPITALIST country outperforms much of Europe in various economic and social metrics. Switzerland boasts many of the advantages that socialist Scandinavian states are supposed to claim exclusively. 

Switzerland’s unemployment rate is just 4.5 percent, which is one of the lowest rates in the world. The country’s poverty rate is similarly low. Those who immigrate to Switzerland have an average employment rate of 76 percent, which is much higher than the European average of 62 percent.

Furthermore, the Swiss educational system is ranked third in the world by the OECD. Only S. Korea (Democracy &amp; capitalist country literally created by America) and Japan (Another Democracy &amp; capitalist country literally created by America) are ranked higher, which means Switzerland’s educational system is the best in the Western world. Many claim this distinction belongs to Finland, but Finnish schools are in fact ranked 10/37 in math and 4/37 in reading.

Additionally, income inequality and debt are both quite low in Switzerland. This reality persists although Switzerland’s wealthy have the lowest tax burden in the world; the richest decile in the country pays only 20.9 percent of the country’s taxes. Remarkably, even though the tax burden on the wealthy is minimal, Switzerland’s national debt as a percentage of its gross domestic product is lower than Finland’s, Sweden’s, and Denmark’s.

On a side note, when Sweden created a HEAVY progressive tax like Sanders is talking about doing, Sweden (Socialist want to be country) went from the 4th richest in the world to the 25th in only 20 years roughly. The government recognized the cause of the trouble and instituted several capitalist reforms to resuscitate Sweden’s economy. 

According to The Economist, following the success of Sweden’s relatively right-leaning Moderate party, “Swedish GDP is growing strongly, and unemployment is falling. The budget is heading into surplus next year.” The article notes that many Swedes support moderate and right-wing reforms: “The centre-right has made welfare payments less generous, cut taxes for the lower-paid and trimmed the numbers on sickness benefit.""

An example from my home region, [here's a 20 second video of some people from my home city of liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2bDuRP9B3I), and [here's a slightly longer video of a cultural event about 50 miles away in north Wales](https://youtu.be/L26WYBuVL0k?t=21). Due to long standing cultural divides between England and Wales despite these two areas being right next to each other they have radically different languages and culture (notice the massive horn and all the bards wearing gowns). If I go slightly further in the opposite direction into the rural north of England you get dialects like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_TXGdWcVhI), where they still use thee and thou in everyday speech, as well as having a huge vocabulary of viking terminology.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a *trade* organisation, and exists for the promotion of its members - paediatric doctors. It is not, and never will be, a *patient* advocacy group.

The AAP members make millions of dollars from circumcision infant baby boys, and millions more from selling the amputated foreskins for medical research and cosmetics:

http://www.foreskin.org/f4sale.htm

And even more money fixing ""botched"" circumcisions — which can be 20% of their income! See below.

*“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”*

― Upton Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked

Many other sane pediatric association from around the world has declared the AAP's stance to be against all sane, rational analysis.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf+html

The British Medical Journal also published an extensive critique:

http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2013/03/19/journal-of-medical-ethics-special-issue-on-circumcision/?q=w_jme_blog_sidetab

Also the Journal of Medical Ethics:

http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/18/medethics-2013-101346.abstract

The Danish Society of Family Physicians has even declared male ""circumcision"" to be genital mutilation. Other countries in Europe will soon follow:

*“The National Board of Health has sent Guidelines Regarding Circumcision of Boys into hearing. DSAM (Danish Society of Family Physicians) has debated the issue and agreed that circumcision may only be performed when medical indication is present. Circumcision in the absence of a medical indication is mutilation.”*

Plus, the circumcision policy committee of the APP had many members with a conflict of interest, not least because of their religious belief in the requirement by their God to have their sons' penises mutilated as a sign of their devotion and love.

These people are terrified that the general public is going to get wise to this child-abuse and ban it.

Dr. Andrew Freedman was one of the members of the committee, and was asked:

*""Do you have a son and, if so, did you have him circumcised?""*

""Yes, I do. I circumcised him myself on my parents’ kitchen table on the eighth day of his life. But I did it for religious, not medical reasons. I did it because I had 3,000 years of ancestors looking over my shoulder.""

http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/new-york-minute/fleshing-out-change-circumcision

So he didn't have 100 million years of human evolution and Charles Darwin looking over his shoulder then? *Every* male mammal in the animal kingdom is born with a foreskin, so it evolved for *reasons*.

Not only that, Dr. Andrew Freedman makes 20% of his income from treating circumcisions that have gone wrong! (But note that *every* circumcision is a botch job). So he makes $500 a pop for circumcising boys, and then more $$$$ for fixing the problems!

*""As a practicing pediatric urologist, 20% of the patients I will see today are here because of something related to their circumcision.""*

http://www.amednews.com/article/20120903/health/309039955/4/

Here is the AAP policy statement. Can you please point me to the section where there task force members state their ""conflicts of interest""? (Hint: you won't find it because it doesn't exist):

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1989.full.pdf+html

Note that as three of the task force members were women; and the rest men all born before 1980, there is a very high degree of certainty that none of them possess a male foreskin.

In addition, at least four of them subscribe to a set of theological beliefs that require them to mutilate the genitals of their infant sons. And one of whom (as detailed previously) did so on his kitchen table. Not only is this in violation of the AAP’s code of bioethics prohibiting physicians from conducting surgery on family members (let alone in non-sterile environments), it also provides additional evidence of a pro-circumcision bias among the hand-picked task force members.

These people will mutilate your penis just because they think it pleases their sky-god. Forget about ""medical benefits"".

And recently, Steven Svoboda, a Harvard educated lawyer who runs ""Attorneys for the rights of the child"", debated two of the AAPs ""Taskforce on Circumcision"" members: Michael Brady, M.D. and Douglas Diekema, M.D.:

*""Asked if people present could explain the functions of the foreskin Brady said, “I don't think anybody knows the functions of the foreskin,” then reiterated, in nearly identical words, “Nobody knows the functions of the foreskin.” I noted that there was not a word about the functions of the foreskin in the 2012 AAP report, and asked, shouldn't we know something about the functions of the healthy body part that is being removed?""*

Tellingly, the AAP pamphlet ""Care of the Uncircumcised Penis"", used to contain this information:

*""The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis, and meatal stenosis. Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life"".*

But this was deleted in the 1996 reprint, and despite numerous letters to the editors, no explanation was ever given as to why it was removed. Of course the reason is obvious: they want to deny that the male foreskin has any function at all, so they can continue to mutilate infant boys.

http://www.circumcision.org/pamphlet.htm

The foreskin is not ""just a little bit of skin."" The foreskin is a complex, double-layered fold of flesh, laden in thousands of nerves and blood vessels. Keep in mind that as a child grows into a man, his foreskin grows too; it isn't so little by the time the child is an adult. And adult foreskin can be from 12 to 15 square inches in size.

The foreskin is not a birth defect.

Neither is it a congenital deformity or genetic anomaly akin to a 6th finger or a cleft.

Neither is it a medical condition like a ruptured appendix or diseased gall bladder.

Neither is it a dead part of the body, like the umbilical cord, hair, or fingernails.

The foreskin is not ""extra skin."" The foreskin is normal, natural, healthy, functioning tissue, with which all boys are born; it is as intrinsic to male genitalia as labia are to female genitalia.

Unless there is a medical or clinical indication, the circumcision of a healthy, non-consenting individual is a deliberate wound; it is the destruction of normal, healthy tissue, the permanent disfigurement of normal, healthy organs, and by very definition, infant genital mutilation, and a violation of the most basic of human rights.

Genital mutilation, whether it be wrapped in culture, religion or “research” is still genital mutilation, and it needs to stop NOW.

* **Latter Days** is about a promiscuous boy who falls for a mormon. Consistently ranked near the top of gay movies.
* **Were the World Mine** is a musical romp about a boy with a crush on another boy. It's fun and well done.
* **Five Dances** may or may not be your thing. It's about five dancers practicing for a production, and centers on a young man who ran away from home to pursue dance in New York.
* **Private Romeo** is the play Romeo and Juliet, except it's all boys. And the boys are in a military academy. It's weird, but if you can get over the Shakespearean language, you'll love it.
* **Geography Club** is about a boy who is coming to terms with being gay and also for some reason he's beautiful and super fit but I felt like we were supposed to think he was an ugly scrawny kid the whole time. I dunno. This one's hit and miss, but I enjoyed it overall.
* **Getting Go** is about a boy who is obsessed with a gogo dancer. It's more mature than the others listed here, but I really enjoyed it.
* **Out in the Dark** is not feel-good by any stretch, but I still think it's good. An Israeli guy falls for a Palestinian guy studying in Tel Aviv, and of course everyone in the region is super racist, so there's lots of conflict. The ending is sort of up in the air. Edit: Racist is probably the wrong word. Israelis and Palestinians hate each other because there's a crazy amount of conflict in the area. Racism may be technically the correct word, but I don't think it appropriately conveys what's really going on.
* **Make the Yuletide Gay** is bad, be warned, but it's also sweet and feel-good as anything. A student returns home to his parents, who he hasn't come out to, and his boyfriend surprises him with a visit. Shenanigans abound.
* **Weekend** is another mature film about two guys who meet and share a weekend of passion. It's obvious that they fall for each other, and the movie explores their differing approaches to romance.
* Finally, I'll recommend the critically acclaimed **Undertow**. It's about a married fisherman who is having an affair with an artist, and it gets really good. Like, really really good. It's equal parts heart-breaking and uplifting.

You've probably seen lots of these, but hopefully I was able to open your eyes to one or two new films! Also, lots of these are available on Netflix for easy viewing. Enjoy!

PS. I realize this list is super white, but I can't for the life of me think of any feel-good gay films that aren't predominantly white.

&gt;If you think you place a high value on truth: Create a document where you list everything you believe against evidence. In your document about wrong beliefs, make a list of things you used to believe that you now are pretty certain you were wrong about. In your document about your mistaken beliefs, make a section about beliefs that you have that make you feel good but could be wrong.

&gt;Your own truth seeking document should also have a section of questionable beliefs you tell other people in order to avoid ostracism. If you find yourself afraid to fill in some sections of your truth seeking document about dubious beliefs you profess, ask yourself why.

Back in the EU, there were quite a few mentions that they did and the glowy part you see was a kind of tracer or cavitation bubble.  Of course, this is all irrelevant now.  There was also this quote:

&gt;   ""I wouldn't know. I do know, however, "", I-Five said, ""that you're much better with that sword than you think you are. ""

&gt;    Jax glanced down at the weapon, saw his disorted reflection looking back at him from the blade's surface. ""Yeah? How do you know th---?""

&gt;    I-Five suddenly whipped up his left hand, index finger extended, and fired a laser beam at Jax. The beam splashed off the ionized fire that suddenly coated the length of the blade, which Jax had automatically raised to block the beam.

&gt;    ""That's how,"" I-Five said, ""The speed of light is just under three hundred thousand kilometers per second. You are currently seven-point-three meters from me. Your Force-augmented anticipatory reflex action is obviously working fine. You just have to let it.""

We are trying to get from Rome to Nimes. We take a train. We have with us our heavy backpacks and our heavy emotional baggage because we are young and idiotic and one of us has just broken up with another one for the third in our group and it is the worst. 

Trains aren't common in America, and the ones I've been on in the U.S. have assigned seating. Hell Train to Genova has only a little floor space available.

It's midnight. Cold. Crowded. Dark. We're not entirely sure when we'll arrive — around 6:30AM, we think. I'm in charge of getting us off the train because I'm the only one of our group who has bothered to learn any other languages. But no one in Italy (aside from shopkeepers) will talk to me once I betray my American accent. At every dark stop I find an awake rider and softly ask ""Genova? Genova?"" like a hopeful baby bird and one old man in particular snarls as me when I do. He *hated* me. Yet he's the one who corrected me on my pronunciation of Genova. Oh, he loathed me for that unfamiliarity with the name. I remember you, angry old Italian man. I will never forget how to pronounce Genova, not even on my deathbed.

There's no room so I curl up in the gangway between train cars where it's technically forbidden to rest, but the bathroom nearby has been overflowing for hours and I just don't want to sleep in stranger's urine. I watch the track pass below me through the gap in the floor I try to sleep.

By 4am or so I no longer care and I manage to sleep a bit in the spreading urine puddle.

So that was a bit of a surprise. If I had to do it over again, I'm sure I could learn better tricks for handling overcrowded overnight urine trains full of people who'd as soon kick me off as help me exit at the right station.

I took two pictures of Hell Train (Flickr, sorry, they're not important enough to move to Imgur):

One is my backpack/bed that long, cold night; one is a mother who stayed awake all night so her child could stretch out and sleep. She looked how we all felt.

My comparable American experience would be a Greyhound bus, but at least on the bus I'd be warm and have my own seat. (The toilet would still be overflowing, though.)",,False,t3_43m82y,,13,t5_2uah7,False,1454299183,0,1458212321,

jetztf,13,GlobalOffensive,czjd5m6,0,t3_43mnjt,"North America, North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas.[2] It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third largest continent by area, following Asia and Africa,[3] and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and Europe.[4]

In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 565 million people in 23 independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably the Caribbean) are included.

North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period, via crossing the Bering land bridge. The so-called Paleo-Indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period). The Classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The Pre-Columbian era ended with the arrival of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the Early Modern period. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kind of interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves and their descendants. European influences are strongest in the northern parts of the continent while indigenous and African influences are relatively stronger in the south. Because of the history of colonialism, most North Americans speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect Western traditions.",rank legendary-eagle-master,False,t3_43mnjt,,13,t5_2sqho,False,1454300507,0,1458212640,Legendary Eagle Master
Bonghaette,22,technology,czjd67q,0,t3_43kxwc,"Yet mobile providers in a ton of European countries survive just fine delivering their promised caps, tethered or not. Because it's data. Data is not different from one device to another, it's 1's and 0's promised up until a certain amount. Next thing you'll try to convince me iPhones should get more data than Android smartphones because they're different too? 

I get 40+GB (anything beyond is limited to 256kbps, no surprise extra bill) with 4G coverage, 10 hours of talk and unlimited text/mms for just about the equivalent of 20 USD (109 Danish Kroner). 

If you believe American providers just oh so cannot possibly afford to let you use the data you're paying out your arse for, on anything but a mobile device, you're their dream customer but you're also fooling yourself. This is milking. I promise you somewhere on their site you can purchase an extra package for 10 bucks or so that allows tethering, it's pathetic. 

I don't understand, but I suppose you're used to data caps on landline broadband as well so it's no surprise. You're getting screwed up the arse and you've grown numb to it.

I wasn't optimistic about the refugees, but the NYE Assaults were so far beyond anything I had imagined. I was imagining regressive cultural attitudes, not coordinated rape gangs. On NYE we  surpassed the imaginations of even the most fevered right wing nutjobs. Absolutely insane to think about.

Too many people are stuck on the ludicrous idea of ""equality"" instead of attaching ""equality under law"". People are not equal, there are Elon Musks, Usain Bolts, Michael Jordans. It's stupid to try and pull the best and brightest down to the lowest levels, and that's what's wrong with modern politics and keeps people very poor in some areas. Jealousy and theft.

The best you can do is give equality under law and liberty to people, instead of constantly erode it as all governments do, and poverty would be eliminated. We are close to a point in North America and Europe where the ""poor"" have amazing living standards that the Rockefellers of the 1900s couldn't have attained. If the lowest have better lives than the billionaires before them then only jealous idiots would think  there is some fundamental problem and that the best and brightest need to be taxed so heavily or held down in any way whatsoever, it is simply hampering human potential because it is easy to hold political power that way.",,False,t1_czjcg0x,,3,t5_2qh2v,False,1454300727,0,1458212692,

Basically, the only legit point the AAP had was that circumcision decreases the risk of UTIs, but since UTIs can be easily treated with antibiotics, it was not worth it to sacrifice irreplaceable tissue to lower that risk.

""Simply look at the historical record""

I am. I've read some history. You haven't clearly. The people who lived there lived in prosperity, and no one was force converted, nor was there any killing of civilians.

I know you won't bring a single credible source for this bullshit.

Like I said, I'll create a post quoting you and refuting you. You agree to that? I don't want to embarrass you if you don't want me to.",,1454303437,t1_czjdowx,,2,t5_2qhbp,False,1454302010,0,1458212992,

Governments always say their socialist programs are going to be better for the poor, the environment, the sick, etc.. Just saying it doesn't make it so. Is the actual record of these policies and ideas as good as the rhetoric? 

Socialism in politics is a just a form of populism that aims to gain votes by playing on peoples emotions. It's no different than a politician looking for votes by playing on people's tribalism or racism. It's just class warfare instead of racism. ""You work hard! You deserve! Why should this other guy have so much and you so little just because of circumstance?"" is the same as ""You work hard, why should immigrants be allowed to come in and steal your jobs"". Where these politicians really stand... Who knows? Some of them may be genuine, or they may just be playing a game with voter statistics. It wouldn't be unheard of for a socialist leader that got elected to become fabulously wealthy.

Buy, you aren't going to be able to satisfy yourself or answer these questions simply. It is an age old political/economic argument with statistics and lies and propaganda and studies and academics arguing on both sides. 

I think when it comes to government people often confuse words with reality. The people who would argue with you that socialism isn't a great system, would argue that, while the proponents would have you believe it's a system where ""everybody wins and everyone has health care etc.."", the reality of the programs and outcomes is very different, and different systems actually have better outcomes for the rich and poor alike. And yes it can be very confusing to look at western European countries and single payer health plans and compare them to the broken us health system etc..

Our country has mere cities with larger populations than the entirety of the socialist European countries that people put up on pedestals. How could a large central government ever be efficient enough to provide for even the most basic needs of over 300 million people? Especially when the needs of people in California are going to be vastly different from the people in Kansas or New Hampshire. That's the whole fucking reason our country is broken up into states, so that the local governments can take care of their people's immediate needs while the central government takes care of everyone's overall needs, namely, protection from foreign enemies.

I understand that there are rich people who worked hard for their earnings, however those who found ways to cheat the system and end up paying less than 10% for taxes should not be doing that.

He is having a hard time being Lawful Good because well frankly Lawful good is kinda hard. Especially being someone who... Was neither in the past but this leads to good roleplay and he's never been in actual danger of falling.

My current and second character is his boss an Inquisitor of Sarenrae who has spent his life being an internal agent and doing a lot of intelligence analysis so his fighting skills are, certainly better than the average commoners but his true gifts are in the coercion of people and having a wide variety of experience in running other agents and missions.

The next step I'd suggest would be reading the news in that language (both world news and local news to places where that language is spoken).

If you're in Australia, I'd think that Japanese would be a sensible choice, since there's a lot of media available and there's actually a lot of chances you might use it far down the road in a real-world setting.

There must be an official stat about this, isn't there?
I want to know if Koreans are just complaining or if they are actually leaving. When I asked about Hell Joseon to my gf she said these young people complained a lot but didn't make any effort to leave or change things.

oSoSmash,2,starcraft,czjgoub,0,t3_43jhc8,"As a smasher, I love the praise, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows over here. Things look great right now, because the game is growing, and everyone wants to be a part of it, but there was a time when Melee was in a decline too. After MLG dropped Melee and Brawl came out, Melee kinda had a big rough patch. Everyone expected Brawl to be an even better Melee so people started playing that. When people realized that Brawl sucked, a lot of people just stopped playing overall, rather than just going back to melee. Then there was the other people who chose to play Brawl. If it weren't for the famous [Mew2King vs Shiz at ROM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qna80MbcAAc) Melee might not be around right now. Even after that, Melee didn't really start it's huge growth until 2013, mostly thanks to [The Smash Brothers Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX9hbbA-WP4) (If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth watching, even if you aren't a Smash fan). I would say that dumb luck and a select few people, were responsible for the survival of melee rather than positivity as a community. 

That being said, I think there is one key thing that separates Melee from sc2, and that's that it is so easy to connect with the community. In sc2, all of the best players live in Korea, and even after that in EU, while a large percentage of the viewership comes from NA. It is impossible for viewers to connect with their favorite players. In melee, I can hop on Twitch and see Mango, or Axe or Westballz or SFAT streaming, and I can hop in and chill with them. Or I can go to twitter and read all of Leffen's dumb rants, or find out the latest Hax$ meme, or check in on the m2k circus act. SC2 doesn't have the personalities that Melee has. The only sc2 streams I ever watch are CatZ, Snute, TLO and MC. If players like Innovation, herO and Zest were able to stream, it would be so good for sc2. The language barrier between the top players and the viewers also contributes to this. I'm not sure if Korean players in LoL learn English, but I always wondered how literally no Koreans learn English. I think there's more Casters that speak Korean than there is top Koreans that speak English. It makes it hard to connect with your favorite players when all of their tweets look like this: ""2015년 저에겐 너무 행복하고 벅찬 한해였네요. 올해는 더욱 성장한 모습으로 찾아뵙겠습니다 다들 새해복 많이 받으세요 Happy new year~"". Also, I think the fact that Melee is an offline, console game helps bring the community together. Almost everyone has a chance to go to a huge tournament, and there is smaller tournaments and smaller local scenes. I can go to a tournament with in half and hour of me and play top players. Most sc2 fans have never been to a tournament, and played with top players, so they have no respect for them as a person, just as a player, so they have no problem talking shit about them and being negative. 

That's just my thoughts, from someone who has been around both communities for a long time.",AFREECA,False,t3_43jhc8,,2,t5_2qpp6,False,1454308517,0,1458214306,Afreeca Freecs

Or, in other words, more people are finally starting to get interested in issues that affect them directly and that are a little more important than Big Brother or the UEFA Champions League.

A good newspaper should *encourage* readers to discuss the news it reports. The whole point of journalism - the self-respecting kind at least - is to divulge information among the people with the goal of enabling common men and women to think, talk and get involved. Sadly, it seems evident that our friends at the Guardian only want readers to get involved if they don't challenge the editorial line.

If the same thing happened to them they'd be whining like a bunch of confused bitches about how life is so unfair for the white Europeans or something to that effect. It's just your run of the mill human frailty and stupidity and natural tribalism that just *happens* to be expressed by white people.

Also, the europe they use Natural Gas as much as they do Petroleum . So dependency is less and Natural Gas is cheaper. This affects the supply demand dynamic.                        
The Tax on petrol is probably 30-40. You are most probably right about that. What I meant to say was that the tax on petrol has risen by Rs10 ever since the price of Crude has fallen.                  
Also yes. All the different hydrocarbons pulled from crude are sold at different prices. For example - Jet Fuel also is extracted from Crude. Its price varies quite wildly from the price of petrol. this is because they have an entire different supply and demand system.

You become a German citizen if at least one of your parents has a permanent residence permit, even if they're not citizens. In France you get French citizenship if one of your foreign parents was also born in France.

War prep starts every Tuesday and Friday evening, around 6pm UK time. We speak English, are all adults, and our members are mainly from across Western Europe. 

•	We understand you have a life outside clash, and don’t require you to war all the time. Communication is key, just let us know if you can’t make it, by mentioning it in the chat, or by opting out, or even better, by doing both! 

•	We don’t have a request/donation ratio. We just all help each other out, but we would like you to donate first when you join, before requesting yourself.

•	We all love the game, have fun, love our wars, but at the end of the day, this is just a game and while we love winning wars, we just all strive to do our best and it is OK if you have a bad day.

•	Should you opt in our wars, all that we ask is that you use both your attacks. Our war rules are simple: opposite number on first attack and clean up time on the second once everyone has done their first attack.

Kuuzie,1,AskReddit,czji68w,0,t3_43ipgu,"I moved out the day I turned 18 with some friends and one of our group was a 23 year old we knew from work. He was a pretty good guy all around, but this is the first time he had lived outside of home. I felt a little embarrassed teaching him how to use the dishwasher, laundry (including on what kinds of soap to buy for both) and how to run the vacuum. He would also frequently put things in the oven too and forget about them and just go to work. How the apt didn't burn down I don't know. 

Another acquaintance would not believe everyone that you actually can fire a pistol sideways like the gangsters in movies. He believed ""the springs"" don't work that way and its just movie magic. Now he is avid shooter last time I looked him up on facebook.

But that is circular logic. Locals overwhelmingly do not have these problems for a wide number of reasons. As a result, by default locals will be disadvataged by the system in favour of these migrants. It's also important to note that legal migrants (from the start, not post asylum claim) are also equally disadvantaged before these originally illegal immigrants.

As a result, we can conclude that system does in fact favour these immigrants. All you did was list reasons why it does so. Which is in a direct opposition to your claim that it does not. This entire thread, in case you haven't noticed, is about discussing the impact of current migrant crisis on lives on average people in Europe.

There are many other swords from history that have an equally incredible story, or skill of craft, and I'm disappointed I don't see anything about them. I mean maybe a stray video about a European broadsword, but next to nothing about chinese Dadao swords, or Persian shamshirs.

The first one is easy, I had a completely beautiful Polish man as an admirer once, he was utterly sexy, fit, passionate, infuriating and confusing. With an incredible body. Nothing ever really happened, he was such a tease (and secretly quite nervous, he didn't think I could tell) and I suppose I was nervous too (because I didn't really believe he actually liked me, I don't think of myself as particularly alluring or beautiful - so I think that discouraged him and my not reciprocating might have even hurt him a little) but he was terribly romantic and passionate both in word and action and I always find myself wondering what might have happened had I reciprocated, and fantasising about it. I now kind of have a big thing for European men as a result.

The clown thing, well it's a combination of always loving the circus, clowns and acrobats, from a very young age. And I once was the object of a Russian clown's affections (as part of his act, not in reality - a girl can hope though) I absolutely love Jimmy Stewart as Buttons the clown in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" and David Bowie in the video for ""Strangers when we meet"" (where he isn't really a clown, but the imagery is circus-like and I LOVE Bowie) and gosh I just don't know, clowns are often so so fit, due to the physicality of their acts and acrobatics.

Also consider that plenty of P-40s were lent to the British and Australians, and a few other countries. The P-39 was the other notable fighter available to the USAAF at the beginning of the war, and was available well into the thousands, as was the P-40. The P-38's production was rapidly approaching 1,000 as well. There were even 150 P-51s and 310 P-51As in service by the end of 1942, with the XP-51B in testing.

However, it's also important to consider that the US did not take a front-seat role in the war for much of 1942. The USAAF had to spend a lot of time getting bases set up, shipping supplies around, and all kinds of other concerns you have with a land-based force. The P-40 saw plenty of action, but it wasn't in frontline service much of the time simply because USAAF units weren't in frontline service much of that time. What use it did see was often in its adopted role of fighter-bomber, which is fairly lower in intensity than dogfighting.

In the Pacific, the P-40 did see more frontline use compared to Europe. But this was against Japanese planes, which had lower production numbers, were slightly behind their German allies in some ways, and whose pilots had little experience outside of stomping the tiny Chinese air force that they outnumbered 6:1. The US Navy and Marine Corps were still doing much of the work in the Pacific in 1942, again, while the USAAF got their affairs in order.",us,False,t1_czjghl8,,2,t5_2uc6j,False,1454315470,0,1458215314,gib F2G-2

nic027,0,europe,czjj0vg,0,t3_43inhb,"&gt; A view that unfortunately crash against history

There are multiple examples in history of much longer and much powerfull hatred that stopped thanks to negotiation and diplomacy. European union is the best one: you will not find a situation where hatred was more incrusted in culture (France/Germany was the most important one but that wasn't the only one) due to war, battles and atrocities by each sides during centuries but accepted to put it aside and resolve conflict by negotiations and now war is unthinkable. 

Every human is born with reason and a great majority will seek peace if it gave them security and prosperity.

I doubt it to be honest. As /u/Lindkvist15 said, there's a cultural divide here where fans of existing teams (at least those with a long history) simply have no interest in the KHL or Russian teams. Hell, we have enough trouble caring about the newcomer teams in SHL, and we certainly don't care about CHL comparatively speaking. 

And in addition to that, most of the clubs have a huge organization of junior and kids teams and a strong connection to the local municipality, which would be in jeopardy from the corporate structure a switch would demand.

&gt;Europe, which has buried our children in the deep waters of the Aegean, which is applying a Geneva play through these deaths, is carrying out a Syriafication scenario against Turkey in cooperation with Russia and the US.

&gt;We are not struggling against terror, we are fighting it

&gt;This is why the struggle in Sur, Cizre and our other cities is a war. This is why those who have dragged Syria into a dead end are shaping this war. This is why there is no terror or fight against terror, there is a plot to turn Turkey into Syria. Just as this is not terror, it is not an ethnic war either. It has nothing to do with religion, identity or values. This is a siege, a project to suffocate the country and strike it from the inside. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and other organizations have been given orders to this end and have been directed as such and pushed into war. The operations in our southeastern provinces are operations to end a domestic invasion. It is a fight to rescue Turkey, our people, country and nation. It is a relentless resistance against a multinational front.

&gt;They are attacking on two fronts

&gt;This is because we are under dual attack. We are under threat from both within and without. Those sieging the country from outside, cutting all our ties with the region to our south, positioning Iran against Turkey, setting Russia against us, are striking Turkey from the inside under the name of terror, through the PKK....

But fear not, friends because 

&gt;Turkey is a miraculous country. It has maintained this characteristic for centuries, it changed history and maps, managed to overcome global-scale crises and revived each time it was said to be “gone.” This is the kind of history the Crusades, Mongolian invasions and World War I has been for us. The only country that has been able to overcome history's greatest crises is Turkey. Since it is the only country with the capacity and experience to recover the region, the showdown is not with Syria. The showdown is with Turkey.

&gt;We are going to draw the map, not them

&gt;If things are so chaotic and sides have become so clear, if war is expressed so openly and even allies have started to hit us from the inside, then this means the gates of that miraculous rise have reopened. Hence, we do not hesitate to persistently say, “Regardless of how many maps they draw, how many Syriafication projects they implement, the real map is going to be drawn by the people of these lands.” We are not carrying out an operation of heroism or morale, we are talking about the truth and those who do not believe will one day face this reality.

""Wise"" (smart) comes [from Middle English wis, wys, from Old English wīs ‎(“wise”), from Proto-Germanic *wīsaz ‎(“wise”), from a participle form of Proto-Indo-European *weyd-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wise). 

But ""wise"" (from Middle English -wis, from Old English -wīs ‎(“-wise”)) is an old word for ""way, manner"". If you know Romance languages, it cognates with ""guise"" (French), ""guisa"" (Spanish, Italian)... following the ""w- to gu-"" pattern you find in other Old English words that made it to the Romance language: Wales/Galles, William/Guillaume, ward/garde, etc.

You find ""-wise"" as a suffix in many other words: otherwise (in another way), elementwise (element-by-element, e.g. multiplication of matrices), likewise (in a similar way).

EDIT: OK, looking a bit further, these words are ultimately related, as descendants of PIE [""weyd""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-), a word for ""to see"" (cognates: video, guide, idea, eidetic...). Think about it: a **wise** person has a good understanding, a good **vision** of the world around him. The suffix **-wise** shows the manner, the direction, or a way of doing something, as a wise person would **guide** you using his ~~**foresight**~~ foresight and **ideas** (bold words are all cognates).

This is why:
In XCOM:EU/EW (and i assume xcom2) you CAN use rockets/grenades to blow up walls BUT you cannot control exactly how big the hole you are creating is and often times the rest of the wall (mainly wooden walls) start burning and you can't really risk taking cover at the edges of the hole created bc you don't know when it could break down and leave your soldier out in the open to get shot at. Also, you have to start the explosion with your team at least one explosion radius (which is quite large in the case of rockets or perk-enhanced explosives) to not get caught in the blast so you cannot really ""storm through"" the opening as well.

With breaching charges you could take a turn to set up and then start a new turn with the breaching charge (maybe even as a free action - you are only pressing a button after all) and charge really far into the building in a single turn.

Wow, this would be so fucking fun - i would even give up an extra grenade or two for it. ",,False,t3_43mjnh,,1,t5_2si6x,False,1454318515,0,1458215741,

It isn't even in the same category as attractions like Soarin' at Disney world. They should remove it. Busch Gardens Williamsburg is an amazing and beautiful park and I cannot wait to see what they have in store. Maybe Kings Dominion will take note and add a new coaster in 2017!

I would be careful, depending upon where you are (or go in the future) because some shops will charge you a fee for over-staying in their parking lot. I assume you are in America, where (out west) lots are large and do not crowd, so maybe you won't have any trouble. But beware that up north-east where it is crowded, you will have trouble. In Europe (especially UK) you will have trouble.

Also - aren't there more beautiful places to park than parking lots of chain stores? I don't know if you have got in trouble elsewhere and this is why you are doing it that way, but my hubby and I (In UK and Europe) tend to find an old road in the middle of nowhere to park (only problem: no facilities) and then drive somewhere in the morning to use toliets, or find a campground (expensive so not good for every day), or park near a pub or public restroom- a couple blocks away maybe if there is a nice park or something nearby, then we can use toilets there before bed (and in the morning). I guess we prefer a nice view and atmosphere, and have not needed to park in (ugly) parking lots--but maybe your lots are nice or you don't mind.",,False,t1_czj419s,,2,t5_2rnwo,False,1454318739,0,1458215766,

starburstempire,1,australia,czjju5j,0,t3_42e43m,"&gt;So its only the desendants of the first white settlers that are responsible? You do know that many white Australian's came here long after that right? 

We know who is responsible. No need to clarify that. 

&gt;Why are they less responsible than people who happened to be born here and buy a house? 

Their descendants didn't colonize this country. Australia was invaded/colonized by White European Settlers. Their laws are directly responsible for the Aboriginal enfranchisement.

&gt;Nope, its my way of saying exactly what i said. Which ill repeat for you: You're a racist if you think just because a person has white skin that they are a racist who is responsible for the past crimes of other white people who they may not even be descended from

White culture benefits from colonization even today. This is not a secret. The fact that you were not directly involved or may not be related to early European settlers does not exclude you from the benefits of colonization and the cultural and ideological dominance that followed. Merely a few decades ago whites in Australia were determining the futures of hundreds of aboriginals in Australia and yet you say, ""its not me"", ""I have nothing to do with it"". But you do. Your very Whiteness includes you whether you like it or not. If not through explicit action then through in-action. If you're from such pure stock then where were your ancestors when this was all happening?

But then again if its not your responsibility; still your just going to stand by and do nothing as if that makes you untouchable in the eyes of your lord. The apathy of fat white men. There's no point in having a debate if the person your debating doesn't even have the strength to admit he'll do nothing either way; aboriginals lose out while you cry like a little girl about you soya latte being too sugary.

Sure, it's possible to escape the PVP but not before you kill the person few times because there is a 15 minutes cool down on channel switch and you can only switch channel from peace zone, so that people can't just zone out on spots (that's how it works on RU). It's easier to dominate a small server than to dominate the whole EU universe on multi-channel, so i think multi-channel is more challenging. Likewise, if you really need to farm you can always go to some outskirt channel to farm those few extra millions and accomplish what you need to accomplish without much stress, everyone needs relative peace sometimes. So it benefits both noobs and pros in my opinion, pros have a choice to either ""hold"" home channel, invade a channel of hostile guild or farm quietly. Noobs have an opportunity to find relatively uncontested spots as well and advance their gear.

meeeow,1,brasil,czjjzdx,0,t3_43ka3a,"&gt;No caso vocẽ fez várias comparações erradas. Primeiro, se há cancer, há cancer. Sabe-se que o problema existe. No caso da criança não há diagnóstico....e aí está o cerne da questão. O que exatemente está errado com essa criança? Você não sabe e os médicos tampouco, mas você tem 100% da certeza de que mudar o sexo é correto, sem ter 100% da certeza da salada de fruta que é a cabeça de uma criança de 9 anos de idade.

Hein? A condicao eh estudade desde 1960 eh bem claro o que esta errado com essa criança: o genero dela nao condiz com o corpo em que nasceu, a gente sabe exatamente o que eh. Tanto que existem diferencas fisicas no cerebro que mostram que o mesmo nao condiz com o sexo do corpo. 

Nao estou dizendo que disforia eh uma condicao comum o simples, ate pq existem muitos gradientes (por exemplo algumas pessoas nao tem problema nenhum em ter a genitalia do genero oposto, outros sentem que nao eh parte do corpo delas - geralmente leva a cirurgia). Para muita gente nao existe tratamento que nao seja a transcição, pq nao existe transplante de cerebro ou de corpo. Mas existe um entendimento bem concreto do beneficio de tratamento hormonal. 

E diga-se de passagem crianças com 2 anos conseguem identificar meninos e meninas, entre 3 e 4 sabem eh quando começam a expressar a sua identidade de genero. E de novo, nao eh como se um moleque de 9 anos pudesse entrar em um escritorio medico declar que eh menina e pedir um remedinho. Existe um acompanhamento medico inteiro antes de comecar o tratamento, durante e depois. 

Mais uma vez pq voce ainda nao respondeu essa pergunta: pq voce se importa tanto com o tratamento médico dos outros? Como isso te afeta? Se nao responder essas perguntas eu vou parar essa conversa por aqui.

Krawu,1,atheism,czjk17t,0,t3_43n52l,"All of these questions assume that atheism follows the same rules as organized religion, which makes them a bit awkward to answer, but here's my shot at it:

-It actually took me a few minutes of reflection to be able to put words to my ""atheistic feelings"". Some of these may sound quite strong, but they're all just part of the backdrop of my emotional life. Atheists don't constantly think about how great it is being atheist in my experience. But since the question was asked, I'll answer: unburdened, free, honest, progressive, unafraid, truly moral (because atheists decide their own morals based on what they would expect of other people). But I also know from personal experience that having just lost one's faith, especially in the beginning, can leave you with a feeling of loneliness, a sense of nihilism, and fear of what comes after death. (Because uncertainty is often scary)

-Atheists do not generally go around trying to convert people to atheism specifically. Remember: Atheism is not a religion, and we have no holy book telling us to add new sheep to the flock. But most atheists are outspoken proponents of critical thinking, intellectual honesty, the scientific method and humanism. These disciplines are usually why an individual struggles to keep their faith after applying them to their own religion. From there, the path does not usually lead into the hands of another religion, because these are just as easily discredited, and they eventually end up with no religion at all - atheism.

-Again: Atheism is not a religion promising anything to anyone. The reason why atheists nowadays are as organized as they are is because of religious majorities in many countries pushing discriminatory legislature that seem bereft of any reason or good sense to anyone who is not part of that majority. And in the part of Europe I live in, the safest bet is to assume anyone you meet on the street to be an atheist as well anyways. I don't know anyone in my age group who is at all religious, except for 2 friends who're muslim, and one of those is addicted to bacon cheeseburgers and can drink anyone I know under the table. So I guess the one thing it really did for me was to provide a sense of community online, which is what usually happens when a group of like-minded people come together.

You *are* the pulsing beat and everything radiates from the chest out. Ballet is about very tight control and angelic beauty through minimal movement; nothing moves that wasn't intentionally placed and everything is *just so* for maximum grace.

Her ballet is ruined through her African forms. Too many times she completely disregards what her arms are doing and lets them flop around, or doesn't hold the chest/spine/form well. Her feet aren't doing anything even close to ballet, and her body movement is just wrong. Likewise, her movements are far too european to be african. Things start from the arms  and legs and move inward and the chest has pretty much no obvious bearing on movement.

It just looks kinda wrong if you think of it as ""ballet + african dance"". It does neither particularly well.

Vertitto,9,poland,czjkaa5,0,t3_43noix,"&gt;where do you see yourself? 

central is best term - it's hard to call us eastern when you want to speak geographically as center of Europe is somewhere around Belarus/Lithuania/eastern Poland (due to most often used maps that cut of Russia are tilted to concentrate on western europe, epeople are not awere how big landmass of Russia and Ukraine is in Europe - [this map](http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/misc/geo-euro.gif) shold give better perspective. Culturally and economically we are somewhere inbetween and politically we are western. Categorising us in either eastern or western brings out lot of problematic issues for either side, so using central is good way of solving the problem

eastern is really annoying when people use it in present context and give ""hurr-durr cold war"" argument to it

&gt;What are the popular politics in Poland right now? Is it left or right wing? Are there a big difference in political views when it comes to age?

population is very polarised atm- more conservative on average compared to west. In general conservative was more prevalent in older generation, but recently there has been resurgance in yunger generations due to fuckups of EU and still long time unresolved internal issues (wages, law, national budget stuff) left by old, more left leaning gov

&gt;In 10-15 years what do you think Poland will be like? The same, or something completely different?

very similar to what is now,  continuing going upwards

&gt;Where does the youth in Poland look to for inspiration such as music and fashion?

also US for the most part, in general the same you can find in rest o EU. In terms of music we are leaning more thowards rock/blues side. [Beats of Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3pT9pZNNQM) (YT sadly took down version with english subs ) covers history of polish music from communism to early modern

As far as religion goes (couse we are always distinctive on various stats) it's more of a cultural thing, than religious. By which i mean people go to church just becouse it's sunday, don't really know the religion (bible, philosophy, theology etc - Saint Marry is almost as important here as Jesus himself), the holidays are for the most part family holidays, things like weddings need to be taken in church, couse it's how weddings should look like etc. More religious people are often looked down upon being called weird or haunted (it's ok to be more religious while you get old, but rather weird before that). Catholic church in Poland also worked differently - it had more of a political and culture preservation role than religious during hard times. Due to that people feel very close to catholicism, but when looking from strictly religious pov it's ""a bit off""

Gotebe,1,europe,czjkgei,0,t3_43eiic,"You know, I don't think those dumb fucks were economic migrants either! A thug is a thug, calling him a migrant is a compliment.

I wouldn't be surprised if we learned that they were instructed, paid even, by someone who wants to fuck with Europe.",,False,t1_czjk8w1,,1,t5_2qh4j,False,1454322195,0,1458216151,
Sickchops,1,australia,czjkgik,0,t3_42e43m,"&gt;We know who is responsible. No need to clarify that. 

You did need to clarify, because i didnt realise you blamed all white people regardless of thier personal history.

&gt;Their descendants didn't colonize this country. Australia was invaded/colonized by White European Settlers. Their laws are directly responsible for the Aboriginal enfranchisement.

Just because you are white doesnt mean your descendants were the european settlers either. Also people are not personally responsible for the crimes of thier descendants.

&gt;White culture benefits from colonization even today. This is not a secret. The fact that you were not directly involved or may not be related to early European settlers does not exclude you from the benefits of colonization and the cultural and ideological dominance that followed. 

Only white people benefit? So a 3rd generation chinese Australian doesnt? Every Australian is benefitting regardless of your skin colour.

&gt;Merely a few decades ago whites in Australia were determining the futures of hundreds of aboriginals in Australia and yet you say, ""its not me"", ""I have nothing to do with it"". But you do. Your very Whiteness includes you whether you like it or not. If not through explicit action then through in-action. If you're from such pure stock then where were your ancestors when this was all happening?

You're obviously racist against white people.   

&gt;But then again if its not your responsibility; still your just going to stand by and do nothing as if that makes you untouchable in the eyes of your lord. The apathy of fat white men. There's no point in having a debate if the person your debating doesn't even have the strength to admit he'll do nothing either way; aboriginals lose out while you cry like a little girl about you soya latte being too sugary. 

I've already said i think its the responsibility of Australia, and hence all Australians. I dont think its fair to single out only white Australians just because they are white. You clearly have issues with white people, and are a classic hateful racist.

Fiction:  

**Die Zwillinge** (De tweeling) by Tessa de Loo. When their parents die, twins Lotte and Anna are sent to family and separated. Lotte grows up in a middle-class family in the Netehrlands, Anna on a poor farm in Germany. The sisters loose contact through the war, but meet again 40 years later in Spa. An interesting view on Dutch/German history, luck, guilt, ""good"" and ""bad"" as the two sisters have to decide whether they can reforge their bond or have become too different.

Non-fiction:  
**Das Getreideparadies** (De Graanrepubliek) by Frank Westerman. In a history book that almost reads like a thriller, Westerman links the history of North-East Groningen, the effect the great political movements (anarchism, communism, fascism, socialism) had locally, and the life and career of Sicco Mansholt, the architect of Europe's agricultural policies who started to question his own dogma's in the end, influenced by his relation with Petra Kelly. 

**In Europa: Eine Reise durch das 20. Jahrhundert** (In Europa) by Geert Mak. Mak, a historian, travels trough Europe visiting the places where crucial events in the 20th century have taken place. Maybe a bit too much emphasis on the second world war, but still a great combination of travel and history book.

**Das Jahrhundert meines Vaters** (De eeuw van mijn vader) by Geert Mak. Geert Mak shows the Netherlands in the 20th century, especially before 1950, through his own family. A great combination of micro and macro-history that gives you a feeling how middle-class Dutch lived, thought, and experienced the neurtal first world war, the depression, the second world war and decolonisation, and the post-war prosperity.",Gelderland,1454413418,t1_cziqhng,,3,t5_30hrx,False,1454322286,0,1458216161,Lord of the Wasps

If they are refugees seeking asylum, they come for temporary protection and protection only.

&gt;Når flygtninge får asyl i Danmark, er deres opholdstilladelse midlertidig. Det vil sige tidsbegrænset. 

And if their stay is only temporary, how much does the level of equality really matter? They *are* going to get sent back. So they might as well travel 200 km to SA in stead of 3000 km to Denmark. 

No reason to make yourself too comfortable, if you are going to leave soon anyways. 

I realize now that that made me sound very right wing. I am not. But that is the current state of our asylum policies (supported by a *wide* majority!)

&gt;Unless a unified european solution to the crisis is agreed upon every country will try to push as many refugees to other countries as possible, and right now we are leading the charge until someone else willing to do the same enacts stricter immigration laws.

2. The refugees should be given shelter in safe countries - for the duration of the conflict (not permanent residency). This process happens via the UN, from refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. I am skeptical of the ""refugee"" status of anyone who can afford to pay a people smuggler: even if they are fleeing something, they are not likely to be the MOST NEEDY, ie the people stuck in the camps. The age and gender ratio of the ""refugees"" arriving in Europe bear that out. 
3. You seem to be suggesting that people from BRICs nations are currently classed as refugees. No they are not.  Living in an ""emerging market"" is not a life-threatening condition. (Although I'd make an exception for Chinese political activists who are threatened by the regime). Honestly, half the population of India and China would love to move to the USA and Europe. Many do, as immigrants with skills - they are not classed as refugees. Are you asking should other countries take immigrants from Russia, China, India, Brazil?

Lets not kid ourselves and say that most of the migrants coming over are highly skilled doctors or whatever. I highly doubt that a significant measure of those coming over have valuable skills of any sort to provide to the economy (I am always glad to be proven wrong) and combined with questionable language skills and sometimes conflicting cultural/religious values, a huge amount of these people could easily prove unemployable setting them up for a long term drain on the social welfare systems.

Oh dear. 40 hours a week is 36% of your waking time per week. That is, by definition, a part time job. It's the absolute bare minimum. Little kids study more than that. 

Point to countries with sub 40 hour work weeks all you want (Scandinavia, Western Europe etc) and you'll find that the much leisure has put team in an unenviable and unsustainable amount of debt. You don't just pick an arbitrary amount of hours and mandate it as a standard work week, they tried that here and found that the amount of work that needs to be done exceeds the standard workweek which is why most jobs exceed that. Take pride in your work and work until your work is done. 

Do you know how much strain the welfare system in those countries is? There are great reasons why we don't replicate it here (long term economic stability). 

God, you people are depressingly entitled. My mother probably does that much in housework per week and doesn't break a sweat. Not just western people but young Koreans and Japanese too. No wonder China will mop the floor with the world economy. No one wants to work anymore. ",,False,t1_czjjlik,,-1,t5_2qiog,False,1454324343,0,1458216382,

The reasons many UK citizens don't like the EU is because the EU is corrupt (it has consistently failed it's own auditing process year after year), it's secretive, makes heaps of unnecessary and often interfering laws, is costly, and is seen as undemocratic.  So once again, David Cameron is completely out of step with the British public.  

Cameron is probably banking on the fact that, come the referendum, most Brits will vote to stay in the EU because they fear the changes it would mean.  ",,False,t3_43ngdf,,3,t5_2qhcv,False,1454324515,0,1458216401,

The prosecution did not stop the MOL CEO Zsolt Hernadi side, because despite the manager wanted to achieve through his lawyer that the Prosecutor General's Office (LU) to initiate a review of the appellate court decision, without success. LU spokesman Geza Fazekas editorial office informed him that will not trigger the appeal in the case.

Transparent lebbentette the veil that last October, Zsolt Hernadi that there is an acquittal, the Mol CEO of cases. This is the website of a final court judgment published in anonymous way was clear.

Zsolt Hernadi, MOL has no leader acquittal tens of millions of euros in international bribery case
The document is rendered anonymous, but it is clear that Zsolt Hernadi related procedures. The verdict states that the substitute private prosecutor is not the victim of the offense charged in the subject, so the court can not rule that Hernadi whether guilty or not.

MOL Chairman-CEO of the Croatian authorities have accused that in 2009 arranged for several million euros payment of kickbacks to the former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader on exchange in order to acquire MOL management rights in INA.

The Hungarian oil company and its leader has repeatedly denied the allegations.

At home in the Central Investigating Chief Prosecutor's Office (KNYF) investigation found that neither the President and CEO of MOL, a Hungarian citizen or otherwise not committed a crime, so terminated the proceedings.

Then, one of the shareholders of the company - the company's former chief legal advisor - substitute private prosecutor stepped up in court, which finally definitively ruled that because the substitute private prosecutor is not the victim of the case so that the court can not rule that Hernadi whether guilty or not.
Experts said the acquittal would have been so important in the Mol-control, because then other (either Croatian) court would have acted no longer the case.

According to the EU your principle, rule on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the Croatian judiciary can not engage in this process if the question of guilt had taken a position on the Hungarian court.

Without sounding name experts have known something, because the transparent information that this is already done, and not after the defense statement, but a few months before.

Our editors are asked about the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office (LU) and requested information also to have taken their decision in this regard and to support the appeal. The organization's spokesman Geza Fazekas in its reply confirmed that the LÜ to the summer of 2015 ""petition for a redress the initiative to the rule of law.""

The spokesman also noted that the Criminal Procedure allows the Attorney General to illegal and against the final decision of the court declare an appeal to the Curia for the rule of law, provided that the final decision can not be challenged in other appeals.

""LU can initiate an appeal of the manor, where the benefit of the offender, so his dismissal or termination of the proceedings or lenient judge's decision is expected from him.

Not only used against the judgment in the substantive legal institution, but also, for example, if the appellate court verdict aside about helyezésről, which could mean the death of the matter is, as happened in the Biszku trial.

Umm.. no, in almost every modern country in the world that is literally THE definition of full time work.  There's a reason that number exists, numerous studies over the last 50+ years has found it to be MORE productive than longer work hours.

&gt; Little kids study more than that.

They sure do, in Korea.  Korea also has the prestige to hold the title of highest suicide rate in the OECD, two years running!

http://english.donga.com/List/3/all/26/411380/1

&gt; Point to countries with sub 40 hour work weeks all you want (Scandinavia, Western Europe etc) and you'll find that the much leisure has put team in an unenviable and unsustainable amount of debt.

Well, lets look at some stats, shall we?

Estonia, debt in 2014 14% of GDP.  Average hours worked per week, 38.9.

Norway, 33% of GDP.  Average hours, 33.9/wk.

Luxembourg, 34% and 39.9hr/wk.

You know is funny... Greece, whom we all know is broke as fuck (debt is 180% of GDP), has an average annual working hours of 2042, pretty close to Korea's 2124.  But, Korea is only in second place there, Mexico (debt 48.7% of GDP) has 2228 annual work hours.

All numbers from OECD, 2014 data.

Guess it's just not that simple, lower work hours doesn't seem to mean crippling debt.  Must be other factors in place.

I can understand how people from the upper crust can feel all is good, and those lowly slaves need to just work more.  But, it turns out, normal people actually have a problem with that and science teaches us that making people go to work for longer hours leads to lower productivity overall.  Yes, in the very short term it can give a boost, but in the long term it is more harmful than helpful to productivity.

&gt;1.Do you think that Syrian refugees meet the definition of what a refugee should be? Ie. Do you think that because of the geopolitical conditions in that part of the world (instability, religious persecution, lack of infrastructure etc.) that they are - like other groups throughout history - justified in attempting to relocate to another part of the world? 

I do. But all those people you see on boats aren't Syrian refugees. Refugees, historically, arrive in the nearest safe country (e.g. Turkey) where they are sheltered, cared for and guarded by the UN until it is safe to return home. As well, if Germany was granting asylum to provably Syrian refugees, they could arrive via plane, [which is safer and cheaper. The only thing you can't do is hide your identity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO0IRsfrPQ4). These people are illegal immigrants.  You could book a flight out of Damascus (DAM) to London for tomorrow night if you wanted to, but you have to show ID.

&gt;2.If you do agree that these people are legitimate refugees, where do you think they should they go? 

Where refugees have always gone, to UN refugee camps in safe neighboring countries, where they wait to return. 

&gt;3.Do you think the West should take in immigrants from emerging markets (like say India, Russia, Brazil and China) for economic reasons like most western countries currently do? Why or why not? 

Yes. They go through a legal, documented immigration process that starts at the appropriate embassy in their home country. They don't just show up. Otherwise they may not be qualified to find employment and end up being a taxpayer burden. The employment stats are in an article in the sub, that on average 2/3rds of these illegal immigrants remain unemployed.

[The majority of people pouring into Germany are not Syrian. They are not fleeing war. They are not refugees.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240010/Number-refugees-arriving-Europe-soars-85-year-just-one-five-war-torn-Syria.html) The people that believe that are the same kind of stupid people that George W Bush tricked after 9/11. He kept saying Al Qaeda and Iraq in the same sentence every speech, on purpose, until 60 percent of Americans (according to a poll) believed Iraq was responsible for 9/11. Osama Bin Laden hated Saddam Hussein and called him an infidel (the Baathists were anti Islamist and the dreaded Fedayeen secret police kept them in check). 

While some people in this sub can seem vitriolic, it's because it's a pretty big ""I told you so"" situation. The left are ""shocked"" by the crimes and the volunteers become ""disillusioned"" after the Syrians treat them like shit, throw garbage everywhere, steal, fight, throw food away and essentially act like assholes.

You are ""shocked"" when you thought something that wouldn't ever happen... happens. You are ""disillusioned"" when your fantasy and reality collide. This is why younger people are generally more Left than older people. Experience. Just because someone is poor doesn't mean they are a good person.

Just watch any video of Arabs and the disdain they have for Europe, Western civilization and Western society. We all expected this to happen. Mass rape? Could have called that. Just ask any white woman that's traveled to the Middle East what it's like. 

People around the world don't share your values. Get used to that.

These people don't have a place in European society. They do not have the right to come in and roll back 1000 years of civil rights, equality, freedom and justice.

They do not want to be European. So they don't belong in Europe. Europeans don't need pamphlets telling them not to rape people.

They do vote though, and they always vote for the suicidal Leftists so that's how the Left stays in power. By importing their electorate, which is essentially hijacking democracy.

By winning a game you gain XP and by loosing one your XP decrease (logical), this XP gives you a level and it ranks you over all the europeen players (meaning less though). Usually the matchmaking is kinda good, you won't be matched with good players at the beginning, still better players than you since almost everyone on Wc3 play for ages. If your looking for fun games then there are some custom games.

There is indeed automated tournaments. 

As odd as it may sound more and more players are coming back on Wc3, I guess the news of a new patch and a HD version is doing is effect. The pro scene is also back in a good shape, with weekly cups and some great internationnal tournaments with huge cash prize.

NE is indeed a good race to begin with, the best thing you can do to train a race is to watch replays and streams (http://tft.w3arena.net/replays - twitch.tv wc3 channel is quite active too).

As said before, Blizzard is working on Wc3 again.

On B.net server you won't play a single day without meeting a maphacker, they're not a real problem if you're feeling confident in your skill but as a beginner I guess it will totally fuck up your games (there is also a latence of 1.5 seconde on every action). That's why i recommand you to play on servers like W3Arena (europe) or Netease (asia), where the ping is good and no hacker involved.

I hope it will help, welcome in the great WC3 Community !

That would have ended a lot quicker if the Israelis had acceded their demands and released the political prisoners.


Israel started the blockade because they were afraid of Hamas being a good government for Gaza and thus becoming popular in the West Bank.



In exchange for a deal, Israel will probably get less attacks and it will not be under increasingly mounting pressure from the international community. Eventually we (I am from the EU) will wind up sanctioning Israel, for occupying a state that almost all of us recognize for almost half a century. If you end the occupation there will be much less criticism, also it would be fulfilling the agreement you made in the 40s to provide for or compensate those who can't return home.

The Aztecs also used all of the tactics, such as slavery and mass execution, that you just condemned the Spanish for. In 1519 the Spanish empire was far larger as it included The Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Milan, The Two Sicilies, and the Low Counties and this was held by the authority and personal strength of Charles V. Along with that, the greatest power of Europe at the time, The Ottomans, allowed religious and ethnic freedom while even allowing minorities powerful opportunities in government through the Janisary system. They managed this through fair treatment of conquered people rather than brutal and mad religious executions. From any point of view, the Aztecs suffered from many of the same sins of any violently militaristic nation, including the Spanish, while having the added barbarism of ritualistic human sacrifice.

Rekthor,256,Games,czjniyy,0,t3_43oc1z,"If there's one thing that really amazes me about XCOM 2, it's that the guys and gals at Firaxis have found an immensely imaginative way of sequel-building in a way that totally subverts and circumvents the normal, carved-out way of making them: they actually made XCOM *lose* in the first game, and XCOM 2 picks up with the human race and Earth enthralled in the now-evolved alien race's clutches.

Other games have done this before, but not quite in the same way. Usually it was part of a linear story that left hooks open for a potential loss for ""our"" side in the sequel. But XCOM: EU not only did have a definitive ending where you win (and XCOM 2 takes place in a reality where you lost the game, because - and be honest - that happened to all of us), but it didn't have a story in the same way as more traditional games. You, the Commander, weren't a character at all: you were just a faceless, voiceless actor whom everyone relied upon to save the world. That wouldn't work if the game was attempting to give the game emotional stakes, but the only stakes in Enemy Unknown were ""go save the world,"" and making the Commander just a silent protagonist (and barely a protagonist at all), means that, they were in essence, *you.* You had a closer attachment to XCOM because *you* were in command of it.

And now, XCOM 2 is saying ""*you* weren't good enough, and *you* lost. Now, *you* get another shot."" Now, just a game developer being willing to **say** that to a player in this day and age of risk-averse publishers takes a massive amount of balls (which the devs were very much aware of, if you watch the interviews), but structuring a whole game around that thesis is a stroke of sly genius. Now, Firaxis gets to drop XCOM in an entirely new setting with new opportunities for gameplay (a moving base, concealment, etc.) and mechanics, only by being willing to tell the player that they weren't quite good enough the first time around and now they get to try again. Essentially, they've not only invited players who were turned off by EU's difficulty back, but they've given themselves a warrant to experiment on the fly with a whole new setting and whole new tones by tweaking this one, usually-absolute rule of ""don't ever tell the player they lost.""

That is a very clever, very unique and very ballsy way of sequel-building. I can't wait to see what they do with it.",,False,t3_43oc1z,,256,t5_2qhwp,False,1454333056,0,1458217599,

Unfortunately, America has ghettos and slums where the bulk of the violence and crime comes from. If Norway had those slums, they would think the order is a bit unique too. ",,False,t1_czjnopa,,491,t5_2qh13,False,1454334351,0,1458217848,

The Austrian school, on the other hand, only ever exists in theory. [Its arguments are circular](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm), and it has [never been borne out by history](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-nonsense-of-austerity/). [There just is no evidentiary case for the Austrian school](http://www.pragcap.com/understanding-why-austrian-economics-is-flawed/). Its predictions following the recession and QE and such were patently wrong, and the austerity efforts in Europe have not been the success they claimed, either. The Austrian school's lack of predictive power evinces its inaccuracy. No matter how much it ""makes sense"" on paper, it's not working out in the real world.

&gt;If i look at you (Presumable of European descent), and one if you're ""Chinese"" Americans shoulder to shoulder, i can tell that one of you is not natively from this country. 

That's another spurious claim you've made - the person who is of European descent could well be Armenian or French or Polish - not every white person in the world is American. 

&gt;It does not mean that they don't share American values and principles. All it means is that they are not ""fully"" integrated.

Put simply plate armour, and mail, and thick cloth armour (the sort that would be used as a primary defense) was proof against sword slashes. Thrusts from a sword were dangerous not so much because they could penetrate the armour but because thrusts could pierce through the joins and other gaps in armour if they were well-aimed.

Yeah I know, it was a throwaway, semi-tongue-in-cheek comment.

impactsilence,1,Gnostic,czjonss,0,t3_4265u4,"&gt; So it's very obvious that you are an Atheist here in the Gnostic subreddit trying to convince people that they are wrong for having faith in something. 

- That is so insulting I had to take a break to calm down. Are you sure what it means to be an atheist? And how atheism relates to gnosticism?

- I'm not very sure about this, but I think the only faith I have attacked so far as evil and inhuman is the Abrahamic system, including Christianity. I feel that you're just defending your faith blindly at this moment.

- I think I have very strong faith, but it is not blind and it tries to allow for my own inherent bias and ignorance. That's why I hesitate to formulate it and that's why I keep it to my self. This does not mean I am unable to share spiritual and mystical experiences with others, but for me the richness and polytopic/multiparadigmatic quality of the experience is as important as its other aspects. I feel better among people who don't try to convince others about specific faith systems and rather try to find common ground and a common language to give tips and reports.

&gt;  But I'll continue to answer your questions because deep down I know that there's a part of you that is dying for answers. 

- Yeah, that's why we're here having this conversation, isn't it? I am looking for questions just as much as I'm looking for answers, though. Even more, to be honest.

- I feel we have reached a point where I feel you kind of miss what I'm trying to say. You basicaly repeat your previous posts. Give me a definition of Demons or Archons, that would solve this problem. I'm not even sure how to reply to the middle part of your last post, sorry. I'll think about it a bit more, maybe something comes up.

&gt; There is enough of everything for everyone but it is people's Greed and other deadly sins that lead to the torment that those that suffer experience.

- I'm not sure how closely you follow the Decline/Divide debate, but our planet and our civilization are in overshoot since the 70s and it's slowly getting worse every year. Americans consume 10 times more energy than a typical contemporary human being, Europeas consume 6 times more energy. We're an unequal, inhuman species that loves to live in systems of hegemony, hierarchy, stratification and caste status. Just... you know... there's not reallz enough of everything for everyone anymore, that's the kind of thinking that created what you call greed. You see, this goes really deep... Abrahamic cults first destroyed Europe, then Africa and S. America roughly at the same time, then N. America and central Eurasia roughly at the same time... there's so much evil spawned and inflicted by people who talk about Jesus/Yeshua (and Moses and Muhammad) and so on that it makes me sick when they try to sound like gnostics... At best, Jesus was the Lovecraft of faith (even with the NHC and other materials included).

There simply weren't enough of them in the first place to have a major impact, they were actually designed for a series of social and biological experiments, not to preserve humanity, and many (perhaps even most) of them failed within a generation or two. Their biggest impact was likely as a storehouse for pre-war technology (the NCR bootstrapped itself off of the GECKs from Vault 8 and Vault City), but you hardly need the vaults for that: there's plenty of pre-war scavenging to be found in old libraries or military bases, too.

The bigger issue would be that there's simply *more* pre-war technology to recover in America. Prior to 2077, America was a much more robust and advanced economy than Europe, which had gone through a catastrophic economic (and possibly social) collapse following the Resource Wars a decade and a half earlier. The flip side, though, is that it's hard to imagine Europe getting hit as badly during the Great War itself: neither China or America was likely to waste *too* much of their time and arsenal targeting an economically depressed backwater of ""quarreling, bickering nation states"" (according to the *Fallout 1* introduction), so it probably wasn't scoured clean by nuclear fire quite as effectively as America. They also don't have the problem of FEV to worry about, so no super mutants, and fewer abominations all around.

Scrybblyr,1,news,czjou8j,0,t3_43jvxc,"The far-right is basically pretending that the governments in Europe are somehow in collusion with migrants to facilitate mass rape. Or something.
Uhhh.. no. Far-right guy here. We don't think the governments in Europe are somehow in collusion with migrants to facilitate mass rape. In face, we KNOW that the naiive internationalist policies of the relatively leftist governments in question have led to self-destructive policies which may prove to be their undoing. They are beginning to open their eyes and understand the existential threat they have inflicted upon themselves, and are beginning to crack down and some are even beginning to remove immigrants... Hope that gives you a more nuanced insight into the views of the far right... at least more nuanced than the tired old xenophobia line.

""In reality Europe has dealt with this kind of shit before and survived. That something appears difficult at the moment doesn't mean it is an existential threat. Europe is more likely to collapse because of its own economic problems then because of migrants. And no, before you say it, migrants are not the source of those problems. Neoliberalism is.""

Perhaps we should define our terms bit. When I say existential threat - I mean that it may cease to exist as a European country. If a European country is overrun by immigrants to the point where it is a mostly Muslim country - that country has ceased to exist as a European country. Your knowlege of the geopolitical system called Islam may be too limited to understand that, but I wanted to define it for the purpose of our discussion.

""I might add there's no ""removing"" migrants without massive violence.""

That would be the problem of those countries who have been stupid enough to allow the invasion in the first place. But it wasn't my decision, talk to Sweden: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35425735

""Because the process of deporting people back to a fucking warzone is violent. Which is something people like yourself either refuse to acknowledge or just don't care about.""

What needs to happen is that safe zones need to be created so that the people don't have to leave in the first place. (Or to which people can be relocated once the safe zones are established.) It is an incredible failure on the part of the United States and the world that this has not already happened. Our predecessors, the ones who defeated the Nazis, damn sure would not have allowed this evil to go on as long as it has, or to take as many lives as it has. But if you elect the worst president in American history, there are bad consequences. 

""You people are xenophobes.""

Yawn. 

""That you can claim you think migrants are an 'existential threat' and that you aren't a xenophobe in the same post is baffling to me.""

Nah. Got a few thousand immigrants who need to come here from Sweden? From China? Japan? Poland? India? Put them through a vetting process and let's talk. The fact that you don't understand the difference when we're talking about Islamist hotbed countries belies your ignorance of the topic at hand. If you want to apply the label ""Islamaphobe,"" then so be it. You are using all the other talking points, you might as well add that one. 

""This is the west's foreign policy fuckups coming home to roost.""

The actions of Islamist nations and individuals is about conquest. Not revenge for some unfair policy. Google ""First Barbary War.""

""We're not living in a world where we can bomb everybody else and expect it to stay far away.""

Again, you are putting the cart before the horse. 

""I hate to break it to you but isolationism is dead and will stay dead.""

Good. Isolationism is bad. 

""So with that in mind you either act humanely or you just become something far uglier.""

Humane is fine. One can be humane (safe zones) without being suicidal (Germany.)

slyabney,3,germany,czjou9v,0,t3_43oa5c,"I think there might be further issues here due to your marriage that may just have to be cleared at the office.  The website says:

""As an EU citizen you do not have a legal entitlement to attend an integration course. However, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees can allow you to attend an integration course if you do not yet speak adequate German, if you have particular integration needs and if there are places available on the course. You should complete an application for admission to an integration course. ""

If they are considering you an EU citizen by virtue of your marriage, you may need to fill out the form to apply for a course. This would then enable you to get the certificate to pay the 1,55 Euro rate.  

Your best course of action is probably to find a native speaker to take with you to get sorted and/or fill out the application to send it for approval.  http://www.bamf.de/EN/Willkommen/DeutschLernen/Integrationskurse/TeilnahmeKosten/EUBuerger/eubuerger-node.html

Timezone:Eu

PvP (/10 - It would be good if you told us your best elo, either on BL or, I'm good in the pvp department I think I would say around 7.5 to 8

Practice2.0): I don't play any of those ones but I play para and my elo is 1.3, I also had that elo on kohi before they reset it.

BB (/10):  I rate my self a 7 because I do the stuff that has to be done like making farms brewing grinding out lootings etc etc so like all those kids of things that the faction need to be set and be ready for pvp etc

Mining (/10): i mine a lot I will always mine the weekly mining trip but if I don't have anything to do i will go mine and get like a half stack of d ores. So in this case I think I would say 8 in the mining skills.

Past Factions: on hcteams I have not played with any known power FACS only a un known power fac but on kohi I have played with Europe, Beachboys, nightmare, n9ne, Tokyo and a duo fac twilight 

Past Betrayls: none, i have never betrayed a faction.

Why you and not others? I think you should chose me because I'm a chill guy in the ts and I will follow your orders, I don't quick drop or anything like that I like to pvp I am very active like around 2-4 hours from Monday to Thursday and the rest like all day.. I will mine for the fac maybe brew pots and all things inside the base.

TheGuineaPig21,7,justneckbeardthings,czjprwv,0,t3_43kh5m,"&gt; The Aztecs were is a constant state of religious wars due to the Flower wars.

The Flower Wars weren't constant. They happened on and off, with relatively small forces committed. 

&gt; While not as destructive as the Thirty Years War or the French Wars of Religion, they can probably be considered morally worse as they had no real purpose but to kill for the sake of killing without any sort of end goal.

This is a kind of presentism, and again shows your frame of reference. War to obtain sacrificial captives was just as religiously motivated as, say, the Holy Roman Emperor seeking to press Catholicism on Bohemia. The end goal to the Mexica wasn't to ""kill for the sake of killing"", but to perpetuate a religious ritual they believed important to the success of their culture and civilization. Not that that was the only motivation of course, as there were plenty of political advantages to these actions - but the same is true again for many of Europe's religious conflicts.

&gt;The Ottomans, allowed religious and ethnic freedom while even allowing minorities powerful opportunities in government through the Janisary system. They managed this through fair treatment of conquered people rather than brutal and mad religious executions.

True, but there are lots of things outsiders would find bizarre and cruel about Ottoman practices - someone from Mexico might find the practices of the Janissary corps to be barbaric, for example. 

&gt;From any point of view, the Aztecs suffered from many of the same sins of any violently militaristic nation, including the Spanish, while having the added barbarism of ritualistic human sacrifice.

The first I definitely agree with. The latter... human sacrifice is understandably looked down upon in modern society, but I don't think it was particularly cruel or barbaric compared to other forms of ritual violence. In any public square in Europe you could've found religious heretics, or political enemies, or just petty criminals publicly tortured and executed in exceedingly grotesque ways. I just don't see how sacrificing a captured enemy warrior in the hope of a good harvest is any way morally inferior to burning someone at the stake because they disagreed with infant baptism.

&gt;If you were arguing for say the Iroquois or Huron confederacies then I could see where they could be seen as more civilised than many European cultures, but the Aztecs were born in blood and reigned in murder.

I don't think the other indigenous groups of the Americas were any more inherently ""civilized"" or whatever than Europeans either. In general I think humans are mostly the same. Specific circumstances and pressures can lead them to do one thing or the other, but I think it's wrong to make sweeping assumptions of their basic nature.",,False,t1_czjmxcv,,7,t5_2xp02,False,1454337944,0,1458218658,

Yeah, I don't get that - are you all just not that into the idea of it?  I mean, it seems like a good idea that nobody except maybe Germany really wants to commit to.

&gt; Also, we have those same differences you have within your country within our own countries. There are dialect regions, differences in architecture, traditions, food... 

I literally had this conversation last week, almost word for word, with someone else here.  We too can open the nesting doll that is our ""States"" and find smaller units inside, with their own regional proclivities.  While the comparisons aren't picture-perfect, they work well enough. There is no ""equals sign"" here, it's just rough comparisons.  Germany, for instance, since it is quite large, would be like California and Texas combined.  While a State like New Jersey has almost double the population of Ireland.  I'm sorry if it's uncomfortable for you to be compared to the U.S. in any way shape or form, but the rough comparisons are there.  Though from what I can see, the E.U. set up is more like what we had under the [Articles of Confederation](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1776-1783/articles).  We had to abandon that set up for one with more power to the central government, in order to do things like centralize our currency, military and taxation practices.  Not doing that would have resulted in the dissolution of our union into 13 nations.  For Americans, who had to learn about that in our history classes, we see a lot of similarities to the current day E.U.  Obviously things are different in 2015, and you have the burden of a much longer history to deal with, but the similarities are there.

The Norse were not writing at the time they were expanding. They minimally used runes, but they did not keep records. The earliest written sources about the settlement of Greenland come from Iceland and are written down in the 12th and 13th century. 

As for the knowledge, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It is unlikely that those who frequently sailed in the North Atlantic had no knowlegde whatsoever of lands beyond Iceland/Greenland. It was always known in Iceland, Norway and Denmark that there had been settlements in Greenland. 

Although Columbus ""discovery"" was not really a discovery, it still was a huge historical event from many perspectives. It was the first direct trip directly across the Atlantic. It had a huge cultural and economic meaning. It was the first lasting connection between European and American cultures. 

In the high north, both Europeans and American natives were living on the edge of what was possible. The settlement in Greenland could not really survive without regular trading with the rest of Europe. The population was perhaps 2.000. On the American side, we had the Dorset Culture, whom very little is known about because the Thule culture drove them to extinction. Those cultures were both were spread and had limited contact further south to the rest of America. 

The distance from Greenland to ""Vinland"" was also almost the same as the distance between Greenland and Norway. What was there to get which was not available in Norway. 

About this, I know very little, but discovering America is not enough. You also need a financial powerhouse to fund expeditions and exploration. Technology in ship building matters. Navigational technique matters. Knowlegde of long distance trade matters. Did Europe really have these conditions for a long time before Colombus ""discovered"" America?

I was speaking in terms of how parties / political groups are classified in Europe. I agree that this classification isn't ideal but that's a whole discussion for itself.

&gt; This isn't categorically crazy

I disagree, it's totally absurd that there will be no immigration and they never even presented a plan how this is supposed to be possible. Look at the US, they can't even stop immigration and their border is tiny compared to Europe. Also the far right started out with crazy nonsense from the beginning on, like claiming that there is a conspiracy against them and that Muslims want to take over Europe.

&gt; far left who simply say everyone can come in. It's basically the same idea. 

I already said I don't support the far left but people seem to miss the point that welcoming doesn't mean that they can stay here. Refugee status is something you need to apply for and is temporary. No major left wing party suggest that we hand out passport and get rid of the refugee application process.

&gt; with the huge amount of sexual assaults, robberies and other crimes going on 

Seriously, this is been massively exaggerated and the far right was literally celebrating every crime so that they can bash immigrants. Also a lot of the reports now start to turn out to be wrong. Anyway, the overwhelming majority of immigrants doesn't commit crimes and I agree that everyone that does should get kicked out. But then again, most people agree with that but the far right claims that we need to kick out all immigrants because some committed crimes.

&gt; Bill Maher is a bit of a twat but his opinion about Muslims is pretty clear

I'm an atheist myself but Bill Maher is a bigot when it comes to Islam and I can't take him serious. Also you can't just apply a ""1 in 8"" is a radial formula to people, that's not how statistics works.

&gt; Let's also not forget that the vast majority aren't refugees from warzones but simply Northern Africans and/or from other regions which aren't designated as dangerous. They shouldn't have been in Europe to begin with and certainly not in West Europe but the left allowed this to happen.

I don't think it's very relevant whether they are economic immigrants or not. Europe simply ignores the reality that people will always come here due to high difference in wealth and safety compared to other place in Africa/Middle East. We should find a solution to deal with this instead of pretending that we can just ignore it.

&gt; allow other politicians to put the blame on the girls that they got assaulted and robbed, for the police to ignore the refugees and literally just looked at the camera's without acting and I could go on.

I think this is mainly far right wing conspiracy nonsense. If anything the NYE were over-reported and exaggerated. I mean it literally has been the main topic in the news for weeks. It's just because immigrants, sexuality and women combined are basically a jackpot to start a emotional debate.",,False,t1_czjidxx,,0,t5_2qh3l,False,1454339482,0,1458219051,

svansson,5,AskHistorians,czjquco,0,t3_43mqi3,"The objective of the expeditions to ""Vinland"" was almost certainly exploration rather than settlement. They would have been looking out for human populations, lumber, hunting grounds for meat and fur etc. The settlement in L´Anse Meadaux for example is conveniently located for sailing into several directions. There was not much livestock there, but plenty of storage houses. They probably had several ships systematically exploring and going back, collecting food or resources of value before heading back to Greenland, Iceland or Norway. 

The Norse had always been making long journeys by boat alongside Norway (whose name in norse literally means the road to the north) and also into Eastern Europe. After the exploration of the North American coast they probably journied every summer further north in Greenland for hunting and possibly trading with the natives.

In terms of having the best players, sure. City have far and away better players than Man Utd. But that's the point. City actually have the best squad in the entire league. Which was the same situation Pep found himself in at Barca, and the same situation he pursued by going to Bayern. 

This isn't about asking a big name manager to go work in the Conference League, I'm talking about him taking on the Man Utd job. Which was where the real challenge was, and where he REALLY would have been able to put his managerial ability to a test.

Insofar as Syrian refugees are crossing the ocean, they're doing so by leapfrogging to more stable Europe first, which makes it inapplicable to *Fallout*'s 23rd century: there's no wealthy, stable society for Tenpenny to row a dinghy to and subsequently hop on a jet to DC. If Europe is as bad as suggested, he wouldn't have much choice but to try to scrounge for his survival back home.

Well obviously. r/worldnews has become a European anti-immigrant subreddit 24/7 recently. I actually understand that more than this crap, though, because they're getting far more immigration than Europe has had before. And what the hell does this story have to do with immigrants? It doesn't.

Yes, because they're rare and kill far fewer people than other random street violence. By that logic we should ban poor people from having kids because they're more likely to kill you.

&gt;And you believe I am insensitive!

For fuck's sake **YES**. You've demonstrated not only ignorant generalizations about a culture you're not a part of and have little experience with, but you propose an aggressively discriminatory policy against thousands to solve a problem where only a handful are guilty.

&gt;You are ignoring just about everything that matters

Everything that matters? I care about the values of religious freedom and non-discrimination. Those matter to me. You can claim ""security"" but your proposal does next to nothing for it.

There, all the cafes have similar menus - seafood, risotto, octopus salad, etc. A lot of them served this tuna spread as an appetizer (that you put on bread) - it's really good. At this particular cafe, the tuna spread was particularly interesting-tasting. It had some spice or herb that I had never tasted before (I'm a pretty adventurous eater and have eaten many other things in the Balkans, Eastern Europe etc.) and neither my mom nor I could figure out what it was. We were commenting on the interesting taste and not being able to tell what the ingredients were. Anyway, so I was eating this along with octopus salad. Within about 15 minutes I started feeling really weird: extremely dizzy, the inside of my mouth and head was itching and then my skin all over started itching as well. I felt really out of it, hot all over my body, I became flushed and had a panicked feeling. I had no idea what was going on and I told my mom how sick I was feeling. While I sat down in an air conditioned bookstore, my mom ran to a pharmacy and explained to the pharmacist my symptoms (fortunately this happened in Europe!) and the pharmacist gave her some kind of anti-allergy pill. I took it and soon felt better. It was a scary experience.

When I got back home, I told my regular doctor about the whole incident and she said it was definitely an anaphylactic reaction and if it had happened here she would have recommended I go to the hospital. She prescribed me an Epi-Pen which I carried around for the next 2 years, but it never happened again. I still have absolutely no idea what I'm allergic to.

I also know (white) people in their 20s and 30s who think women should not work and have children at the same time.

Calfurious,1,news,czjrawg,0,t3_43jvxc,"You aren't. Making. Any. Points. To. Address. Any points you're making is essentially you just saying don't bring up Christians when talking about Muslims.

Also Trump isn't even tackling the Muslim issues. He's just spouting a load of bullshit that won't even accomplish anything of worth. For example banning Muslim immigration? The vast majority of domestic terrorist attacks are from Muslim BORN in the country of the terrorist attack. They are citizens, not foreigners trying to wreck havoc. However Donald Trump's voters are too stupid to know that. Hell that's a common theme around many of Trump's statements and arguments. They won't accomplish anything because Trump has a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues. Which isn't surprising, seeing as Trump is neither a politician nor an intellectual and therefore is just about as informed about these topics as the average American (which means not at all).

Also right-wing movements are rising in Europe because of the fact that racists and bigots NEVER went away in the first place. That's a mistake that the general public failed to realize, the racists didn't disappear, they simply went back into the shadows. The ""PC and liberals"" were right the entire time, racism was still plenty strong in the western world it was just waiting for the right moment to strike (IE, the current problems with Muslims is the perfect opportunity to pray on people's fears).

I am angry. You are right. But that's because i'm literally flabbergasted at the fact that you can't honestly see the flaws in your thinking and that you're actually trying to praise DONALD TRUMP for seemingly tackling issues. It's like if a person traveled back in time and argued with a person who said they supported McArthy because he was rooting out communists. Your inability to detect complete bullshit is astounding. No wait it isn't, because it seems you tend to say complete bullshit yourself.

Also any serious debate should be moderated to ensure respectful and meaningful dialogue between both parties. However the problem here is that most people tend to have this weird idea that just because they have an opinion and a statement, that means they're able to a serious debate and deserve to have their opinion respected. News Flash. IT doesn't. You're entitled to your opinion, you are not entitled for your opinion to be respected. Which is something that many right-wing groups always fail to realize when they're constantly rejected by academic community (and they then scream nonsense about liberal bias and government coverups). You only deserve to have your views respected when you actually make some arguments and points that are worthy to be respected. So far you have done neither. You have made piss poor arguments that sound like they were made by some middle aged member of stormfront. You endorse a politician who routinely misunderstand issue and is currently misleading millions of people who are under the impression that he's some hero tackling issues because he isn't being ""PC"".  Shit he isn't even bringing the most attention to the SERIOUS issues in our country, like the fact that we've became an Ogliarchy instead of a Democracy. Despite all of Bernie Sanders flaws, at least he's able to point out that the most powerful and wealthiest country in the world that has enough bombs capable of ending all of human civilization is now being run by corporations whose only goal is profit by any means necessary. In that context of that situation, terrorism and immigration are quite honestly side issues. Of course the political and wealthy elite in society don't want you to pay attention to that fact so they create nonsense like ""trying to fight political correctness!"" to distract morons from the fact that the people have literally lost control of their own country.

Political correctness isn't an issue. It's at it's VERY WORSE, annoying and unnecessary. If Right Wing groups really wanted to solve actual issues, they'd stop focusing on PC and start focusing on actual relevant issues like the influence that huge corporations seems to have in this world. Of course that in itself would be problematic seeing as many of these right wing groups tend to get funding from large corporations or ARE large corporations themselves. Right-Wing groups don't want you paying to much attention to the real issues, because then you'd realize that many of them are just shills.

lotharofthehillpeeps,0,europe,czjrb56,0,t3_43las1,"by the way, both my father and my best friend speak fluent Russian. Things aren't always what they may seem, and its not so easy to just put people in a little box. 

But alright, first, I wasn't being serious when I said Russia is responsible for the Taliban. I think Afghans are full stop. It's very common for the European left to look at fascists in the ME and say 'they don't mean it' or 'they don't know any better' or 'its not their fault they're fascists - it's *our* fault!', and I think thats a very racist position to hold. You say America (who people love to blame for everything under the sun) is to blame for the ecxistence of the taliban, and I disagree. 

&gt;Maybe we should allow Russians to dump modern weapons, tactical equipment and a nuclear warhead or two to Syrian government, instead of simply supporting it

You don't think Russia has sent Asad modern weapons and tactical equipment? Are you crazy? 

&gt;There are radical movement in almost every country. Those are kept in check because rarely they have access to any meaningful arsenals or resources

Where did the taliban get all of its weapons and ammunition? Again, you're crazy to infer that the taliban is today using weapons and ammunition given to the mujahadeen by the US. The taliban gets their aks and ak ammo on the black market, and the US does not manufacturre ak47's. Where do they get them from? You tell me. 

&gt;First of all: USSR, not Russia. No matter what the US propaganda says those are two different countries. 

Of course the USSR was not a 'country' but I let that go because English isn't your first language. But you're crazy if you don't think Russia, which was as much the USSR as the US is NATO, wasn't the force behind the Soviet's invasion of Afghanistan. Are you *really* trying to say that Russia isn't the country to blame for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan????? I've literally never heard that Russia wasn't in charge of Soviet Union policy before. 

&gt; we actually celebrated independence from USSR every year.

My father's country too. If they would have caught him escaping they would have sent him to the gulag. 

&gt;The reason it's still a smoldering ruin is because no one is willing to allow Afghans to figure solutions for their own problems.

So you want the US to leave tomorrow. What will happen then? Civil war, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands dead by the rend of the year. Or do you think all Afghanistan needs for peace is somehow simply for the US to leave, and Afghanistan the next day would turn into a hippy love and dope paradise? What are you basing the premesis of your opinions on? Your personal random guesses, shaped by Russian media?

&gt;They don't even have a real government at the moment, just puppets.

The taliban were a real government of Afghanistan, and there's no way you would call them US puppets. They are also armed to the teeth with many guns and bullets made after the end of the cold war and are willing to die - so you would support a taliban government? Or at least the fighting of a civil war of epic proportions? And you call yourself anti-war?

&gt;Can't or don't want? You position is clear: ""We did nothing wrong"" ""We are the good guys"" ""Evil Russians doing evil things because they're evil"" ""Axis of evil"" etc. etc.

This is just rediculous blabbering. I could make fun of you too, but I don't want to stoop to your level. 

&gt;However, it's not uncommon even among American students who come to Germany to study. Even after spending 5 years studying in the same auditorium with a few, I'm still amazed with the way they teach modern history in the US.

You makre this jump in your post to this, just to insult Americans. But you know what I know? I know that Americans don't spend five years studying in Europe, we do it one semester, as a study abroad during a bachelor, or at the most three semesters during a masters. So you have spent five years at the same university with zero Americans- we don't go to Germany for an entire bachrelors, except if the person is a dual citizen. So why infer you've spent five years with the same person/people from the US. 

And you want to know what else I know? Americans don't really interact much with preople of slavic background with an attitude like you have- we can smell it a mile away. Know how I know? I too studied in Germany for quite some time, and it was apparent in a day or two, who the student or students were, who were from former USSR countries, who held anti-American views. Its really obvious, even though I'm sure you tricked everybody (you tricked nobody). You were one of these guys who nobody really talked to that much or showed that much interest in, right? Thought so. 

And finally, I wonder how it was that you were able to afford all those years studying? Did you have a job that paid all of your exprenses, like very few university students did? Or were you at least partially paid by the German state with a generous scholarship? Whether you were or not, the least you could do to repay the kindness of the German state for all they have given you, would have been to study hard enough that you learn about how the world actually works instead of just doing barely well enough and solidifying your own anti-globalist views!

[deleted],1,GGdiscussion,czjrchh,0,t3_43a6kn,"&gt; those are not defining characteristics of racism; those are defining characteristics of a subcategory of racism usually deliniated by [term for race in Question]-supremacy. And those are definetly not defining factors of the defenition of racism you've been arguing for the first 3 replys and now suddelny switched.

Of course those are the defining characteristics of racism. Racism as a term was used to describe the notion of racial superiority. Saying racism isn't to do with this notion is silly. From the *first line* in Wikipedia 

&gt; Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the **belief that one's own race is superior.**

Racism never excluded the concept of racial supremacy, the term was invented to describe this attitude FFS. You seem to be arguing it does because some people ignorant of what racial supremacy was used racism to just mean not liking some other race and those people are where you got your definition from.

&gt; you need to look around more. i'm not from or living in the US, i've never seen that defenition outside of a US feminist fb group, TiA links and ghazi; 

Well then you need to get out more. This is a wide spread and common knowledge in Europe. Maybe cut down on the alt-right websites.

&gt; And you are the first person to argue in such a way that white-supremacy would stop being racist if in an alternate reality the US were 80% black with black people in most positions of power.

I've not idea what that is supposed to refer to. Up to know all you have done is say that in a black neighbour black people can be racist to white people.",,False,t1_czjqu1c,,1,t5_3a3as,False,1454340748,0,1458219468,

Islamist are just a tiny minority. Most Muslims don't want a caliphate, in fact most of them are running away from groups like ISIS.

&gt; I know demographics trends

Actually the trend is that Europe is overaged and needs immigration to sustain the population.

&gt; That the cultures of these nations is not getting fundamentally changed?

There is no such thing. Cultures change all the time. And there is nothing wrong with that. In fact it seems rather that people that have an issue with change have a problem. Because even without immigration the culture changes. It's ridiculous to complain this because even if you are a very conservative and traditional person now then you are still very different from someone e.g. 100 years ago.

&gt; That Islamists are not achieving their goals?

Taking over Europe? No, they aren't achieving their goal, not even close. Actually most immigrants don't care about Islamists but come here because they are looking for a better life.

&gt; That a global caliphate would actually be a good thing

Obviously I'm not in favor of that but the idea is just absurd. I mean look at it from the other point of view. How much did the West influence other cultures?

Also in Europe the employees in general pay for HC with a tax that goes from their true gross salary (gross+% of costs shifted to the employers side), so from employers point of view it's a wash and they couldn't care less.

The thing that has kept a WWIII from happening is the European Union which was made as a result of the destruction of the world wars as the countries involved did not want to relive the carnage again.


I think it is ridiculous of talking of WWIII with Russia at the forefront. There could be WWIII if the EU fails and fragments (maybe in part due to Russian dynamism) or there could be a 2nd Cold War (let's say Lukewarm War, because the Cold War had the Soviet sphere of influence reaching all the way out to Berlin while now the Russian sphere of influence ends around the middle of Ukraine).",,False,t3_43n15f,,2,t5_2qyt6,False,1454341124,0,1458219579,

**Author**: Voltaire

**Avg Rating**: 3.75 by 127558 users

**Description**: Brought up in the household of a powerful Baron, Candide is an
open-minded young man, whose tutor, Pangloss, has instilled in him the
belief that 'all is for the best'. But when his love for the Baron's
rosy-cheeked daughter is discovered, Candide is cast out to make his own
way in the world. And so he and his various companions begin a
breathless tour of Europe, South America and Asia, as an outrageous
series of disasters befall them - earthquakes, syphilis, a brush with
the Inquisition, murder - sorely testing the young hero's optimism.

It might perhaps be a possibility to have a unified state at some point but for that to have any chance to succeed without the need for supression of dissent it needs the natural tribal groups to build trust and have a large degree of local autonomy. Europe went through centuries of this and we have only recently started to work together (and even then we have differences of opinion)

I can see the attraction of a united large country but it only works in the long term if people feel secure that their local identity will not be compromised. Power needs to be exercised as close to the local level as much as possible for the citizens of a state to feel it is for them rather then over them.",,False,t1_czjqv17,,2,t5_2x5s1,False,1454341453,0,1458219674,

It's recommended you change your location to there, even if you aren't actually from there.

1st thing that comes into my mind after i read ur text is a fight i had yesterday against a Destroyer. 

Fight starts and he goes for the cat. He beats her down and ignores me. I thought wtf and started doing some dmg to him. I let the cat die and wanted to see what he would do next. Ofc he goes after me i stealth and run to the other side of arena. Do the petal resummon dance and thought: ""Well thistime he will go for me surely!"" But NO. He went for the cat again!

Ofc he died short after and in the round after that he just sat there doing nothing...

Idk man. Everyone who cries about summoner should just make one themselfs check the skills try one or two arena games after lvl 30 and understand how the class works. 

U can beat summoners pretty easy if u just understand the skills they are using. I mean u would not hit a sin while he/she is countering or try to cc a spinning destroyer xD

Unfortunately, we've just sacked one of the best tacticians out there and the other two best managers will be at Bayern and City.

Britons don't want to be part of a Federal Europe and want to take a tougher stance on immigration. These are reasonable exceptions IMO, especially considering not every country wants to follow ""European convergence""; just look at Euro countries. All EU countries are supposed to use the Euro, but thats not going to happen for a long time.

&gt; How can the Union respect itself if it completely dismantles everything it stood for to appease the island nation that is off and on Europe?

An exception is not the same as a ""complete dismantling"".

The majority of Britons simply don't want to be part of anymore convergence, but they want to retain membership of the EU. The solution to this is a [two tier system as espoused by the leading European Federalist in the European Parliament (leader of ALDE and founder of the Spinelli Group) Guy Verhofstadt](http://www.politico.eu/article/an-eu-for-full-members-only/) (you've probably heard of him seeing as youre a Belgian ;)).

Passing is even encouraged, because when you get a long line of cars, passing becomes dangerous. Here in Europe we have additional lines for overtaking when it's uphill, so trucks do not slow traffic down, while trying to climb it.  
I've had a lot of cases where a semi is slowing down traffic, and you get impatient drivers everywhere around you trying to get ahead and doing dangerous maneuvers. Crashes happen so often from those conditions, that I've learned to stay way behind, and wait for a long straight stretch of road, or if I see a semi appearing from a hill or a curve, I start preparing for evasive maneuvers.  
So many bad drivers on the road, it's unbelievable.

Con:  Fragile, non-warranty (not avail in US), camera app can be faster, slower updates

A lot of people don't think the camera is that great but I think otherwise.  I was just in Europe for work and play for 20 days and was taking great shots.  My friend who has a IPhone 6P was amazed at the shots I was taking.  I think the camera review has been mixed online but I think it has to deal with a learning curve.  I wasn't sold on the camera till this trip where I got a good chance to learn the way it works and took enough shots to be confident in it.

When I first got the phone it would heat up a lot but after 2 weeks of regular use it rarely gets hot.  There might be some truth to the phone needing to learn it's user.  

I highly suggest getting front and back tempered glass.  If you tend to drop your phone a lot, I would also get a case for it.

Lubyak,20,AskHistorians,czjti9u,0,t3_43ou26,"The Holy Roman Empire (HRE) offered many things to its members, and its non-electoral princes had their own role to play within the legal structure of the Empire. 

Perhaps first and foremost was external and internal security. For threats outside of the Empire, such as the French or Swedes encroaching on its borders, or the classic threat of the Turks to Christendom, the Empire was intended to provide a united front of princes under the Emperor. The Princes of the Empire had obligations to provide soldiers for the defence of the Empire in general. Declarations of *Reichskrieg*--I'm sorry, I just love that term--could thus meet an externtal threat, and allow even the smallest Imperial prince to rely on the protection of the Emperor and the Empire as a whole if they came under threat from an external power. Of course, the effectiveness of this system is up for debate. 

Even within the Empire, security was an important role. The *Reichsreform* resulted in the declaration of the 'Public Peace'. Essentially, this system was meant to outlaw the use of force to settle disputes within the Empire, and require princes to settle their disputes through a legal process--much like most modern states require their citizens. The Imperial Circles were drawn up to promote and enforce the Public Peace, and the Imperial Aulic Council (*Reichshofrat*) was established to serve as a supreme judicial body for settlement of disputes between the princes. This, of course, was meant to promote stability and security within the Empire, by preventing the princes from resorting to force of arms--justified by claims of right to revenge/vendetta--and binding them to basically go through an arbitration process. 

So, as we can see, there was certainly a benefit to being a member of the Empire, rather than just being a random prince of a small polity in the heart of the Europe, without the protection of the Empire. The Empire provided security against external threats, by ensuring that the Empire could provide forces to the Emperor for their own defence, and security internally, by binding the princes into a legal structure to resolve their disputes rather than merely allowing themselves to fight over it. In addition to all of this, the Empire--effectively--provided a government structure above that of the individual princedom. 

To understand this, let us turn to the *Reichstag*, or Imperial Diet as it is often translated. The Diet was the gathering of the estates of the Empire, and to hold a seat in the Diet, was to be a true Imperial Estate. The Estates are best seen as a convention of the Emperor's direct subjects, who could then discuss and present recommendations to the Emperor. The Emperor could then approve of their recommendations to transform it into Imperial law. The Diet could vote the Emperor money or soldiers to meet a threat, among other issues. The Diet consisted of different 'Colleges': the Electoral College, which of course consisted of the Prince Electors; the College of Imperial Princes, which consisted of the non-electoral princes, both secular and ecclesiastical; and the College of Cities, which consisted of the Imperial Free Cities. The Free Cities were a later addition to the Diet, and were inferior to the Electoral and Princely colleges for a long time. 

As such, as we can see, the Imperial Princes had a voice in the government of the Empire as a whole. This resulted in what was essentially a diarchy between the Princes of the Empire and the Emperor, with both relying on each other in their own way or manner. The Emperor needed the princes to give their approval for his wars and policies, while the princes relied on the Emperor to provide a centrepoint and the enforcement of the laws and policy of the Empire. As such, the Empire did provide advantages to the average Imperial prince, both in terms of garunteeing their own physical security, and of increasing their own imporance by giving them a voice in the government of the wider Empire as a whole.

I just wanted to point out, despite the fraudulent behaviours of former greek governments and the massive corruption problems. there are just as well other factors that play important parts. The policies inflicted on Greece that didn't tackle corruption at all (probably because it runs deep in Eurogroup as well) while introducing harsh policies for the actual economy, the fault of the eurozone construction itself and the political powerplay over the Grexit. (I wouldn't have heard that a state of the US would be threatened to be fiscally abandoned, or Berlin ejected from Germany... If rich regions don't want to pay anymore, it's them who need to state their independence, not bullying anyone out of a given union). While it is valid point that maybe Greece shouldn't have been in the union at all because of the fraud it's also a denial of the facts (Greece is in the Union + it is not the one who has profited most from being in, otherwise it could have easily payed back all the loans, once Greece was in, it was a European Problem, not a greek one. Thus it's no use in punishing Greece as an Economy. If one is to be punished, it's the people who profited illegally.)

What I want to point out especially: At one point it was the economic rational decision to import yogurt from Germany rather than producing it right there in Greece. Why?

I could constantly unplug and re-plug devices where it's possible or get a hub (a decent USB 3 hub is 30-50$), but I rather have a few extra ports to have headroom for the future. Personally I won't need extra PCIe slots but the one M.2 slot will be occupied from the beginning (looking at you oh sexy 950 PRO), so I would not have any space for a later upgrade.  
2. I think we agree here. For gaming only, I'd go with a 6600k instead (like I hinted at in my original answer) and I see no CPU bottlenecking with any of the I7/Xeon options.  
3. You are right, the 80W is over the 6700 non K variant (75W actually). I haven't really looked into real power consumption comparisons, I've just read that the Skylakes are great in low load/idle every day scenarios (like &lt; 4W idle) and their max TDP is 50/75W less, so I assumed the power draw under load is also lower. I'll have to look into this  
4. Well true, but then again, my current CPU, a 3770, is going for ~560$ new. The old CPUs' production capacities get reduced while the labs switch production to the new one, one by one. Here in Europe the 5820k is actually 50€ more expensive than the 6700k. The 6700k prices should go down over time as production ramps up, the 5820k might go down for a while but eventually it will go up as supply will go down.   

I don't really like the E3 Xeons, they are getting a little old and they are missing useful everyday features in hardware like audio/video/picture de/encoding. You need to go up to at least 1271 models to get comparable performance. They are amazing for multi core best-value builds though (where you sacrifice some power and features to get the price down).  
  
Sorry for the long read, I will probably post my build plans in this subreddit soon.  
I'm building a new Workstation  
(development that requires 2-3 IDEs running, 1-3 VMs (mostly vagrant/virtualbox 1-2GB Linux boxes), some video conversions, light but frequent compiling etc).  
It should be able to do at least 1920x1200 gaming maxed out / it should be Oculus ready so there is a certain gaming performance need as well.
  
So my profile is a little different, I'm aiming for 32GB ram and an i7 in a quiet system that has low power consumption (at least in ""work mode"").  
  
Price isn't a primary concern but I don't want to blow 2000€ on an overpowered system I don't utilize, ... I always have other stuff I can spend that money on ;).",,False,t1_czjdmvg,,1,t5_2rnve,False,1454344211,0,1458220523,

Age: 12, I don't Think the age really matters though, aslong as you're mature &amp; not being childish then I guess it's fine.

Timezone: CET (Central European Time) I'm from Sweden.

Past Factions: PainTrain, Infamous, Spain, Hooked, solo's &amp; duo's on Kohi. On HcTeams I've only been in small factions like 3-6 people or solo &amp; duo.

PvP x/10 (Including kohi elo): 7/10. I can hold 1v1's decently, I don't quickdrop, I'm really good in teamfights, will listen to callouts. My kohi elo right now is 1220 global. If you want I can get my elo up a bit, but currently I have 1220 global.

Basebitch: 8/10, I will be able to basebitch alot, I will brew pots, build the base unless we've got a builder. I will also mine Daily to make the faction rich.

Communication: I don't scream in teamspeak, never. I listen to the leaders &amp; all callouts. I can communicate decently,  I can give coords whenever etc. So I'd rate myself 8/10.

Classes (Diamond, Archer, Bard): I prefer Diamond but I'm pretty good bard &amp; Archer aswell. But I do indeed prefer Diamond as class.",,1454345539,t3_43orm4,,1,t5_326m9,False,1454344224,0,1458220527,

Anonate,-1,PoliticalDiscussion,czjtoi5,0,t3_43nyzs,"I see your point on the ""half a graph."" It might be closer to 1/3rd though. Clinton is pretty centrist relative to politics in the last 50 years- the US has moved a bit to the right. 

Authoritarian seems to be geared toward ""restrictions on personal liberty."" That's my take on it, anyway. So things like gun rights and gay marriage would be more relevant than social welfare or infrastructure spending... or even tax rates. 

From the FAQ on Political Compass- ""Despite their higher taxes, the social democracies' degree of social freedoms would presumably be envied by genuine libertarians in more socially conservative countries.

Our point is that a regulated economy and a strong public sector are not necessarily authoritarian, and a deregulated economy with a minimal public sector is not necessarily socially libertarian.

Interestingly, many economic libertarians express to us their support for or indifference towards capital punishment; yet the execution of certain citizens is a far stronger assertion of state power than taxation. The death penalty is practised in all seriously authoritarian states. In Eastern Europe it was abolished with the fall of communism and adoption of democracy. The United States is the only western democracy where capital punishment is still practised.""

20quid,2,korea,czjtpd7,0,t3_43l0jh,"Firstly I should point out that I'm not an entrepreneur, and as such can't say personal experience has led me to know what start-ups need. I'm also not a politician (just not old enough to stand either) so it's safe to say I probably have no idea what I'm talking about. However if I were in charge these are the first steps I would take to make the economy more favourable for smaller companies.

Honestly I don't think the place to start is investment. The government has been good at investment and incubation of start-ups, but if there's no room in the fish-tank the fish won't grow any bigger no matter how much you feed it. Start-ups need space to grow, and that means telling the big boys to stick to their patch and play by the rules. The government focuses too much on offering the carrot and showing restraint with the stick when a conglomerate takes the carrot and screws you over anyway.

There is already plenty of legislation in place to make South Korea’s economy more competitive and support workers health and well-being. The problem is that a law is only about as strong as the states will to enforce it. If I were in charge I'd end the practise of large companies giving contracts to their sister firms, something which is illegal but we all know happens anyway, and I'd put checks and measure in place to ensure impartiality and competitiveness when it comes to the awarding of government contracts. These public and private contracts need to trickle down, and if anyone thinks it's going to happen on it's own they're deluded.

I would set up a monopolies commission, such as those which exist in other countries, and give it some real teeth to go after companies that dominate too many sectors of the market. Chaebols have caused the large-scale closure of mom and pop stores up and down the country, and frankly the company that built your apartment block and sold you your phone should not be the same company running the local coffee shop and selling you a newspaper. If something is truly “too big to fail” then let's break it up and spread the wealth around.

I would offer a discount on Import/Export Tariffs to businesses under a certain size, so that when it comes to accessing the rest of the world they are not disadvantaged over the larger conglomerates who can better absorb the cost burden. Many small companies cannot manufacture every part of a product themselves (many big companies don't even bother) and so have to cooperate with other businesses to their mutual benefit. It might be instinctive to want Korean companies to only work with other Korean companies, but if we remove restrictions on access to the global markets then the wealth can flow both ways. The EU free trade agreement has been a boon to both sides, and I think it needs to be widened to include many of the sectors we're betting the house on.

I would also introduce net neutrality laws so that everyone can have free unburdened access, and be freely accessed without burden and without borders. We now live in a world where even an incredibly small company can be an international one, and many small companies rely on that business which mainly comes in over the web, so this is important. I would also reform a lot of the internet security laws which, although well meaning, have actually held back the progress of internet security and have made the websites of many Korean services some of the most user-unfriendly experiences in modern life. What's worse than having your identity stolen when dealing with a company online is the company not being able to do anything to fix it because of legislation.

We also need to change the attitude within schools to make education a more interactive, engaging and enlightening experience. Kids should be taught how to learn, not how to pass a test. Too many people grow up meek, expecting to be told what to do and living within already set confines, those people do not innovate. A new generation of resourceful kids who may not know how to do something, but know how to work it out, would be formidable. Kids should also be exposed to business at a young age, running mock-enterprise schemes within schools that give kids the experience of inventing and selling a product/service, and organising trips to trade shows to give then a taste of the industry would be beneficial.

When it comes to the arts we need to end the behind-the-scenes collusion between big record labels and broadcasters. No company should be able to force an industry-wide career-ending blacklist of an artist and broadcasters should dedicate a bit more time to showcasing talent that comes from small record labels or individuals with no label at all. At the end of the day a musician who made his own album artwork and managed his own tour is as much an entrepreneur as someone founding a tech start-up. They need to be supported, especially since the arts exist for the mutual enlightenment and shared heritage of mankind.

Anyone who invests money knows that to avoid disaster you need to have a diverse portfolio. The consumer electronics sector is definitely where it's at, and we're right to invest heavily in it, but we shouldn't be going all-in. The sector is already crowded and we're not competing on par with other countries. Other areas such as transport infrastructure, medicine and construction are also hotbeds of innovations and deserve heavy investment. As a side effect it may also mean people can move out of their parents houses before the age of 35.",,False,t1_czjjv4o,,2,t5_2qiog,False,1454344388,0,1458220580,

x2Infinity,8,finance,czjtr1g,0,t3_43iz6w,"&gt; I'm moderately certain an oligarchy isn't most Americans idea of a representative government.

It's not an oligarchy despite what a lot of people seem to believe. Finance throws it's monetary weight around but so do numerous other industries, at the end of the day votes are votes, politicians still need votes to win.

&gt;I also resent the casual dismissal of everyone who may disagree with you as uninformed.

When you are talking about academic or experienced opinions they line up very heavily on one side of the argument. Sanders ideas have little support from anyone who could be considered experts in the industry.

&gt;Quebec has an effective top tax bracket greater than 50%

Which is one of the highest rates in North America and the province still has more debt than any other in Canada. They are not a great example of economic enlightenment.

&gt;Iceland has implimented strict controls on the financial industry

They nationalized their banks and then said fuck you to basically all the foreign investors those banks owed money to. On top of that they still have pretty high interest rates and a worthless currency. The wealth inequality actually rose quite a bit after they did this because the currency has a much bigger impact on average citizens. It really isn't comparable either Iceland's banks are pretty irrelevant to global markets. It also a big question mark how that decision will pan out long term.

&gt;Canada distinguishes between investment banks and consumer banks and doesn't allow them to be the same entity.

You're going to have to expand on this, Canadian banks do offer investment banking services they don't have anything like G-S in place to regulate it. Canada's banking system is basically just 6 enormous banks(relative to the market) that are quite conservative. There's good things about it and bad things about it but they don't have any of the regulations like what Sanders has been proposing for the U.S so I don't think it's that relevant.

&gt;Virtually everyone in the modern world boasts some form of single payer healthcare.

No they don't, they all have some form of universal healthcare but most of them aren't single payer. And really none of them are truly single payer like what Bernie Sanders is advocating for.

&gt; It seems very elitest indeed to suggest that the entire rest of the world is too stupid to know they are tanking their economies while the benevolent dictators of the US financial institutions are saving the US by refusing to adopt any progressive policies.

If you are talking about how the U.S has done coming out of the recession it's certainly done quite well. The EU's fiscal direction for dealing with the crisis has certainly not panned out as well as the U.S choice to primarily use monetary policy. And if you're speaking of Canada they are back in recession, so I'm not sure they'd be a great example either.",,False,t1_czjr89r,,8,t5_2qhfj,False,1454344456,0,1458220602,

And Russia's intent will not necessarily be to harm or punish Ukraine, but to protect the relatively weak Russian markets from the EU in this case. So yeah, you kind of need to consider all your trading partners all the time, with the level of consideration somehow weighted by the amount of trade.

the_howling_cow,2,TankPorn,czju885,0,t3_43lxsx,"Oddly, there's a bit of a discrepancy as to exactly *when* 5th and 7th Armies met at the Brenner Pass. The 781st Tank Battalion After Action Report says ""041000"", 10:00 AM on May 4.

&gt; 5 May 1945 - Battalion remained in Innsbruck with one exception. Company ""C"" moved with elements of 411th Infantry Regiment to Brenner with mission of contacting forces of FIFTH ARMY. Contact was made at 041000 May with elements of 88th Infantry Division in Italy. Company ""D"" was relieved from attachment
to 410th Infantry Regiment and reverted to battalion control.

103rd Division veteran Pierce Evans says ""040151"", 1:51 AM on May 4th; he was there. 

&gt; Late at night on May 3rd Colonel Donovan Yeuell's 411th Infantry Regiment motor marched more than 40 miles, through the 409th advance positions in Innsbruck and up toward Brenner Pass, one of only two routes through the Alps between Innsbruck and Italy. As was his style, Col. Yeuell rode in his jeep, the second vehicle in the convoy, behind the lead tank. Our radio truck was the third vehicle followed by the rest of Task Force Brenner. We traveled with our headlights ablaze for the first time since before we were committed to action at St. Diè. The weather was lowering and getting worse by the minute. The temperature dropped below freezing again and it began to snow.
Thousands of German soldiers, in awe of the glaring headlights of the 175 vehicle column, poured out of the forests and surrendered. They were directed to discard their weapons and were sent, disarmed and unguarded, back toward Innsbruck to our PW cages. We advanced at very high speed considering road conditions and weather and secured Brenner Pass at 040151 (May 4th, 1:51 a.m.), without opposition.

&gt; The task force stopped for the night and the CP was set up in a building right next to the Brenner Pass border check point gate.

The 88th Infantry Division (the other half of the meeting, says 041051, 10:51 AM on May 4th

&gt; Meanwhile, the 349th Infantry, motorized, took off for the Brenner Pass. Moving more than 60 miles through the beaten enemy, advance patrols of the 349th were the first elements of the Allied Armies in Italy to make junction with forces moving south from Germany. At 1051 hours. 4 May, the European and Mediterranean fronts became one unbroken line when the 349th made contact with patrols from the 103rd Division, VI Corps. Seventh Army, a few miles south of the Brenner Pass.

As the 103rd Division veteran doesn't recall making any kind of contact with 5th Army troops, there could be another explanation that is validated by both the 88th Infantry Division and 781st Tank Battalion documents.

One explanation for the different times is that the pass could have been secured by the 411th and C/781st, at 1:51 AM, who set up their CP then hunkered down for the night to wait out the storm. In the morning, they sent patrols south through the pass into Italy and made contact with the 349th Infantry/88th Div. at 10:51 AM.

This photo could have possibly been taken sometime during the day on May 4th, as the CP was set up in the checkpoint gate building. So logically, the tanks should be from C/781st Tank Battalion and the infantrymen from the 411th Infantry Regiment.

Conversely, Harry Yeide's book *The Tank Killers* (incorrectly?) says the meeting was on May 5th.

CuntWeasel,2,europe,czjue2e,0,t3_43ooo1,"&gt; We should aspire to a controlled migration and multiculturalism on the level of the US or Canada.

Not sure if that would work in Europe for several reasons, but I will state the most obvious one: in the US specifically, and in Canada to a certain degree, multiculturalism paradoxically works because of nationalism. In schools in the US kids pledge allegiance to the flag every morning, while in Canada they stand for (or sometimes even sing) the national anthem, which makes kids identify with these countries. Also, although Canada prides itself with *diversity, not assimilation*, society teaches kids that they are first and foremost Canadians, and an overwhelming majority of immigrant children don't speak their mother tongue when they grow up.

I don't see this type of nationalism working out too well in Europe (unless it would be federalized of course, and that won't happen anytime soon). Teaching kids to be nationalistic would first screw with the Union, and secondly I doubt immigrant kids would be regarded as say Italians by the local population if they were of Asian or Middle Eastern descent. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that due to the somewhat homogeneous population and centuries of history, people would be less inclined to accept outsiders as one of their own from the first generation.",TRAN,False,t1_czjqk7b,,2,t5_2qh4j,False,1454345389,0,1458220903,Transylvania / Canada

LittleDevil1,1,ukpolitics,czjuoov,1,t3_43p7d5,"Well, this is from 2014 but I'll chip in. It really boils down to a left vs right issue, I'll take it to extreme a bit but this is how I see it. The left hate bosses and capitalism, love trade unions (John McDonnell talking about spitting in your bosses mug etc) they're generally cultural marxists so must leap to defend all people who they perceive as being persecuted, migrants, islam, workers etc. They can't admit that population increases can affect public services and infrastructure, and if they admit they do they believe the problem is that government isn't doing enough to tackle the problem, this demonstrates the cultural marxist theory of oppressed vs oppressor. 

However on the right, there is obviously more of a conservative viewpoint, and they take the viewpoint that unlimited immigration can affect infrastructure, services and jobs in a market based economy. As they believe more in the free market rather than trade union blackmailing, they see it as just a symptom of market disruption that is brought on by the EU, like china flooding the steel market (which surprisingly both the left and the right agree is a bad thing to some degree). So here conservative thought leaning people see that the market is being flooded by people because of our wages, benefits etc, it makes a lot of sense for someone to come and work here if they can get 7x their minimum wage. On top of that there is the illegitimacy of the EU, the fact that we handed over a lot of our sovereignty and we can't control our own borders/market to the extent that we would like too. Also they generally believe that raising wages above what one can pay is going to lead to less employment, higher prices etc, this is obviously where the left would like the government to chip in and either subsidise or nationalise, something that the right will obviously disagree with because of the general failure of nationalised companies and higher taxes.   

Both blaming your bosses for not paying you enough and joining a trade union, and just leaving the EU and regaining control of our country and borders are both solutions to the problem. I see it that conservatism and free market economics is the answer, it has been proven to be more successful at this kind thing, I believe the best way to help people is to let them help themselves and help them with the opportunity to help themselves. I don't believe a socialist answer is the best one because it leads to lots of other problems. I believe the most sensible answer is to have an australian style points based system and take in people who are in demand in the UK, then help out economies in places like Romania by having trade deals and cooperation with them to allow them to sell and buy stuff from us, which can help their lower and middle class population. I still think trade unions definitely have a place in our society, and I'm kind of ok with how they're run at the moment, I believe it was wrong for them to have so much power during and before Thatcher (edit: something who whoever wrote this on the billboard will definitely more than likely disagree with.)

Just be aware that some products from Japan/UK often uses ~1/150 scale. 

But all uses N gauge tracks 9 mm or 0.354IN, so N Scale is from 1/148 to 1/160 (the last afaik the most common). and the curve ball here is Code 80 and 55, which is the height of the track it self, if you stick to one kind of track is not a problem, but if you mix it up, it is advisable to use the same Code.

strl,1,europe,czjvsxq,0,t3_43inhb,"&gt;What do you think about the Israeli government playing a part in these illegal settlements? What do you think should be done with them?

There's a criminal prosecution system in Israel, if a crime has been committed it should be referred there. The politicians I voted for generally have nothing to do with any settlements. 

&gt;Jerusalem is quite a mess, don't you think? I'm sure you're familiar with the arguments from the other side as well, and mentioning the issue only in the light of the legally bought residences in East Jerusalem seems to me quite biased.

Right, and we want it, and we want to create facts on the ground. If it bothers the Palestinians they can come to the negotiating table before we achieve a majority in all parts of the city. When the Arabs controlled the city they destroyed all the synagogues and drove out all the Jews. We allow Arabs to live in Jerusalem and we respect their holly places.

&gt;It's obviously one of those issues that the two sides will never see eye-to-eye on, and I personally can't see any other viable solutions than something along the lines of making it an UN administered free city or something like that.

Because the UN is known for good administration.

&gt;Sure, that explains the rationale behind it but certainly doesn't justify it legally.

International law is a guideline, not actual law, you realize that right? Short of when it becomes something widely considered a crime i.e. killing civilians it's not really something that's enforceable, or should be for that matter.

&gt;It's pretty simple actually, either annex the area (eg. make it officially a part of Israel and accept the consequences of that - including citizenship for the inhabitants) or don't build settlements on land that is not in Israel proper.

We want to annex part of the area and we have annexed east Jerusalem, the Arabs there are residents of Israel and may apply for citizenship. We don't view the West Bank like you want to view it, it is not some package it's something created because of a ceasefire line from a war that happened almost seventy years ago, there's no geographical or even originally an ethnic justification for it. Take for instance Gush Etzion, this was a settlement of Jews which was legally built before 48' in the are of the west bank today, they were ethnically cleansed in 48' as were all of the Jews of east Jerusalem. Likewise we drove Arabs our, albeit more numerically but less percentage wise. The green line has no real world justification and our stance is that the future border is subject to negotiation, this is also the stance of the international community, all precious negotiations were based on this.

&gt;I'm not sure I'm quite following the argument you want to make here - it's the Palestinians fault that Israel is acting against international law?

No, my argument in context was that the settlements are a product of the Israeli population not believing peace is achievable, mainly because of the actions of the Palestinians. They were the ones who initiated violence mid negotiations because of bogus claims and I have already sourced this earlier in this thread somewhere, check for yourself terror attacks during the 90's and why the second Intifada broke out (this time we were totally plotting to destroy Al-Aqsa).

&gt;I'd rather talk about what is happening now rather than devolving into discussing horrible shit perpetrated by both sides (and always claimed to be just a response to something the other side did) over the last 100+ years.

Right, but our decisions nowadays are influenced by the past. If I thought that the Palestinians were truly interested in peace and were ready to commit to it I wouldn't support any settlements, like when I was younger. Knowing that the Palestinians still think they'll eventually drive us out I support ensuring physical control of strategic areas. Perhaps if I didn't believe in any viable peace ever happening I'd support settlements everywhere. 

You can't just act like either the Israelis or the Palestinians are some people without history that fell out of the sky and suddenly need to draw a line on the map, that's why Europeans don't understand this conflict. Both Palestinians and Israelis have real grievances based on  real occurrences. That doesn't simply disappear because you want it to and of course our perception of the conflict is based on it, I judge my relationship with a person based on past occurrences, not how he describes the future of our relationship.

&gt;Does Israel want peace? If so, then at least building new settlements needs to stop.

If it doesn't happen though despite that, like in the 90's? We're supposed to be left grasping the short end of the stick?",ISRA,False,t1_czjs5be,,1,t5_2qh4j,False,1454347436,0,1458221570,Israel

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/bc4d080745cc41f780b0aadf04680d33.png)  

&gt; Born at home in 1981 (midwife, Venice Beach), singer, pianist, and composer Gabriel Kahane was reared in medium-sized cities on both coasts of the continental United States by a psychologist mother (relational) and concert pianist father (unaffiliated). While a convenient and tidy psychological reading might suggest that his hybrid of blistering, chromatic counterpoint and traditional singer-songwriting belies some sort of defiance of the classical environment in which he was raised, Gabriel would no doubt argue that such theories are half-baked. “They were listening to Joni Mitchell too!” he retorts. And yet, Mr. Kahane’s work defies classification through his sonically challenging, emotionally resonant, yet deeply accessible music.

&gt; After an uneventful childhood marked by the quotidien, in which Gabriel found himself singing in operas in Germany, competing in international chess tournaments, and obsessively compiling baseball statistics, the young man discovered a pair of rickety Martin guitars in the attic of his parents’ Tudor home on Cobbs Hill Drive. Experiments ensued, though they would give way to a fascination with the piano toward the end of Mr. Kahane’s high school years.

&gt; Fast forward to 2008. It’s a historic moment in American politics, with a septuagenarian running against an African-American for the most hallowed office in the United States. In a more modest sense, it’s also a historic moment because it is the year in which Gabriel Kahane’s debut record will be released (September 16, to be exact).

&gt; Recorded primarily in March and April of 2008 in Seattle, Hoboken, and two Boroughs of New York City, the album is a testament to Gabriel’s catholic musical pursuits. With twenty musicians supporting him, Mr. Kahane’s debut offers snippets of string quartets juxtaposed with strummy strum folk song, brass chorales right beside jangly piano pop, and yet, he would argue, it’s very much of a piece, an album meant to be heard as a whole.

&gt; Who is this Gabriel Kahane? And why can’t we just go swimming?

&gt; Gabriel’s best known work, Craigslistlieder (2006)-- an eight movement song cycle which comprises settings of anonymous classified ads from craigslist.org—has been heard in venues ranging from the dankest bars of the Lower East Side to Carnegie Hall, in a recital by critically-acclaimed baritone Thomas Meglioranza. The summer of 2008 witnesses the premiere of Kahane’s For The Union Dead, a new song cycle on poems by Robert Lowell for chamber ensemble, at the Verbier Festival in Switzerland.

&gt; But whither the catholic approach?

&gt; Among his varied credits as a performer, Gabriel has appeared in recital with Grammy winning bass-baritone Thomas Quasthoff throughout Europe, toured the Schumann Piano Quintet with the Mark Morris Dance Group, and accompanied violinist Hilary Hahn in the slow movement of the Sibelius Violin Concerto in yet another dirty bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He has shared the stage with indie-rock luminaries My Brightest Diamond and Luke Temple, and has recorded with Sufjan Stevens and former Nickel Creek front-man Chris Thile.

&gt; Much in demand as a composer of chamber music, Gabriel is currently completing solo piano commissions for pianists Natasha Paremski as well as for his father, Jeffrey Kahane. An evening-length work exploring his family's genealogy and journey from Germany to the United States will premiere in the fall of 2009 in Los Angeles and New York.

&gt; The play within a play?

&gt; An avid theatre artist, Kahane has collaborated extensively with the Obie-winning New York City-based downtown theatre company Les Freres Corbusier, serving as musical director for a number of their productions including Hell House, A Very Merry Unauthorized Scientology Pageant, and the Los Angeles production of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson. In addition, the composer was recently commissioned by the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia to write an evening length work for their American Musical Voices Project, and is also the recipient this year of a new fellowship through the Shen Family Foundation and the Public Theater with the aim to create and develop new work.

&gt;C.W. also had to profess the Shahada, by claiming, “There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”

""Profess"" probably means, ""had to remember and fill in on a test or assignment"", which wouldn't be surprising or wrong since learning _the_ central tenet of Islam is probably important when learning about Islam.  I've also, at various times, had to read Biblical excerpts, remember the Nicene creed, read the Tao Te Ching and read and recall portions of the Bhagavad Gita.

&gt;C.W. and her classmates in 11th grade World History were instructed that “jihad” is a “holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

""CW and her classmates were provided with the definition of Jihad"", an important element to understanding Islamic spirituality.  In its sense of ""personal struggle"" I might compare it to learning about Christian beliefs in original sin.

&gt;C.W. and her classmates in 11th grade World History were instructed from the text of the Qur’an and had to learn and recite the Five Pillars of Islam.

Again, I assume ""learn and recite"" means ""remember and regurgitate on a test"".  I learned the 5 pillars and again can't comprehend a suitable curriculum that taught about Islamic history that does not mention them.

&gt;C.W. and her classmates in 11th grade World History were instructed from the Qur’an that “Men are the managers of the affairs of women” and that “[r]ighteous women are therefore obedient.”

""CW and students were introduced to passages from the Q'uran prior to a discussion on ME politics and treatment of women in the Islamic world.""

&gt;Defendants spent only one day teaching Christianity, but devoted approximately two weeks to promoting Islam.

Assuming I believed this -- and I don't -- it wouldn't surprise me.  Americans probably have a much better native understanding of Christianity than Islam.  I think it's more likely though that when elements of learning about Christianity are woven into discussions on Medieval times, the Enlightenment, and generally into information about European history then those elements are less likely to be noticed by students and parents than a similar amount of information about Islam.  The exotic sticks out.

&gt;Defendants forced C.W. to invoke and profess, both in words and writing, Islamic religious beliefs, including that the only god is the Muslim god and that Muhammad is a prophet or receive zeros on those classroom assignments.

Again, I assume here that ""invoke and profess"" means, for example, that the assignment said, ""what are the two major elements of the Shahada?"" and if you didn't write those two major elements in the blanks, yeah you'd probably get 0s on those answers.

Now, for big issues we have politicalvideo, which no one is really at and the common man's opinion can't be expressed as well.

I understand fears of polarization, but dumbing the product down to reach the masses may not be the best way to actually engage said masses. There's plenty of other content for them to see and quite honestly, most people I have tried to get on reddit leave because they hate the Frontpage configuration and lack of style, so, they're not even getting exposed to the comments and videos you're all so afraid of people seeing because people can get ugly about things they're passionate about...the world changes, opinion shifts, attentions are distracted and things boil over. Does anyone really talk about BLM anymore? No. Done deal. 

Looking out for the lurkers I understand, but I feel like they're just along for the ride. I can't possibly speak for them, they're probably way smarter than me because they don't engage in these little discussions that, dumb fucker I am, enjoy so much.  This is just an assumption.

The other problem with censorship is that in order to get the news you have to go to where the extreme outliers may be. For instance, for me to get news about the immigration crisis I have to go to /r/European where there are nazis, albeit a small, yet vocal minority, who talk about this is the Jews fault and nonsense like this. I hate that. I hate that I'd like to discuss something fucked up that happened and I have to deal with that shit because /r/Europe is filled to the brim with fascist moderation. It's truly awful.

ThirdHuman,1,askphilosophy,czjwr7t,0,t3_43o71p,"&gt; Having lived in a very poor country for years, I'll tell you that the people that ate the best - after the very rich, of course - were those who lived a very traditional lifestyle of farming and hunting, and not those living in cities working jobs to buy food etc. 

I'm curious as to whether you are referring to a marginally poor country (e.g. Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia) or an utterly impoverished one (e.g. parts of present day India, most of Africa, all of China 40 years ago)?

This distinction makes all the difference in the world.  There are currently more individuals living in absolute poverty in India today than all of Africa, but this is rapidly changing due to outside investment.

Some countries are artificially attempting to retain their place within the sweatshop phase of development.  For instance, China devalues its currency in order to weaken its citizen's purchasing power in order to keep wages low for international production.  These sorts of tactics are immoral and unconscionable, but this is the fault of the Chinese government rather than the foreign investors.   If US investors were to ""revolt"" by refusing to invest in China, then other foreign firms (Australian, Japanese, Korean, or European) would be able to take advantage of EVEN LOWER wages due to the increased supply of individuals seeking employment.  Any boycott of the Chinese government's policies would necessarily be required to be both global and strictly adhered by all parties to in order it be successful enough to end the currency manipulation without leading to worse absolute consequences for Chinese workers. 

 Another alternative, would be for Americans should to pressure their government to cease deficit spending, since the Chinese purchasing of US treasury bonds is the mechanism through which the Yuan is devalued.  You could take away from this that Americans have a ""moral obligation"" to sweatshop workers to get their country's deficit under control.

&gt; This is true to a significant extent; however, that does not make it ethical. Choosing between starvation and unconscionable working conditions for ridiculous hours is not a real choice. And when you consider that it is the poorest people in the poorest countries working to provide luxuries and cheap, unnecessary goods for the richest people in the world, it begins to look very bad for any kind of sweatshop system, regardless of whether it raises a given worker's standard of living. 

I agree that sweatshops are far from ideal, but in order to escape this imperfect choice between difficult working conditions and starvation, a country needs to attract capital investment necessary to achieve the institutional, productive, and social dynamics necessary for prosperity.

The alternative would be for developed countries to open their borders in order to enable individuals to access their full productive potential.  A Haitian who enters the United States increases his/her standard of living by 1000% just through gaining access to the dynamics in the more developed country.  This is a worker with ZERO SKILLS and NO LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, and the premium is EVEN HIGHER for individual with language proficiency or hard skills.

There are some charitable methods that can augment or supplement the normal economic development [(See Effective Altruism)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism).  These mechanisms focus on creating increasing standards of living through sustainable arrangements that are self-reproducing and minimize unintended negative consequences that traditional charity is typically associated with.

We know that direct transfers of money or goods to individuals in developing countries will not stimulate the development of domestic production, since it retards productive economic development.  Metaphorically, you want to give individuals a ""fishing rod to catch his/her own fish"", rather than create a dependency on ""fish transfers"".

Thus, I am left once again restating that the best 3 things we can do for sweatshop workers today:

1. open our borders to migration

2. eliminate barriers to trade 

3. intercultural exchange programs.

I will add that we can supplement these 3 options with 3 additional:

1. Through pressuring governments in rich developed countries to decrease deficit spending, thereby abating foreign currency devaluation.

2. Pressure foreign countries to cease practices that devalue their worker's wages.

3. Donate to non-profits that engage in effective altruism.

Sweatshops are bad, but we must recognize that the responsibility of this inequity does not lie with foreign investors.  To the contrary, sweatshops are the symptom of problem, rather than the problem itself.  This symptom is associated with recovery process much like being bed-ridden after catching a cold.  Being stuck in bed recovering is no fun at all, but if we attempt to artificially force the sick individual out of bed, then we will have slowed the recovery, and opened up the possibility of much worse consequences.

The government would have to choose to not fund certain medicines and treatments, essentially creating ""death panels"" which decide which diseases are worth curing and which are to expensive.

Instead of Sanders plan I would advocate for a government option, which is what the UK has. If you want you can take the government healthcare plan, which won't have as much bargaining power as the single payer system but can pressure insurance companies to lower rates. If the government options proves to be successful than we can maybe move towards a single payer system, after the infrastructure has been put into place and expansion is possible.

My fiancee and I are planning on traveling 1-2 times out of the US each year, for the next 3-4 years. We went to Europe 2 years ago and did not have a ""zero foreign transaction fees"" so we took all cash, and there was a few times where we ran out and swiped our cards and got hit with some pretty crazy fees.


We are also having a destination wedding in Mexico, luckily we're booking all travel through a travel agent that uses their own cards so we don't have to worry about transaction fees. We do feel like we might need to to have a credit card down there so when we get more into wedding planning (decorations, reception, excursion, anything else) we won't get hit with the fees.


As of right now looking at nerdwallet it looks like the ""Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card"" might be our best choice. We have a Capital One 360 account set up already. We also could easily hit the ""Spend $3,000 in the first 3 months and get 40,000 miles"" (we'd just use it to pay off our wedding). I guess I'm a little confused about the $59 fee, dose that mean after the first year I have to spend at least $2,950 to ""cover"" the annual fee? 


 	- $59 x 100 = 5,900 miles        
	- 5,900 / 2 (2 miles per dollar spent) = $2,950 
	- Or is my math wrong? At what point do you break ""even"" with the annual fee? 


I guess speaking for myself in 2015 I spend ~$14,500 on my BoA Credit card, and in 2014 I spent ~$17,000 on my BoA CC. I normally used my CC when ever I can, unless they don't except Credit and I need cash. So using those numbers if I would spend about the same next year I'd have about $300 - $350 in ""free travel"" (not including the annual fee).

&gt; Jane Mallory Birkin (born 14 December 1946) is a British actress and singer.

&gt; Birkin was born in London, United Kingdom to David Birkin and Judy Campbell, an actress in Noel Coward musicals. Her great aunt was Freda Dudley Ward, a mistress of Edward VIII while he was Prince of Wales.

&gt; Birkin emerged in the swinging '60s in London, starring as one of the models in the controversial film Blowup in 1966.

&gt; In 1968, Birkin went to France to audition for the lead female role in Slogan. Though she did not speak French, she got the role.

&gt; In 1969, she and Serge Gainsbourg released the song ""Je t'aime... moi non plus"" (""I love you... me neither""), written by Gainsbourg and featuring both of them singing, which caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness. Arguably due in part to the publicity it got from being banned by radio stations in Italy, Sweden, Spain, and the UK, it was a commercial success all over Europe. The song's fame is a result of its salacious lyrics (sung in French) against a background of female moaning and groaning, culminating in an orgasm at the song's conclusion (which some claim to be the result of Jane and Serge actually engaging in sex during the recording of the song).

&gt; Birkin took a short break from her acting career in 1971-72, but returned as Brigitte Bardot's lover in Don Juan (or if Don Juan were a woman) in 1973.

&gt; In 1975, she appeared in Gainsbourg's first film, also titled Je t'aime... moi non plus, which created quite a stir for its frank examination of sexual ambiguity. For this performance she was nominated for a Best Actress César Award.

&gt; Birkin has starred in the Agatha Christie films Death on the Nile and Evil Under the Sun, and recorded several albums, including Baby Alone in Babylone, Amours des Feintes, Lolita Go Home and Rendez-vous. She has obtained in the category Female Artist of the year in France the Victoires de la Musique award in 1992 .

&gt; She starred in two films by Jacques Doillon — as Anne in La fille prodigue (1981) and as Alma in La pirate (1984, nominated for a César Award). This work led to an invitation from Patrice Chéreau to star on stage in La Fausse suivante by Marivaux at Nanterre. After this, she also began to appear frequently on stage in plays and concerts (in France, Japan, the UK and then the US).

&gt; Jacques Rivette collaborated with her for Love on the Ground (1983) and La belle noiseuse (1991, Nominated Césars best supporting actress).

Falkenhirn,1,europe,czjxoao,0,t3_43oumq,"Well we have a multi tier system of association then EU proper and then we have opt outs with in the EU (another layer for each opt out for each country that has one) I am all in faavour of removing that last bit and turn it into just two tiers but then why the hassle if that loose connection system is allready in place. Also adding another option (second tier) does not guarantee everyone with opt outs will go there so you do not end up killing layers. 

A country opting out of alot of stuff (basicly the second tier) should not be in the EU as any influence it has (indirectly by bargaining in other fields for example) on issues it opted out of is too much. So if one would axe voting rights on everything in that second tier I guess I would see the benefits for the union.

&gt;A two tier system is literally just two layers... Federal membership and Associate membership...

And what about Norway, Switzerland, Turkey etc. they all have different association with the EU so not just two tiers. 

&gt;Then you're going to have to grappel with the reality that being part of the EU is not the same as wanting more European Union. Just look at the countries that are supposed to have adopted the Euro by now compared to those that actually have adopted the Euro. Even Poland still uses the Zloty.

That is one of the inofficial opt outs I am clearly against. (But nothing a little article 50 could not fix.... /s)

&gt;A Federal Europe will never happen without offering every country the choice of being part of that federation. You can't just keep expanding EU competencies and expecting everyone to abide by them without complaints.

Joining and leaving are voluntary, for everything else I rather have: if a country disagrees with the majority of the others on the direction and is not willing to follow them they can opt out of the Union and not opt out of this field. 

Every country has the chance to agree to federalisation by not leaving.Having any sort of deal on what a Federal Europe even should be is way easier with less members anyway, and how things look I hope my country is not part of that. Then again I would also prefer for gouverments of individual countries to loose all power in the EU and a powerful parliament instead and in exchange keep competence on a EU level as small as humanly possible.

Considering that a mtf skull is the same size while the brain gets smaller in some sense, it's possible that you can sustain concussions easier as the brain is more likely apt to move or ricochet around the skull during some type of impact, causing the concussion.  My guess anyway.

""One interesting study is “Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure” by Pol, et al (European Journal of Endocrinology, 2006). They recruited both MtF and FtM transsexual volunteers and measured their brain volumes in several ways both before and after 4 months of HRT. The result?
The ﬁndings suggest that treatment of MFs with estrogens and anti-androgens decreases the male brain size towards female proportions, whereas treatment of FMs with androgens (not substantially affecting circulating estrogen levels) increases the female brain size towards male proportions. The magnitude of this change (i.e. 31 ml over a 4-month period) is striking, since it signiﬁes a decrease in brain volume, which is at least ten times the average decrease of around 2.5 ml per year in healthy adults (16).""",,False,t3_43npez,,0,t5_2r4b9,False,1454350545,0,1458222610,

I think you have expressed what is wrong with the hero characters in a way that I was having trouble nailing down.  They are all angelically noble (this is the same problem I have had with some of Dickens's characters) and therefore respond to stress in the same way, which makes their constant worry get annoying even though it is well founded. Van Helsing especially seems to spend half his time mawkishly telling Mina how wonderful she is whenever she is worried about turning into a blood sucking vampire. I guess this relates to the various sexual subtexts that have been suggested for the novel, but I found this side of it harder to relate to. 

The epistolary format is another thing that I wasn't sure about. It works some of the time but I don't know why the whole bulk of the novel requires it. Often a character will say something like, ""What a long, tiring and dangerous day! And more tomorrow! Let me spend a few hours writing it all down in detail before I get some rest...""

The climax was also a little disappointing. [***spoilers coming***] The heroes have to race across Europe to beat Dracula to his castle. Dracula spends the time asleep in his box. They manage to catch and destroy him just in time. This final confrontation is only a couple of pages, so the real battle was not so much against Dracula but against the train and shipping timetables.

This all makes me sound like I hate the novel, which I don't.

There are some things that are going to surprise you about F1 in Europe as compared to NA.  However, there is nothing like watching these cars bottom out heading up Eau Rough towards 200 MPH.  

If you do choose to go to Spa here is my unfiltered advice as an asshole american tourist:

•	The views and the race are amazing; you’ll have a great time rain or shine.

•	In general the area is gorgeous and if you enjoy nature and the outdoors it is really hard to beat.

•	I will remember the race for and the time we spent there for the rest of my life, it was a definite bucket list item.

•	The fans in general are polite and well mannered, but there is a lot of drinking.

•	Speak French, Dutch or maybe German.  You'll be in rural Belgium; English really is not well understood there.
  
•	Cash will make your life way easier at the food vendors.  However the souvenir and team booths all take credit and we had no issues with our NA credit cards there.

•	Other than no privacy out-door urinals and a few poorly maintained chemical toilets be prepared to pay to us the toilets.  Have change (not hard if you’re using cash), be patient and make sure your wife is prepared for that culture shock. 

•	Unless you’re going to spring for VIP, Spa feels a lot more like a three-day rock concert (think Burning Man, Dave Mathews Tour, Warp Tour ETC) than a “high class” F1 race as it is branded in NA.

•	Be prepared to walk.  A LOT.  I'm talking at least 4 to 5 KM up and down hill from the parking to your car. This is with ""decent"" paid parking.  The things that make Spa beautiful also make it a bitch to walk at.  Lots of hills, you’ve been warned. 

•	Traffic in town is HORRIBLE on practice / race days.  Get there early if you plan on picking up your tickets and learn the layout of the town ahead of time.  Generally the ticket pickup is across the street from hotel in town.

•	The food sucks, bring your own otherwise I hope you like Fritas.

It's sad. The story in Korea was quite unique and your character had interesting shady flaws. In NA they make your character feel like an idiot fumbling through the story, randomly cutting out crucial parts of the story they didn't like, leaving the end user confused as to what the hell is going on.

I wouldn't have gave a shit if it wasn't for the fact that they used ""No censorship"" as a marketing ploy to sell the game. And they also said they would allow refunds on the founder's pack if requested before character reservation, but they backed out on that. Then they took all the popular names during reservation and even renamed characters that people managed to claim because a GM wanted their name.

Added NCSoft to my list of companies I'm never giving money again. Now Trion(pay2win), NCSoft(repeatedly lieing to customers and refusing to take ownership of it), and Valve(non-existant customer service) are all on the list.

Islam is no different from Christianity in that regard. It's simply just a different set of rules, most of which doesn't work with our society.

It seems the colonists pressure him to sent reinforcements for possible native agression.

He decides to sent 2 light ships, with fishing equipment, over the risky cod route north. It is still winter, so they might very well not arrive. There simply is no other way to reach New Amsterdam at the moment. The ships shall carry replacements of the died soldiers, and another 75 crossbowmen and 25 swordsmen.

The colonists will attempt to help the natives in the meantime in anyway possible, however no soldier shall ever leave the fort or walls of the settlement. All the colonists receive training to use the weapons of soldiers that havent survived the winter. No more than 20 colonists, all armed and on horse, shall ever leave the sight of the guards on the walls. This way the colonists will be able to work on the fields in sight or hunt, but not with 20 men more at once. 

10 colonists are to always remain with the natives and assist them in basic duties. Those 10 also offer to care for the sick natives, and show their respect to all those who have died. The colonists will try to explain to the natives what is happening to them, and try to communicate with them.

&gt; BERLIN Moscow&amp;#039;s intervention in an alleged rape case involving a German-Russian girl has heightened suspicions in Berlin that it is trying to stir up trouble, with a view to weakening Chancellor Angela Merkel.

&gt; Senior German officials believe Russia is trying to erode public trust in Merkel using immigration, an issue which has badly damaged her opinion poll ratings and divided European Union governments over who should accommodate asylum seekers pouring in over the past year.

&gt; Merkel&amp;#039;s allies are closing ranks around her over Ukraine and Berlin&amp;#039;s technical help for Western airstrikes on Syria, although its jets are not doing any of the bombing.

anthonysrivero,5,Diablo,czk02eq,0,t3_43l69n,"San Francisco is about an 8 hour drive from Orange County (if you're lucky), so they're not that close. 

SF is vastly different in almost every possible way. 

First, it's a walk-able city, meaning, I don't need a car at all to live here. You can get around the entire city by public transit and foot easily. When I would go for walks in the OC, I almost felt like a freak. Almost NO ONE walks to the store. There were a few guys I worked with who were hassled by the cops while walking home from work in Irvine, for no other reason than looking suspicious because they were choosing to walk instead of drive. One guy in particular was from Madrid, Spain (If you've ever been to Madrid, you'll know how nice their public transit system is.) So one night he decides to walk home from work, and for no good reason, the police stop and question him.  He was furious. He wasn't the only guy that happened to.

The political climates are polar opposites. Orange County is known as the one Republican enclave in California. It is, in general, very conservative -  especially the city of Irvine. San Francisco is probably one of the most left leaning cities in America. I could dye my hair pink and wear a dress if I wanted to, and no one in SF would care. If I did that in Irvine, I would be gawked at incessantly, if not outright harassed. 

San Francisco is friendly to small businesses. You'll find many ""mom and pop"" stores, cafes, and excellent restaurants. OC is all about strip malls with big chain stores and fast food. Irvine's big cultural attraction is one giant shopping mall called The Spectrum.

Speaking of culture, SF has some excellent museums (although nothing here compares to Europe's museum choices). Los Angeles has some great museums, too, but LA is not OC (the drive to LA can sometimes take 2 hours because of traffic being so bad.) OC itself has a couple museums that are ok, but nothing special.

Architecture - When coming to San Francisco one of the most recognizable characteristics it has is the architecture. The Victorian style homes and hilly landscape give it a distinct flavor all its own. If you enjoy location sketching/painting, you would love it here. OC looks like a sea of stucco tract homes with red tile roofs. Orange County does have some nice beaches and hiking trails for location painting, but as far as city-scapes go, it's lacking.

luc1kjke,0,russia,czk05yc,0,t3_43i9uv,"&gt; This isn't about playing by somebody's rules, this is about doing the right thing.

Yeah. Right thing in your understanding would've been to leave Ukraine alone and see what would happen in Crimea. And as a local I can say it has reminded me powder keg standing in the burning house long before Ru military took over.

&gt; And killing our neighbors and our fellow Slavs is almost never the right thing.

You've already told me everything you think about the subject: ""I don't know who made the strike, whether it was made by rebels or not, whether it was an airstrike or not, *nor do I care.*"". You *don't care* who's killing Slavs so lets just drop the subject you're not interested into.

&gt; Are these Azov Battalion folks nazis? Yes. Does that mean Ukraine has been taken over by nazis? I don't think it's fair to say so. There is only around 800 people in that battalion. Just because militaristic people have been integrated into the National Guard doesn't mean the country is taken over by nazis.

Oh and it took just ~10-15 thousands *UNARMED* people to take over fucking country called Ukraine! Really I find your arguments childish. It's not about AMOUNT it's about ORGANISATION and WILLINGNESS to do certain actions.

&gt; So why take them on? Why accept them into the National Guard? Well, if I were the Ukrainian government right now, underfunded, undermanned, underpowered, locked in a conflict with the rebels assisted by the second-strongest military in the World and 800 idealistic anti-Russian soldiers came up to me and volunteered to be on the front lines while half of my country is evading the draft, of course I'm going to take all the help I can get! Any man in the same position would do the same thing.

Oh right. Second powerful army nobody has filmed in Donbas. Sorry, but I'm not really into fiction.

&gt; And once again, I can also give you examples of nazis in the Russian police:
""... Социологические опросы начала 2000-х гг. ...""
Does this imply that Russia has been taken over by nazis? No, of course it doesn't. Neo-nazi elements have plagued Europe (including Russia and Ukraine) for a very long time, and I don't see them going anywhere soon.

You're comparing non-systematic individual acts of racism with military-grade ammunition armed para-military organisation of neo-nazi. Really?

&gt; Does the Ukrainian government *also* silence dissenting views?

Again - there's a lot of opposition media that you can freely access. Nobody banned echo.msk.ru. Situation is *entirely* different in Ukraine, it's not ""also"".

&gt; I don't see our leaders trying to unite us, all I see is them trying to divide us.

I have yet to hear how Russian mainstream media would say anything against Ukrainians(not their government). Not very valid argument imo.

&gt; There's nothing isolationist about being against sending our kids to die for leaders with whom they have less in common than they do with the enemy soldiers. 

Except there's only *volunteers* in Syria. 

&gt; And doing what we did, we certainly have made much more enemies than we have made friends, bringing us closer to the status of NK.

Except sometimes you just have to do something that is in your national interests. Otherwise you may as well end up like Baltic states - puppets doing what they can to please their masters.

&gt; Russia would protect them from who? There are (were) no wars going on in Europe, especially not the kind that would require an organization as big as NATO.

Oh, except from those never ending Yugoslav wars you mean? Russia could've stopped violence before it started to leak.

&gt; Here's my opinion, and correct me if I'm wrong, but throughout the entire 20th century the Russian state has been mostly a very destructive and oppressive force to our allies.

You should really check that old Afghanistan films. This state was perfectly fine while our ally were sitting in their palace. Now look at it now - US occupied mess.

&gt; In comparison to those who have chosen to ally themselves with the United States, we lose pretty much in all the cases in terms of being the better country to ally with. East Germany still can't catch up with West Germany, same thing with Eastern Europe in general, North Korea is a Stalinist nightmare while South Korea is an economic and cultural powerhouse, same with Japan. So the Soviet Union collapses, these countries are now free. They look at the success of those who chose to ally themselves with the U.S., NATO comes up to them and says: ""Hey, being under Soviet control was terrible, wasn't it? You want to make sure that never happens again? Join NATO!"".

""Join NATO or we'll bomb you to shit like Yugoslavia or we'll make a coup in your country like in Ukraine"". Really NATO is the same shit as Warsaw pact just with *some* benefits.

&gt; And now, by doing what we did in Ukraine, we have only made their fears come true :(

I don't feel sorry for the fact that we, in Crimea, are alive and there were no bloodshed.

&gt; Honest, sincere politicians exist in Russia. Of course they do. Unfortunately, however, anyone who tries to run outside of Edinaya Rossiya has practically a zero chance of winning any serious position. For many reasons: political, media control, bureaucracy, etc. This is pretty much the same as with КПСС in the USSR, if you're old enough to remember. Once you're in Edinaya Rossiya, any dissent will not be tolerated. If you attempt to push an agenda that is different from the party leaders - you will be kicked out of the party forever. There is very little good you can do for the people, regardless of how idealistic you are. This is simply how politics work nowadays in Russia, and this is exactly what I mean when I say that democracy is being repressed.

You haven't mentioned other parties which are regularly elected. And I don't believe in democracy. Once people are in high places - there's 0 control over them. Democracy is the illusion of the oasis in the desert. I say - we should move and look for a real one.

&gt; I don't think the revolution in Ukraine happened because of U.S. planning it that way. The CIA isn't that smart and that's never how they operate. They are opportunists. They see Ukraine destabilized, they say ""Oh, look! People are sick and tired of the corrupt pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine, this is the perfect opportunity to install a West-friendly regime!"". So they give them some money and they prop them up in the media.

Riiights, same as in 2006 there were no plan with Yuschenko. This people just grabbing money, then hiring snipers and some para-military(which are appearing from the thin air) and boom - you've got a coup. So easy!

&gt; In my opinion, this revolution would have never happened if the leadership of Ukraine wasn't shitty, *and if being pro-Russia was beneficial to Ukraine. The citizens of Ukraine have exercised their will, and that will was anti-Russian. For good reasons*.

What?! Ok, I see now that you hold zero understanding of the matter and probably never heard about Stratfor analysis about Ukraine, never seen Ukrainian presidency vote dispersion between West and East AND you probably didn't even knew that previous Ukraine president was pro-russian and Maidan were highly supported just in few regions in the Western Ukraine. Really I don't see a reason to continue this discussion as it seems like you need to self-educate yourself since claims you're making are smelling US funded anti-russian shills and I don't have time for it.

The government isn't a jobs program and we shouldn't be subsidizing these low paying jobs directly through welfare programs and indirectly through higher insurance costs. Looking are Europe (which is just as flawed as we are) you don't see wal-marts, as many retail stores, or restaurants as you do in the US. I think that has to do with the high European labor cost. 

While raising the minimum wage will in the short term raise unemployment. I think in the long term the economy will do better without the massive market intervention these subsidies represent. 

I think the corporate tax rate should be 100%. However, that should come with a 100% deduction for operating expenses including all labor costs and a 100% deduction for cap ex.

I play Eve Online in a small, mostly European alliance. We use TeamSpeak for voice comms and coordinating stuff in fleet fights. People will also just hang out on the TS server and bullshit while doing boring grindy-type stuff like mining, killing NPC pirates, etc. I've had some hilarious conversations with the people in this alliance and for the most part, they're rather intelligent, polite, mature adults. The accents are also an absolute delight for me to listen to, but talking about that is just going to get me off track.

One of our fleet commanders is a woman. For me (and I like to think most of the other people I sit around on comms with), she's a competent FC who happens to have a feminine voice. I've flown with these people for about a year now and I don't think that fact has ever come up until just the other day. 

And then some new guy from a corporation that just joined our alliance a week or so ago gets on TeamSpeak:

""Hey, &lt;name&gt;, my friend was over at my house the other day while I was in a fleet fight and he thought you had a really sexy voice. He was wondering if you could send him a picture of yourself.""

Dead silence for a solid half-minute. Then about five people (including her) all within a second of each other: ""What?""

He reiterates his ""friend's"" request and she, rather more politely than was really warranted, informed him that that was sorta weird and creepy and no, she was not going to send some guy a picture of herself because he heard her calling targets in a fleet battle and thought her voice was hot.

After a few more ""I'm really not trying to be creepy""s and ""You should take it as a compliment""s, pretty much everyone else in the channel joined in on the effort to try and make this guy understand that his request was rather untoward. Realizing that he was not going to get his juicy .jpg, he accepted defeat and logged off. 

After that, a few more minutes of complete silence on comms while everyone's trying to pull their [palms off their faces](http://i.imgur.com/iWKad22.jpg?fb). Then, as if to tacitly say, ""Wow, that was unbelievably awkward, creepy, and terrible. Let's change the subject to, like, ANYTHING else,"" someone breaks the silence with a question (perhaps purposely) just as irrelevant to game mechanics as the last one:

IAmFrankCamberlain,10,belgium,czk390y,0,t3_43ovq7,"&gt; 1) What I would actually like to know is what's wrong with the Belgian justice system and how to fix it, 

The legislation gets too complex, there are too many gaps leading to different interpretations. Moreover all courts and tribunals are understaffed in particular the administrative support section is understaffed. Consequently magistrates (example: criminal investigative judges and their clerks) are overburdened with executive administration work which of course has a negative effect on their core business. 

How to fix it? Spend enough money to recruit administration staff. 

&gt;I'd like to ask if you, in the European context that you now operate, know of European countries that DID manage to handle something like the informatisation of their justice department correctly, and maybe some insight on what are the main elements of doing something like that successfully.

I'm sorry but this question exceeds my knowledge. 

&gt; 2) Then for the second question, I don't know if you've ever seen the documentary ""bitter lake"" it's a historical overview of western involvement in Afghanistan and also delves deeper into the disconnect between our vision of a place like afghanistan and the complex reality on the ground, and how that basically prevents actual growth or peace taking root, no matter how many billions you pour into ""reconstruction"". What are some surprising insights you've come to,regarding that disconnect, our vision vs the reality?

First of all one should understand that Afghanistan is theocratic country with a supremacy of the Islam. I remember that I asked an Afghan audience how they could possibly reconcile human rights adopted in their constitution with the application of the Sharia in case of a hudood crime (one of the seven crimes against Allah himself in which case the judge may apply the Sharia, ex: adultery), knowing that the sentence could be death by stoning or amputation of limbs. 

I said ""your constitution forbids cruel and degrading treatment and torture"" and yet you apply such sentences. The answer? The constitution is not our first legal source, the Sharia is.  

It will be obvious that in such a situation cultural changes towards a more open society are very difficult to realize. Furthermore the corruption of government officials  in Afghanistan was a massive problem. In fact the situation corresponded with the explanation that former NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns gave to a journalist when asked to define in short the assistance to ""under developed countries"". Mind you this terminology is no longer accepted since we now speak of ""young democracies"". But in that time Luns answered: ""The assistance to under developed countries is when poor people from rich countries give money to rich people in poor countries"". It is a sad thing to say but I've known this to be a reality in Afghanistan. ",,False,t1_czjxkvd,,10,t5_2qhe6,False,1454357816,0,1458225163,

America's health care system is great for those who participate in it. You get outstanding care in America; cancer patients in the US have far better outcomes than their counterparts in Europe. In fact when you account for lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, etc. Americans are shown to have better outcomes again.

The problem with America's health system is that there are people who are excluded from it. 10% of the population is still uninsured, despite the regulations of the ACA. Because of these people who forgo insurance, metrics like life expectancy are dragged down for the nation as a whole. So, articles, like the one above, is not indicative of the average American's experience within the healthcare system. They will always skew America downward because of the nature of our health system. If you compare the outcomes for people that participate in the health system in America vs. the outcomes of people of people who participate in the health systems of Europe, the story changes quickly.

Now, if we talked about implementing a system that involves everyone, we may see a cosmetic increase in overall life expectancy, simply from getting more people to participate in the health system. However, we would likely see outcomes for people currently being served diminish. This also does not account for lifestyle factors, as mentioned before, so there is no guarantee that a system that provides access to more people would positively affect the populace.",,False,t3_43jbry,,1,t5_2u3ds,False,1454358358,0,1458225346,

There are a number of (valid, IMO) complaints that the more recent *Fallout* games do a poor job of illustrating how badly their various regions will still be impacted by nuclear war after two centuries. The problem is significantly worse if we're talking about conventional war. It certainly could have been very badly damaged during the Resource Wars and the subsequent civil wars, but it's hard to credit the idea that the impact would still be felt two hundred years later, especially when there's not even any lingering radiation to deal with. 

The worst case scenario would seem to be the same amount of physical devastation, but no irradiated soil or water supply, and no significant abominations to worry about. Even if more than 90% of the population had been eradicated in the process, two hundred is a long time for society to recover, especially when there seems to be so little holding it back (something you can't say about the Capital Wasteland or the Commonwealth). So it's a difficult argument, even being generous to it, since there's really very little evidence of non-nuclear weapons in the *Fallout* universe capable of wreaking that kind of large-scale devastation in the first place. The few that plausibly *do* exist, like HELIOS One, were so cutting-edge they were unlikely to have been available to an economically depressed, resource-poor backwater like Europe.

And you *still* have the problem that the sole significant description of the break-up of the European Commonwealth describes them as ""quarreling, bickering nation states,"" which is a curiously understated to way to say ""deep shit.""",,False,t1_czk1zoe,,5,t5_2udux,False,1454359540,0,1458225752,

The israelis both accuse them of personally FORGING documents and of purchasing forged documents, all while insinuating that they were operatives/ agents. So what was their purpose in Israel?

I think I answered this already, and you seem to have missed it. Please re-read.

&gt;tell me that story. I can cite unlimited international aid agencies who say that you're wrong. who can you cite other than the Israeli government?

Which aid agencies? Human Rights Watch, whose [founder](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/opinion/20bernstein.html) pointed out its bias against Israel? Amnesty, who sponsors a [Palestinian promoter of the anti-Semitic blood libel](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/194278/why-is-amnesty-international-sponsoring-a-u-s-tour-for-a-palestinian-promoter-of-the-blood-libel)? Doctors Without Borders, who had a [Palestinian employee](http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Shin-Bet-foils-plot-to-kill-Olmert) plot to kill the Israeli Prime Minister in 2007, who [posted about Ahed Tamimi, a 14 year old Palestinian who likes to throw stones at Israelis](http://www.thetower.org/2771oc-analysis-doctors-without-borders-anti-israel-crusade/), and did the video of her under a poster of ""martyrs"" that included PFLP terrorists that killed civilians?

Which ones? I have long lists of information most people don't realize that show how **everyone** is political when it comes to slamming Israel. I mean how else will they get that sweet EU and Arab Gulf cash?

&gt; Recurrent power cuts and an unstable power supply affect medical care

Yep. And why do these cuts exist? Not because of Israel, which tries to [constantly expand](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-09/11/c_134612006.htm) Gazan power supply, despite the fact that it doesn't get paid for any of it. Israel supplies more power to Gaza than Gaza generates itself, and more than Egypt supplies to it. And it does this despite the fact that Gazan power is supposed to be paid for by the Palestinian Authority, which owes [hundreds of millions of dollars](http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/62491-150226-first-planned-palestinian-city-rawabi-gets-long-awaited-water-supply-approval) to Israel, nearly bankrupted the Israeli Electricity Company (the government stepped in to pay the Palestinian debt, as you can see), and more.

I wonder where the problem is? Ah yes, it's what even [Hamas said](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3911229,00.html), which is the Palestinian unwillingness to pay what they owe.

&gt; The functionality of medical equipment has been deteriorating because of inadequate maintenance capacity and spare parts

Also the result of...guess who? Hamas! The Palestinian Authority has [accused Hamas](http://www.timesofisrael.com/pa-gaza-health-ministry-stole-medical-aid-during-summer-conflict/) of stealing medical equipment and medicines, even. Something they have a long history of doing, since the PA accused them of stealing ambulances back in 2007.

You know what's really fascinating? The fact that you quoted what you did, but left out the next paragraph from the first WHO page:

&gt; Despite these challenges, **the public health system in the West Bank and Gaza is relatively well developed** and is able to provide a full range of health services to the population.

Weird, you must have left that out?

&gt;In 2010, almost one out of five applications for patients to leave Gaza to go to hospitals in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Israel and Jordan was denied or delayed by the Israeli authorities.

Delayed how long? A day or two? A week? How urgent was the need for care?  Those with life-threatening diseases and problems are virtually always let through. Denied for what reasons? I guess we'll never know.

Even so, [thousands](http://www.thetower.org/2060-ap-report-thousands-of-gazans-treated-in-israeli-hospitals-every-year/) of Gazans are treated in Israeli hospitals every year...even during war, when Israel [tried to set up a field hospital](http://www.timesofisrael.com/on-gaza-border-an-israeli-field-hospital-stands-empty/) on the border and Hamas told people not to go to it for treatment.

&gt;http://www.emro.who.int/pse/information-resources/abu-abed.html

What your link showed was that he got delayed slightly, was treated quite well and was healthy enough to wait, etc.

More importantly, your link shows *only his testimony*, without the Israeli side of things. There's no actual corroboration of his story in any way. Furthermore, you have to remember that Hamas stole ambulances in the past and terrorists have [hidden suicide belts in ambulances](http://archive.adl.org/israel/israel_explosives.html), and there is a *long* history of this kind of thing. Again, blame Palestinian terrorists.

&gt;yes, that's the only anecdote I have found too. But she isn't a Hamas member. Find me an example of a military age male being given that access.

[Israel reinforces](http://www.timesofisrael.com/medics-told-to-treat-attackers-at-terror-sites-the-same-as-victims/) rule that terrorists be treated for wounds with the same urgency a victim of that terrorist would at the scene.

Israel [used a cutting edge, expensive treatment](http://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-spared-no-expense-treating-palestinian-stabber/) to save the life of a Palestinian stabber.

The Hamas Prime Minister's [brother in law](https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/08/231069.html) was treated in an Israeli hospital.

I already linked the story of thousands of Gazans getting treatment in Israel.

StooTubbs,2,Xcom,czk51vq,0,t3_43pn9n,"I have 2 fun stories:

One:

My very first playthrough of XCOM EU, on normal difficulty, I was seven shades of awful at the game. 

This wonderful story comes from the Temple Ship mission, wherein I struggled through despite my pitiful tactical prowess. When I finally reached the final door, I had an assault, named after myself of all people, with 2 remaining HP, and the heavy from the tutorial, who was bright yellow and called ""Big Sanchez"". 

I enter, and immediately, Big Sanchez, the beautiful man who had carried my sorry ass the entire campaign, was immediately mind controlled. There were probably other options from the eyes of a competent player, but I wasn't a competent player, and shot sanchez in the face, his slow motion death marking the end of my XCOM innocence. 

My assault with 2 hp in half cover somehow survived the onslaught of fire directed squarely at his emotionally hurt face, then ran right up to the Uber Ethereal and double-crit rapid fired it's face. I did not realise this would end the mission and the game, I just did it in a fit of wonderful gaming rage.

I wish the Temple Ship could make me feel this way again, but as it stands, it's pretty much the easiest mission in the game.

Two:

My most recent attempt at Ironman Impossible (Vanilla). That one map with the meat freezer at the back.

I stack up my 4 very low ranked troops, forgetting the number of aliens in this difficulty, and break open the doors. Owen Wilson, the randomly generated blonde maverick, practically faints at what he sees, 10 sectoids, having a birthday party, they probably had a cake and everything, I was too busy shitting my pants to check. 

I proceed to make what I'm not afraid to say were the best tactical decisions I ever have in XCOM, using my hunkered sniper as bait while my assault and my heavy leapfrog around flanking mind mergers. 

Only Owen Wilson died that day. Somehow. It was deeply saddening that the very next mission I squadwiped and had to abandon the campaign.

variaati0,11,worldnews,czk54it,0,t3_43nlgb,"Also Americans must understand the police tactics are different. In Europe police prefers containment over direct confrontation. In Europe police also prefers de-escalation. When that doesn't work they prefer overwhelming force presence.

Where American cops getting a suspected weapons call would be ground for immediately busting down the door pistols raised, In Europe it would be grounds for:

a) immediate call for heavy tactical backup, since unlike american cops European patrol cops don't play fair. European cops aren't going to engage in a pistol vs pistol or pistol vs rifle battle. It would be stupid. No instead it will be SMG or Carbine vs pistol or rifle. Why play on level playing field, when you don't have to.

This is grounds for the oddity (at least in some american and other minds) of having for example heavily armed officers in prominent public view in ""gun shy"" places like Sweden, UK or France. Those places aren't gun shy. They just think side-arms are rather useless. If you bring out guns, you don't bring out a pistol. No you go straight to SMGs to make sure you have  definitive and overwhelming firepower advantage. The officers seen in public are placed at high risk areas like metro stations, public offices etc, public gathering areas etc. Pistols aren't for real work, they are last ditch weapons.

b) containment aka the first (probably lightly armed) responding patrol is not going to confront the situation head on unless absolutely necessary to immediately save someones life from immediate death. They rather have risk hostage situation go on for a little while, than burst in ill prepared. Ill-prepared entry is anyway probably going get both the police and hostage killed. So instead they find out where the armed person is and try to lock them in place. Usually this means evacuating civilians from nearby and creating a security zone around the person by placing officers in strategic well shielded spots, so that they can shoots if necessary to stop escape, but otherwise under protection. Then they wait for tactical to arrive/ armed officers and negotiators to arrive.

c) negotiators. Negotiations solve majority of armed person cases. Those that can't be solved by negotiating are usually hard criminals and that means a major tactical team is being scrambled to handle the situation. Police in Europe can easily wait for a day or even multiple for a person to surrender. Their endurance is always longer than the armed persons. Usually only case for going in is civilians starting to get hurt at which point tactical will end the situation shiftly and permanently one way or another.

------------
For example here in Finland police officers carry sidearms, but almost newer use them. Almost all shootings done by police are done by carbines or SMGs. It is more accurate, more powerful and thus safer.

Only reason for example for Finnish cop to use sidearm is getting taken by surprise and having to use it as last ditch self-defense, when not able to retreat. Well that and euthanizing road kill animals. 

In all other situation they wait for armed patrol, which are called in very lightly at even first hint of armed persons being involved. Almost all cities have if not swat then a ""heavy response patrol"" on stand by in the field 24/7. Normally they do normal patrolling, but when priority call comes they drop everything else and rush to resolve dangerous situations. You don't notice them. They drive normal patrols and normally look and wear normal gear, but have heavy gear in the van. In minute they can deck out tactical ballistic and grab MP5s from the car.


Frankly if Finnish cops where patrolling a gun situation like USAs there would not be a single cop with anything less, but a SMG as their standard issue weapon in the field. (edit: assuming they would be armed. Other option would be un-armed community policing patrols. Trusting that not being armed would mean they would be shielded by most aggressiveness, since they aren't a lethal threat anymore) Our cops just don't play even, because they are the authority and that means they have the tools to match it. Why USA cops only carry measly pistols in a pistol riddled country is beyond me.",,1454361999,t1_czjnopa,,11,t5_2qh13,False,1454360405,0,1458226046,

Trying to buddy up with China staying on good relations with them will help relations with Russia so much more, along with north korea, and most of southern Asia, an angry isolated China with a GDP matching that of the US, yeah fucking good job trump, relations with China are at a fairly all time high, it's fairly worth it to keep them as such, Relations with Russia are shit because Russia wanted to act like a little shit towards everyone else, we don't need the US pulling the same stuff on China. 

So after all that said it'll just be shitty relations with both China and Russia under trump, Really good idea.

goodreadsbot,1,india,czk6gpe,0,t3_43no2b,"**Name**: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies

**Author**: Jared Diamond

**Avg Rating**: 3.98 by 150302 users

**Description**: A global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning
refutation of ideas of human development based on race. Until around
11,000 b.c., all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that
point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies
evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became
the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals
were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond
vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing
food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world
through conquest, displacement, and genocide. The paths that lead from
scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal
to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies
arise? Why weren't native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones
to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories
tracing societal differences to biological differences. He assembles
convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs
that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of
discovery. In its sweep, *Guns, Germs and Steel* encompasses the rise of
agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a
unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of
dinosaurs and glaciers. Jared Diamond, professor of physiology at the
UCLA Medical School, is the author of *The Third Chimpanzee*, awarded
the 1992 *Los Angeles Times Science Book Award*. He is a regular
contributor to Natural History and Discover magazines and lives in Los
Angeles.

I don't agree with paying any taxes but let us not debate that issue (lookup Anarchism). Socialism causes higher taxes. Initially, taxes are low as a small part of the population requires welfare but slowly over time the size of those on welfare grows to unsustainable levels. Socialism encourages poor people that cannot afford kids to have more kids. It is also tempting for some people to just take welfare instead of working for a living. More stable parts of society (middle classes) are taxed muxh more over time, so they have less incentives to have kids because they can't afford them (lower birthrates for productive classes). Ratio of unproductive/productive increases over time = bad. 

Slightly off topic: Socialism in Europe has caused mass immigration because migrants benefit from social welfare programs in certain countries. Many of these immigrants have little to no skills, have high crime rates, are ignorant of other cultures (stoning transsexuals or Christians) and come from a radicalised culture. 

&gt; No. The US did well in the past because their best and brightest went into the financial sector and manipulated money. They outsourced everything else.

That was part of it, but I'm talking about before all that, when the dollar was gold backed, the US could not manipulate and speculate as much then. Most of the manipulation started when they converted the dollar to a fiat/paper based currency.

Money is a government backed monopoly (you have to pay taxes in dollars). Under a purer capitalist system, it would be legal to create competing currencies in the US, some currencies could be gold, oil or whatever backed. The currency speculation and printing would not last long under such a system because people would start distrusting the dollar and would have viable alternatives. This will happen eventually anyway over time (lookup Peter Schiff).

Again, it's doable, but it's not a pick up and go thing. When I have traveled I've always tried to have something waiting for me at the destination. Friends, a job or a course, a place to stay. 

Try this if you are really serious about it. Start in North America (I'm assuming you're in the US). Quit your job, pack up your room, and hop on a bus. Pick a destination, somewhere far away, if you are in California, go to Maine, if you are in Florida, go to Yellowstone. See how long you can last doing odd jobs and bartering. If you can stick it out for six months, stay safe, stay out of trouble, then think about going abroad. This way you will get some experience as a traveler and if it turns out it's too much you aren't on the other side of the planet.

TL,DR It's doable, but you need to have some kind of plan to handle the unexpected.

EDIT: Don't drop out of school to do this. Abandoning a shitty job is fine. Abandoning your education is not.",,1454364173,t3_43qr1f,,2,t5_2qjdm,False,1454363769,0,1458227179,

2. Neighboring countries that are also primarily Islamic. Many of the refugees originally stayed in Turkey and migrated to EU only because they heard everything is free here and that no one will punish them for any crimes. It would be way easier for both Western countries and the refugees, as there would be no clash of cultures (which seems to primarily be a negative thing).

3. I have nothing against people who are truly in need, but any help should not be unconditional and should require that the people fully integrate into society (or it's a trip back home).

What you don't understand is that in the USA the entire government isn't dominated by party politics as is typical in Europe because we are a Federation of 50 individual States under a Federal umbrella, with a strong history of independence.  The US Civil War was fought exactly over the rights of individual States to sovereign government. 

The States make their own laws and what Republicans in New York push for may be entirely different than what ones in Alabama push for because of the different constituencies in each state.   

The system is designed so that Alabamans can't effect laws in New York, except where those laws are applied to the entire country on the Federal level.  For instance, until recently, gay marriage was legal in some states and illegal in others.  That is a situation that typically never happens in European countries because you have no sovereign divisions in your countries. 

In a very real way, the States themselves are the entities that vote in the Federal elections, rather than the people directly.  Every state sends Congressional representatives to the Federal government, the number of which is determined by population.

It's going to take a long while before non-Koreans will get better. The Koreans are just that much better. Highest level of skill is all concentrated in Korea. Non-Koreans will not get better collectively unless Korean teams start getting non-Koreans on their teams and practicing them, but this will not happen. There's no incentive for Koreans to go to other ladders and practice, because why would they? Why would Hydra not just play on the Korean server from the Root House? He has to get his 100 wins, but that shouldn't take too long. 

I mean of course there hasn't been any noticeable difference, because how often do the EU foreign hopes play against Koreans? They play amongst themselves for the most part so of course they are competitive amongst themselves. Against Koreans they aren't as competitive, because they play them so little. It's like asking a Euro league basketball team to go against NBA teams. NBA teams are 66-12 vs EU teams since 1990 prior to 2000 EU lost all 15 games versus the NBA. Slowly EU teams are getting more competitive winning most of their games in the last 6 years, but that's because 1. A lot more players are going to EU teams from America 2. EU players are benefiting directly from talent spread across the globe. Why wouldn't it work for SC2? ",GamaBears,False,t1_czka62n,,1,t5_2qpp6,False,1454370313,0,1458229251,Gama Bears

Cy-V,6,LifeProTips,czke60t,0,t3_43po1z,"Tl;dr: cost-benefit analysis

The long answer: A faulty one under warranty would need to be replaced anyway, they save money by negating the shipping cost. The cost for this is already in their budget and considered when setting a price. But it remains in their best interest to not have too many defective products which is why products are tested for not just functioning but also the longevity of that - too many broken products would ruin their profits.
In Europe all electronic devices have standard two year warranty by law, so companies would know that theirs need to function at least that long. If you're unlucky, you'll end up with your devices dying a month after warranty ends.

As a company you want your customers telling you something broke, and especially when a lot of them seem to call in ^x-time after purchase of a certain model, or if a certain function breaks more often. This can tell you something about production. The chance of a reward incentivizes customers to report on issues (we're an apathetic bunch of animals).

Add to that, this kind of customer service will keep you customers. Bad service might want to make people switch, if there's no issue or good service-you'll most likely stick to what you know next time you're looking to upgrade if replace.

Scrybblyr,1,news,czke80f,0,t3_43jvxc,"""First of all, there isn't a genuinely left wing government in Europe. The place is in a perpetual state of neoliberal austerity, generally speaking.""

The fuck does ""neoliberal austerity"" mean?

""As for 'internationalist', the fuck does that even mean? Having a conception of basic human rights?""

From Google: ""Internationalism is a political principle which advocates a greater political or economic cooperation among nations and peoples, and whose ideological roots can be traced to both socialism and liberalism.""

Translation: go around the world apologizing for the success and greatness of the United States, bowing to and kissing the asses of other world leaders, and making fucking stupid deals with our enemies which give them $150,000,000,000 while they celebrate 'Death to America' Day.

""You aren't complaining about bombing the middle east or free trade, you're complaining about refugees who show up at your borders. As if leaving them to rot is somehow ethical.""

Let me help you understand. If a group of homeless people show up at your front door and try to walk in, you are neither obligated, nor even wise, to let them into your home. Because a less fortunate person wants to take things that belong to you, does not obligate you to provide it. There are a lot of people who are less fortunate. Can you help homeless people? Absolutely. SHOULD you help homeless people? Of course you should. Can you give to charity, and/or collect for a charity, or volunteer at a soup kitchen? There are a lot of ways you can help. But are you somehow unethical for not letting people move into your home, with your family? No, and to imply otherwise is absurd. You can (and should) help those in need, but you need not jeopardize your family or your home to do it. There are other ways to help, which are not suicidally stupid. Likewise, if we refuse to allow thousands of jihadists (talking about aforementioned 1% again here, not ALL of them!) - if any country refuses to allow thousands of terrorists into its borders, then that country is acting in its own defense, and it is not unethical in the least. 

I love dogs. It is painful to me to see a homeless dog. But can I take every homeless dog home as a pet? No. And I don't mean to compare the refugees to dogs, I simply mean that while charity and goodness and empathy are crucial to our humanity, and we must act on those benevolent impulses, we must draw certain lines. (If you disagree, and believe that no lines are to be drawn, then please write to me after you have given your home to some of the Syrian refugees, and have given all of your worldly possessions away and committed 100% of your paychecks to some charity.)

""Then again, you don't believe in ethics. See, people who do don't peddle this madness.""

Covered.

""The only existential threat is people like you. I went over that already.""

A word of advice: those places that say ""the [X] lastname comes from [Y]"" and their ilk are basically useless for accurate information about your ancestry. Many people arrived to the americas because they were escaping from something in the old continent, so they changed their names and often used fake papers. On top of that, indigenous and african populations were often forced to adopt european names, and they'd pick the name of the local boss, so even if you have [X]-lastname, it may not come from its geographical origin. That, coupled with the high rate of migration within the country makes for extremely hard work tracking ancestors beyond a couple centuries.

And even if you find it, you are likely to end up with a boring bible-style list of ""A, son of B, son of C, son of D, son of E, son of F..."" and the track disappears when F arrived in a boat with Turkish papers nobody bothered to transcribe.

[deleted],1,news,czkfp4d,0,t3_43jvxc,"&gt;The fuck does ""neoliberal austerity"" mean?

If you don't know what either of those words mean you're probably not informed enough to be talking about politics. Neither are hard concepts to grasp, nor are they some obscure academic shit, nor did I pull it out of my ass. 

&gt; ""Internationalism is a political principle which advocates a greater political or economic cooperation among nations and peoples, and whose ideological roots can be traced to both socialism and liberalism.""

So basically it's a right wing buzzword that's objectively meaningless? The only ""cooperation"" happening in Europe is between large economic blocs, that's all it has ever been. 

&gt;Translation: go around the world apologizing for the success and greatness of the United States, bowing to and kissing the asses of other world leaders, and making fucking stupid deals with our enemies which give them $150,000,000,000 while they celebrate 'Death to America' Day.

So basically you want to ditch all realism and engage in fascistic hyper imperialism with no regard to basic decency or political reality? See, this is why i laugh at you people and consider you dangerous in the same breath. 

&gt;Let me help you understand. If a group of homeless people show up at your front door and try to walk in, you are neither obligated, nor even wise, to let them into your home. 

You know how we deal with homelessness in society? We build shelters. Because it turns out letting problems fester on the street is both inhumane and fucking stupid. What I think of the matter is irrelevent. These are human beings and a society that disregards basic humanity does not deserve to exist and it will collapse under its own bullshit anyway. People like you really don't know what you advocate. You think you can just be an amoral, apathetic, xenophobe with no consequences. No. What you are advocating is quite literally violence and chaos on a massive scale. 

&gt; Likewise, if we refuse to allow thousands of jihadists (talking about aforementioned 1% again here, not ALL of them!)

Stop trying this plausible deniability bullshit. You mean all of them or enough at least that you'd advocate destroying the lives of the vast majority because of your misplaced fear. 

You want to deal with Islamic extremism? You create mutual understanding between peoples and give alienated youth oppurtunity. You know how you encourage it? The bullshit you support. 

&gt;I love dogs. It is painful to me to see a homeless dog. But can I take every homeless dog home as a pet? No.

This isn't you. This is a whole fucking country with far more resources then you. Far more room for everyone. 

&gt;Your heart is in the right place, kid. Just gotta get your head up to speed.

ozzilla45,1,worldnews,czkfpdo,0,t3_43inoz,"Hey buddy, I wrote this up in response to your other comment and I don't feel that it should go to waste!

&gt;Except that gazans aren't starving. They are actually some of the most obese people in the world. 

Because Israel deliberately limits their intake to be sugar, limiting the amount of fruit and vegetables that go into gaza and doubling the amount of sugar. That doesn't mean that they are eating well or are not hungry. Obesity in this day and age is a sign of poverty.

&gt;That number is based on the reports from the gaza ministry of health, ...

Except that number is from the UN and it is different from the number that Palestine accepts. So how exactly is it based on the Hamas number. Oh and speaking of memos, where exactly is the evidence for this bold claim?  I immagine that with two conflicting interests in a body count I'm certainly not going to believe the very conservative estimate of civilian casualties by the Israeli government, so they can say ""See, no genocide!"" If the majority of casualties in Operation Protective Edge were civilian **which they were** and inflicted by the IDF, the most logical reasoning for this would be to accept that they were not avoiding civilian casualties. Also there is no evidence to suggest that Hamas ever used human shields. While there is overwhelming evidence that Israel *did*. 

&gt;It is just to show the hypocrisy of people like yourself who hold Israel to a different standard than anyone else in the world. Israel is the only nation held to such a high standard that they are expected to roll over and die rather than fight back against a bunch of religious lunatics trying to murder every last Jew.

Except no one is holding Israel to a different standard. The world considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization and Israel to be a legitimate government. Why would anybody *not* hold a government to a higher standard than a terrorist organization. The world is holding Israel to the standard of other legitimate governments. The world condemns Hamas. The only people who compare Israel to Hamas are Israelis. 

&gt;No, they are relevant because there are 150 million Russian citizens who are suffering from sanctions yet you aren't riled up about that. It is a clear sign of your hypocrisy and obsession with Israel.

I was riled up about it when it was in the news, but it no longer is. Why when Israel is criticized you Zionists like to point out some other problem in the world? It’s the most suspicious behavior when you are doing something wrong and then point out somebody else’s wrongdoing. 

&gt;The sanctions are the same as a blockade... 

I’m sorry but you don’t know what a blockade is. A blockade is a military force physically preventing someone else from trading with them. All of the countries currently sanctioning Russia right now did so of their own free will because they were unhappy with Russian international affairs, America didn’t make them. On the other hand plenty of countries did not carry out sanctions against Russian, and most of them would be easily squashed by the US military. So I think it’s fair to say that there is no “force” making other countries sanction Russia. 

&gt;Then why is there no mention of it in your comment history?...

If you go back far enough there will be, because I have made comments about it. Just like an Israeli, to be spying on everyone though. Lol. 

&gt;Not powerful enough that it's economy hasn't plummeted.

Yeah, but they’re not on the verge of failing by any means. The Palestinian governments do not have complete control over their territories, hence why the PLO’s authority is disputed, and at this point literally have no control over Gaza, hence why Gaza is fractured and not actually completely controlled by Hamas. Your attempts to put Russia (2nd most powerful country in the world) in the same field as Palestine (fractured governments not even recognized as a state) is ludicrous. 

&gt;If they spent their billions in free aid money building roads, schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, ...

That aid does go into building the schools and hospitals. The aid is granted by the people that actually go there and build the stuff, or at least oversee it. This is why all those schools that the IDF destroyed in 2014 were UN schools and hospitals. Nonetheless Hamas and Fatah wouldn’t have to be using it to buy weapons if Israel was not constantly invading them. And the UN wouldn’t have to be granting aid if Israel would stop destroying all of their infrastructure. 

&gt;Considering Israel is in control of the land, and someone else wants it, I would say that is disputed land. It was never Palestinian land. IT is a political contrivance to call it anything other than that, lest the Palestinians start hijacking planes again and attacking other countries. They are very good at the terrorism thing.

Really, it didn’t belong to the people that actually lived there?? Actually it belonged to people living in Europe. Yeah that makes since. 

&gt;Except international law is made up. It has no real force or effect. It is a political tool that is written after the fact to call something wrong when the international community doesn't like the outcome of their machinations. And what about arab imperialism that brought them from far away in the arabian peninsula to steal land in the levant? They are the real imperialists, trying to steal the Jewish homeland.

The international laws that Israel is breaking were ones written up before the fact. They were written in response to WWI and WWII because the world saw how ridiculously unethical they had been being. Also learn a little fucking history. I know you jews are tought your history, that’s one of the major points of the religion. The arabs didn’t exist when your ‘homeland’ was taken away from you. The Babylonians took it from the Jews. The arabs took the land from mostly pagans and allowed some jews to actually return. The most amount of Jews living in Palestine modern day Israel was greatest under Muslim rule until British Mandate era, when Zionists started flooding into Israel trying to take the land away. 

&gt;Did you not see the attacks mentioned where arabs from the west bank carried out attacks in Tel Aviv? How they got there isn't really the issue. You claimed they wouldn't be able to attack Israelis if they left the west bank and you were proven to be wrong again. I will quote them for you again.
October 8, 2015, an East Jerusalem arab stabbed 5 in Tel Aviv. http://www.timesofisrael.com/four-injured-in-tel-aviv-stabbing-attacker-killed/
November 19, 2015, 2 Israelis stabbed to death by arab resident of West Bank town of Dura.http://www.timesofisrael.com/one-israeli-dead-as-stabber-attacks-tel-aviv-office-building/
&gt;Both attackers were palestinains, not Israeli arabs. They find their way into Israel and murder regular Israelis, not ""settlers.""

“Both”. 2 criminals justify an entire war and blockades. 

&gt;It is irrelevant that the UN claims that land bought by Jews is not owned by them. The land was bought by Jews, lived on by Jews, and then cleansed of Jews. They returned and reclaimed it. It doesn't matter that you and the UN want to give their homes away to terrorists and those who support terrorism. Israel owns it and the arabs are never getting it back. Too bad. I guess that's what you get when you pick a fight you can't win.

Here you are showing your lack of empathy for an entire group of people and disregard for international law. Cliché Zionist: check. 

&gt;yes, they weren't committing acts of terrorism, right? These were just random stabbing attacks in the middle of a wave of terrorist stabbings, right? Are you so dumb you believe this or do you just have no recourse but to come up with an idiotic dismissal of the facts?

It’s an idiotic dismissal of facts to believe that *you* are able to *know* what someone was thinking before they died unless they told you. Did they tell you or is it just that you assume that they stabbed people because terrorism? 

&gt;I am just going by what you said: ""A lot more would have to die because the current number is minuscule especially in comparison to the amount of deaths of Palestinians."" You said that more Israelis need to die before you think it is ok for Israel to defend itself. 

Because as it currently is, Israelis are using crime statistics to justify full on war. They are using the actions of a few to justify the killing of an entire country. I’m not saying that they should die, I am saying that war would be an appropriate response to an actually significant amount of deaths rather than the current Israeli inflate the feelings of fear amongst the public and then wage war. 

&gt;Again, how stupid do you think everyone is? This is local crime, not terrorism? You are calling the blockade collective punishment, so that means the rocket attacks and tunnel attacks are just local crime?

I never said that the rocket attacks weren’t terrorism. I said that the knife attacks really aren’t. They are individual crimes. Also terrorism and collective punishment are not the same thing. Are you purposely misconstruing meanings of words to support your own agenda? 

 &gt;Do you not see the stupidity of claiming this isn't terrorism? Either way, you just aren't worth the time talking to but please do not misconstrue any future lack of response as agreeing with you or cowing to your arguments. You are just not worth my time because you make dumb, racist comments.

Ah yes, every critic of Israel must be a racist. How could they not see that we have the right to this land because of our ethnic superiority and our ties to a kingdom that’s been gone for 3000 years?",,False,t1_czjh1d7,,1,t5_2qh13,False,1454376484,0,1458231106,

Russian President Vladimir Putin used to seem invincible. Today, he and his regime look enervated, confused, and desperate. Increasingly, both Russian and Western commentators suggest that Russia may be on the verge of deep instability, possibly even collapse.

This perceptual shift is unsurprising. Last year, Russia was basking in the glow of its annexation of Crimea and aggression in the Donbas. The economy, although stagnant, seemed stable. Putin was running circles around Western policymakers and domestic critics. His popularity was sky-high. Now it is only his popularity that remains; everything else has turned for the worse. Crimea and the Donbas are economic hellholes and huge drains on Russian resources. The war with Ukraine has stalemated. Energy prices are collapsing, and the Russian economy is in recession. Putin’s punitive economic measures against Ukraine, Turkey, and the West have only harmed the Russian economy further. Meanwhile, the country’s intervention in Syria is poised to become a quagmire.   

Things are probably  much worse for Russia than this cursory survey of negative trends suggests. The country is weathering three crises brought about by Putin’s rule—and Russia’s foreign-policy misadventures in Ukraine and Syria are only exacerbating them.

First, the Russian economy is in free fall. That oil and gas prices are unlikely to rise much anytime soon is bad enough. Far worse, Russia’s energy-dependent economy is unreformed, uncompetitive, and un-modernized and will remain so as long as it serves as a wealth-producing machine for Russia’s political elite. Second, Putin’s political system is disintegrating. His brand of authoritarian centralization was supposed to create a strong “power vertical” that would bring order to the administrative apparatus, rid it of corruption, and subordinate regional Russian and non-Russian elites to Moscow’s will. Instead, over-centralization has produced the opposite effect, fragmenting the bureaucracy, encouraging bureaucrats to pursue their own interests, and enabling regional elites to become increasingly insubordinate—with Ramzan Kadyrov, Putin’s strongman in Chechnya, being the prime example. Third, Putin himself, as the linchpin of the Russian system, has clearly passed his prime. Since his catastrophic decision to prevent Ukraine from signing an Association Agreement with the European Union in 2013, he has committed strategic blunder after strategic blunder. His formerly attractive macho image is wearing thin, and his recent attempts to promote his cult of personality by publishing a book of his quotes and a Putin calendar look laughable and desperate.

The problem for Putin—and for Russia—is that the political–economic system is resistant to change. Such a dysfunctional economy is sustainable only if it is controlled by a self-serving bureaucratic caste that places its own interests above those of the country. In turn, a deeply corrupt authoritarian system needs to have a dictator at its core, one who coordinates and balances elite interests and appetites. Putin’s innovation is to have transformed himself into a cult-like figure whose legitimacy depends on his seemingly boundless youth and vigor. Such leaders, though, eventually become victims of their own personality cult and, like Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Mussolini, do not leave office voluntarily. Russia is thus trapped between the Scylla of systemic decay and the Charybdis of systemic stasis. Under such conditions, Putin will draw increasingly on Russian chauvinism, imperialism, and ethnocentrism for legitimacy.

Since none of this mess will be resolved anytime soon, Russia appears poised to enter a prolonged “time of troubles” that could range from social unrest to regime change to state collapse. It might be foolhardy to predict Russia’s future, but it is clear that the longer Putin stays in power, the worse things will be for the country. Putin, who claimed to be saving Russia, has become its worst enemy. For now, the United States, Europe, and Russia’s neighbors must prepare for the worst.

DRIVERS OF INSTABILITY

Some analysts dismiss the possibility of massive instability in Russia on the grounds that the opposition is weak, its leaders lack charisma, and Putin’s popularity is high. These factors are not as important as they are assumed to be. Most revolutions have come as a result of deep structural crises; few have been made by self-styled revolutionaries. Charismatic leaders emerge in the course of systemic instability as often as they predate it. And country-wide popularity is never as important for a movement or leader as power in the capital city and among key political and economic elites.

Imagine that the three crises noted above continue to deepen, as they in all likelihood will. In that case, nearly every sector of Russian society will get closer to rebellion. As inflation and unemployment rise and living standards fall, dissatisfaction will grow among workers and social unrest will increase. Political and economic elites, too, will grow increasingly unhappy as Russia’s three crises deepen. Their status and wealth will increasingly become vulnerable, and their willingness to countenance alternatives to Putin and his system will grow. Urban intellectuals, students, and professionals will likewise rediscover their voices and provide intellectual guidance to the forces of instability.

With more systemic chaos and elite stasis, patriotically-minded elements within the armed forces (army, militia, and secret police) will search for alternatives to Putin and his ruinous system of rule. And soldiers and mercenaries now fighting in Ukraine and Syria may return home and promote radical views throughout the country. Outside Russia, the Russian Federation’s 21 non-Russian republics will assert their authority.

For 18 years, Putin could defuse discontent by the three means all elites use to stay in power. He bought popular support with the windfalls from rising energy prices. He strengthened the forces of coercion and repressed discontent. And, by projecting manliness and vigor and promising to remake Russia in his own image, he created ideological incentives to support him and his regime. Thanks to his mistakes and the system’s decay, however, Putin no longer has the material resources he once possessed and his image has been greatly tarnished. And thanks to Russia’s transformation into a rogue state incapable of defeating Ukraine and increasingly mired in the Middle East, the vision of renewed Russian greatness is losing its appeal. As a result, Putin now relies almost exclusively on the forces of coercion to stay in power and sustain his regime. He thus depends on their willingness to go along with his rule. And Putin, whose regime recently adopted legislation permitting the secret police to shoot protestors, knows it.

*The United States is making headway on two historic trade agreements, one with 11 countries on the Pacific Rim and another with America's friends in Europe. These two agreements alone would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers.*

*But before the U.S. can complete the agreements, Congress needs to strengthen the country's bargaining position by establishing trade-promotion authority, also known as TPA, which is an arrangement between Congress and the president for negotiating and considering trade agreements. In short, TPA is what U.S. negotiators need to win a fair deal for the American worker*

Now that we have the connection with TPP, lets talk about him flipping. I'm glad you finally acknowledged that.

However your argument is that he flipped because of deals between McConnell and Boehner.

Sure he would say that.

But we all know that he flipped because Trump came out against it and lead the fight against globalism. Cruz just rode his coattails, like usual.

332i,1,funny,czkibf7,0,t3_43q67y,"Dude both sides of my family were poor as fuck growing up.  My mom grew up on mayonnaise sandwiches.  Just mayonnaise and bread.  My dad was one of six siblings with no father for them.  His father died when my dad was 12.  Single mother.  Of those six siblings: One cop, three teachers, a fire fighter, and an accountant.  All of them graduated from college.  No idea what my moms side of the family does, because they live far away and we've never been close, but she went from eating mayonaise sandwiches to having a masters and had to take years off from year to year of school to pony up the money for it.  But my grandfather came here from sicily when he was 18.  He retired at 70 years old and sold a furniture company that he built from the ground up.  He's sold leather computer chairs to people like Michael Jordan.  They were immigrants, came here, white, worked hard, etc.  Both sides of my family lived in one of the worst cities in the country.  I was born in said city and lived their until we I was three and we moved to the suburbs.  I've witnessed this all first hand and I also have a disability.  So I know what goes on at every level.  

My fathers side of the family came here when there were signs on businesses' windows that said shit like ""irish need not apply"".  My fathers family is from ireland and we have one of the most irish last names on the planet.  We've lived poverty.  We've lived in ghettos, myself included.  Gunshots and sirens all night.  Sirens still make the hair stand up on the back of my neck.  

If you compare all of the minorities in America to blacks...blacks are getting they're clock cleaned by ALL of them.  Scientific studies don't exist...because reality answers any scientific questions when you look at the stats.  Why are black people the biggest issue when it comes to crime and poverty?  African Americans have been here longer than my family.  We clawed out.  Why can't they?  I don't understand.  Why are they the most problematic race in America?  Are you kidding me?  

What would a ""scientific study"" be comprised of.  Explain to me how you would test that without stats that show their current state in terms of crime, poverty, wealth, success, etc.  Why are they in the bottom of the barrel in these matters, when they've been here longer than every single other minority?

Why don't all sorts of asians including indians, europeans, etc...why does every single other race that migrates here not have crime issues like blacks and why do they not sit stagnant when it comes to poverty and wealth?  Because blacks don't work as hard as other people.  Simple.  It's black culture.  They have a low standard of living and accept it.  Then they blame there issues on people who are higher up the social/food chain. 

Think about it in a pragmatic, factual manner and put race aside.  Let's put it in terms of dog breeds.  Okay, you breed all these colors of dogs among each other.  We'll call blacks ""pitbulls"".  When you have career criminals and low lives breeding with each other...do you expect them to produce showcase quality pups?  Or do you expect low lifes to produce more low lifes...whilst they corrupt their baby low lifes pristine hard drives?  It's a viscous cycle that they don't care enough to get out of.  I've lived this shit dude.  I've seen it first hand.  

People ignore facts and don't want to believe shit.  Skin color is not the issue.  It is the breed.  They're the only minority that has a massive problem with crime and poverty.  Latino/as, asians, whites...basically anyone else who comes here usually figures shit out to a point that they're not eating off of frisbees and selling drugs or committing theft and shit...and pumping out more kids that are going to be one in the same.  They have no interest in cleaning up their neighborhoods, etc.  They blame it on everyone above.  It's retarded.  Dude these people have been breeding career criminals and low lifes since slavery.  Why do you think black athletes are so fucking fast and better at some sports?  Because the  ones that made it to freedom via means like the underground railroad were the fastest runners.  No joke.  Think about it.  Not many people are going to outrun dogs and a bullet from the plantation into a safe zone, then up into the north.  It's not about skin color.  It's literally about a breed, how far back it goes and why it still exists.  That goes the same for every other race and denomination on the planet.

You can't argue with this shit.  It's not clear that poverty induces crime.  It's clear that blacks commit the most crime and are the poorest.  Period.  People just like to attempt to link one statistic to another to make excuses.  ""Oh, it's because they're poor."".  Really?  Why am I not a criminal or anyone else in my massive family.  My family was born out of the IRA dude.  Think about that.

You can link any statistic you want to another.  Any correlation is a suggestion.  A thought.  A hope.  The stats speak for themselves.  There is no scientific studies to be had.  The factual statistics prove that black people commit more crimes and they're more poor in terms of money.  There are other minorities living in the same places with the same disadvantages...and they don't even come close to the rates that blacks provide.

It is what it is.  If you can't handle it and want to rationalize with bullshit or say things are inconclusive...good luck to you in life, because you are flying blind and gripping to bullshit like grim death.  You are literally ignoring facts.  Compare them to other minorities that are in the same position or worse and then come back with an argument.  Other minorities are coming over here with nothing.  Blacks have been here for two fucking centuries...and they still can't straighten their act out.  But fuck, some poor kid can come up here from south america and make something of himself.  Odd, isn't it.  No, not in the least.

I'm afraid that as far as getting new fans in the west, BABYMETAL have definitely got an uphill battle ahead of them.  I think it's safe to say that most music fans in Europe and North America have probably already made their minds up about the band.  

I've done my very best to get my circle of friends into them, but it's just not going to happen...and I tend to hang around with people who are very open to new music.  Despite all my efforts to the contrary, having watched Gimme Chocco, they have all decided that:

* a) it's a gimmick
* b) it's the exploitation of young girls
* c) Japanese teenager voices are too high pitched
* d) It's not in english, and only english music is worth taking seriously
* e) some combination of the above
* ( f) I'm somewhat odd for being such a fan)

Even if Metal Resistance is the best album since Abbey Road, I can't really picture any of my friends changing their minds.

Having said that, the one sub market that is ripe for some turnover is metal fans.  If they can release a mature sounding polished record, with the legitimacy that the Kami bring to bear, they could definitely bring over some new converts.

But all this only speaks to the West.  I think in Japan, even if the album is just OK, they've got no place to go but up.  I get a real sense that since the girls have played around the world, something very few Japanese artists have done, they are somewhat revered at home.  Add to that the fact that Susuka's voice has become a legitimate force of nature, and their showmanship is second to none, and you've got pretty good odds for success.

So I don't think there's any question of 'make or break'.

Laughable. Beyond laughable, really. Ludicrous.

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe

&gt;Jewish ghettos in Europe were parts of a number of cities in Europe in which Jews were permitted to live. In addition to being confined to ghettos, Jews were placed under strict regulations and disabilities in many European cities.[1] The character of ghettos varied over times. In some cases, they comprised a Jewish quarter, the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews. In many instances, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos had narrow streets and small, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system. Around the ghetto stood walls that, during pogroms, were closed from inside to protect the community, but from the outside during Christmas, Pesach, and Easter Week to prevent the Jews from leaving during those times.
&gt;
&gt;The distribution of the Jews in Central Europe (1881, German). Percentage of local population:  dark burgundy  18% (and higher),  red  13%,  pink  9%,  blue  4%,  light blue  3%,  brown  2%,  beige  1% (and lower)
In the 19th century, Jewish ghettos were progressively abolished, and their walls taken down. However, in the course of World War II the Third Reich created a totally new Jewish ghetto-system for the purpose of persecution, terror, and exploitation of Jews, mostly in Eastern Europe. According to USHMM archives, ""The Germans established at least 1,000 ghettos in German-occupied and annexed Poland and the Soviet Union alone.""[2] ...
&gt;
&gt;Nazi Germany organized ghettos in many occupied countries. The Łódź/Litzmannstadt Ghetto existed in a Polish city annexed to Germany, small ghettos were organized in Heidemühle, Koło, Będzin.

You realize Bjerg didn't come back until week 9 of that split right? And if I remember correctly Regi played what, 1 or 2 weeks? Bjerg played most of the split without the correct visa, he was only back for the final 2 weeks. 

&gt; then went back to Europe with the sole intent of getting the proper visa 

Shortly before the tourist visa ran out, how convenient :)

&gt; The chances of Regi saying ""yeah fuck rito they'll never suspect a thing"" are very unlikely and it was more than likely a case of him not realizing that Bjerg needed a more specialized visa to continue playing.

Why wouldn't he report it to Riot then if he all of a sudden randomly and conveniently realized right before Bjerg's tourist visa ran out that it was against the rules? His player played illegally for 6 months, I thought Regi was all about following the rules and being a super good moral guy? :)

Not to mention the fact that this has been a rampant problem in LCS for years and still even now, Regi had to know about other players in LCS on tourist visas. I'm sure he just forgot about the rule or something, since Regi can do no wrong ever.

&gt; For all the outrage over Trumps comments, he's not actually wrong though. I note nobody can disprove what he's saying, just loadsa ad-homiem attacks.

&gt; Reading trough this thread I note just how many apologists, defenders of the undefendable &amp; right on, PC, naive people there are. Some of you should be ashamed of yourself.

&gt; I mean here in the UK we're a very tolerant(the most tolerant in Europe and the World imo), accepting bunch, not perfect mind but we've come along way and have fought hard for our rights, and I don't see why we should go backwards(Tolerance should not be a one way thing) by having these people here. Thats why as a gay man I find supposed ""Islamophobia"" to be entirely rational. Why should I or anyone be accepting of a such a hateful, intolerant, facist. misogynistic, homophobic, supremicist &amp; segrationist ideology??... Most of these migrants(https://youtu.be/W2QcffxADHY Just look at that) &amp; muslims already here represent and believe in many of those elemants. They share those abhorrent values. See Islam is ultimately incompatable with secular democratic western values(Christopher Hitchens beautifully explains it in depth superbly.. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CADoG-gu5Zk).

&gt; Now if they completely renounced, totally reject, do away with and see how wrong their vile culture of homophobia, misogyny, segregation, supremism, hate, intolerance etc is. And are ok with and see nothing wrong with open mocking n criticism, in-depth questioning n scrutiny of Islam etc. And fully accept and embrace British/X- European country values n recognise British/x-european country's laws and Western liberal democratic values as right n above Islamic ones etc etc...Then yes I would be ok with Muslims coming to Europe. But seeing as that's not the case I feel I'm correctly justified in my stance.

&gt; Though I do think that the US should be doing more, as they're the country which has contributed the most to the wars/bloodshed/destabilisation of the region etc.. They should be doing more than just idily standing by looking on at the mess they bare the most responsibility for creating.

&gt; Also I'm against n feel the same way about Christianity and Judaism as well. The Old Western world's centuries old struggle to tame Christianity shows us exactly why we should not &amp; cannot allow Islam to be so prominent in our societies. Despite the would be enablers.. History shall not repeat itself. It's simple really.

&gt; Oh and I think no more Muslims should be allowed into Europe. Plus with regards to the ones we already have here. I want to see new laws put into place...

It's probably in large part remnants of the pathos that drove the Occupy movement that's behind Bernie's support as well... they feel there's a systemic failure that's causing them to suffer, and they want to change it. They see that wall street has money, that they don't have as much, and they want things to change to fix that issue.  

Again, this isn't that different from Trump supporters, who feel that the system has failed them because it hasn't kept them safe from illegal immigrants, terrorists, or the consequences of out-of-control-debt.

Let it be understood that when one speaks of Afrika, and when most whites think of ‘Africa’, they are coming from two different worldviews. One view supports the Afrikan ethos, while the other view supports the European ethos.”

The Introduction:

* A global threat is suggestive of a global insurgency of some form or another. An insurgency that seeks to establish world power and order. The subversion, use of terrorism and armed conflict to achieve this aim is carried out against multiple governments who represent an opposition to the threat doctrine.
* How well do we understand the root causes of violent extremism? Well, that depends what *type*. We understand many factors that have the potential to turn someone violent or bear comfort and support to their coming of violence. Extremism is a poor term for this - extreme ideas are not always wrong. There needs to be a better delineation here.

First Question:

* The first question relates directly to a Military situation, exampling that we are dealing with civil situations too - that said, an insurgency that is supported be a civilian population. Civil society involvement, including women and children.
* He states the Daesh is defeatable ""Militarily"", suggesting that the ideological aspects are left to be defeated. Remember when the Americans used to call it *Al Qaeda ideology*, now they're just calling it *ISIS ideology*, in other words saying it was a brand like the second speaker on the third question--again, ignoring the basis for these ideologies, i.e. a religious basis, Qutbism, etc.

Second Question:

* Bam! There it is. ""It has something to do with Islam"" (4:45). Round of applause ladies and gentlemen. Second, it has something to do with the ""system of our countries"", that being democracy as opposed to theocracy.
* And again backing up the point that the civil, ideological and sociological aspects of this issue has not been countered (5:12).
* This is indeed true that no extreme Islamic organisation has been countered successfully without the help of external factors (i.e. the West) (5:27).

Third Question (Root Cause):

* Gang-related (tribal) mentality. Sure, to a degree. I note for myself that crime is linked to the terrorists that I knew. ISIS are selling death, no one buys into that? Well, if we're going to the highest tier of Paradise, maybe some people *do*. A sociopath or psychopath could join them, yes. Do they buy it more willingly? Not really, no.
* Bam! Correct, the sociological elements such as economics and education does not fit the jigsaw piece.
* A generational issue would bring grievances, which is plausible. This happened for Jake Bilardi. Some call this the ""youth culture"" (youth alienation) theory. Defeating loyalism (to religion) and revivalism (of religion) are important, too.
* Protection and duty of care are great points for parents especially. 
* Kill the brand, kill the demand. How? By censoring the Qur'an or Hadith?

Fourth Question (Upstroke in Terrorism):

* In my opinion, yes it is getting worse and that is only expected. This is a continual war that will not end until, as the first speaker suggested, that ideological aspect is defeated. This is nighe impossible, however we can diminish it to the standards as done before with such concepts as Communism.
* Prevention, Diplomacy and Enforcement sides of the argument. Convincing the people--treating an insurgency like an insurgency through hearts and minds. Slow clap.
* Counter-propaganda/narrative campaigns. Good.
* Uniting religions and speaking about sociological elements does some good. But this does not combat the above - the ideology. His argument is basically a call for unity and solidarity but on sociological concepts, not religiously-based concepts. As he says, it is multifaceted, so why not target this area?

Fifth Question (Cultural Erosion/Attack):

* Is culture at the heart of today's conflicts? Yes. Religion is the blood that pumps through it.
* Islamic bookstores are problems indeed, with ""radical"" books.
* Plurality and dualism. This is not too bad an argument in regards to identity. But the narrative of this is not solely through organisations but scripture and supporting scripture itself.
* Polytheistic, a shared humanity (16:00). This is absolutely true. Islam unfortunately splits the world between dar al-Islam and dar al-Harb, and when people believe it, you destroy human cohesion.

Sixth Question (Sociological Question):

* The media hardly describes this as a religious conflict, at least accurately.
* What a loaded question--it simplifies things. No it does not, and that does not mean it is wrong. As you say it has a very ""clear religious aspect"" (17:35).
* Hit the nail. Faith-based problems, not accommodating. The theological narrative dominates.

20 minutes in, good debate so far. All I can say is - they do not read your propaganda. They read Muhammad's or Qutb's or other propaganda. And yes, you CAN apply these literally. That is what we are SEEING. By the way I like how the multiplicity argument happened to only be in regards to European countries, not Saudi or other countries. That whole argument was underfunded. The diversity argument was quite poor. There were no solutions there apart from ""new ideas"" which is ambiguous and suggestive of NO solution.

And then (39:15) the push was towards Islamic countries. Well... this is a start. Embracing other countries from the Islamic world. Criticize lots of things, too. Exactly. Self-criticism is important. But that also means the history you were talking about and ""coexisting""... which in the Ottoman Empire was not as good as you have romanticized.

And women's issues are vitally important. Changing the dominant culture, especially for women. The emancipation of women - especially over their sexual rights - is a large key to many of the sociological issues. Oh my God did someone say Islamic patriarchy?! Slow clap. But then the Priest goes on to mention humanism within religion. That is not present in Islam, as far as I know. So what is there to reclaim? Where is the Golden Rule to allow that?

Should extreme thought be the target? Yes and no because we have free speech. The slippery slope theory made me laugh. Thought crimes and control is, indeed, a worry in that regard.

Tolerance? Tolerating bad ideas is a bad idea. To some degree, people representing interest groups will not tolerate a lot of things that do not fund their narrative or agenda.

- A direct hit from a baseball bat is usually catastrophic.  You are going down and the perp will then beat you to death.
- I don't know about this specific PD, but many police departments in the USA are not allowed to carry tasers.  
- Police usually carry a pistol, a taser, pepper spray, and their fists.  Some departments don't have tasers, even if they do, those are single shot weapons.  If you miss, you die.  Pepper spray is not 100% effective either.  A baseball bat always beats fists.  That leaves the pistol as the only viable option if a policeman values his life.

BGSacho,35,KotakuInAction,czkqhkc,0,t3_43r2z4,"As with everything else, this is money privilege rearing its ugly head. The upper middle class usually live in affluent neighbourhoods, where only capable or already-rich migrants move to. Most of the migrants move to poor neighbourhoods or ghettos, so they're out of sight and mind for all the sjw activists and the media. So journalists will keep harping on about how you must take in more migrants, while the poor clash with the islamic disregard for secular laws and the zero willingness for assimilation. 

This is why there's a **huge** rise in popularity for the right and far-right parties - and you see the attempts at damage control from the left, ranging from forming coalitions to block the right out of government, to swinging their media clubs at them.

Just like the US has the terrorism boogeyman that has led to almost four terms of war-mongering, Europe has the evil nazi boogeyman to unite all the comrades under the community banner.

A similar thing happened when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU. Their Roma population is notorious for poor education, lack of assimilation and disregard for the rule of law(which probably just stems from the poor education), and when they tried to migrate to the west and set up ghettos in Norway and France, they were fairly swiftly ""dealt with"", despite an outcry from the media at how horrible and evil that was. My guess is that this time, the migrant situation got too far, and it's impossible to just deport them back. Plus there's the extra trump card of ""they're refugees, you can't send them back to a war zone"". 

Regardless of that, European countries will have to face the reality of living with a minority that has almost no interest in becoming part of their country. Since my country has been dealing that for a long time, all I can say is...welcome to the club. Within a few years these migrants will be proper citizens, and you'll see parties rush to grab their vote, so expect a political shakeup as well. Eventually, certain parts of your country will become ghettos where you know not to go, and some parts will grow into vibrant muslim communities that welcome visitors but still have their own, unique culture. Your social benefits program will be tested to its limits for every possible abuse, so better hope there's some reformist sentiment in your politicians, otherwise you'll be saddled with a program that runs on a massive deficit that will collapse in a couple of generations.

Maybe give the lawyer a name? Even 'Mr. Smith' or something like that. It feels less awkward than calling him 'Lawyer'. 

That opening paragraph could use a bit of reworking. How about something like:

Mr. Smith, 20, (not calling him Lawyer) sits next to Keaton, 40. 

Really, their ages are all we need to suggest that one is more fit, and energetic than the other. 

We don't really need to know that one is slightly older than the others. All we need is:

Mr. Smith shows Keaton a picture of some college kids. 

Strike the 'Keaton moves forward' thing (leave that to the director), and we can gather from the dialogue that he's realized who the student is. Also some of the dialogue is stilted/needs cutting. The first several lines are okay. But after that, try something like:

KEATON

He's alive? Is he working?

MR. SMITH

He's a student. (You don't need 'no'; the subtext of this statement is self-evident)

KEATON

Get out.

MR. SMITH

He's been targeted. Interested?

KEATON

Do I get help?

MR. SMITH

Mercenaries. And Control. 

KEATON

When do I leave?

MR. SMITH

Right now. 

On page 2:

We don't necessarily need that detail about the bunk; leave it to whatever director/production crew winds up with the script. You can shorten it to:

Phone rings. Mia, 20, awakens and answers. 

The following exchange is enough to let us know she's reluctant. And it fortunately has enough brevity that it doesn't need TOO much editing. 

From the third 'fuck you', I'd make these edits:

CONTROL CHICAGO

Sleeping?

CONTROL NEW YORK

Yes.

CONTROL CHICAGO

Later.

CONTROL NEW YORK

Ugh. Fine. Sup?

CONTROL CHICAGO

Big Bad Wolf is going to Finland. The European's been targeted.

CONTROL NEW YORK

CONTROL CHICAGO

We can't find him. 

CONTROL NEW YORK

Who's ""The European""?

CONTROL CHICAGO

566515 in the database. 2AM okay?

CONTROL NEW YORK

Yeah. Later. 

On page 3:

You can cut this down to:

Call ends. Mia pulls up profile. 

The bit where Mia reads his info aloud really won't fly. It's clunky. People don't behave that way. If the information is absolutely necessary, use a SUPER, here:

SUPER: 29, 6'1, 263 jobs, 100% success rate. (It doesn't necessarily seem like a computer would qualify aspects like athleticism and scars, so much as hard data)

Strike the bit about it being 'surprising'; that sort of interpretation is up to the actor and director. If it isn't written that Mia closed the profile, we'll naturally assume she left it open. Just write, after the SUPER:

Mia heads back to bed. 

ALSO, use 'NIGHT' instead of a few hours later; if Keaton hasn't made it to Finland yet, according to CHICAGO, then we can gather that this is not too long after the first scene. For the next scene, go with 'DAY' instead of 'THE FOLLOWING MORNING'. Also go with 'HALLWAY' instead of 'OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL'.

The opening paragraph of the scene can be cut down to:

Maria, 25, The European, and their classmates wait. Try cutting the dialogue:

&gt; Towards the end of last year, a shocking statistic appeared deep in the pages of a World Health Organisation report. It was this: suicide has become the leading killer of teenage girls, worldwide.

&gt; More girls aged between 15 and 19 die from self-harm than from road accidents, diseases or complications of pregnancy.

&gt; For years, child-bearing was thought to cause the most deaths in this age group. But at some point in the last decade or so – statistics were last collected on this scale in 2000 - suicide took over. And, according to the WHO’s revised data for 2000, it had already just inched its way ahead of maternal mortality at the turn of the millennium.

&gt; Yet, somehow, we didn’t notice.

&gt; I heard the statistic from Sarah Degnan Kambou, President of the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), at a Gates Foundation breakfast last month.

&gt; Most of my fellow guests worked in the fields of global women’s rights or female health. Yet they were as stunned as I was to hear it.

&gt; “I’m not quite sure why we haven’t realised this before,” says Suzanne Petroni, a senior director at ICRW. “Maternal mortality has come down so much, which is fantastic,” she says.

&gt; That’s a major factor behind the fall in the overall death rate for 15-19 year old girls from 137.4 deaths per 100,000 girls in 2000 to 112.6 today. It’s an amazing achievement.

&gt; And it has allowed the spotlight to fall, finally, on what has actually been the biggest killer all along: suicide.

&gt; The report looks at six global regions. In Europe, it is the number one killer of teenage girls. In Africa, it’s not even in the top five, “because maternal deaths and HIV are so high,” says Petroni.

&gt; But in every region of the world, other than Africa, suicide is one of the top three causes of death for 15 to 19 year old girls. (For boys, the leading killer globally is road injury).

&gt; It’s particularly shocking given that suicide is notoriously underreported.

&gt; “We don’t really know the extent of the problem,” says Roseanne Pearce, a Senior Supervisor at Childline in the UK. “Because the coroner often won’t record it as suicide. Sometimes that’s at the family’s request, and sometimes it’s simply to protect the family’s feelings.”

&gt; In countries where stigma is particularly high, suicides are even less likely to be recorded than they are in the UK. And the poorest countries in the WHO’s report have very patchy data on births and deaths at all, let alone reliable detail on what caused those deaths.
In South East Asia, the problem is acute: self-harm kills three times more teenage girls than anything else. (The Eastern Mediterranean, which includes Pakistan and the Middle East, has the second highest rate.)

&gt; Professor Vikram Patel, a psychiatrist who was recently featured in Timemagazine’s 100 Most Influential People for his work in global mental health, is blunt in his diagnosis:

&gt; “The most probable reason is gender discrimination. Young women’s lives [in South East Asia] are very different from young men’s lives in almost every way.”

&gt; The male suicide rate in this age group is 21.41 per 100,000, compared with 27.82 for girls.

&gt; This is the age at which girls may be taken out of school and forced to devote themselves to domestic responsibilities, forgetting all other abilities or ambitions. Hitting puberty can mean no longer being allowed to socialise outside the home. Sometimes it can mean no longer being allowed out of the home at all. And, sometimes, it can mean forced marriage.

&gt; […]

&gt; Rhea (not her real name) is 17 and has attempted suicide twice. **“Porn was everywhere in my school,” she says. Her boyfriend Andy became “obsessed with it”.**

&gt; **She’d “made it clear,” she says, that she “wasn’t ready to have sex,” but one evening he sexually assaulted her in a park. The assaults became routine. Rhea did nothing.**

&gt; **“The constant talk about porn had made me feel like what was happening was normal,” she says. She uses that word repeatedly to describe her attitude towards Andy’s assaults: normal.**

&gt; “I felt trapped, like everyone thought it was normal and I had to go along with it if I wanted to be accepted.” The pressure to conform to these perceived expectations was so great that, eventually, Rhea says, “I felt like there was no way out.” She tried to kill herself.

&gt; “The suicide attempt rate for young women in the UK is extremely high,” says Prof Patel. He believes “sexual pressure” is a significant factor in their unhappiness.

&gt; Roseanne Pearce agrees, adding that “sexting is another big issue among our callers. Girls become desperate, even suicidal, because they’ve sent a picture and it’s been posted online.”

&gt; There is also relentless pressure on Western girls look a certain way: to be thin and sexy. The boys at Rhea’s school constantly compared the girls’ bodies to women they saw in porn films, almost always negatively.

&gt; […]

&gt; But, he says, “groups that have less power” tend to be most vulnerable - suicide rates are consistently higher among the unemployed, and the economically or socially marginalised.

&gt; Young women in parts of the Middle East and South East Asia are some of the most disempowered and marginalised people in the world.

&gt; Even in the West, adolescence is a time when girls feel their choices become restricted: that they must look and behave in certain ways to be accepted.

&gt; “Gender is a pervasive global issue,” says Prof Patel. And, as we’re somewhat belatedly realising, the consequences can be fatal.”",,False,t1_czk1bvu,,-1,t5_2r0gj,False,1454398161,0,1458896644,And none shall molest them from morn until e'vn... except Joseph

Most of these guys are too far gone. They despise Islam with a deep passion that blinds them because it has proven incapable of dealing with the spiritual void of modernity. This isn't some logical conclusion they've come to from studying different faiths, this is a knee-jerk reaction to a choice every faithful person has to face in a modern world: do I stick harder to the moral teachings of my religion in the face of the modernist invasion, or do I abandon it completely? 

They've picked option three: revive a corpse and dress it up for the party. Reverting back to Zoroastrianism for Persians or to Pagan religions for Europeans isn't really a reactionary movement, it's actually a very modernist move, you are denying all the existing traditions which are the result of thousands of years worth of trial and error for a blank piece of paper in some perpetual imaginary point in history. 

People too attached to the customs of their people can't abandon tradition as easily as modernists do, so they reject one living, thriving, established tradition with actual measurable social power for one that is dead or dying, and can be re-written at will or interpreted freely to the point of fitting the nihilistic modern existence. 

ISIS is the exact same creature, a complete rejection of all tradition with the brand of ""bid-ah"", and a perverse demand to return to ""true"" textual Islam, which probably never existed and never will. When ISIS actually wins power and tries to recreate society based on an ideological conception of the past, and fails, its members become modernists. 

So a modernist is a disappointed protestant, and these guys are either proto-Atheists or ex-Atheists who are too shy to admit the full effects of standing face to face with the horrendous abyss of a chilling emptiness that is the existence of a lonely man in an infinite universe. Defining humanity as sentient meat requires either extreme courage or extreme dimwittedness, and if you lack in both the only way is to play dress-up and get your fix of the opium from a less controversial source than the established religion. They adhere to the same set of moral principles of all other modern men, which is a more developed and secular version of protestant Christianity.

Regarding Anthony Johnson, I think we read different articles here because I don't see where it says this case was at all precedence setting. In fact it mentions another case entirely:
&gt;Many historians describe indentured servant John Punch as the first documented slave in America, as he was sentenced to life in servitude as punishment for escaping in 1640.[17][18] The Punch case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a negro and that of the two European indentured servants who escaped with him (one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman). It is the first documented case in Virginia of an African sentenced to lifetime servitude. It is considered one of the first legal cases to make a racial distinction between black and white indentured servants.[19][20]

John Punch, in case you didn't bother to look into any of those references, was not owned by Anthony Johnson but by Hugh Gwyn a white Virginia landowner and member of the House of Burgesses. The reason no one mentions Anthony Johnson, is because no one knows who the fuck he is. Except, I guess people that want to say ""But black people owned slaves too!"" as if that totally makes it all acceptable.

White people were the only ones that fought to abolish slavery? Someone better let these guys [know.](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war/) Or these [guys] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Turner). And I guess all the people in [Haiti] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution) (and really all over South and Central America) would want to be more kind to their white saviors too. 

And man, it's a good thing racism and disenfranchisement of black people ended with slavery!

Tonberry is the server with the highest population of English-speaking players on the Japanese Elemental Data Center. In fact, it can be said that we constitute about half of Tonberry's total population. Most of us are from the regions of SEA and Oceania.

Although there are English-speaking players on servers like Atomos, Gungnir, Kujata or Masamune, they are much fewer in comparison.

To prevent everyone from just piling onto crowded servers and to curb RMT, the developers have setup [Character Creation Restrictions](http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/80cd4583bf743600105b947d6906d0909189e479) during periods of high congestion. There is no set regular time for when the restrictions are removed because this depends on the numbers of players who are currently logged in.

There are a bunch of things you can do to make it easier to enter a highly populated server such as Tonberry.

1) Design the appearance of your character first and save it in advance.

2) Try entering during periods of low online population. The usual examples are:

* Very late at night when most people are asleep.

* Very early in the morning when most people are at work/school.

* Just after server maintenance before most players have logged in.

3) This is the more expensive option. Create your character on another server first, then use the [World Transfer Service](http://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/help/option_service/world_transfer_service/) to transfer into Tonberry.

But McCain, the CIA, and the Pentagon supported the Free Syrian Army, whose members promptly defected to ISIS-affiliated groups.

[deleted],-1,worldnews,czktvpc,1,t3_43ri4u,"While I'm in agreement with Nahles' statement in general, the definition of ""integration"" is always a little fuzzy. On the whole, migrants of all flavours (economic and refugees) are rightfully expected to learn the language to a reasonable degree and respect our laws, cultural standards and customs. That means no discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation or religion for one thing.

That being said, I think many people tend to forget how difficult it is to learn a language that is so fundamentally different from your own. To put this into perspective, think about how difficult it is for you to learn Arabic, and you have a rough idea. The only advantage they have is that Arabs and North Africans are for the most part already familiar with the Latin alphabet. And I don't condemn individuals either for struggling mentally to come to terms with women's equality or LGBT rights - it's how people act on those fears that's the problem.

I also believe that we as a European society need to understand priorities when it comes to customs and treating people of different genders and sexual orientations with equality. What happened in Cologne was unforgivable and must be punished - there's no doubt about that. The staring, jeering and molestation by many anti-social youths that have found their way in through refugee channels also needs to be dealt with.

But focusing on other matters that are quite frankly of lesser priority - for example about how devout Muslim men will not shake a woman's hand (it's worth pointing out that they do this *out of respect*, a classíc case of culture clash) - only seeks to undermine the greater effort to integrate refugees and migrants. I've met plenty of devout Muslims who follow this rule and were still very courteous towards my wife, giving the traditional hand-on-heart Muslim greeting with a slight bow and a smile.

Personally - and I hope I speak for most decent Germans here - I only expect migrants to make an effort to learn German as best they can, respect the law, earn their keep, and respect the equality of women, LGBT persons and people of other religions. That, for me, is integration.

But I know that for some people - many AfD voters and PEGIDA followers in particular - integration means absolute invisibility (no mosques being built, no headscarves on the street, no Arabic being spoken in public), and so some people will never be satisfied until we're culturally absolutely homogeneous (and, as we've seen from the increasing number of attacks on dark-skinned people in Germany, racially homogeneous), which is quite frankly unreasonable.",,False,t3_43ri4u,,-1,t5_2qh13,False,1454404460,0,1458237859,

India does elections better than others, we have the experience, we have the scale(no one is even close on this front, our election for our largest state is equal to what the US Presidential Election is). The issue of scale, cost, security and illiteracy created challenges which led to the use of technology.  
I have yet to come across a system of electronic voting anywhere in the world which is better for majority of the world's population than Indian EVM's.  

A Bank/ATM like touch screen, wireless-cloud linked data system machines *might* work for ultra-tech savvy countries like Japan or some places in US and Europe but by inherent design that these systems use makes them more vulnerable, they are susceptible to more attack vectors. Plus an illiterate(non-tech savvy) person can't use them. And they would be expensive (which is very relevant for places like India and developing countries which are democracies).

It seeks to integrate all of society by promoting tradition instead of seeking to establish an entirely new order. Traditional values (including gender roles) are its cornerstone, at the center is the traditional family unit- the people are encouraged and monetarily rewarded by the state for getting married and having as many kids as they can afford (because they want low immigration and immediate integration so that immigration does not interfere with nationalism). Although property is still mostly kept in private hands, a robust welfare system is put in place and the rich shoulder the majority of the tax burden required to finance it as yet another tool for unification to make common people see the wealthy as vital contributors to the health of the nation, but every single person is expected to work hard- the worker is exalted as the backbone of society. The goal is to turn all of the citizens into a united army of nation builders. Profits made from anything other than work and investment are highly taxed and limited if not outright banned (especially when it comes to speculative activities like property speculation, short-term trading of public shares, and marketing of other products of financial wizardry like derivatives). The government is prohibited from engaging in any form of usury (although private loans are allowed) and the Central Bank is publicly owned. Strong obscenity laws are used to suppress any part of the society which is considered to be degenerate- which means homosexuality, interracial relationships, and counter-culture movements (especially Marxism) are a big no-no.",,False,t1_czkdzb0,,-3,t5_2tk0i,False,1454406311,0,1458238060,

This is based on the assumption that it's a small portion of bad actors. It's not a small portion.

There are even more disturbing figures to be had but lets remember that there is a reason why the worst place on earth to be a woman is in muslim dominated cultures. This comes out of cultural practices that literally cover women up so that they can't show themselves. It's not a small portion of bad actors. Evil is ingrained in Islam and middle eastern practices, just like it was ingrained in European christian practice during the 1500's.

P1:

Russian President Vladimir Putin used to seem invincible. Today, he and his regime look enervated, confused, and desperate. Increasingly, both Russian and Western commentators suggest that Russia may be on the verge of deep instability, possibly even collapse.

This perceptual shift is unsurprising. Last year, Russia was basking in the glow of its annexation of Crimea and aggression in the Donbas. The economy, although stagnant, seemed stable. Putin was running circles around Western policymakers and domestic critics. His popularity was sky-high. Now it is only his popularity that remains; everything else has turned for the worse. Crimea and the Donbas are economic hellholes and huge drains on Russian resources. The war with Ukraine has stalemated. Energy prices are collapsing, and the Russian economy is in recession. Putin’s punitive economic measures against Ukraine, Turkey, and the West have only harmed the Russian economy further. Meanwhile, the country’s intervention in Syria is poised to become a quagmire.   

Things are probably  much worse for Russia than this cursory survey of negative trends suggests. The country is weathering three crises brought about by Putin’s rule—and Russia’s foreign-policy misadventures in Ukraine and Syria are only exacerbating them.

First, the Russian economy is in free fall. That oil and gas prices are unlikely to rise much anytime soon is bad enough. Far worse, Russia’s energy-dependent economy is unreformed, uncompetitive, and un-modernized and will remain so as long as it serves as a wealth-producing machine for Russia’s political elite. Second, Putin’s political system is disintegrating. His brand of authoritarian centralization was supposed to create a strong “power vertical” that would bring order to the administrative apparatus, rid it of corruption, and subordinate regional Russian and non-Russian elites to Moscow’s will. Instead, over-centralization has produced the opposite effect, fragmenting the bureaucracy, encouraging bureaucrats to pursue their own interests, and enabling regional elites to become increasingly insubordinate—with Ramzan Kadyrov, Putin’s strongman in Chechnya, being the prime example. Third, Putin himself, as the linchpin of the Russian system, has clearly passed his prime. Since his catastrophic decision to prevent Ukraine from signing an Association Agreement with the European Union in 2013, he has committed strategic blunder after strategic blunder. His formerly attractive macho image is wearing thin, and his recent attempts to promote his cult of personality by publishing a book of his quotes and a Putin calendar look laughable and desperate.

Russian President Vladimir Putin poses for a selfie with members of the youth military patriotic club ""Vympel"" (The Pennant), November 4, 2015.

The problem for Putin—and for Russia—is that the political–economic system is resistant to change. Such a dysfunctional economy is sustainable only if it is controlled by a self-serving bureaucratic caste that places its own interests above those of the country. In turn, a deeply corrupt authoritarian system needs to have a dictator at its core, one who coordinates and balances elite interests and appetites. Putin’s innovation is to have transformed himself into a cult-like figure whose legitimacy depends on his seemingly boundless youth and vigor. Such leaders, though, eventually become victims of their own personality cult and, like Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Mussolini, do not leave office voluntarily. Russia is thus trapped between the Scylla of systemic decay and the Charybdis of systemic stasis. Under such conditions, Putin will draw increasingly on Russian chauvinism, imperialism, and ethnocentrism for legitimacy.
Since none of this mess will be resolved anytime soon, Russia appears poised to enter a prolonged “time of troubles” that could range from social unrest to regime change to state collapse. It might be foolhardy to predict Russia’s future, but it is clear that the longer Putin stays in power, the worse things will be for the country. Putin, who claimed to be saving Russia, has become its worst enemy. For now, the United States, Europe, and Russia’s neighbors must prepare for the worst.

DRIVERS OF INSTABILITY

Some analysts dismiss the possibility of massive instability in Russia on the grounds that the opposition is weak, its leaders lack charisma, and Putin’s popularity is high. These factors are not as important as they are assumed to be. Most revolutions have come as a result of deep structural crises; few have been made by self-styled revolutionaries. Charismatic leaders emerge in the course of systemic instability as often as they predate it. And country-wide popularity is never as important for a movement or leader as power in the capital city and among key political and economic elites.

Imagine that the three crises noted above continue to deepen, as they in all likelihood will. In that case, nearly every sector of Russian society will get closer to rebellion. As inflation and unemployment rise and living standards fall, dissatisfaction will grow among workers and social unrest will increase. Political and economic elites, too, will grow increasingly unhappy as Russia’s three crises deepen. Their status and wealth will increasingly become vulnerable, and their willingness to countenance alternatives to Putin and his system will grow. Urban intellectuals, students, and professionals will likewise rediscover their voices and provide intellectual guidance to the forces of instability.

With more systemic chaos and elite stasis, patriotically-minded elements within the armed forces (army, militia, and secret police) will search for alternatives to Putin and his ruinous system of rule. And soldiers and mercenaries now fighting in Ukraine and Syria may return home and promote radical views throughout the country. Outside Russia, the Russian Federation’s 21 non-Russian republics will assert their authority.

For 18 years, Putin could defuse discontent by the three means all elites use to stay in power. He bought popular support with the windfalls from rising energy prices. He strengthened the forces of coercion and repressed discontent. And, by projecting manliness and vigor and promising to remake Russia in his own image, he created ideological incentives to support him and his regime. Thanks to his mistakes and the system’s decay, however, Putin no longer has the material resources he once possessed and his image has been greatly tarnished. And thanks to Russia’s transformation into a rogue state incapable of defeating Ukraine and increasingly mired in the Middle East, the vision of renewed Russian greatness is losing its appeal. As a result, Putin now relies almost exclusively on the forces of coercion to stay in power and sustain his regime. He thus depends on their willingness to go along with his rule. And Putin, whose regime recently adopted legislation permitting the secret police to shoot protestors, knows it.

FORCING THE FORCES
Relying on the armed forces could be a dangerous bet. For one, they might be unwilling to employ coercion if they face large numbers of protestors drawn from the general population. This is true for all repressive regimes, which tend to emphasize the elite nature of policing and deploy officers far away from their homes. Given Putin’s popularity and the relatively greater difficulty of organizing mass protests in the Russian provinces, the greatest likelihood of such a scenario playing out is in Moscow, which witnessed mass demonstrations in 2011–12, and in the non-Russian regions such as Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Yakutia, Dagestan, and Ingushetia, where ethnic solidarity could override orders to use coercion. If women and workers participate in such disturbances, coercive forces would be least inclined to follow orders and shoot.

At present, such a revolution looks improbable; but in mid-2004 and mid-2013, no one was predicting the Orange Revolution or the Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine. Such revolutions, as Putin probably realizes, are intrinsically unpredictable, because they are the product of inchoate forces of discontent, dissatisfaction, anger, radicalization, and hope. Even so, given the dysfunctionality of the political–economic system and its incapacity to change, the chances of such disturbances will increase with every year. The protests are likely to be sparked by a sudden, unexpected event that outrages people and propels them into the streets. That shock could be anything, from an embarrassing televised slip-up by Putin to an act of brutality by the police to a tragic fire. No one ever predicts such shocks, but, as systems decay, they become more likely.

Like I said, the US declared war because of British maritime policies. The US was the aggressor militarily, not Britain, especially as by all accounts the reason of 'British maritime policy' was just a transparent pretext to try and take Canada from the British. This was evident as, when the British revoked the Orders in Council that prevented neutral ships trading with Napoleonic Europe, this being the policy that Madison stated in the Declaration of War, Madison didn't turn around and stop the war as expected, but instead changed the reason for declaring war to the imprisonment of American sailors. At this point it was clear Madison had no intention of making peace with the British, and that his objective was to take territory (Madison, like Jefferson, had made no secret of his desire to take all of North America. To quote Jefferson, 'The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, and the final expulsion of England from the American continent'). Lord Liverpool even offered to release these prisoners, but instead Madison chose to believe Napoleon's false promises to exempt US ships from the Continental System that barred the trade of British goods (it was Russia's decision to leave this system that sparked the war in Europe).
    
&amp;nbsp;        

Here it is useful to look at some British perspective. Britain wasn't interested in taking more territory in North America from the US, only in retaining it's current assets and economic position. The War of 1812 was more of a skirmish to Britain than a war, when you consider that 20,000 people died on each side in the American theatre compared to 3.5 MILLION in Europe. Nevertheless when the US attacks on Canada were repelled, Britain moved into the US in order to strengthen it's position at the peace negotiation table in 1814. Britain was pretty keen to find peace in order to focus on Napoleon (who they defeated a year later), and ultimately the only real losers in these negotiations were the Native Americans, as the British tried to secure them a 'buffer state' for fighting on the British side. In terms of meeting their original objectives, however, the Americans failed, although ultimately it still turned out quite well for the US which was roused by some late victories in battle. Britain was allowed to maintain a focus purely on Europe, with Lord Liverpool believing there would be little to gain from carrying on the war in North America.

No, they didn't. That's my whole point. I know the problems. I've thought about them a lot. I'm an ethnic minority so these issues are on my mind a lot (I hope you're not European American because if you are, you can't possibly understand where I'm coming from, and I win all arguments... according to the SJW rulebook, allegedly).

But see, no one here is ""acting like history began with Columbus only"". No one here is trying to justify genocide. All the problems you monologued about, I implicitly assume people in this subreddit don't have. In fact, I implicitly assume most people here have thought about them in a rational and informed way. Most of what's going on in this subreddit are not funny *unless* you can give people that benefit of the doubt.

So it is my assumption that in this subreddit, we know that we can discover advanced civilizations, as much as we can discover hunter-gatherers, and as much as we can perhaps discover other sentient lifeforms in our universe with technological achievements far greater than our own.

Now, if you're going to insist on governing other people's language, you have to show that there is a benefit to justify the aggression. But like you said, the change in the rhetoric *represents* a shift. The change in rhetoric didn't cause the shift. Americans learned more about their history, and that made them stop saying ""discover"" the way they used to. It's not the other way around. Will people who think Native Americans were all killed know otherwise just because you tell them not to use the word ""discover""? Will people who know the many splendid civilizations of the Native Americans, just because they're not allowed to say ""discover""? Somehow I doubt it, and you haven't presented a case for it.

Personally, I don't say ""discover"" because I don't view history from a European perspective, and because maybe, just maybe it might help change people's views in some small way. But I won't go around aggro-ing everyone who uses that word. I will point out if they make incorrect factual statements, but otherwise, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. The whole point of equality is supposed to help us get along. I'm not going to create aggression in its name unless I'm certain the outcome justifies it.",,1454412141,t1_czkpc40,,0,t5_2wo26,False,1454411811,0,1458238706,5 more beakers to Writing

If you really think SKT look like a middle of the pack lcs team there something really wrong with you.They don't have to fix their problems in a week,they have a month before Iem and even more time before playoffs.

NA lcs : Rigth now NA is worst than last split mainly because half of the teams have visa issues and the other are news.I won't talk about TIP and Echo Fox because they don't even play with their main line up but here is my 2 cents on the other teams :

-c9 : a fucking mess,they can't play without Hai and Hai can't land a skill shot.Rush is having as much trouble as Spirit,Ball is not good anymore.They are just not good rigth now.

-Dig : Bad team with barely lcs level players.

-Ren : Freeze and Friends,poor guy must feel alone.The veterans Crumbz and Alex will need to step up really hard for this team to even make playoff.Maybe things will get better if they find a suitable support.

-TSM : TSM is just average.They have a good line up but they don't play that well.Yellowstar seems unable to find his way into the team.The bright side is the synergie between Hauntzer et Sven but that's the only thing they got going for them.

_TL : Quite good,will need time to develop but they should make playoff.I still think Fenix need to step up or just get benched because he seemed to perform only on very few champion,Azir last split,Lux this split.

Clg : Good team,probably a bit weaker than last split but they get the work done.

Nrg : Probably the second best in NA,solid players even if Altec is inconsistent as fuck.Their main issue will come from playing comp they are not good enough to play.

Imt : Best team in NA,they play well and manage to make full use of their roster for now.I'm not sure they will win this split,but they are sure to have a top 4 finish.

Na is weak overall,they have 3 good teams with Imt/Nrg/Clg,1 rising team with TL and TSM that will probably be good when playoff come around.

Eu lcs : I won't talk about El/Giant/Spyce and Roccat because they are the same as dig/tip/reng and echo fox,low level teams.

Uol : Decent team, that should make playoff but i don't see them winning a bo5 against any of the top team.

OG : Big mess.People will jump on the PoE hate train but Amazing and Soaz are so awfull it's hilarious.Sven and Mithy have to carry every game.They found succes with PoE on Lulu but they won't be able to do that every time.Like TSM they will probably step up before playoffs.

Fnatic : Spirit is almost as bad as Amazing for now it hurt to watch.The team doesn't seems to have clear shotcalling,Gamsu tp are bad,the draft is not great either,Rekkles is cleary not the same without yellowstar.They can make playoff and considering their history it would not even be a surprise for me if they win the split but they are not the favorite.

Vtiality : I don't know what to think of this team so fuck it.

G2/H2k : the clear 2 best team in Eu rigth now,even with Ryu absence.G2 is still unpolished as a team and the lack of experience could play against them during playoff.H2k with Ryu would be one of the favorite to win the split.

Ah si? Giusto per completezza: salotto ora no, io sono a lavoro, seduto su una sedia comoda, anche se senza braccioli. Tu da dove scrivi? Non siamo in guerra, non vige la legge marziale. Purtroppo per te vige ancora la cara vecchia costituzione.
Guardiamoci in faccia: SIAMO -metaforicamente- in salotto. Chi se la sta vedendo brutta non siamo ancora noi, nonostante tante forze politiche vogliano far passare quel messaggio.

&gt; Caso concreto: Se tu riesci a rispettare uno saudita che sostiene le decisioni del suo governo, complimenti per la faccia tosta. Io a uno che ritiene giusto tagliare la mano a un bambino se ruba una mela, non ci riesco.

Si, il rispetto della vita umana lo ho per tutti. Mi stai dicendo che il ritenere giusto tagliare la mano a un bambino, da parte di un individuo, legittima l'aggressione da parte tua?

&gt; Io ero dalla tua parte della discussione fino a qualche anno fa, nel liceo :) poi ho cominciato a interessarmi sul serio di rapporti internazionali, economia e geopolitica. Oltre che di tanta, tanta, tanta filosofia.

Buon per te! 

Intanto mi chiedo che cosa mi vuoi comunicare con questo: vuoi legittimare la tua opinione? sminuire la mia come infantile e ingenua?

Ed infine, ti vorrei ricordare che i valori per i quali dici di combattere nascono e pertengono ad altre discipline che sono, sfortunatamente, ortogonali a geopolitica, economia e rapporti internazionali. 

Mi sembra che tu abbia le idee un po' confuse. Bene il leggere ed interessarsi, ma forse occorre un po' di riflessione per organizzarle, tutte queste nozioni.

clownpuncher24,1,reddevils,czkw45m,0,t3_43tmig,"He had a horrible season this year and I certainly don't think his behaviour in the whole Eva Carneiro thing helped, but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt - after all, it's not the first time that toxic Chelsea dressing room has gotten a manager sacked. He did win the league at a canter the year before.

I think he also gets a bad rap in terms of playing style. He is a ruthless pragmatist at his core. This portrayal of his teams always 'parking the bus' has mostly come from the big European ties against Barcelona when he was managing Chelsea/Inter. Playing with a defensive mindset against a team containing Messi, Iniesta, Xavi etc seems like a pretty wise move to me. It also lead to a win over the two legs with a vastly inferior Inter team and a narrow loss with Chelsea after a last minute Iniesta screamer. Of course, he has played defensive/counter attacking football in other big games too but I can't really think of other instances where his team have full-on parked the bus. Defensive solidity in big games where you want to avoid losing at all costs is a sensible attitude to have. Sure, it would be nice if we could go into games and pass circles around the other big teams and score for fun but in reality, that's not going to happen. If you want to see what happens when you approach the big games in the same way you would Norwich at home, take a look at Arsenal. They've had an abysmal record against the big teams up until very recently, and have only improved due to Wenger finally changing things up and playing a more counter attacking style.

Finally, I think it's difficult to judge Mourinho in terms of longevity as he's rarely stayed longer than 3 years at any club. His first Chelsea sacking was seen by most as premature and used as further evidence of Abramovich being a mental owner. At Real, he had major dressing room problems and issues with the club hierarchy, and despite all that lasted longer than any of the other managers they've had for the past decade and managed to dethrone Barca as the dominant force in Spanish football while Pep was still at the helm (plus they played some fucking spectacular football). I'm really not sure what went wrong this year at Chelsea but I think it's way too simplistic to put their failings this season solely down to Mourinho. 

Basically, Mourinho is a proven winner who wants the job and knows the league. I don't think he'd see it as a short term job either - he's managed a number of major European teams and there aren't many places he can still go should he decide to bail after 3 years like a lot of people on here suspect he will. He's great in the transfer market, knows how to beat Pep's teams, and will be thirsty to prove himself after the disaster with Chelsea this year. I've wanted him in since Fergie retired and I think he'd be absolutely fantastic for us.  ",10,False,t1_czkv6hs,,1,t5_2rxse,False,1454414145,0,1458238983,Van Nistelrooy

http://www.redditsecrets.com/how-to-use-reddit-tutorial

O Reddit é meio confuso no começo mesmo, principalmente pela interface. Mas o basico pra entender é que você vai se inscrevendo em subs (como /r/brasil, /r/aviation, /r/cityporn, etc...) que te interessam e aos poucos a sua front-page se torna um agregado de tudo o que te interessa, uma vez que os subs normalmente tem um tema específico, destinando a determinado ""nicho"". As pessoas votam pra cima ou pra baixo nos posts e comentarios e isso faz com que o post/comentário ganhem ""relevância"", aparecendo mais no topo dos topicos populares.

goatl,5,KotakuInAction,czkwyvu,0,t3_43tjpr,"&gt; Statistics are not evidence, if they were then hard science's wouldn't rely on repeated experimentation to verify the statistics in the first place. Statistics are just that, stats used as an abstract or intrinsic frame of reference to find the evidence that supports it. And no, I'm not trying to dismiss the greater issues at hand, such as the question of what about Islamic culture is incapable with the west, what dangers do a radicalized Islam propose against the non-Islamic world and what exactly can we do about the issue at hand? Those are great questions and things I would love to see discussed. The problem is that when it comes down to it, nobody is willing to even have those discussions and would sooner throw out epithets and categorize people for ease of dismissal. And the use of statistics to do just this is a part of the problem.

I disagree, statistics I feel offer real clarity on a matter, and help gain some perspective on just how significant or insignificant an issue really is. Furthermore, when asking for evidence it's really the only kind that matters. Otherwise you're left with worthless anecdotes. 

&gt;Shariah Law may have a basic meaning, but the thing is though is that when it comes to how one defines and applies Shariah and in what area of life has been a debate that goes on since the very death of their prophet, who I might add, didn't really say anything about the topic at hand but gave then a general and very vague guide on how to go about it. Why is that? Because he died before even able to finish it and the resulting canonization of the Quran and the Hadiths ultimately involved in a book burning scene very similar in nature to the Christian destruction of the Library of Alexandria, in order to maintain a fairly specific clerical interpretation of his work. It's the reason why some Muslims agree with the Surahs while other's don't and its why searching for Shariah Law in the Quran is usually abandoned for finding it in the Hadiths, which are largely forgeries for the most part. You see, its that kind of understanding that will in fact result in a more robust, nuanced and perfectly reasonable discussion regarding Shariah Law, but most people would rather rail against Muslims using statistics to browbeat people as opposed to say, being reasonable.

You're really not addressing my argument here. Also, you are trying to do as so many do and make it as if this is about railing against ALL Muslims. It's not. As I'm sure many have told you before, this is about ideas more than anything, and those that subscribe to them. However big the number. The concept of Sharia law is one that by any way you try to nuance its meaning is one incompatible with the concept of a secular, western democracy. 

&gt;And what narrative am I trying to craft, other than pointing out that using statistics without a greater breakdown of their meaning to get to the people behind the stats in the first place, results in nothing more than ideological mudslinging where everyone is more interested in talking past each other instead of to each other?

Isn't dismissing relevant evidence when it's demanding only doing that? When you are demanding evidence be provided as to why a person is arguing this or that, and then either preemptively try to downplay its relevance or do so when it is gathered. How do you expect people to react? That's not being entirely reasonable to me. 

&gt;Yes, I've seen those statistics, and just the like what I've said before, they're fucking useless without a greater breakdown of the reasons why and a cultural analysis as to the meaning of said statistics. Some of them are not very reputable, such as the one regarding Eastern European Muslims and their stances on various things coming to around 75%-85% when the reality is that some of the numbers they polled, either exceed the Islamic population that's in the country or gives a severely low polling for the Islamic population in that country. Does that mean that all of them are like this? No, but without a proper breakdown of the stats, they're essentially useless.

NateChampion,3,distributism,czkxecn,0,t3_43hejp,"FWIW, the government already gives out loans for the purpose of starting small businesses. The Small Business Administration has long backed loans for that purpose. These are, essentially, ""subsidized"" loans.

As an entity, the SBA dates to 1953, so it surprisingly comes after the Great Depression.  I haven't researched it, but my suspicion is that it has its roots in the Depression however, or perhaps in World War Two, given the nature of the entity.  

The SBA  isn't alone in this, however, as the Department of Agriculture likewise gives out some similar, if ineffective in my view, loans.  Many states likewise do, and indeed mine does although the program is always subject to limited funding.

Are those programs Distributist?  I haven't thought of it, but they likely could be regarded that way.

Usury is the charging of interest at a predatory rate, so these loans are clearly not usury.  Lakey91 is correct that usury is contrary to the Distributist model.  It might be pointed out that its' certainly against Christian ethics and its also contrary to ethics held by Jews and Muslims, at least.  It would also be contrary to Socialist principals (which actually borrow nearly all their ethics at the foundation level, if not the application level, from Christianity), but in a different fashion as true Socialism holds that the government owns everything in the name of the people (any other economic theory calling itself Socialism that doesn't espouse that isn't actually Socialism, but some species of capitalism, which is why there are actually very few post 1990 Socialist anywhere).  In other words, if there's a bank at all, it's not Socialism.

Merely charging interest isn't usury.  Indeed, given the time value of money and the fact that some level of inflation exists in every economy save in times of economic depression, charging interest at some rate is actually necessary simply to recover the value of the loaned money. No interest is actually a type of gift, as the money paid back would be less than that paid out.  At current rates in the US and Europe, that's almost the case now as rates are so low.",,False,t1_czj0v71,,3,t5_2u8gs,False,1454418293,0,1458239588,

&gt; The issues in Europe are mostly a result of flawed policy and geography. To suggest that they weren't avoidable because the citizenry loves their fundamental rights too much is crazy talk.

No, it will break down, because the government ignored or misjudged heavily, how many refugees are bearable by the system.

Different than what you perceived, I value the basic rights actually very much. But I believe they are only usefull, if the system it creates is stable in itself. If these rights lead to the destruction of the system under certain conditions, the rights either can't be absolute or the system must have protection to avoid the conditions that break the system.

&gt; The minister’s intervention comes after local authorities across Germany warned they could not afford the cost of paying benefits to EU migrants under the existing rules.

ggthxnore,28,KotakuInAction,czkxybn,0,t3_43tjpr,"&gt;Do you really think most everyday people like living in, say, a radicalized Islamic state?

I mean... tons and tons of true believers keep leaving comfortable first world democracies to head off to Iraq and Syria and join ISIS. That's a conscious choice that people who have experienced Western freedom, often for all their lives, are making. Maybe if they survive and make it back they'll realize they were super dumb to romanticize the Caliphate and they don't actually want to live like that at all, or maybe they'll really enjoy killing a bunch of people and taking a harem of Yazidi sex slaves. But whether they chose it out of ignorance or with their eyes wide open, they still chose it freely.

But of course not everything's about ISIS, and while there are a lot of people heading over to joining them those people are still very much the minority. So instead let's look at those polls. Now this whole Islam thing was never really my fight so I haven't looked into the sources or anything and maybe it's all bullshit, but I recall polls showing that *massive*, **massive** #s of Muslims are in favor of Sharia law, stoning adulterers and homosexuals and apostates, and other unacceptably barbaric things.

Basically what I'm getting at is I'm not afraid of Muslims as individuals, but I *am* afraid of Islam as an ideology. I don't see an Arab guy on the street and think oh no he might be a suicide bomber, but I do cringe at unchecked mass migration into Europe knowing how backwards and regressive so many of these people are. Imagine living in some podunk little European town that suddenly takes in a few thousand ""refugees"" and getting told you better start dressing your womenfolk more properly so as to not provoke your new neighbors. How about fuck you. I don't want to import a bunch of people who don't believe in the liberal values that are fundamental to our society. Respecting cultural differences is taking off your shoes when you enter your Asian friend's house, being told to cover up if you don't want to get raped or don't draw cartoons if you don't want to get killed is something else entirely.

I actually used to be pretty pro-Muslim in the past, solely because I saw them as the underdog. Like all these crazy religious right assholes going after them as an easy target when they're not any better, you know? I wanted to defend Muslims and go after Christians just because I saw them getting kicked around as the easy target that everyone shit on when their most vocal opponents are *just* as backwards and it's basically just a stupid sports rivalry between crosstown invisible sky daddies. But there isn't really a Christian equivalent of ISIS, is there? You can't really pretend like religions are all equally terrible when no one is being burned alive in the name of Shintoism. Anti-abortion terrorism is certainly terrible, but it's also considerably rarer and less frequent than Islamic terrorism. Plus whenever it does happen everyone is eager to blame it all on right-wing pundits and politicians and Christianity, but you're not allowed to say anything about the motivations behind Islamic terrorism unless it's to blame the West? That's the kind of hypocrisy I focus on these days.

So anyway. Still not right-wing. Still just a liberal who cares deeply about liberal values and fighting regressive ideologies whether it's modern feminism wanting to get people fired for cartoons they don't like or Islamists setting people on fire for cartoons they don't like. Not anti-immigration but very leery of mass migration. Very tired of being lumped in with far-right crazies but that won't stop me from defending those silly extremists if I see them being unfairly maligned. I would also really like Israel to stop being such fucking dicks so I guess I hate Jews even more than Muslims since I'm pro-Palestinian.

Actually, he said that it wasn't a threat, but a statement of the situation. 

Had Ireland burned senior bondholders at the time, the market panic would have engulfed the entire eurozone banking system, and a bomb would indeed have gone off in the IFSC, as Trichet pointed out. And the ECB would have had no choice but to withdraw the majority of its ELA funding from Ireland, because it would have been needed everywhere else - Ireland would no longer be able to use 25% of the ECB's ELA capacity.

redroguetech,1,atheism,czkya6b,0,t3_43po3l,"&gt; I was pointing out that you personally don't mind native American sites, some in extremely remote areas literally carved into cliff faces, getting protection, while you do mind it if churches with artistic and historical value get little to nothing.

Not true. Native American sites within populated areas should also get more resources than remote sites. Now, in the U.S., sites are often built specifically in remote areas. The Statue of Liberty is placed on the otherwise deserted Liberty Island. Mount Rushmore is placed in the remote Black Hills. Doing that is stupid.

I did not say that no resources should be provided for remote sites, rather that proportionately less - all else being equal - should be provided. 

&gt;If the Mormon Tabernacle were to fall into disrepair after it came out that their current President, Thomas Monson, who speaks directly to God, personally raped every single Mormon child in the entire world, I would still want to restore that building because it is amazing.

The Mormon Tabernacle should be provided greater resources than any other equivalent site, since it is in the middle of a major city. Therefore, it is both cheaper to maintain than a more remote site, and can be viewed by more people.

&gt;Even though we know many of the native tribes did awful things to each other before our arrival

Compared to European standards, there is little evidence this was ever true, let alone on any large scale.

&gt; some of them did awful things to us after we arrived (not without some justification, of course),

""Not without justification..."" Then why say it?! The United States (and to a lesser extent, England) waged total genocidal warfare for three centuries, completely annihilating many entire cultures and driving many nations to literal extinction, yet it's like there's some obligation for people to say ""Well, natives killed some people sometimes too."" In the U.S., we whites reserve what's called the ""Castle Doctrine"" as a white privilege.

&gt;we don't bat an eye at protecting their sites now.

Did you not read my link?? Not only did the U.S. build a monument to 4 leaders who participated in that genocide (two of them literally personally participating), but we built it on sacred land guaranteed by international treaty to the Sioux Nation. This wasn't in some distant past, but in the 1930's. The Sioux Nation has sued for their land to be returned to them. The government agreed it's their land. Needless to say, it's still a ""national monument"", not Siuox. Although somewhat unusual in its status, its not unusual in its attitude.

The city I live in has a mound site (an indigenous ""church""). The descendants of those who built the site number just a bare handful even now some 250 years after they were removed three states away. The site is ""maintained"" (in that the grass is mowed), but has not been returned to them. It's been made into a park, with a standard-issue public bathroom, some pick-nick tables and those ugly cast-iron BBQ stands. They also have on display a hammer, most likely made in China, as a comparison to a rock. My point (hopefully obvious) is that the disrespect goes deep. It is a reminder of the past, by how it's being treated now. Owned by the government. Not returned to the rightful owners. Used for people to walk their dogs and play frisbee. The few educational resources nothing more than pathetic insults. No restoration.

&gt;They should be protected as reminders of a rich past, not because that past was particularly good, but because they are objectively beautiful.

I disagree that beauty is the only standard, but I don't disagree about churches. Rather any church in a populated area, all else equal, should be provided more resources.",no-knight,1454426289,t1_czk8ck5,,1,t5_2qh2p,False,1454420550,0,1458240005,Strong Atheist

This is also the point about Spanish speakers in the USA.

I don't care if that makes me a bad person in your eyes and I am confident that my opinions are shared by a great many people. This will be reflected should Angela Merkel seek re-election.

pepperboon,1,europe,czkyimf,0,t3_43pd41,"&gt; Roma aren't precisely a novelty in Sweden

But their number used to be *a lot* less than in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia. After some quick and dirty googling, I found a Hungarian book from 1998 about Roma in Nordic countries on Google books, and it says there were 12-15 thousand Roma in Sweden at that point by the estimate of the ""Nordic (or Scandinavian?) Gypsy Council"" (not sure about their English name). Do you have a better sourced estimate? How about before the fall of communism?

The problems are just radically different when you have so much different numbers. Rule-of-thumb estimates say that in a school you can successfully integrate Roma if they are no more than 10% of the children. So about 2 or 3 per class. Above that things become extremely tense, non-Roma parents will ""rescue"" their kids from such a school and rather have them spend an extra hour commuting to a better school, teachers start fleeing and you're left with a disaster. If their numbers rise above 20%, people won't just commute, they move out altogether. And then you're left with Gypsy neighborhoods and villages.

Then Western European TV crews can come and lecture about the segregation and racism inherent in Hungarian/Romanian/Slovak etc. culture and how we need to learn the proper civilized Western values like those in Sweden and the Netherlands. Fortunately these crews can now get their stories right there in Western Europe as well.

Just some more numbers. Out of children born in 2002 (today 14-year-olds) approximately 16% were Roma in Hungary, and this is averaged over the whole country ([source in Hungarian, estimate by Central Statistics Office](http://www.demografia.hu/kiadvanyokonline/index.php/demografia/article/download/615/427)). So there are lots of places where they are well above 30%-40%. For example in North Eastern Hugary ([another Hungarian source](http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20150420_roma_diak_arany_magyarorszagon_papp_z_attila_interju)).

newshelp,8,europe,czkyury,0,t3_43tpwf,"I'm not that proficient in the history of East Germany/Romania/Hungary, so I can't comment on what was the key difference. However, I can comment on the people involved with the coup in Bulgaria:

The Bulgarian Communist Party had a very long history by the time WW2 ended. It was founded in 1903, but its roots can be traced as far back as 1894 when Marxists and Social Democrats were in the same party. After the ideological split, the Marxists (the BCP) were a founding member of the [Communist International (Comintern)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International) with Georgi Dimitrov being a General Secretary between 1935-1943.

The BCP also had a history of armed assaults: The [1925 St Nedelya Church assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Nedelya_Church_assault) held the record for the deadliest terrorist act worldwide [until 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battles_and_other_violent_events_by_death_toll#Terrorist_attacks). This attack was a response to the ban of the BCP following the [1923 September Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Uprising) which was organized by the BCP under Comintern pressue. So there was a lot of peer-pressure involved.

Later, the BCP organised the [1933 Reichstag Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire), again under Comintern pressure. By this time Georgi Dimitrov was head of Comintern operations for Western Europe and a member of the Central Committee of the BCP.

Now, it is important to understand why exactly Bulgaria joined the Axis when it did. Basically, there were threats of an occupation from both the Axis and the Allies, both of which needed the land. However, Bulgaria could not have possibly joined on the side of Greece or Yugoslavia, since both countries have gained Bulgarian territories after WW1. At the time, the reunification of Bulgaria was a major issue and it would have been a political suicide to support Greece/Yugoslavia. So, Germany use a carrot and a stick approach to the issue: if Bulgaria doesn't join the Axis - Germany will attack Bulgaria, even if Bulgaria remains neutral. However, should Bulgaria join the Axis, Germany will not expect Bulgaria to participate in any invasions and Germany will support Bulgaria's territorial claims should the Axis win the war. The Allies were already supporting Greece, so they were out of carrots.

On the other hand, the Comintern supported a ""Communist Balkan Federation"" of sorts, which the Bulgarian Army was very much against, having recently fought a lot of wars with the neighbouring countries. [A plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bled_agreement_%281947%29) was devised to eradicate the opposition of this idea. The gist of the plan was that Bulgarian nationalism should be crushed by splitting Bulgaria in two or three parts (Macedonia and Moesia Inferior+Thrace) and supporting nationalistic ideas in each of these parts. As a result of that, the Macedonian language was codified and the BCP ordered people in the then [Gorna Dzhumaya area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blagoevgrad_Province) to stop calling themselves ""Bulgarian"" and to use ""Macedonian"" instead.

If this was all to succeed, the old military had to be removed entirely, either via executions or suicide missions. An example of that would be when paratroopers were forced to drop in front of German positions in the middle of the day. Most of them were killed before landing.

The whole plan flopped after the Tito-Stalin split in 1948. By that time the old military was replaced with a new one and Macedonian nationalism was becoming a thing. However, the ""Balkan Federation"" never happened as it was envisioned.",,1454431530,t1_czkx9kj,,8,t5_2qh4j,False,1454421852,0,1458240274,

I'd suggest turning off the ""Lucky Nations"" bonuses in the options if you are finding it difficult to play Europe.

France is usually among the 3 strongest nations in Europe at the start.

I don't understand what country your friend is playing. Is it Galicia, the releasable country north of Portugal? If that's it, you should both try to get France as an ally before you go conquering. In fact you can just forget about conquering and simply go colonize stuff. If not, and this is a country adjacent to France, then you need to get an alliance with Austria as fast as possible.

Generally you'll need to form alliances with the rivals of your enemies. France's rivals are usually Aragon, Castille, Austria, Burgundy and England. England is a horrible ally. Austria and Burgundy are the best allies you can get. Aragon is a punching bag for France, so don't rely only on them. Plus the Iberian Wedding event will fire at some point and you'll lose Aragon as an ally immediately (but probably gain Castille if you work on them before hand). You can also try to ally France from the start and increase their trust of you. That way they are a lot less likely to want to attack you.

Economically, as Portugal, you certainly depend a lot on trade, so it's good to get trade ships to patrol trade in your home trade node. Try to get trade companies set up in Africa, by colonizing provinces with important centres of trade and estuaries, and by getting protectorates and force them to give you their land that has important centers of trade.

During peace time you could mothball your forts and lower your army's maintenance to increase your income. You also don't need advisors at the start of the game. Only get level 1 advisors once you start making between 6-10 ducats per month (so you still have a healthy income). Maybe you can get one advisor early if you really need his bonus or his +1 monarch points.

I assume your friend's playing Galicia though, which I'll say is a mistake. First, if and when you conquer Iberia, you will be getting resources that should be controlled by one player, particularly since you'll end up a natural rival for France. Secondly, a one-province minor is a very bad idea for a player who doesn't know the game. I assume you are both from that area and that's why you pick it. I'll suggest two things:

a) One picks Portugal, the other picks England

b) You both pick Portugal (you can both control the same country together)",,1454424442,t3_43u01c,,2,t5_2uqat,False,1454423690,0,1458240699,Commandant

The media does have a part in influencing the debate but they pander to their readers more than they influence them. If the Daily Mail became pro-EU would their readers change opinion or leave them for another paper? People gravitate towards the sources that work with their existing biases and that's just as true of us on the Internet as it is of the people reading newspapers. 

It's become received wisdom to blame the press for the failure of marginal politics in this country. It's much easier, albeit deeply insulting, to assume the 'public' are stupid and easily influenced by the papers they read rather than people with their own opinions that just happen to disagree with whichever politics we're talking about. 

It's the same rationalisation again and again. Corbyn would be popular if not for the press. It completely absolves his politics of any blame. [Is he so out of touch? No, it's the voters who are wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMqZ2PPOLik).

This is a fucking brilliant idea. Show Muslims this literature before they come here and explain to them that homosexuality is normal in Europe and inform them that we will be teaching their children that it is 100% normal accompanied by video footage of men kissing, especially arab men.

condorNH,1,IAmA,czl044z,0,t3_3tbaid,"Hi Marty and Rick
Now that the TV season is nearly over, I wanted to pass some thoughts to you all.. My background was in Operations and Non Destructive Testing Failure and Root Cause in the high pressure natural gas pipeline and compression industry, so I’m here to help.
1.	Ancient mariners knew, whether coming from Europe or Latin and South America, that as they tried to correlate their compasses to what they knew was fixed (North or South Star), that the compass failed them in the long run. I wondered if you have taken the time to analyze all the alignments of rock to rock or triangle stones to money pit, scenarios, based on the North Star ? Clearly these ancients were wise to nature, and skills learned over centuries, which leads me to believe that unless each scenario isn’t analyze with compass of today and compass of yesteryear and North Star, the case isn’t closed.
2.	Next is the Mercy Stone of the Kabbalah Tree of Life that is submerged in the swamp. I believe it is there, but it was placed there, not realizing that the sea level would rise over centuries and soften the soil and eventually would sink the rock. Earthquakes do happen up through the region and a few soil liquefaction events and that rock goes down. As the rocks that form the Kabbalah Tree of Life, are not very large, the penetrating radar most likely will not distinguish the Mercy Stone from the rest of the rubble it may be laying in or atop, like finding non-perpendicular laminations are difficult to discern. Since winter is coming, now is the time to get on the frozen swamp and start doing a contour profile with rebar. The method is identical to the novel pin board of decades ago that one could push their face into and the thousands of pins would slide to duplicate the image, also like a single line molding contour tool used in wood working. I would start with as accurate a laser survey from rock to rock to discern the accuracy of the other rock distances. From that margin of error analysis, ascertain the possible rock position and start by drilling the ice using a pipe and flange guide so all holes are perpendicular to the ice surface. Drop a rebar in and tap until solid. Determine a good length to stay above the ice. Start a circular pattern, 3 inches apart, going with rebar all of the same length until the under water profile is then revealed. There will be the rock in there somewhere, indicated by the hump.
3.	Penta drilling is my last suggestion today. When encountering a known item of note, like when core drilling into the side of the wooden vault, a penta pattern needs implemented next. A penta pattern is basically a pentagon of drillings around the drilling. If the drilling had hit near or on  the corner of the vault, than one used a box drilling pattern, they easily could miss the vault entirely just by being shifted slightly toward the outside of the vault, as anyone knows from laying pipeline, that steel has a bunch of flex over distance. So might want to go back and re-drill a few extra holes before closing the case on those sites.
4.	Terrain and ecology – Back 400 years ago or whenever, the island could have been barren from a fall lightning strike, allowing better line of sight for digging and placement of markers, allowing less stringent measuring techniques, therefore increasing the margin of error.
5.	Measurement – Although there seems to be constant conversation in feet, the foot was an old Roman Empire measurement which was roughly 12.8 of today’s inches, or the length of the designated foot official. Since Metrics for much of Europe did not come about until the Medieval Times and since the American foot was not really formalized until the late 1800s, how could the boys that excavated the Money Pit, find wood at so many even 10s of feet ? Neither they or the original construction crew would have been educated or used American SI measurements.
6.	Construction and ciphers – considering what was worth hiding was of high value, it would have taken much time to hide, so likely a pirate would not have, as being on land for so long would have driven them nuts. So whomever commissioned the hiding had very intelligent support for all this. Architects, engineers, mathematicians (people of the caliber of Leonardo daVinci would have been involved), so to send a bunch of sailors to a very unknown place and perform a crucial task, would have been accomplished through using an amazing simple technique, but yet clever enough to diverge from the true path and frustrate until the plunderers quit, yet it was right there.
7.	So when an old tale says 15 feet, it could have been 15 meters. When it says North, use all 3 Norths, as the translations lost their truth as they were handed down.
8.	PS: Tell Rick to stay off those boards over 10-X. A few years back boards were commonly used at grain mixing silos and it was common practice to walk out to check things. Well the local guy walked out, and snap, fell into the grain being turned in the silo. By the time they could hit the switch he was under the grain whirlpool and drowned in the dry grain. Gravity’s only goal is to suck down everything and anything, regardless.
9.	By the way, a typical continuous run submersible well pump will easily handle 200-300 feet of head. Drop that down into 10-X and also pump water down to really stir the cavern. That will clear the water in a day or two.
10.	Best of Luck

Awilen,3,bladeandsoul,czl0qk0,0,t3_43rly1,"Let's be real :

* hardware is basically computers, be it in Korea or in EU. Beefy Xeon processors (or equivalent) with a metric ton of RAM and whatnot. They are the same tech as your own computer, with far more CPU cores with lower frequency, and very high internet access speed.
* software is a ""piece"" of code that runs the game actions- and data-wise. It isn't rewritten from scratch, there's no point.

Tuning has already been done and redone on Korean servers, and fine-tuning isn't a matter of 5h downtimes. No excuse here.

---

Now I don't think it's a matter of server tuning as much as it's a matter of ""data backup"".

It's an important process that enables data recovery due to failures or exploits that lead to undesired data modifications (like adding money to an account.) In the latter case, fix the bug that allowed the exploit, wipe the database, and copy the latest non-corrupted backup.

Do you know what they backup data to ? Magnetic tape cartridges. While the hardware to read/write them is expensive, magnetic tapes themselves are inexpensive, have very high data density (Sony recently developed a [185TB tape cartridge](http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/30/sony-185tb-data-tape/)), and are very long-lasting. But slow. So painfully slooooooow...

I guess *that* is what takes 5h do to once a week. Because data integrity must be preserved, they shut it all down so players don't modify them.

---

&gt; So how can they avoid 5h downtimes due to data backup ?

Three solutions off the top of my head :

* they don't and continue as they are doing now
* they do it during the night
* they rent more servers that copy the databases every actions (aka ""replication"") and once a week, freeze the replicated db and let it run the backup system; unfreeze and apply modifications that happened during the 5h freeze

One is inexpensive, the second is common sense, the last is downright crazy expensive. I think the second would net money from players more willing to spend more thanks to a reliable experience. Plus it's EU servers, they are in EU, right ? While I think they won't change how they do it completely (like adopting the third solution), can't they do backups during the night ?",jin-f-assassin,1454429457,t1_czkxs0g,,3,t5_2skd6,False,1454425496,0,1458241161,Over here !

The Russian Military is already behind the UK and French militaries by a long way in quality. They spend only $9bn more than the UK on military and their economy doesn't have anywhere near the same depth to increase this as the UK does.

The Chinese military is a better example. Though if you combine the militaries of the UK and France, it's something closer to an even fight. In any case the UK and France both have better power projection capabilities than China at the moment. The UK could defeat a Chinese invasion of Europe on it's own and China could defeat an invasion of Far East Asia by the UK + France.

&gt;That said I am fairly certain that if necessary germany could build a very strong military in very short time.

Germany spends $43bn on Military and has lots of economic depth so yes they very likely could. In a race though they are very far behind and there are questions about the quality of their current forces that would need to be asked.

100,000? That is not enough.

2. We don't have a second world country next door? Don't forget Europe has open borders within the EU. There are many second world countries on EU borders. Also we don't build fences in Germany (not anymore...).

3. Germany has no quota. What difference would a quota make anyway? Do you think refugees will just turn around and walk back in the middle of winter, just because a country has a quota? No. They are coming. And we either help them or let the freeze to death in some forest. It is a choice to make. And I know on which side of history I want to be.

4. You are mixing up refugees and immigrants. Don't do that.

5. Yes, there are groups in Germany (just like any other country) that oppose helping humans in need. But they are a minority. noone I know personally is against us helping them. We are not perfect in handling the crisis. But we are heading in the right direction.

6. Yes the western world cooperated well in bringing chaos to the rest of the world. The only thing we can do is trying to become a part of the solution and not stay a part of the problem.

En revanche, il s'agissait de boulot de relation client stressant et mal payé, l'expérience montre que dans la durée on y trouve (même dans ma boîte) une majorité de femmes et un paquet de personnes d'origine étrangère (c'est moins vrai en province).

Imsolost123456789,2,relationships,czl2z0j,0,t3_43ur5i,"&gt;Sometimes i ask myself if she's a serious girl because we had sex in our second date together.

So, you aren't a serious guy because you had sex on the second date? Or does it not work that way in your brain? Because if that makes her not a serious person...it also makes you not a serious person. And how in the world does sex on the second date equal anyone not being serious? Serious about what? You went right along with it...so.... 

&gt;I think i have reasons feel jealousy, since she's my girlfriend

Uhm. Some jealousy is normal, but ""I have a right to feel this because you are mine"" is not, at all, normal. It's possessive. 

&gt; but she had sex with my cousin years ago before she met me.

.....so? Obviously, this didn't bother you, because you dated her. I don't see the relevance. 

&gt;She has as a friend on facebook a guy she slept years ago and she won't unfriend him! 

Because it was years ago, and it's not a big deal. At all. Why do you care? It's not like he's going to jump naked out of the computer.

&gt;I'm divorced (one marriage only) and she's divorced too, but she was married twice. This kind of worries me!

So, you being divorced is fine, but her being divorced is bad? Do you understand what double standards are?

&gt;She's always complaining about her life, lack of money, she wants to make more money, be able to spend more money on new car, buy a house... trips to other countries, this kind of stuff.
I think is good a thing having ambitions in life but sometimes she looks like greedy!

Wanting a house, a car, and to go on trips are normal human ambitions. Seriously. That's the most normal thing ever. I'm currently saving for a house, I'm planning a trip to Europe next year, and I just got a new truck not long ago. These are normal, adult things to do and have planned.

You even mention that you want to live abroad, but she wants to have her job. So, it's bad when she has dreams, but it's fine when you do? Her dreams are even more realistic than packing up and moving overseas. And she is right. These things require money. 

&gt;She even said to me that ""Money brings happiness! If i had money i would be more happy in life!""

There is some truth to that. Money does make things easier. Struggling to make ends meet is fucking hard. It's not something I ever want to go back to. It obviously isn't an instant happiness tool, but it is a make life easier tool. Have you ever talked to her on what her views on, in depth? Or did you just decide it sounded greedy and stopped there? Because this is the sort of thing you sit down and clarify. 

&gt;She has depression and sometimes she's not caring with me and doesn't express her love, she gets cold and distant and i don't like it!

Wait, did you really just make her mental illness all about you?

&gt;but i can't afford a therapy!

There are places out there who do work with low income patients. I suggest you find one. You have a lot of issues to work out. You are 30, and are acting like you are in high school. You have bizarre double standards towards women and jealousy issues. You honestly don't sound like you are mature enough for a relationship at this time, especially since you distrust her just because she's a woman.  

Edit: Typos and redundancy.

years ago, world population was growing by 1.24 percent per year. Today, it is growing by 1.18 percent
per year, or approximately an additional 83 million people annually. The world population is projected to
increase by more than one billion people within the next 15 years, reaching 8.5 billion in 2030, and to
increase further to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. 

This growth is highly dependent on fertility rates, which are highest in Africa. More than half of global population growth between now and 2050 is expected to occur in Africa.
Africa has the highest rate of population growth among major areas, growing at a pace of 2.55 percent
annually in 2010-2015. A rapid population increase in Africa is anticipated even if there is a substantial reduction of fertility
levels in the near future. The medium variant projection assumes that fertility will fall from 4.7 children
per women in 2010-2015 to 3.1 in 2045-2050, reaching 2.2 by 2095-2100. After 2050, Africa is expected
to be the only major area still experiencing substantial population growth.  In contrast, all countries in Europe are currently below their replacement rate (~2.1) and populations are expected to decline between 2015 and 2050. 

At the country level, much of the overall increase between now and 2050 is projected to occur either
in high-fertility countries, mainly in Africa, or in countries with large populations. During 2015-2050,
half of the world’s population growth is expected to be concentrated in nine countries: India, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of
America, Indonesia and Uganda, listed according to the size of their contribution to the total growth.

So basically, overpopulation will disproportionately affect certain places relative to others. By 2050, India will have ~1.7bn people, and Nigeria will pass the US with a projected ~398 million people. Cities like Lagos, Kinshasa, Accra, Nairobi, etc. will experience a lot of stress attempting to deal with this growth.

The 3DS is also quite great at capturing low-budget experiences as well.

Square Enix seems to've tested the waters for Final Fantasy by porting all three FF13 trilogy entries to PC (to varying success, of course... I'm still pissed over FF13-3's camera) and if they are considering FF15 for PC, that means sales must've been good enough to financially fuel this decision.

Yes, I've been fascinated by this for quite some time &amp; to me it's the most interesting question in the field of futurology.

But I'll be honest, it's hard to know how it will all play out.

Politics and human choices as yet unmade will influence this in a myriad of ways that are unforeseeable or unpredictable.

What I feel most confident &amp; sure about - is that this will NOT play out in any sort of disaster/apocalyptic/suffering/riots scenario in developed countries.

There is a long history of ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" in dealing with wrenching changes like this.  America does not have much experience of it (and has it's nightmares vividly painted by Hollywood), but different European countries have seen these ups and downs numerous times in the 20th century.

I think the important thing to keep in mind, in the midst of all this - is that maybe ""real wealth"" is going to be measured differently &amp; is going to become abundant &amp; shareable. Something that was never true in other times - like say The Great Depression.

I think Education via MOOC is a glimpse of what was formerly a scare resource would look like in a post-scarcity world.

Renewable energy, robot farms, robot cars, 3D printing - will all be part of this post-scarcity world too.

When history looks back at this - what it will remember is that (hopefully) the great revolution was the rapid spread of this post-scarcity to the developed/3rd world.

Although they loom large now, our ""transition pains"" may be about as memorable as the financial panics of the 1870's and 1890's seem to us now - distant almost forgotten memories.

Djmedic,1,france,czl3usc,0,t3_41uahp,"&gt; La crise des dettes souveraines peut tout à fait être résolue dans le cadre d'une restructuration financière sans sortie de la monnaie.

Lolnon. T'as pas bien regardé l'avis des Allemands, des Finlandais.
 &gt; Par ailleurs, le mouvement actuel va au contraire vers un renforcement de l'intégration financière des pays membres de la zone euro.

Dans le programme de rachat des obligations souveraines par la BCE, le risque n'est partagé qu'à hauteur de 20%. [Traduction : c'est chacun pour sa poire](http://www.les-crises.fr/comment-la-bce-se-moque-du-monde/). Il suffit de regarder les balances Target-2 pour avoir une idée de l'état de santé de l'euro. François Asselineau explique pourquoi [dans ce débat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dmKWNpHVjs) si tu ne sais pas à quoi ça correspond.

&gt; Enfin, je ne vois pas à quoi peut servir le retour d'une monnaie nationale.

A rééquilibrer la balance des paiements, voir la monnaie s'apprécier/déprécier sur le marché des changes conformément aux performances à l'export, d'avoir des taux directeurs adaptés à ton pays...

 Pendant que ça chauffait en Irlande et qu'il y avait besoin de ralentir l'économie, il y avait au contraire besoin de la stimuler en France, en Italie en Espagne. La BCE est forcé de ménager la chèvre et le choux en fixant un taux qui n'arrange personne et qui aggrave encore plus les problèmes.

&gt; Le franc sera par construction plus faible et plus instable, n'aura pas le même poids au niveau international

La Grèce à été à plusieurs reprises sur le point de sortir de l'euro et donc de l'UE, puisqu'il n'existe pas de moyen juridique de sortir de la monnaie commune sans sortir également de l'UE.

Quand un choc asymétrique affectera une zone en France, il ne sera absolument pas question qu'elle fasse sécession puisque la solidarité française entrera en jeu, comme elle entre à l'intérieur d'un même peuple. Elle n'entre pas en jeu dans le cas de l'UE parce qu'il n'y a pas de peuple européen.

&gt; renforçant encore plus le rôle du dollar

Faudrait vous mettre d'accord entre européistes, un jour l'euro est censé concurrencer le dollar, un jour pas du tout. Si on regarde les faits, l'euro n'a jamais été proche de concurrencer le dollar.

&gt; La monétisation de la dette proposée, aujourd'hui interdite, pourrait à nouveau être envisagée

Ca peut être utile si fait avec modération, et si tu insistes pour dire que c'est une menace, je te laisse comparer avec l'aléa moral qui consiste à payer les dettes contractées par les autres pays...

Même si tu es d'accord avec ça, les Allemands ne le sont pas parce que le risque est que ça retombe sur eux, et il s'élève à 1000 milliards de dollars...ce qui explique l'instransigeance de leurs élites.

&gt; On peut même se rappeler la petite phrase à l'occasion de la crise ukrainienne : ""Fuck the EU.""

T'as pas bien dû plancher le dossier ukrainien. Le fait qu'elle est insulté l'UE veut dire qu'il y avait un désaccord de forme face à la crise en Ukraine, mais pas pour le fond et à en voir la prolongation des sanctions cotnre la Russie, on en est très loin.

The Yen is also in the negative rate thing at times and Japan probably gets hit harder by a collapse in East Asia than other parties.

Heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment) and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built up youth bulge, including European colonialism, 20th century Fascism, and ongoing conflicts such as that in Darfur, The Palestinian uprisings in 1987-1993 and 2000 to present, and terrorism.

To flesh things out a bit, Yiddish is a Germanic language spoken by Ashkenazi Jews(most European Jews who first settled in Germany about 1000 years ago). It has a mostly old German vocabulary with some Slavic(Polish/Russian/Bulgarian/etc. Family of languages) and Hebrew based words and is written with the Hebrew dialect. 

Yiddish was spoken by many Jewish immigrants. A number of words bled in to NY and especially American English especially via Jewish authors , entertainers, and comedians. These are less likely to be used in the UK or some other English speaking countries although some words may have crossed over due to the popularity of American media.

pasternak94,1,SandersForPresident,czl5t0k,0,t3_43uwz9,"I will try to answer all 4 of your points:

1) I wouldn't disagree that the Fed is theoretically supposed to be an academic non-partisan institution. However, in reality that is not really the case. Many of the leading people in the Fed have been involved directly with the banking industry. It's hard for people to accept your claim that they are independent when many appointed members of the Fed boards in New York are bankers themselves.

It's very easy to see the ""agency"" problem and conflict of interest that hangs over the Fed. Not only that, but the Fed did a horrible job leading up to the '08 crisis pretending nothing was going wrong. Again, these are the issues Bernie has with the Fed. And it's not like only liberals are the ones that take issue with it; Rand and Ron Paul have also called for Fed reforms.

2) Alright, well don't think that the House and Senate can't flip with large voter turnouts. Hillary will not get a large turnout, that we can already predict. We see how much Obama has gotten through Congress (almost nothing) so I don't understand how Hillary could really do any better. If anything, Republicans hate her even more. I also want you to think carefully about the potential of an FBI indictment for Hillary. If this happens during a general election (even without a conviction) the GOP will have won the White House. 

What I mean to say is that Hillary carries a lot of risk in the general with very little potential upside. She basically wants to continue on with another ""Obama-like"" term where very little gets done and there is gridlock. Bernie on the other hand, has much more potential upside by trying to raise voter turnout to new highs; better things will come of that.

&gt; As for the latter, I don't think a Republican congressman or congresswoman will vote for an extremely liberal policy because he or she ""sees people protesting outside their window,"" if such a protest would even happen.

I'm not so sure... The Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act are two examples where this didn't hold true. Fundamental and transformative change in America has never happened because of one person (as President, for example); it has happened when millions of people have gotten together to demand change. Nobody said it was easy, but we have to try and reform the system in this way.

3) 

&gt; If there's one thing that economists agree on, it's that free trade is overall good for the economy, even the workers, in the long run.

If you adopt a Ricardian way of thinking, that is true in theory. But again, you need to understand that theory and the long run do very little to console the people of Detroit who had very good manufacturing jobs, only to find themselves struggling to get by right now. It's easy to say that we should just divert our labor resources from manufacturing to finance (an American service sector), but something tells me that an auto worker at the age of 45 that needs money for their family cannot go $40-50k in debt + opportunity costs in order to re-tool themselves by going to school and become a financial adviser. 

Are some trade deals good in the long-run? Maybe. But as Keynes famously said, ""we're all dead in the long run."" So even if these changes seem inevitable from an economic stand-point over many decades, the viewpoint of the electorate from both sides seems to be widespread disillusionment with the political establishment that cater to billionaires. Widespread income inequality is a huge problem, because if you've read a bit of history, you should know that this kind of inequality could be a national security threat. People will become tribal and that is when fascist ideology or some other form of extremism loves to grow among the population (re: Europe).

4) 

&gt; But he also opposed the Gulf War. Can anyone explain to me how the Gulf War was anything except a pretty clear success?

Well , if you look at his speech at the time, his main argument against the war was that millions of people at home are hurting, yet the USA found money to wage a war to defend oil depots in a middle-eastern country. I don't blame him for standing up to war hawks who want perpetual warfare for resources around the world. Did he support humanitarian interventions and anti-terrorist interventions post-9/11? He sure did. Relative to Clinton though, his judgment on foreign policy is much better and I think veterans and the military alike would have a lot more respect for someone who value their lives a lot more than Clinton (re: Iraq in '03, Benghazi: [lying to families about video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etykig0XE5A) , Libya in '11)

A melhor remuneração para nível médio é a do Legislativo, mais especificamente do Senado, mas os concursos são raros e com poucas vagas. Eu iria de Agências.

A partir daí trace um cronograma de estudos focado no cargo que você escolheu, de forma que, de 3 em 3 meses você tenha estudado TODA a matéria do seu concurso dos sonhos. Como você está só estudando, pode focar 10h por dia nessa atividade, tornando o estudo bem plausível.

Tudo o que for relacionado a direito você vai ler a lei seca e algum livro muito simples ou apostila. As demais matérias você deve responder questões para ver como são cobradas e adequar seu método de estudos. E faça muitas questões. Tanto quanto você puder. Tenha horários específicos para fazer provas de concursos no seu cronograma. O ideal é que esse tempo de resolução de questões seja em torno de 30-40% do seu tempo de estudo. Veja o que você errou e estude novamente o assunto. Guarde essas questões em um ""banco"" de dados e repita-as com frequência. Mesmo as que você acertou, procure ver se o seu acerto foi pelos motivos corretos.

Sobre COMO estudar, quem sabe isso é você. Tenho amigos que gravavam a leitura de um livro e ouviam depois. Outros leem livros e apostilas grifando, outros fazem resumo... enfim. Você estudou vários anos e sabe como funciona bem para você.

Cursinhos são desnecessários para nível médio. Sério. Muito caros e passam informações básicas que você apreenderia fazendo questões.

Você, entretanto, vai fazer todos os concursos de nível médio que aparecerem. Não importa se você vai estudar especificamente para eles. O desejável é que você pare o seu cronograma do concurso dos sonhos e estude as matérias muito específicasna semana do concurso. O grosso das matérias e questões se repetem com frequência, principalmente para nível médio, então dá tempo. Com isso você vai garantir uma ou duas aprovações em concursos que você não tem interesse no meio do caminho e vai acabar sendo chamado para eles, o que já garante uma renda.

The biggest associations are the catholic DPSG and the protestant VCP. They are, together with the BdP (interreligious), members of the WOSM.
You will find groups that actually don't have outdoor and wild life activities.
A great ""cultural"" difference is, that the Scouting-movement and the so called _Wandervogel_ mixed after the first world war, (forming the _Bündische Jugend_), so that many traditions are shared. Most scouting- and wandervogel-groups are very active singers (and casually song writers) (we have our very own music style (_bündisch_), but we also like folk (british/irish..)) and go hiking. We also don't focus that much, if at all, on badges and stuff like that.

The whole community, except for a few well-known black sheeps (nationalistic associations), is openly left-, green- and liberal-leaning. At times we are outspoken about that. Often, we don't live an actual political stance (can you say that?), because we had bad experiences (during the 1st world war, the nazi-era and in the 1968-movements).

You'll find a few scout groups that focus on the british/anglo way of scouting, but they are pretty small and irrelevant.

I am active in the DPBM (interreligious), which is, compared to the majority,  an actually pretty big association. The DPBM is a member of the federative association called DPV (interreligious), which is as big as the BdP. We are not part of WOSM, because the BdP took the vacant place. Only one interreligious association can be part of the WOSM. My local group, member of the DPBM, focuses especially on singing and hiking (every summer we travel to a different European country and go hiking for three weeks to learn the culture, customs, food, people, music...). The DPBM sees itself as a very diverse association, as every local group is pretty autonomous and has his own style.

I actually have never witnessed any work done by the Boy or Girl Scouts. Our prejudice is that American scouts are pretty conservative (you know, that homosexuals-topic), militaristic and homogeneous. 

Regarding our roots: we don't take _Scouting for Boys_ really seriously. It has, for us, a very authoritarian pov.

Additionally filter the dataset down to a very humanities based major such as film. You'll see the distribution of last names total skew away from Asian.

makinmywaydowntown,17,pics,czl6ljn,0,t3_43u1p2,"I find this confusing. I've read this so much recently, and even Lucas himself, and Mark Hamill have done specials and interviews discussing the Japanese influence in a lot of the style of Star Wars. The Old Republic is rife with it too! Before lightsabers, there were vibroblades, and before those, finely crafted swords for force users, very reminiscent of everything Bushido. 

But I can't help but feel that this is all an anachronism. Wasn't Vader's silhouette based on the German 'HUN' WWI and WWII era [Stahlhelm and gasmask](http://www.warrelics.eu/forum/attachments/steel-helmets/526804d1371492579-german-stahlhelm-period-photos-gas-masks-german2.jpg)?

Furthermore, the signature Tie Fighter combat flight sound that we all know and love, while being made by combining an elephant scream with a car driving on a wet road, was intended to mirror the [Siren of a JU 87 StuKa Dive Bomber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZ504TGDpE). These sirens were used as an added psychological warfare effect to the already devastating aircraft. I know, I know, that BOTH traditional Japanese culture, AND WWII military tech had a hand in influencing Lucas' cinematic universe, but I feel like there's been a recent conscious effort to distance the visuals in the films from the latter of those two, and I'm not sure why. Are they worried that modern audiences just plain won't relate to that anymore?

Hvis vi var lidt skarpere til at tage hensyn i trafikken, så kunne de her knallerter køre lidt ind til siden, når vi andre kom og skulle overhæle i vores bil, så vi slap for at skifte vognbane, og de kunne samtidigt køre 50 km/t.

Udover det, så er Danmark det enste land i EU, der ikke lader 16-årige at køre på lille MC (125 cc, dvs. 0-100 på et kvart minuts tid, topfart i den ende også).

From now on, when on the defending side, if a team wins an objective location, they won’t be able to pick it again until they’ve won the remaining locations. If the match goes into overtime, all objective locations become available again.

**Reduced bullet trail intensity, especially for suppressed weapons**  
Reduced the visibility of bullet trails for all weapons, with an additional reduction for suppressed weapons for a stealthier approach. We believe this tweak will make silenced weapons more useful, as the damage reduction trade-off will now be more worthwhile, on top off the sound reduction.
**
Increased the flashbang range of effect**  
We are roughly doubling the range of flashbangs, making them more effective.

**Reduced noise levels of multiple Defender gadgets**  
Reduced the noise levels of Mute’s jammers. It will now be considerably lower for Defenders and we reduced the verticality of its sound (will not be heard from two floors up or down anymore).  
Reduced the electricity noise levels on electrified gadgets.  
Reduced the noises levels of the Kapkan trap.  

**Reinforced walls and Castle barricades now block bullets while being deployed**  
It used to be possible to get shot while deploying reinforced walls and Castle barricades, even if they seemed to be covering the players. From now on, there will be collision on those surfaces even during deployment and therefore the bullets will be stopped.

**Thatcher now has a shotgun available in his loadout options**  
We added the English shotgun M590A1 to Thatcher’s loadout options.

**Removed Bandit’s unique gadget’s (CED-1) electricity damage on the hostage**  
Removed electricity damage on the hostage. This will avoid some edge cases where it wasn’t clear who was responsible for the hostage’s death.

**PLAYER COMFORT**
---
 ---
**Added map and mode name display during loading and planning phase screens**  

**Reduced screen dust effect**  
When surfaces break or explosions occur, nearby players get a dust effect on the border of their screen. We reduced it to be less intense and occluding.

**Altered matchmaking timer display**  
Timer now counts up to estimated time.

**Fixed weapon damage numbers in menus**  
We have changed the damage numbers in the menus according to the light armor values.

**PLAYLIST CHANGES**
---
 ---
**Individual spawn location selection for Attackers (Ranked, Custom Games setting)**  
In Ranked (and as a Custom Game setting), each Attacker can now select their own spawning location instead of having to vote as a group. This will give more tactical flexibility on approaching the building and will also greatly reduce the amount of instances in which Attackers get picked off as a group by the Defenders right as the Action phase begins (team spawn killing).

**Ranked population repartition tweak**  
Our data tracking shows that the upper ranks (Gold, Platinum, Diamond) are less populated than expected. Therefore, we have reworked how our players are distributed through ranks. This means that many players will see their ranks change instantly after the February 2nd update.

Here’s how it was before this update:  
1.17% Copper (1-4)  
34.6% Bronze (1-4)  
58.8% Silver (1-4)  
5.27% Gold (1-4)  
0.1% Platinum (1-3)  
Less than 0.001% Diamond  
*Note: Players in Platinum were often matched against Silver players, almost always against Golds and rarely against other Platinums, which gives the impression that matchmaking is unbalanced.

Here’s the repartition we are aiming for with this update:  
15% Copper (1-4)  
25% Bronze (1-4)  
35% Silver (1-4)  
20% Gold (1-4)  
5% Platinum (1-3)  
0.2% Diamond    
We will be closely monitoring how the rank repartition evolves over time and will be doing additional tweaks if needed. To learn more about the Ranked System, read this forum post.

**Ranked fluctuation parameters tweak**  
From now on, players ranked Silver 3 and below will have a higher fluctuation rate compared to the ranks above that threshold. For example, Bronze 3 could contain players that have skill ratings between 15 and 16.5 while Gold 3 would have a larger spectrum, between 32.5 and 35. The intention behind this is that players from the lower ranks can climb out of them faster. This will make it more fun for newer or less experienced players, while the constant, highly skilled players will be able to maintain their rank.

herbw,7,science,czl7z6r,0,t3_43tsyg,"The comparison process explains easily and simply how languages work, and how languages are translated into another.

Note the use of massive ""comparisons"" of how similar words are used together. the common element in translation is ""comparison processing"".

Ich bin hier.
Je suis ici.
Estoy a qui.
I am here.

The ways in which commonly used words are close to each other in the romance languages, the Teutonic languages &amp; Semitic languages gives us the taxonomies of how and where those languages came from. It's no accident that these massive comparisons of words in each language give us these taxonomies. Not to ignore the entire collection of indo-European languages, all based upon those massive word comparisons.

It's very simple, too. Champollion and Young translated ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics using the Rosetta stone, because they knew Coptic language, and massively compared the known, Hellenistic Greek with the Hieroglyphics to find common translating letters and words. It was the comparison process of ""trial and error"" which gave the translations. .....
Sagan showed this in ""Cosmos"".

IN fact, we can use this method to translate and understand dolfinese into english and vice versa. That was how names for individual  porpoises as whistles were found. And the use of common events in existence, such as ice, water and water vapor by comparison with OUR words/sounds for those events comparing them with ANY alien species' representations for same to create by trial and error, a comparison process, which will give translations. This was how our ancestors learned other languages, very likely, too. &amp; it was how Von Frisch discovered and decoded the dance/wiggle by which bees communicated where the flowers were, too. By comparison of what the bees did to where the bees flew. That commonality, that comparison process.

this common method of understanding other languages and the underlying comparison processing going on, is what allows one language to become translated into another. It's the reason why children can learn any language, because all words/ideas are processed in the same way in the speech cortices, by comparisons.

The authors find the clue, comparison/comparing, but don't realize the deeper significance of what this has for the neuroscience of how language, AND math are generated. it's simple, once you see it.

We compete for World First boss kills. We go flawless in trials every week. And we have a friendly, fun and close knit group with zero drama. We are looking for a few elite players to add to our existing 12.

**What we offer:**

*You could join a stable group of 6 strong players to raid with. Our raid teams have always been amongst the first to beat new content. We were approximately the 50th/60th group to beat King's Fall NM (according to DestinyCheckList) and were top 10 to beat Skolas. We aim for top 10 finishes in new content.

*We play a lot of Trials, the majority of us have a win ratio of around 85% which all but guarantees a trip to the lighthouse.

*We keep in touch via WhatsApp and chat about games as well as random stuff. We are friends as well as clan mates. 

**What we are looking for**

*The right mentality is crucial. You must be: competitive, ambitious and determined with a will to win. A team player interested in both PvP and PvE.

*There will be try outs to join the clan. I will not request particular stats but please do not apply unless you genuinely think you belong in a clan that can get a world first raid finish or 3 lighthouse trips per week.

*Social and a good sense of humour. Maturity a must. 18+ only. 

*Active, playing at least 2 or 3 nights a week minimum, and playing heavily following new content. However, breaks between expansions in quiet times are fine and normal! You might find us playing other games then eg Division, Overwatch.

*You should be looking to join a group of friends to play Destiny with for years to come.

**Other stuff**

*Headset essential

*WhatsApp needed

*EU timezone only (We have some US/Canada players who play on EU times)

PubliusPartsus,3,worldnews,czl8yrj,0,t3_43uf8a,"&gt;Haha, certainly ""compounded""? The vast majority of European wealth was built on acquiring cheap raw goods from colonial markets, dumping European finished products on colonial markets, and enforcing bans on finished products being produced locally in colonized countries.

European products that the majority of those colonial markets lacked any ability to mass produce. The ravaging and horrific treatment of the people certainly shouldn't be overlooked but let's not pretend they were just days away from building iron foundries and concrete structures. Europe was already by far wealthier and more powerful than Sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas.

I cannot think of anything I've ready that supports the idea that the industrial revolution was caused by exploitation of foreign materials, especially as most developments happened to local materials.

&gt;Bullshit again. India, China, and SE Asia were as wealthy if not wealthier than Europe until the 18th century.

India was in deep decline at this point. While it eclipsed Europe for much of history the collapsing Mughal Empire was a technologically stagnant wreck. China was never colonized and not really the topic here but the Xing dynasty did an admirable job of recovering for the dissolution of the Ming but it was just that, recovery, no advancement. As above with India, China was far more advanced than any post Roman organization but again, was by no means an economic, military or otherwise equal to even the divided and fractured Europe.

South East Asia, I'll be honest, I don't really know enough about to comment on.

Ultimately though history is pretty plaincut on the topic, Americas and SubSaharan africa never really took off to the same extent as Europe/Asia and Europe just so happened to break those final hurdles that allowed for global expansion at the same time Asia hit a decline. It very easily could have gone the other way and many times nearly did. Further, this wide spread belief that only Europe was prone to ravaging other places and sorely abusing the natives that got in the way of their attempts to carry off whatever wasn't too heavy to take is nonsense.
