If you mean how colorism came about at all, I don't know that it's an either/or situation. Skin color is just an adaptation to environmental conditions. How different groups reacted to differences in melanin probably had to do with the interaction of a whole group of factors.

Some colorism emerged with colonialism and slavery (whites placing themselves at the top of a hierarchy that placed darker skinned black slaves at the bottom, people in between being given marginally more status than darker slaves, etc). 

Colorism also developed in some agrarian communities as a mark of social status (people who worked the fields were likely to be darker, so lighter people were assumed to have less reason to be outside, therefore not peasants/farmers/serfs/whatever).

So have the IFSC's drug tests caught many cheaters? Not really. Between the federation and its predecessor, only a few climbers have been sanctioned following positive tests, generally for recreational drugs rather than performance enhancers. In an email, IFSC sport manager Jerome Meyer said besides Edu Marin, only ""1 or 2"" climbers have been caught since the doping controls came into place, all of them for marijuana. (While Meyer said the IFSC's privacy policy prevented him from naming names, we already know who one of those athletes was. In 2001, Chris Sharma was stripped of his World Cup title after testing positive for THC at a competition in Europe.)

O que vende mais no kindle é...erótica, grande surpresa, não, a sério, há pessoas a fazerem milhares por meses. Conheces a piada que a mulher lê erótica, o homem vê pornos? É assim mesmo, a típica audiência que compra um romance erótico, é uma mãe, ou uma housewife, com o seu cartão de crédito, e compra em bulk, 5 ou 6 de uma vez. Como geralmente o preço é baixo (2, 3 doláres) o investimento é baixo.

Não tem que se preocupar com o marido ou com o filho porque o que aparece na conta do cartão de crédito/débito no final do mês, é ""encomenda amazon"" sem especificar o título. O que ajuda, claro, a Amazon sabe o que está a fazer...geralmente um texto erótico não tem o tamanho de uma novela completa, ou seja 60 mil palavras, geramente tem entre 5 a 10 mil palavras e é vendido a um preço reduzido. As cenas de sexo devem ter 2/3 mil palavras. Mas como a amazon não vende pornografia, apenas erótica, deve ter o suficiente de história para ser considerado de mérito artistico.

Obviamente que se vende mais em inglês, aliás nem conheço o mercado em português, eu acho que a maior parte das cenas que vou vender vai ser em inglês, exceptuando este texto.

Quanto a fanfics...embora legalmente a amazon tenha um programa com algumas criadoras para se venderem fanfics (com regras muito especificas), não compensa realmente, não podes vender as fanfics como queres, têm que ser aprovadas pelo dono do IP, e eles retiram a maior parte do profit.

Outra cena popular na amazon são livros de self help tipo ""chicken soup for the soul"", ou claro, versões ligeiramente mais baratas de romances por autores conhecidos, do que as versões fisicas, geralmente 2/3 doláres. chega a compensar se tiveres um kindle/ebook reader/a app. Mas se fores alguém relativamente desconhecido não há muita gente que vá gastar 15/20 euros no teu livro, quando há tantos mais livros a 5/6 euros.

Jam packed with shocking information my eBook exposes juicy, personal first hand Intel about their ill conceived and misguided decisions that forced mine and many other small businesses to suffer substantially, while clearing the lanes for their own greed, power, and financial gain. And, they are doing absolutely nothing to repair the damage! It’s 2015 and my livelihood has suffered substantially. I'm swimming in debt up to my eyeballs. After finally losing my home in conjunction with the housing market crash, I’ve been reduced to renting again. Business has dried up so bad to the point where I’ve been threatened with homelessness 4 or 5 times throughout the year. Managing to avoid that, I’m now hanging on by a thread just living to pay the rent month to month, and it’s all because of moves Google made behind the scenes for its own self-serving purposes. 

The anger and outrage caused by their unethical, corrupt moves runs deep for many like myself that have suffered deep personal losses. In 2016, still families and marriages are being torn apart, homes being lost, livelihoods being reduced to rubble, chances for recuperation devastated… truly a big short indeed. Desperate attempts have been made and precious time has been lost in waiting in trying to fix this situation. This is what happens when a multi-billion dollar conglomerate goes unchecked without the threat of being held accountable for its actions! 

From negative Google SEO tactics used to invoke penalty on page rank visibility that anyone can apply anytime undercover - with zero protection from Google, to the implementation of their beloved Panda, Penguin, &amp; Hummingbird “algorithm change experiment” gone horribly wrong, and what that’s done to small business on the web across the globe! I also shed light on the scandal they are embroiled in with the European Union they’re hoping to keep on the hush and settle under the veil of secrecy away from public scrutiny.

&gt; 

np.  I've kind wondered about it myself from time to time.  There is probably some case somewhere about it.  

To get a visa, you have to be printed these days.  The issue would probably only come up in an entry without inspection situation.  Logically, the US government can't just say ""well this guy seems like he's from China,"" then put him on a plane without a Chinese passport and expect China to be like, ""Yep!  He looks like one of ours!""  The US government has to get some kind of travel doc/passport issued from that country and that country may no know who the hell he is either.  There may be a couple of exceptions.  I believe Mexico has an easier way to do it without a passport.  It does seem like a loophole, but I don't think it's a big issue in the US from what I've seen.  Someone told me once that it is a problem in Europe.  ",,1454290487,t1_czj6iz9,,3,t5_2qvj0,False,1454290250,0,1458209865,
snackies,3,starcraft,czj7i4q,0,t3_43jhc8,"Alright.

&gt; First off it's a community tournament so you can't expect a huge prize pool. If Catz opened the tournament to donations for the prize pool would you donate?

The prize pool is low because it's coming out of root's pocket and sponsors don't want to invest into a tournament that is projected to get very little viewership. If catz could approach sponsors in the industry to get more money in the prize pool he would. That's what sponsors do. Having only $2k in the prize pool tells you something troubling about the appeal of SC2 as a financially viable advertising platform for players, for sponsors etc. If sponsors aren't interested in community tournaments without names like TotalBiscuit (who was able to fund SC2 stuff because of the cross promotion as one of the biggest if not the biggest gaming youtube channels in the world)

That's pretty bad. Especially when you're already at a number like $2k being so low. Root would probably accept even like $500+ to be a title sponsor. Because they don't really have any sponsors that are interested in the event to begin with, so there's very little competition.

&gt; Having them participate should show you that they love the game enough to play in tournaments regardless of money so why don't we?

So what? MC fucking hates sc2? All of the pros that never wanted to grind these small potatoes tournaments / like Go4Sc2s on a weekly basis just hated SC2? That's a bullshit argument. The reason they never bothered playing stuff like this was because they got a salary, and they had a bunch of important big tournaments always on the horizon and they'd focus on practicing for those. And the proposition of taking several days off to, play a match, wait, play a match, wait. ALSO on shitty ping for some or just hoping to win the ping die roll and play on your own servers. ETC

So taking several days to play a tournament like that at the MAX chance of probably $1k for the winner? And with rough competition in there even the best in the world is just not guaranteed to win Like if we assume prize payouts are like $1k/$500/150/150/50/50/50/50 With a 16 player bracket or something. That used to be an expected value calculation where the best in the world saw it as a waste of time. But now if you're being paid basically minimum wage in a team house you can't pass up on those opportunities even if you feel like you won't win, which a lot of these players have to feel like.

&gt;  In fact BW is looking pretty good for foreigners right now because they consistently showed Korea they want more BW.

I fucking LOVE brood war still, I think it's a far superior game to SC2 in a lot of aspects, especially in just the pacing and the ability for superior play to lead to insane comebacks more frequently than in SC2. I think the BW scene is growing as the SC2 scene is dying personally. And I'm very very optimistic about people looking back to brood war in Korea.

&gt; It shouldn't. Complaining about the money in the tournament is ridiculous because you don't get to see any of that money anyway so you should just care about the players and match-ups.

Which are tainted by things like ping unfortunately, if they roll on NA or Korea or EU or whatever, there will def be good matches on this. At no point do I EVER say i'm not going to watch it and that i'm not looking forward to the matches. But the comparison I would make is it'd be like a famous prize fighter being paid so little that they start to take amateur fights at their local casino again to pay the bills. I'm happy to see them fight, just really sad that they don't have any other options.

&gt; A big prize pool is a positive but a small one isn't a negative, having no tournament would be a negative.

No tournament is negative? If that statement is true then the scene has actually already died, there's no tournaments 99.9% of the time except for when there are tournaments. Haha, I mean sort of just kidding but logically that argument kind of fails. There's a reason why a lot of Koreans and foreigners are retiring, and it's a lot to do with money, decreasing salaries, lower prize pools with the same level of competition. The tournament is happening because the people that are sticking with the scene need all the financial help they can get. But again, going back to the prize fighting analogy. When you see the reigning champion of blizzcon put in a position where he's going to prioritize this above GSL, team leagues, Dreamhack practice all that stuff. It just feels a bit odd.

&gt; My point is that Catz view is way more constructive than yours because focusing on the positives will always be better than the negative. 

That's definitely a great perspective to have on it. I'm overall happy that this tournament is happening, i'm going to watch it, and I can't wait for some of the matches. It doesn't mean that there aren't legitimate bad signs for the scene involved in the discussion of the tournament.

The only reason I talked about the tournament was because catz brought it up in context of like ""why can't we focus on all the positives in the scene."" My general reply is like, why the fuck am I bringing up a $2k tournament in the middle of a discussion about someone who WOULD HAVE BEEN recognized as the Greatest of All Time player in Sc2 being caught match fixing. That is objectively shitty and horrible. So what do I say ""Well the GOAT of SC2 was match fixing, but fortunately we have a $2k tournament next week!"" The only reason I was negative about the tournament is because it's out of context, and when taken out of context it's not a universally positive sign of the scene being healthy.",Axiom,False,t1_czj6f5c,,3,t5_2qpp6,False,1454290398,0,1458209906,Axiom

In the US it's great because we're offered so much less PTO than European countries. At all previous jobs I was given ~10-15 days of PTO a year that would accrue per two weeks.

Positions on trade agreements, war, finance reform, and capital gains reform would be the primary factors when it comes to imperialism, I would think. The expansion of US and European hegemony would certainly be stunted under the policies promoted by the sanders campaign, relative to the policies of the Clinton administration.

&gt; i mean if imperialism is a system and the usa are imperialist then its president is just as imperialist as the last one.

A worker with $30 in Disney shares, a petite bourgeois who owns a single store front, Donald Trump, and Micheal Bloomberg are all capitalists in a sense... but some are more capitalist than others. The worker with a few shares in a large company has effectively no capital, while Bloomberg, on the other end of the spectrum, is one of the most powerful people on the planet.

azair doesn't support many airports in the US, but messing around with it some will give you some ideas. It's almost always cheaper to fly with one airline to Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, or London and then use one of Europe's shitty discount airlines (vueling, ryanair, etc.) from there.

I've definitely heard the, ""Japanese people in Japan in general dislike black people more than white people,"" thing from several people to the point that I wouldn't doubt that there's a sort of racism hierarchy.  Honestly, from what I've seen, heard, and experienced, xenophobia is rampant across East Asia in a way that's a bit different from the way that US-type racism is.  Even with Trump's current xenophobic bent, I feel like America is generally pretty okay with... Brits, Australians, Irish people, white Europeans and Russians and even white Latino/a people.  As long as you have pale skin, you're a-okay in America?

On the other hand, in Japan, if you're not Japanese, you're just lesser.  In Korea, if you're not Korean, you're just lesser.  In Taiwan, if you're not Taiwanese, you're just lesser.  And so on and so forth.  I feel like Xenophobia and racism are just variations on a theme rather than *totally* distinct things, but maybe not?

The Canaanites were not known as the Phoenicians, the Phoenicians were Canaanites, like the Israelite were Canaanites. With the canaanites being the original cultural identity the various tribes like the edomites, israelites, jebusites, moabites all split off from.

We know the Phoenicians were closely related to the later Hebrew civilization due to the fact ancient Phoenician and ancient Hebrew were mutually intelligible to eachother. So yes the pheonicians were a semitic people. 

The sea people you mention is in reference to the philistines, not the Phoenicians, while the Phoenicians did create a maritime empire, were the first to circum navigate africa and did establish the later carthaginian empire along with a number of coastal merchant cities in north africa. The sea people primarily refers to the greek invaders that came later into canaan. 


Furthermore DNA has already shown the closest related population to the Minoans are Europeans. If they were the founders of Canaan the closest genetic population would be in the Levant.

An example from my home region, [here's a 20 second video of some people from my home city of liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2bDuRP9B3I), and [here's a slightly longer video of a cultural event about 50 miles away in north Wales](https://youtu.be/L26WYBuVL0k?t=21). Due to long standing cultural divides between England and Wales despite these two areas being right next to each other they have radically different languages and culture (notice the massive horn and all the bards wearing gowns). If I go slightly further in the opposite direction into the rural north of England you get dialects like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_TXGdWcVhI), where they still use thee and thou in everyday speech, as well as having a huge vocabulary of viking terminology.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a *trade* organisation, and exists for the promotion of its members - paediatric doctors. It is not, and never will be, a *patient* advocacy group.

The AAP members make millions of dollars from circumcision infant baby boys, and millions more from selling the amputated foreskins for medical research and cosmetics:

http://www.foreskin.org/f4sale.htm

And even more money fixing ""botched"" circumcisions — which can be 20% of their income! See below.

*“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”*

― Upton Sinclair, I, Candidate for Governor: And How I Got Licked

Many other sane pediatric association from around the world has declared the AAP's stance to be against all sane, rational analysis.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf+html

The British Medical Journal also published an extensive critique:

http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2013/03/19/journal-of-medical-ethics-special-issue-on-circumcision/?q=w_jme_blog_sidetab

Also the Journal of Medical Ethics:

http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/18/medethics-2013-101346.abstract

The Danish Society of Family Physicians has even declared male ""circumcision"" to be genital mutilation. Other countries in Europe will soon follow:

*“The National Board of Health has sent Guidelines Regarding Circumcision of Boys into hearing. DSAM (Danish Society of Family Physicians) has debated the issue and agreed that circumcision may only be performed when medical indication is present. Circumcision in the absence of a medical indication is mutilation.”*

Plus, the circumcision policy committee of the APP had many members with a conflict of interest, not least because of their religious belief in the requirement by their God to have their sons' penises mutilated as a sign of their devotion and love.

These people are terrified that the general public is going to get wise to this child-abuse and ban it.

Dr. Andrew Freedman was one of the members of the committee, and was asked:

*""Do you have a son and, if so, did you have him circumcised?""*

""Yes, I do. I circumcised him myself on my parents’ kitchen table on the eighth day of his life. But I did it for religious, not medical reasons. I did it because I had 3,000 years of ancestors looking over my shoulder.""

http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/new-york-minute/fleshing-out-change-circumcision

So he didn't have 100 million years of human evolution and Charles Darwin looking over his shoulder then? *Every* male mammal in the animal kingdom is born with a foreskin, so it evolved for *reasons*.

Not only that, Dr. Andrew Freedman makes 20% of his income from treating circumcisions that have gone wrong! (But note that *every* circumcision is a botch job). So he makes $500 a pop for circumcising boys, and then more $$$$ for fixing the problems!

*""As a practicing pediatric urologist, 20% of the patients I will see today are here because of something related to their circumcision.""*

http://www.amednews.com/article/20120903/health/309039955/4/

Here is the AAP policy statement. Can you please point me to the section where there task force members state their ""conflicts of interest""? (Hint: you won't find it because it doesn't exist):

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1989.full.pdf+html

Note that as three of the task force members were women; and the rest men all born before 1980, there is a very high degree of certainty that none of them possess a male foreskin.

In addition, at least four of them subscribe to a set of theological beliefs that require them to mutilate the genitals of their infant sons. And one of whom (as detailed previously) did so on his kitchen table. Not only is this in violation of the AAP’s code of bioethics prohibiting physicians from conducting surgery on family members (let alone in non-sterile environments), it also provides additional evidence of a pro-circumcision bias among the hand-picked task force members.

These people will mutilate your penis just because they think it pleases their sky-god. Forget about ""medical benefits"".

And recently, Steven Svoboda, a Harvard educated lawyer who runs ""Attorneys for the rights of the child"", debated two of the AAPs ""Taskforce on Circumcision"" members: Michael Brady, M.D. and Douglas Diekema, M.D.:

*""Asked if people present could explain the functions of the foreskin Brady said, “I don't think anybody knows the functions of the foreskin,” then reiterated, in nearly identical words, “Nobody knows the functions of the foreskin.” I noted that there was not a word about the functions of the foreskin in the 2012 AAP report, and asked, shouldn't we know something about the functions of the healthy body part that is being removed?""*

Tellingly, the AAP pamphlet ""Care of the Uncircumcised Penis"", used to contain this information:

*""The glans at birth is delicate and easily irritated by urine and feces. The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision, this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis, and meatal stenosis. Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcised penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life"".*

But this was deleted in the 1996 reprint, and despite numerous letters to the editors, no explanation was ever given as to why it was removed. Of course the reason is obvious: they want to deny that the male foreskin has any function at all, so they can continue to mutilate infant boys.

http://www.circumcision.org/pamphlet.htm

The foreskin is not ""just a little bit of skin."" The foreskin is a complex, double-layered fold of flesh, laden in thousands of nerves and blood vessels. Keep in mind that as a child grows into a man, his foreskin grows too; it isn't so little by the time the child is an adult. And adult foreskin can be from 12 to 15 square inches in size.

The foreskin is not a birth defect.

Neither is it a congenital deformity or genetic anomaly akin to a 6th finger or a cleft.

Neither is it a medical condition like a ruptured appendix or diseased gall bladder.

Neither is it a dead part of the body, like the umbilical cord, hair, or fingernails.

The foreskin is not ""extra skin."" The foreskin is normal, natural, healthy, functioning tissue, with which all boys are born; it is as intrinsic to male genitalia as labia are to female genitalia.

Unless there is a medical or clinical indication, the circumcision of a healthy, non-consenting individual is a deliberate wound; it is the destruction of normal, healthy tissue, the permanent disfigurement of normal, healthy organs, and by very definition, infant genital mutilation, and a violation of the most basic of human rights.

Genital mutilation, whether it be wrapped in culture, religion or “research” is still genital mutilation, and it needs to stop NOW.

Peabo721,3,AskReddit,czjc5ba,0,t3_43lip8,"I would be happy to but there is quite a rant ahead. This is my personal experience.. yours may vary. Something about US festivals and concerts always put me off a bit. No matter where they were or who was playing or how fun it was, it seemed like the crowd was split up into 4 kinds of people.. super cool bros/chicks either trying to be intimidating or just plain unfriendly, stoned people in the back(good people, just chilling no problem there), country bumpkins looking to get super trashed and rape someone/fight someone and cause problems, and then a spritz of really cool, genuine fans screaming their heads off trying to enjoy the music and the experience more than anything else in the world, metal shows lacking a bit on the bros and certainly having more than a spritz of good people. As I grew up.. the more shows I would attend, especially the bands I was really into, the more it seemed like it wasn't a cool thing to be having fun. It seemed like it was more about judgement. I would go to a concert and almost feel like I was kind of an outcast for singing and not holding my phone up the whole time and wanting to mosh around a bit sometimes to have fun.. not to beat the shit out of each other.. which is fine at a death metal show.. kind of really fucking stupid at a Popevil show. Take Rock Allegiance for example. I went to Rock Allegiance, a day festival in Chester PA, and although I got to see some great bands and Bring Me The Horizon finally.. the crowd was littered with asshole fuck face Five Finger Death Punch fans giving people shit about liking the bands like Bring Me The Horizon and jumping around and having fun. Not to mention some of them taking it a little too seriously when people started pushing forward and them trying to fight people.. talk about super tough guys -________- This was generally the experience I had with US shows. Now then, my whole teen years in the 2000s that I knew how to work a computer, I knew about European Festivals like Download which used to be Monsters of Rock, and Rock Am Ring to name a few. I saw MASSIVE crowds.. way bigger than anything I had ever seen. But what was different about seeing those pictures and watching those videos was that the crowds didn't seem like crowds in the US, who are notoriously rather boring and shitty as I have briefly mentioned. They seemed like crowds of tens of thousands of people like me. Crowds so loud the singer wouldn't even have to sing. Massive stages. Everything just looked so unbelievably more put together. Compare them to soccer. In the United States we have the MLS, just like other countries around the world have different teams and their different leagues. In the US though it feels a little forced and a little fake. It doesn't feel natural like it does in fuck, probably every other country in the world with the teams loving playing there, the massive crowds screaming chants and being loud the whole time and it seeming like a family rather than a bunch of different people awkwardly sitting in the same arena. Thats essentially how it is at a European Festival. In 2012 the headliners were Marilyn Manson (who was forced to cancel), Limp Bizkit, and Evanescence on the Red stage, Linkin Park, Die Toten Hosen, and Metallica, which I ended up on stage with, but I rode that karma train already, on the Blue Stage. Along with them.. tons of top shelf bands. I mean a killer lineup. The background story to how I went was that I was stationed in north east Italy in the USAF from 2010 to 2013 and I knew the only goal I had was to go to a European Festival. Not only because the lineup and stuff.. but because I wanted to experience what I had always heard, read about, and saw was just an incredible time. So, Nova Rock was the closest at roughly 7 hours away. The first summer of 11 I was deployed and pretty bummed I missed the chance. The next year though I knew I wouldn't be so I bought my ticket. Unfortunately due to costs and mission requirements, I was the only one out of my few interested friends that got to go. So, I went solo through fucking Austria with some tea, water, bread, peanut butter and jelly, and chips for the weekend, a tent I borrowed from my buddy, a paper map, 150 Euro, a backpack with clothes, a beat up camping chair, 21 years old driving a 2012 pearl fucking yellow Mustang, which by the way attracts a lot of attention in countries that have never seen one before. So the trip up was fun.. but boy should I have done some research. What I didn't know was that at a European festival they aren't fucking around. I brought the few supplies I brought. When I got there I figured out right away that it was a different beast than I had ever experienced in my life. People were pulling into the parking field with trailers like [this](https://www.uhaul.com/Reservations/Images/HeaderTrailer.png), absolutely stuffed to max with cases upon cases upon cases of beer and liquor and food and their equipment. The thing that surprised me though was that once they all got out and had a few beers.. they would unhitch that trailer and collectively pull that thing by hand, through the front gates to be searched, then roughly a mile to their campsite. I couldn't believe people were able to do that! I felt like such an outcast but for a different reason. I felt like people were having MORE fun than I was and boy did I want to change that. But I was alone. Let me tell you though.. that changed too. After I finally got in after making two trips for my stuff I took a nap. When I woke up a few hours later at 2ish because of the heat.. I was completely surrounded by people. Super friendly people. It was kinda weird. I luckily heard a guy walk by me and he spoke english to someone so I asked him where he was from. He was from Australia, and that guy is one of my closest long distance friends in the world now! He and all the people he introduced me to. Quick back track, I won 2 snake pit tickets for Metallica on Sunday night. It was a triangle area inside the stage like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0Iy42eAalAM/T_YZ7KII97I/AAAAAAAAHCE/6pj1Eih8lpg/s1600/06june2412_pic29.jpg). I told that guy that I had one and wanted to know if he wanted it. He told me no way, not before his buddy Tom because he was a huge Metallica fan and definitely the guy I should give it to. He pointed Tom out, I walked over and told him I had one.. the rest was history. I hung out with those 10ish guys and the 10ish Austrian guys in between my tent and theirs. I would never have imagined it being so almost humbling in a way. They didn't know me from anyone and the only problem they had with me was that I had no idea how to enjoy festival (bring lots of beer) and they were more than happy to give me what I can only guess was at least 50 beers throughout the weekend. I didn't see one band alone. The camp grounds were littered with flags from all around the world.. so we went up to every different one and just talked to them.. not once given any attitude and not once greeted with anything other than ""we are from x country! Where are you from?! Have a beer!"" I couldn't believe it. We ended up getting so drunk we flew my buddies tent like a kite and then when that didn't work anymore we ran around catching people with it.. and everyone was laughing even the people we caught. I will say it until I die.. I cannot believe that shit went down like that. You would probably get punched in the mouth in the U.S. Every morning we would wake up around 7 and drink until noon when the first act came on, drank all day until around midnight when they ended, and then went to a party tent which was open until around 4 am playing the loudest house music ever. Then again on Saturday and Sunday. Another crazy thing that happened was on Friday night when Marilyn Manson had to cancel because of the weather and them needing to be at Download the next day in the UK, Linkin Park did not cancel. When the weather lifted and they could proceed, I think I remember it being somewhere around like midnight give or take, Linkin Park still took the stage around 1230ish maybe, played their entire show for a crowd essentially twice as large, and loved the fuck out of it and I just kept thinking ""man.. in the states they would have just cancelled it all together."" It was just the atmosphere. They wanted to play and we all wanted to see them so they fucking killed! [here](http://imgur.com/a/ANr0B) are some pictures from 2012. I keep in contact with most of these people from time to time.. people I have hung out with for a total of 4 days for the Australians and 8 for the Austrians because I went again in 2013 with my best friend Mark. Funny thing about the last picture.. the girl is my friend Tom's girlfriend who was given another extra snakepit pass by the two guys in the middle who I have no fucking idea who they are but they both had 2 each, and I in all actuality just realized that the guy in the blue shirt right behind us is my now friend Danny who I went up on stage with Metallica with to play the drum intro to Seek and Destroy. I had no idea he was in that picture as he and I are also both in [this](http://imgur.com/8q4R61E) fucking badass picture of us stage. Bottom line.. if you love live music and an absolutely incredible atmosphere where you can make some friends and memories you will never forget.. you owe it to yourself to go to a European Music Festival before you die. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWl0VvE8RKM) is one of my favorite videos from the 2013 show. Incredible crowd. Worth it to watch the whole thing. It always mesmerizes me.

Are you **actually** serious? The middle east with its internal and external strife (all the early caliphates popping in and out, territorial expansions, the mongols, the crusades etc.) pushed forward science and technology in the first 500 years of the millennium, until Europe which was essentially plunged in scientific darkness was able to catch up and propel forward in large part owing to the wealth brought in by the conquest of the Americas and other colonial conquest. Many of the early modern scientists built on Arabic and Persian scientific texts brought in via the Mediterranean trade route https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age#Mathematics 

Who is ahead in science and tech is largely a matter of who has access to resources and can patronize the arts and the sciences: at a certain point it was the Greeks in the Hellenic age, then the Islamic world benefiting from the silk road, then Europe benefiting from the colonial trade routes, and in the future it might very well be the far east or where-ever else. Each regional decline has led to a decline in innovation as well.

In the meantime if you're trying to imply there are no emerging geniuses from the middle east and Asia in general that are pushing science forward, you should look at some of the remarkable minds from the region (for example the first and only female Fields Medal winner: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/13/fields-medal-mathematics-prize-woman-maryam-mirzakhani Iranian born, and Iranian university educated before moving to the US for doctoral program)",,False,t1_czjc7f4,,3,t5_2qh13,False,1454301020,0,1458212762,

umphtown,2,solotravel,czjdzaq,0,t3_42ptdl,"Hey there. I'm kind of in the same boat. I'm not super shy but I've never traveled alone as extensively as I'm planning (June 1-Aug 1). I have heard that Berlin is great for us gays, so I plan to go there as well for a week or two. I would recommend hostel life as well, some of my shorter trips I've stayed at hostels and have made some great friends doing it. I'm actually meeting up with a Japenese dude I met at a hostel in the Philippines in 2 weeks. The one thing to keep in mind here is that you have to try to force yourself out of your comfort zone (I know, easier said then done). At hostels people will be more than happy to include you, but it's up to you to make the first move and get yourself involved.  
  In terms of gay friendly, I hear Europe is much more inviting as a whole. Towards the end of your travel dates (if theyre not set in stone, you may want to adjust, idk) Europride will be in Amsterdam and that's supposed to be one of the best Pride parades in the world. Amsterdam as a city is supposedly super gay friendly in general, but I'm sure surrounding these dates you can find many other gay people to hang out with.  I'm having a hard time deciding if I should get a dorm room for certain places because I'm not sure where I'd go if I wanted to hook up with someone.... I guess thats a concern for hetero travelers too though eh",,False,t3_42ptdl,,2,t5_2rxxm,False,1454302169,0,1458213029,

Jlaug,5,AskReddit,czje1w0,0,t3_43jq3z,"I believe that there are circumstances in which it could possibly work, but not in a country as big and diverse as the United States. Our country has mere cities with larger populations than the entirety of the socialist European countries that people put up on pedestals. How could a large central government ever be efficient enough to provide for even the most basic needs of over 300 million people? Especially when the needs of people in California are going to be vastly different from the people in Kansas or New Hampshire. That's the whole fucking reason our country is broken up into states, so that the local governments can take care of their people's immediate needs while the central government takes care of everyone's overall needs, namely, protection from foreign enemies.

Also, there's no such thing as free healthcare, free college, etc. It's all taken out of your taxes because doctors and teachers still need to make money. I wish people would understand this. ",,False,t1_cziqgit,,5,t5_2qh1i,False,1454302313,0,1458213063,

In the 1990s Japan faced similar issues with their so called ""lost decade"" with a slowing economy, high suicide rate, and aging population. However the issues in South Korea are not exclusive, as other developed nations face a tough job market in America, Europe, and other Asian countries. The global economy has been in a rut since the 2008-2009 Great Recession, and as a result there has been a lot of social upheaval globally.

The Germans do not do mass surveillance on random/all Americans' private data that they can get their hands on.

Besides, again: what agencies are doing is one thing, but **you will not hear Germans saying that it would be ok for their government to violate the privacy of millions of Americans**.

That is the big difference. Americans themselves don't give a fuck if other nation's people's rights get violated, as long as *their own citizens* are looked after.

If you're blond, blue-eyed and 6ft tall no one will give you a second look walking around Europe, but go to Japan and you will suddendly become very conscious of your racial identity.

So just giving it a superficial thought it seems we form an identity from what we identity in ourselves as similar to others around us, but then also how we are different from them.  

This is implicit in many of the words for ""foreigners"" in various languages.   In Greek the word is barbaroi from which we get the word barbarian.  It basically means the people who say ""bar bar"" .... That is they are unintelligible.

The word in many Slavic languages for German is something like niemiec..which means ""the mute one"".

If you're really committed to learning a language, get some basics down on a site like duolingo, and then try to find online media to consume in that language.  Films/TV subtitled in English can be a really good starting point, so languages like Japanese, French, Hindi, etc. where there's a large variety of good quality video available would be the recommendation.  The next step I'd suggest would be reading the news in that language (both world news and local news to places where that language is spoken).

If you're in Australia, I'd think that Japanese would be a sensible choice, since there's a lot of media available and there's actually a lot of chances you might use it far down the road in a real-world setting.  Downside is that it is grammatically quite different from English (also no similar words that you might get with european or even indo-european languages), and the written language can be a chore to learn.",,False,t1_czhn6fh,,2,t5_2z1tz,False,1454305487,0,1458213742,

It all depends on what your native language is. Most non Anglophone Redditors are European, and Germanic/Romance languages are extremely similar to English. Plus they have 10+ years of English education and in some countries, pretty much only English language media. Putting all these factors together, it makes sense that they find it easy. Try learning Swedish as a native English speaker and it's easy too.

In contrast though, you should see how Chinese people struggle with English.

Only five out of the top 100 are from the UK, only three Belgian, only one German, and no Czech. Wow. That's hard to understand. 

I think the primary language of the site might have something to do with the skewing beyond what must be the highly American userbase. But I also wonder if the culture of beer is different in the sense that all this American stuff that's getting rated is new and craft beer is still a fun hot new hobby for a lot of people, whereas I imagine a lot of the breweries in the ancestral homes of beer are long-established and the culture surrounding them is very settled and not new. Maybe rating and reviewing beer is not something they'd think to spend much time doing. So maybe in addition to not speaking English as a first language, there just isn't the same excitement happening. 

You can see that the UK has more than any continental country and maybe that's due to language, but you'd think they'd have more than five with as much as we're always hearing how much great cask ale there is over there.

How did Russia annex Crimea without much of a hitch?  Because of Putin.  

Putin sees the world 1-2 steps ahead of most world leaders, partly because he is a brilliant ex-KGB leader, and also because he's been in the spot for a ton of time.  

The Russian economy has been bad, and will remain bad, but will never go completely belly up, due to the large amount of natural resources they can sell.

Manchester United FC are constantly referred to as the Red Devils but that is not in their official name. Same can be said about Hull City FC - some refer to them as the Tigers but again it's not in their team name (lots of nicknames over there are taken from something within their city, whether it be the people and/or emblems/symbols, or their shirt colour). 

I do agree that over here teams that use ""United"", ""City FC"", etc. are more or less doing it to appear genuine (heck, a lot using ""FC"" or ""SC"" are just as bad). However, there needs to be some nicknames attached with them (we use ""Reds"" a lot even though it's not in our official name because our kit is just about all-red)

This is an example of morality and legality diverging, and when individuals are punished by the government *despite that individual being morally in the right and having done nothing wrong*, that is when citizens begin resenting their governments and seeing them as alien from the citizens.

I agree with the reservations people have about privacy issues, and I'm also worried by the money the card companies are making out of all of this, but neither of those problems changes the fact that it's overall a positive development to be able to pay directly from my bank account instead of carrying cash around.

And then at the end it goes into this bullshit about how God is the only one who can judge them and they will face punishment for their disobedience from God. Don't make me laugh. 

They have an ethno-state and we Europeans do not, I don't mean to downplay the terrible anti-Western attitudes of about 75% of Jews. I'm just saying, look, they're getting what they want.

Background: The Union of Portugal and Brazil maintained close ties despite being ruled by separate monarchies since the late 1820s. In 1860, the two kingdoms were reunited under a single monarch. Pedro V of Portugal sought to modernize the Union by enacting reforms, building factories and funding massive railroad projects throughout the empire. Drawing inspiration from the United States of America, Pedro V sought to give voting rights to the people. However, reactionary forces in his government were unwilling to comply. In 1868, Jacobin revolutionaries rallied outside the palace in Lisbon and demanded the right to vote. Under pressure from the masses, the old government of the aristocratic elite was dissolved and a new Liberal Regime took power.

The Union struggled in next few decades as Brazilian aristocrats resented the liberal reforms of the new government. They saw this as Portuguese oppression and began to dispise the Lisbon government. In 1870, the abolition of slavery added strain to this relationship as Brazilian plantation owners saw their fortunes collapse. In 1879, voting rights were given to Afro-Brazilians. To the Brazilian elite, this was an attack against their way of life. The political domination that they had enjoyed for centuries had collapsed.

By 1900, enormous changes were occuring in the Union. The United States was humiliated in the Portuguese-American War, resulting in the domination of Portugal-Brazil over Panama and South America. Following the Berlin Conference, the Portuguese had consolidated power over enormous swathes of Africa. Many of these colonies, such as Angola and Mozambique were granted statehood. By this time, Rio de Janeiro had eclipsed Porto as the largest city in the Union. The power had shifted from Portugal to Brazil, yet the government on the mainland weilded the majority of power. Brazilians sought a return to self-rule, the autonomy to govern their own affairs, free of Imperial influence.

In May 1902, Brazilian independentists in Rio de Janeiro took to the streets demanding freedom. With sympathizers throughout the kingdom, power was quickly consolidated in Rio and the Brazilians declared independence. The new Brazilian King reinstituted slavery, and consolidated power into the hands of the plantation elite. During this time, massive political upheaval in the Portuguese mainland forced the King to abdicate and a new democracy was installed. Under the new government: The Republic of Lusitania, the Portuguese rallied to re-unite their empire. This bloody Civil War raged on, putting brother against brother, father against son.

With the help of German, Italian, and Argentinian allies, the Union was reunited in December 1904. In the Treaty of Rio, a new Lusitanic Republic centered in Rio de Janeiro would be formed. Under this new Federated Republic, great autonomy would be given to the various regions of empire. The Autonomous Republics of Portugal, Brazil, Cisplatina, and Guiana were acknowledged by the Constition as sovereign states within the Lusitanic Republic. Other republics were given special status within the nation including Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe, Angola, Transvaal, and Mozambique.

1. Don't buy some cheapo unreviewed Alibaba shit like this guy here in Cologne did. There's a reason why people buy clones from Fasttech or reputable stores in EU and US. The site has a huge community with hundreds of thousands of people reviewing stuff and sharing info. This us crucial.

2. Use those reviews to filter out the crap. There are lots of *very good* clones. Some are even straight up *better* than their originals. Ergo, don't be lazy, either get *quality* or buy an original.

3. Do your homework. Know your shit. If any one of the following points is true you should **not** be owning / using a mech:

- You don't know what ohm's law is and how it relates to the specs of your battery and atomizer.

- You don't know what kind of electrical circuit a mech is, *how exactly* it functions and what that means for you.

- You don't own a multimeter.

- You don't check the wraps on your batteries every time you handle them. You also don't know why you should be doing it.

- You're not confident in your ability to be handling unprotected circuits safely i.e. you have a propensity to, f.e., forget locking your mod.

- You're too lazy to be cleaning connections and doing the neccessary maintenance on your mod *at least* once a month.

Qerbside,0,Futurology,czjiht3,0,t3_43isqu,"The fact now though is that extremely low incomes are only a temporary thing for non lazy people. The reason I got my degree was because I was so poor and wanted better. 

Having a set income gives a change for your landlord to fuck you over even more, because they know exactly how much you're making. My girlfriend lived on Helsinki in a place that was 700 euro a month, there's no reason for them not to bump that up to 1000 if they know you have it. If your response is you'll find somewhere else, they bump up too. Supply and demand, if everyone can now easily afford to rent the cheapest places, they go up. 

Look at Australia, fantastic minimum wages, the response? Cost of living is now insanely high. Because the minimum wage increase is much higher, they get charged way more by overseas companies for products. IKEA made news there because the cost was 300% more relative to the rest of the world.

You can see it yourself. Go to a website like Dell in the US, then the Australian website. Look at the exchange rate and compare the difference. 

As for context, this is Switzerland, about an hours drive from the rest of Europe. Let's say you are a highly skilled professional and now you find out that your salary is capped. So yes, poor people have more, but now you have less. Much less.

If it were me I'd likely move country over to the next that pays me well. I can always go back with the extra money now too.

That's why US citizens complain about Mexicans crossing and taking jobs, because they don't get paid enough over there and want opportunity.

I get there's a difference between a poor person wanting a better life but it's no surprise the rich want to become richer, all the talented people that know they are worth more will move. For me my salary is okay, but I'd get paid the same in the US and cost of living is lower, so I've highly considered moving there.

The1nt3rN,6,Dota2Betting,czjiyvy,0,t3_43mit0,"Hey everyone! It was great reading through the many opinions of other people during MDL week!

Here are my thoughts for today a few of the games!

***Rox*** vs PR

Rox lost yesterday 3-2 to Ad Finem and not to take anything away from AF but they started the grand finals with a game advantage. However, it is important to note that they also played without Sedoy. Their standin was Fn from Power Rangers and if you were watching the game, I think it is fair to say that he was extremely underwhelming. The other 2 games that Rox won were just amazing plays by the Rox supports, Yol &amp; Arzeeqq and offlaner, Ghostik. I expect Rox to get back to their usual high standards when Sedoy comes back for this game.

PR on the other hand have been looking underwhelming ever since they lost important players from their rosters such as  Ditya Ra, Fng, Sonneiko, etc. It's a real shame that they have been raided by bigger clubs from the CIS region. It is important to note that Illidan have been standing in for them but they still look shakey even though they have the top EU MMR player. 

Keep in mind that anything can happen in a BO1 so watch the odds and bet accordingly. 

***Navi*** vs Mamas Boy

Navi are currently playing with General in their team and even though I don't think Dendi is that good anymore, General is a welcome talent to the team. Together with  Ditya Ra, whom I think is a massive talent on the carry role and the amazing Sonneiko, they might be able to do decently well if they find some rhythm and consistency if they stick through for awhile. They did well against an out of form Vega Squadron yesterday and I expect them to do well again MB.

MB have been in a rough patch ever since they lost EGM back to Alliance. However, they still have a pretty decent squad and Pajkatt is still a great mid player. 

I don't believe that Navi will lose 2 games to MB so I think that it'll be safe to go with a Med-Big bet on Navi.

NLG vs ***Rox***

NLG are just on a lower tier compared to Rox. Assuming that Rox plays with their full squad, I don't expect them to lose to NLG, unless Xcalibur plays super godlike and carries the team super hard.

***Liquid*** vs Cookiss

Similarly, Liquid are just on a different skill level to Cookiss. Should be a safe bet but never go all in since it is a BO1. Doubt there will be an upset, Liquid's quality will see them through.  

**PS: Sorry for not giving any insights the past few days I've been really busy!**

**Disclaimer: This are my own opinions but feel free to give me constructive feedback or your own thoughts down below! I'm always happy to hear everyone's views and share knowledge on other games! May the odds be in our favour :)**",VG,False,t3_43mit0,,6,t5_2xnuo,False,1454316012,0,1458215380,Vici Gaming

There are multiple examples in history of much longer and much powerfull hatred that stopped thanks to negotiation and diplomacy. European union is the best one: you will not find a situation where hatred was more incrusted in culture (France/Germany was the most important one but that wasn't the only one) due to war, battles and atrocities by each sides during centuries but accepted to put it aside and resolve conflict by negotiations and now war is unthinkable. 

Every human is born with reason and a great majority will seek peace if it gave them security and prosperity.

&gt; There is no real hope for a pacific short term solution

Neither in middle/long term if Israel isn't ready to accept reasonnable Palestinians demands as stopping settlements.

Mijns inziens is dit hoe al jaren wordt gestemd: ook in de EU. Ik herinner mij nog een college Europees Recht alwaar mijnheer professor vertelde over EUR-Lex - l21122b ""Cocoa and chocolate"", enkele landen weigerde te stemmen vanwege andere (niet met ""Cocoa and chocolate"" te maken hebbende) punten. Ik herinner mij iets over Polen die een conflict had over een bepaalde subsidie regeling en Frankrijk die daar niets van wilde weten. En dus dreigde zij met nee te stemmen.

 Ik ben het niet eens met de koers van Europa en daarom stem ik nee, om te laten zien dat er mensen zijn die het niet eens zijn met wat Europa doet. Of mag ik alleen zo stemmen als er een specifieke ""Ben je het eens met hoe Europa gaat"" vraag is om op te stemmen? En middels mijn stem geef ik mijn mening - ik snap niet hoe ik dat anders zou kunnen doen? Of ben je van mening dat iedereen zijn bek moet houden en dan maar moet stemmen bij de Europese verkiezingen als ze het niet eens zijn met de koers van Europa?

mrhumphries75,2,AskHistorians,czjj5tv,0,t3_43kzsf,"Slavs were such a big source of slaves in early to high medieval Europe that they actually gave the word for 'slaves' in most European languages. The Arabic word *Saqaliba* had a similar story - it originally referred to Slavs and later went on to denote captured (and castrated) slaves that were highly prized as mercenaries, eunuchs etc. They were particularly prominent in Islamic Spain and after the Cordoba caliphate fell apart in 1031 they even formed ruling dynasties in some of the *taifa* kingdoms.

There's some debate whether they were really Slavic or if it was a word that was used for any captured slave at some point. At times the word seemed to apply to anyone who looked vaguely North European (we know of at least one 8th-century Arab warlord who was nicknamed al-Siqlabi because he was probably blonde and tall and had blue eyes). But I believe some argue the Saqaliba of al-Andalus were mostly really Slavic, coming from the Balkans.

The Saqaliba of Spain were earlier briefly discussed [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3wrx7t/who_were_the_saqaliba_and_what_happened_to_them/)

On slavery in the Islamic world and the ways the Saqaliba were imported see [here] (http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.asp).

There's a good dicussion of the Saqaliba in the Aghlabid Tunisia [here] (http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/conant/mushin1998.pdf). The first pages deal with the Saqaliba in general.",,1454320799,t1_czjhjje,,2,t5_2ssp3,False,1454316780,0,1458215471,

Wolphoenix,2,KotakuInAction,czjj8y5,0,t3_43jbuu,"If you read the actual survey, you find out they:

* Left out countries with a Muslim population of less than 10m
* Left out some countries with a large Muslim population such as India and China
* Left out Muslims West of Africa and nearly all of Europe
* Were unable to verify if the people surveyed were actual Muslims in a number of countries
* Used the statistics provided by the countries to determine how many Muslims there would be and used that to verify if the people being surveyed were Muslims, and acknowledged that the data received from countries in this way was extremely poor for third world countries and to therefore keep that in mind
* Didn't survey males in some countries and didn't survey females in others

etc.

Moreover, when people use that survey in an argument, they fail to mention what the definition of the Sharia they want would be, which is mostly financial and civil law matters, not criminal. They fail to mention that a minority of those who wanted Sharia to apply wanted it to apply to non-Muslims. So no, that is not 86% of a country. That is a percentage of a smaller group of people within that country. 

&gt;Christianity has done a lot of bad things over its history, but to equate it's present state to Islam is at best, extremely naive, and at worst, completely dishonest.

Christians started the war in Iraq, justified it through religion. Christians still burn witches in Africa. Just because your media does not focus on it, does not mean it does not happen.",,1454317893,t1_czj2gin,,2,t5_33726,False,1454317128,0,1458215512,

They're just fleeing for their lives, but you can have your opinions about how bureaucracy should be processing them.

Yet, the initial comment here denies that these are children. Why would someone not call these children what they are -- children? I can think of several reasons someone would do that, but a normal human reaction to an article like this isn't ""they deserve it because [blank] country's bureaucracy failed them."" 

Rather, a normal human reaction is: ""Holy shit, 10,000 children have been kidnapped in Europe and may be being raped in dungeons and forced into prostitution throughout Europe.""

The fact of the matter is that if we allow wounds like Syria to fester, the infection spreads to all of us. That's why there's an ongoing refugee crisis in Europe now.

TheLukas317,1,Xcom,czjjl30,0,t3_43mjnh,"This would be a great idea, breaching charges would fill a gap that has been there since XCOM:EU. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

This is why:
In XCOM:EU/EW (and i assume xcom2) you CAN use rockets/grenades to blow up walls BUT you cannot control exactly how big the hole you are creating is and often times the rest of the wall (mainly wooden walls) start burning and you can't really risk taking cover at the edges of the hole created bc you don't know when it could break down and leave your soldier out in the open to get shot at. Also, you have to start the explosion with your team at least one explosion radius (which is quite large in the case of rockets or perk-enhanced explosives) to not get caught in the blast so you cannot really ""storm through"" the opening as well.

With breaching charges you could take a turn to set up and then start a new turn with the breaching charge (maybe even as a free action - you are only pressing a button after all) and charge really far into the building in a single turn.

Wow, this would be so fucking fun - i would even give up an extra grenade or two for it. ",,False,t3_43mjnh,,1,t5_2si6x,False,1454318515,0,1458215741,

But here we have a case where we know someone wanted that and he is just moving freely in Europe. What's the deal with that? Are they that incompetent, or have they not yet realised what's in stake here?

The imperial system has continued in the UK but its close proximity and trade with Europe means metric crept in, it being taught in schools as scientific standard probably helped too. We still however use feet and inches for measuring people, pints for beer and milk, stones for weighing people, miles for distance - anything everyday basically (although celcius has completely taken over, mainly because fahrenheit is nuts). Bear in mind the UK didn't even have metric money until the 70s. 

Regarding sports, American football developled out of the games which Rugby and ""soccer"" came from. Baseball from rounders. A lot of countries have ""unique"" sports they call their own but they seemed to have spread due to proximity, the British Empire gave a lot of countries cricket otherwise it would have been a local curiosity.

meeeow,1,brasil,czjjzdx,0,t3_43ka3a,"&gt;No caso vocẽ fez várias comparações erradas. Primeiro, se há cancer, há cancer. Sabe-se que o problema existe. No caso da criança não há diagnóstico....e aí está o cerne da questão. O que exatemente está errado com essa criança? Você não sabe e os médicos tampouco, mas você tem 100% da certeza de que mudar o sexo é correto, sem ter 100% da certeza da salada de fruta que é a cabeça de uma criança de 9 anos de idade.

Hein? A condicao eh estudade desde 1960 eh bem claro o que esta errado com essa criança: o genero dela nao condiz com o corpo em que nasceu, a gente sabe exatamente o que eh. Tanto que existem diferencas fisicas no cerebro que mostram que o mesmo nao condiz com o sexo do corpo. 

Nao estou dizendo que disforia eh uma condicao comum o simples, ate pq existem muitos gradientes (por exemplo algumas pessoas nao tem problema nenhum em ter a genitalia do genero oposto, outros sentem que nao eh parte do corpo delas - geralmente leva a cirurgia). Para muita gente nao existe tratamento que nao seja a transcição, pq nao existe transplante de cerebro ou de corpo. Mas existe um entendimento bem concreto do beneficio de tratamento hormonal. 

E diga-se de passagem crianças com 2 anos conseguem identificar meninos e meninas, entre 3 e 4 sabem eh quando começam a expressar a sua identidade de genero. E de novo, nao eh como se um moleque de 9 anos pudesse entrar em um escritorio medico declar que eh menina e pedir um remedinho. Existe um acompanhamento medico inteiro antes de comecar o tratamento, durante e depois. 

Mais uma vez pq voce ainda nao respondeu essa pergunta: pq voce se importa tanto com o tratamento médico dos outros? Como isso te afeta? Se nao responder essas perguntas eu vou parar essa conversa por aqui.

Krawu,1,atheism,czjk17t,0,t3_43n52l,"All of these questions assume that atheism follows the same rules as organized religion, which makes them a bit awkward to answer, but here's my shot at it:

-It actually took me a few minutes of reflection to be able to put words to my ""atheistic feelings"". Some of these may sound quite strong, but they're all just part of the backdrop of my emotional life. Atheists don't constantly think about how great it is being atheist in my experience. But since the question was asked, I'll answer: unburdened, free, honest, progressive, unafraid, truly moral (because atheists decide their own morals based on what they would expect of other people). But I also know from personal experience that having just lost one's faith, especially in the beginning, can leave you with a feeling of loneliness, a sense of nihilism, and fear of what comes after death. (Because uncertainty is often scary)

-Atheists do not generally go around trying to convert people to atheism specifically. Remember: Atheism is not a religion, and we have no holy book telling us to add new sheep to the flock. But most atheists are outspoken proponents of critical thinking, intellectual honesty, the scientific method and humanism. These disciplines are usually why an individual struggles to keep their faith after applying them to their own religion. From there, the path does not usually lead into the hands of another religion, because these are just as easily discredited, and they eventually end up with no religion at all - atheism.

-Again: Atheism is not a religion promising anything to anyone. The reason why atheists nowadays are as organized as they are is because of religious majorities in many countries pushing discriminatory legislature that seem bereft of any reason or good sense to anyone who is not part of that majority. And in the part of Europe I live in, the safest bet is to assume anyone you meet on the street to be an atheist as well anyways. I don't know anyone in my age group who is at all religious, except for 2 friends who're muslim, and one of those is addicted to bacon cheeseburgers and can drink anyone I know under the table. So I guess the one thing it really did for me was to provide a sense of community online, which is what usually happens when a group of like-minded people come together.

tnhalbertsma,15,bladeandsoul,czjkdi3,0,t3_43mfno,"I think it's a mess in general. I really liked the game the first few days, even bought the initiate founder's pack.
Coming from GW2 though, which probably spoiled me, but I really hate the invisible walls, glitching up and down when jumping on something or when trying to run over a fence or something, it's just so bad.
The gold spammers are awful. The descriptions of everything are SO half-assed. I mean, you could've put me there, I'm not even a native English speaker and I would probably do a better job making the skill text somewhat comprehensible. Right now it's just pure gibberish, and some skills even have exactly the same names for completely different skills, or so I heard.

The RNG stuff which I guess is okay. I've gotten decently lucky on them. Still though, when I first leveled, I leveled with 4 friends. One of them just wasn't able to get their first breakthrough weapon. Which apparently the best option if you spend all your keys by level 10 is to just start over. Which is really fucking sad when playing as 5, if one just gets screwed over like that.
Also dumb how the Warlock weapons are dropped instead of shit you might actually want/need.

Idk, liked the game at first. Still in love with the combat system, but it just seems like we're playing a game that's incomplete/unfinished, made by a company that's SO greedy for money. I mean, I'm always willing to spend money on free games, but the amount of NCash they ask for premium... 20 dollars for a month, 50 dollars for three months. Are you shitting me?
And the outfits and stuff. I've bought my fair share of outfits/skins on games cause I want my character to look decently 'cool', but I'm not spending 10 euro's on a skin that I can only use on a single character, just to spend that exact same amount again if I want it on a different character, ALSO owned by me. Just ridiculous.

I mean, how hard would it be to at least have a single bank tab that's account-wide, for outfits and such? I just got that Luna outfit (EU daily dash) on my one character, does that mean I won't ever be able to get it on the other one?

I really thought when I first started that I'd be playing this game for a while, that I'd be spending 10 euro's a month on premium, etc. But I just can't stand the greediness, every single thing they can ask money for, they ask money. Money drops, mailing, outfits on different characters. Every. Single. Thing.

It's sad. I liked this game in the pre-release, even bought the initiate pack like I said, but I just started playing less and less, until it was like an hour spread over three days (aka basically not at all) cause I really just didn't feel any attachment to the game cause of these incomplete/unfinished things, and greediness of the company which yes, I know, their primary goal is to make money. Which is fine, if your product is any good, which in this case it's good but simply wasn't ready for release yet...",,1454322547,t3_43mfno,,15,t5_2skd6,False,1454321846,0,1458216114,
imj64,3,harrypotter,czjkduy,0,t3_43gaiw,"Hi!, sorry for replying late.

As the the-simplest-things said, that was not my intention of the post. I does not mean that elitism is an integral part of eastern European culture, but that equality is an integral part of Scandinavian culture. The one does not imply the other.

Scandinavian countries are in the top 10-20 in gender equality, economic equality and least racist (however you measure that). But, I have to say, I was very surprised when I saw that the other half of the top ten/twenty of most equal income was past soviet countries. But, then I saw that Russia was even worse than US, and that explained a lot. I, with many others, tend to lump former soviet countries with my impression of Russia, and think that they have the same values and culture. That is of course wrong.

So to clarify, I get the impression of Durmstrang being a Russian School. Russians do have a long history of singling out gifted children and pushing them to extremes in areas like Olympic sports, ballet, classical music, chess and more. And they also have a long history of cheating, f.ex. with use of drugs on unaware athletes.

That being said, it does not surprise me that a Scandinavian school of magic is not mentioned in the books, it probably doesn't excel in anything. Probably the reason why we are so equal is something called Janteloven (the law of Jante), a satirical ""law"" describing how small Scandinavian communities behaved towards others and themselves. It is ten laws:

You're not to think you are anything special.
You're not to think you are as good as we are.
You're not to think you are smarter than we are.
You're not to convince yourself that you are better than we are.
You're not to think you know more than we do.
You're not to think you are more important than we are.
You're not to think you are good at anything.
You're not to laugh at us.
You're not to think anyone cares about you.
You're not to think you can teach us anything. 

This is not superior or positive. It is the negative and the other side of the same coin of equality, which the positive side is equal rights, payment, equal gender rights etc. It is the stark opposite of the American Dream.

thienge,3,svenskpolitik,czjkes7,0,t3_43k8ev,"De Syrianer och Irakier som flyr hit är en blandning av ekonomisk migrant och flykting. De flyr från krig, ja, men om de tagit sig hela vägen till norra Europa så är de efter mer än säkerhet. De har insett att kriget inte kommer ta slut snart och vill ha en bättre framtid än den man kan få i ett flyktingläger eller ett av EUs gränsländer. Skola för sina barn/sig själva (beroende på ålder) och/eller jobb och ett generellt stabilt liv. 

De sparar så mycket de kan i några månader/år (beroende på utbildningsnivå, tur osv) och satsar allt på att fly till Europa. När man befinner sig i Tyskland/Österrike så har man vad man vill, men då är Sverige osv inte mer än ett par steg bort, och många verkar tycka att det är en tillräckligt stor ""uppgradering"" för att vara värt tågfärden. 

Så, inte 100% flyktingar, men man kan vara både ekonomisk migrant och flykting på samma gång, i min åsikt. Betyder dock inte att jag tycker att de har rätt till asyl här i Sverige bara sådär. EU borde antingen skapa stora men välutrustade flyktingläger ute i EUs gränsländer (Grekland, Italien osv) eller fullständigt stänga gränserna och hjälpa till i Syriens grannländer, i min åsikt. 

Om man tar det första alternativet så kan man också inrätta ett system där länder kan ordna kurser i språk och kultur som flyktingar kan ta för en chans att bli inbjudna till landet de vill till om de presterar tillräckligt väl. Då lär man kunna ge de bästa, mest motiverade flyktingarna asyl och en bra framtid i de rikare länderna, tjäna på det i längden (nya medborgare som har en bra chans att integreras), lösa den humanitära krisen och lätta trycket på Grekland, Italien, Libanon, Jordanien osv. Det lär dock vara alldeles för komplext och politiskt svårt att skapa för dagens EU, tyvärr.

*****
&gt; The first satellite of the European Data Relay System is set to launch from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan tonight with its laser node payload, which aims to make the transfer of Earth imaging data from satellites to ground stations about 90 times faster than your typical earthly internet connection and drastically cut down delays.

&gt; That means that operators need to know where each satellite is in relation to the other with great accuracy, and the satellites&amp;#039; laser terminals need to be able to target the laser beam with great precision.

&gt; The second satellite will add capacity to the system, as each can only relay data from one other satellite at a time, as well as adding greater geographical coverage and acting as a redundancy if one suffers and outage.

And if their stay is only temporary, how much does the level of equality really matter? They *are* going to get sent back. So they might as well travel 200 km to SA in stead of 3000 km to Denmark. 

No reason to make yourself too comfortable, if you are going to leave soon anyways. 

I realize now that that made me sound very right wing. I am not. But that is the current state of our asylum policies (supported by a *wide* majority!)

&gt;Unless a unified european solution to the crisis is agreed upon every country will try to push as many refugees to other countries as possible, and right now we are leading the charge until someone else willing to do the same enacts stricter immigration laws.

It has been my understanding that sending parcels from Japan to abroad by Surface is likely the least expensive method... however, that might not be true depending on the size/density of whatever you're looking to move (for JapanPost it will be by *weight* but it seems moving firms provide estimates based on *volume*) 

The maximum weight per box according to JapanPost is 30 kilograms: https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/service/i_parcel_en.html and there are also certain restrictions on the dimensions of the box. 

Using their online charge calculator, JapanPost indicated the following for a 30 kilogram box sent from Tokyo to somewhere in California:

* 13,750 yen by Surface ; 2 months

* 26,550 yen by Economy Airmail (SAL) ; 2 weeks
 
* 36,650 yen by Airmail ; 8 days

- No listing for Hola, warts and all?

- Could there also be a notes field, e.g. ""VyprVPN is available in a bundle with Giganews""?

- Could you also explain which VPN services have an app for iOS, tvOS, Android, Android TV, NAS devices, OpenWRT routers, DD-WRT routers, and pfSense routers?

- Are you aware of how any of the above services can be configured for downloading apps in a different country's Play Store?

- For instance, Amazon Video 3.0.63.245601 (63245810) from the Japanese Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient

- the phone and tablet version of Zattoo Live TV 2.6.2 from the Swiss Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zattoo.player (NOT com.zattoo.player.eu)

- the Android TV version of Zattoo Live TV 1.6.2 from the Swiss Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zattoo.player (the same listing, but the APK served for Android TV has a different version number)

- Hola worked for this around a year ago but, as of February 2016, neither this solution nor http://www.eyeondemand.com/2015/04/17/nexus-player-review/#8 are working for a:

CptBuck,1,AskHistorians,czjl1nc,0,t3_43nkjw,"The British in particular had a number of terms that they used to describe their imperial possessions, be it colonies, protectorates, dominions, mandates and so on. The distinction, as far as I'm aware, is that studies of ""colonialism"" look at how these territories were governed and ruled (whether they were nominal ""colonies"" or not) whereas studies of ""imperialism"" cover a whole range of activities that may or may not have involved the governing of anyone.

This contrast shows up in the differences between works like *Colonizing Egypt* by Timothy Mitchell (which was de jure still a part of the Ottoman Empire even though it was fully occupied and administered by the British from 1882 to 1914, and then as a ""protectorate"" from 1914-1922) and *Western Imperialism in the Middle East, 1914-1956* by D.K. Fieldhouse which covers the entire imperial project, including skirmishes and wars between powers and negotiations that came to nothing. Likewise we can look at ""imperialism"" in Europe in this period, but it wouldn't make much sense to discuss colonization in quite the same way. As for why territories [edit: in Europe] that were occupied and governed aren't usually termed ""colonialism"" I suspect that would get into debates over power relationships and racial or subaltern notions, but that's not a debate I'm particularly familiar with.",middleeast,False,t3_43nkjw,,1,t5_2ssp3,False,1454324782,0,1458216430,Modern Middle East | Islamic Studies

* Etoile de Besseges: to be won by a rider in the French Army Racing Team, narrowly beating 35 year old Leonard Duque.
* Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana : /r/olland 's first victory for Cannondale. He won't finish in another top 5 GC for the rest of the season. Quintana (Dayer that is) carrieshis great form from San Luis and wins the queen stage.
* G.P. Costa degli Etruschi: Marko Kump outsprints team-mate Mohoric. The first race on Italian soil is a disaster for Italians, as the top five is completed by Grega Bole, Luka Mezgec and Borut Bozic. Italy moves to annex Slovenia in an attempt to fix this injustice.
* La Méditerranéenne: The French Army Cycling team sees its luck fade as they only place second in this race. Victory goes to Brice Feillu.
* Vuelta Ciclista a la Region de Murcia: Davide Rebellin smashes the opposition. It is later found that he cheated: after a bad fall at home, he had to undergo hip replacement surgery. The artificial hip was discovered to be equiped with a motor.
* Clasica de Almeria: Outrage in the peloton as for the first time this month, the result is completely plausible: 1. Bouhanni 2. Coquard, 3. Lobato
* Trofeo Laigueglia (1.HC): Pippo Pozzato starts his renaissance as a cyclist. A daring attack with 6.5 km to go sees him win the race.
* Volta ao Algarve em Bicicleta: It looks like this race is always won by a strong time trialist. This year it won't be any different as Oliveira takes the victory in his home country.
* Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista Del Sol: Natnael Berhane is the first black rider to win an european stage race. The race is full of surprises as Maxime Monfort finishes second, Kiel Reijnen third.
* Tour du Haut-Var: Vuillermoz
* Tour de la Provence: podium of Bakelandts, Bagot and Bardet (not necessarily that order).
* Omloop Het Nieuwsblad (1.HC): It's been eight years, but Gilbert seems to have put his mind on the Flemish classics as he wins this one after breaking away on the Muur of Geraardsbergen. In the absence of Degenkolb, Bert de Backer takes the lead role for Giant-Alpecin, but ironically, he is hit by a team Sky car. Keukeleire and Stuyven complete the top three when they 'win' the sprint in a group of eight 1'15'' behind Gilbert. This group contains early breakaway riders Bagdonas and T.Martin, as well as Drucker, Sénéchal, LL Sanchez and a strong Démare, who forced the split from the peloton on the Taaienberg.
* Classic Sud Ardèche - Souvenir Francis Delpech: Showdown between old and new: Barguil, Bardet and Vichot chase a breakaway group of Frank Schleck, Sammy Sanchez and JC Peraud. Oh, and it snows.
* Gran Premio Città di Lugano (1.HC): The snow that started falling in France yesterday spreads to Switzerland. Everyone but the Swiss riders give up after 40km. For the first time in 25 years, a Swiss wins this race.
* Kuurne-Brussel-Kuurne (1.HC): Belgium is spared from the Swiss snowstorms. In fact the weather is warm and sunny. The race is cancelled as all riders prefer to do a ""terrasske"" instead and enjoy the moment.
* La Drome Classic: as winter nears its end, Jonathan Hiver(t) wins this one.

&gt;1.Do you think that Syrian refugees meet the definition of what a refugee should be? Ie. Do you think that because of the geopolitical conditions in that part of the world (instability, religious persecution, lack of infrastructure etc.) that they are - like other groups throughout history - justified in attempting to relocate to another part of the world? 

I do. But all those people you see on boats aren't Syrian refugees. Refugees, historically, arrive in the nearest safe country (e.g. Turkey) where they are sheltered, cared for and guarded by the UN until it is safe to return home. As well, if Germany was granting asylum to provably Syrian refugees, they could arrive via plane, [which is safer and cheaper. The only thing you can't do is hide your identity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO0IRsfrPQ4). These people are illegal immigrants.  You could book a flight out of Damascus (DAM) to London for tomorrow night if you wanted to, but you have to show ID.

&gt;2.If you do agree that these people are legitimate refugees, where do you think they should they go? 

Where refugees have always gone, to UN refugee camps in safe neighboring countries, where they wait to return. 

&gt;3.Do you think the West should take in immigrants from emerging markets (like say India, Russia, Brazil and China) for economic reasons like most western countries currently do? Why or why not? 

Yes. They go through a legal, documented immigration process that starts at the appropriate embassy in their home country. They don't just show up. Otherwise they may not be qualified to find employment and end up being a taxpayer burden. The employment stats are in an article in the sub, that on average 2/3rds of these illegal immigrants remain unemployed.

[The majority of people pouring into Germany are not Syrian. They are not fleeing war. They are not refugees.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240010/Number-refugees-arriving-Europe-soars-85-year-just-one-five-war-torn-Syria.html) The people that believe that are the same kind of stupid people that George W Bush tricked after 9/11. He kept saying Al Qaeda and Iraq in the same sentence every speech, on purpose, until 60 percent of Americans (according to a poll) believed Iraq was responsible for 9/11. Osama Bin Laden hated Saddam Hussein and called him an infidel (the Baathists were anti Islamist and the dreaded Fedayeen secret police kept them in check). 

While some people in this sub can seem vitriolic, it's because it's a pretty big ""I told you so"" situation. The left are ""shocked"" by the crimes and the volunteers become ""disillusioned"" after the Syrians treat them like shit, throw garbage everywhere, steal, fight, throw food away and essentially act like assholes.

You are ""shocked"" when you thought something that wouldn't ever happen... happens. You are ""disillusioned"" when your fantasy and reality collide. This is why younger people are generally more Left than older people. Experience. Just because someone is poor doesn't mean they are a good person.

Just watch any video of Arabs and the disdain they have for Europe, Western civilization and Western society. We all expected this to happen. Mass rape? Could have called that. Just ask any white woman that's traveled to the Middle East what it's like. 

People around the world don't share your values. Get used to that.

These people don't have a place in European society. They do not have the right to come in and roll back 1000 years of civil rights, equality, freedom and justice.

They do not want to be European. So they don't belong in Europe. Europeans don't need pamphlets telling them not to rape people.

They do vote though, and they always vote for the suicidal Leftists so that's how the Left stays in power. By importing their electorate, which is essentially hijacking democracy.

Are we more united than under the Romans? Are we more united than under the Nazis? Under we more united than under the European empires of the 19th century? There is absolutely no empirical trend through history of 'the formation of a single, united country'. History has been exceptionally varied; there is no tendency.

&gt;It started out as small tribes, which later formed small villages, those villages eventually combined to make cities, which eventually made countries, which eventually made empires, which eventually made unions.

While that sounds like a nice summary of history; it is completely wrong theoretically and empirically. And I'm astounded that you can't see it.

&gt; Just 100 years ago in the West black people were seen as being different, and Africans as being savages, not today.

What has this got to do with 'forming a single country'? Africa is even *more* divided than it was 100 years ago.

&gt;Given a few hundred more years and I could definitely see humans uniting entirely, we're all already becoming more and more united everyday especially with fast forms of communication and the internet. It's not unreasonable to assume this progression will continue, assuming we don't destroy ourselves first

You keep jumping between 'humans becoming friendly to one another' and 'forming a single country'; these are far from synonymous.

&gt;But in the future I would be (so long as it isn't the model that is the Eu), when people see past their cultural, religious and ethnic differences in the world and see how much of a hindrance they are.

Etular,1,DebateAnAtheist,czjnut1,0,t3_43nzb5,"&gt;If they cannot obey the law and do their damn job, they should quit. 

If I remember correctly, the Kim Davis issue only occurred because there was something about her public position/work contract that meant that she couldn't be fired, quit or be relocated (which would have resolved the issue).

If that is true and I did remember correctly, this is a woman who was forced against her will into doing something against her beliefs, without the ability to resign and maintain her freedom of belief. She wasn't given the option of ""Do this or be fired/quit"", but ""Do this, you cannot quit, if you don't do it then you'll be arrested"". And the public cheered at that news.

If it's the case where she could have voluntarily quit or be fired, it would have been a lot less devious and disturbing than it actually was, and the Kim Davis example only serves to reinforce to conservatives why government jobs - with their inflexibility that could threaten liberties - need to be minimized or abolished. After all, in any private industry, if she has not been doing her job she would have been fired without any of the controversy.

EDIT: Given how other commenters are under the impression she ""could have quit"", I looked into it - [turns out that she refused to step down, for the valid reason of wanting to keep her job, *only hoping that gay marriage licences wouldn't be carried out in her name*, according to her lawyer](http://europe.newsweek.com/why-kim-davis-cant-be-fired-marriage-licenses-332545?rm=eu).",,1454338534,t1_czjmv73,,1,t5_2ryfy,False,1454333869,0,1458217754,

I should preface by saying I neither agree or disagree, but I'd like to see a more thorough and objective explanation of why you think the chart is inaccurate - taking into account current and historical global politics. 

The chart itself is intended to measure things on a *global scale* and it's long been accepted that American politics in general are much farther to the right than most European &amp; Scandinavian countries. This confirms that, especially when you compare similar charts they've done for other countries.

Looking at their measurements of the last few US election cycles, these results don't seem very off to me. It also shows an alarming, rapid trend toward right-wing authoritarianism in *all* parties - which is something *MANY* of us have been saying for the last 8 years. Hillary was much closer to the center last time around, which also doesn't seem inaccurate despite a few social changes.

It would seem that nearly all of American politics, with the exception of a few outliers like Sanders, Ron Paul, and 2012's 3rd party lineup, operates in the upper right corner of the graph. 

So if you were to normalize the chart to the upper right corner and call that ""American Politics"", Hillary would look much closer to left or center and Cruz/Trump less authoritarian. Ron Paul and Sanders would be off the chart left and right leaning libertarian. In other words, seems pretty accurate. 

In essence, I'm suggesting we Americans may be looking at this chart through a right-leaning looking glass and thus disbelieving of the results.",,1454336597,t1_czjl40n,,2,t5_2sfmf,False,1454334711,0,1458217922,

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/e77887c502ec4bac95cec9779ce1bb7e.png)  

&gt; Lotus Child was born when Zachary Gray and Tom Dobrzanski met in a touring choir as teenagers, becoming friends while killing time in the green room before concerts on a tour of Europe. As years went by they started drawing more and more from bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Jeff Buckley, and Muse; and so began the search for other members. After hitting it off with music student Peter Carruthers on bass and perpetual student/down-at-heels golfing phenom Miles Bruce on drums, suddenly they had a band on their hands. Lotus Child recorded their first album, a self-titled EP, in the transformed guest room of Tom's basement. Club owners were impressed, and Lotus Child set out to take on Vancouver, scoring regular sell-outs at Mesa Luna Nightclub, The Backstage Lounge, and The Media Club. Audience reaction was overwhelming to Lotus Child’s sophisticated brand of indie pop-rock; seemingly overnight they were being hyped by youthful masses across Canada. With their electrifying live show and a battery of new material, Lotus Child is poised to dominate indie clubs and airwaves throughout the continent. Morale is justifiably high these days at the Lotus Child camp, and when asked about the gruelling schedule the year has become, Gray is philosophical. “Everything’s fallen into place pretty well for us, so I don’t think you could call it gruelling, necessarily. Um…I mean yeah. We’re robots.”

impactsilence,1,Gnostic,czjonss,0,t3_4265u4,"&gt; So it's very obvious that you are an Atheist here in the Gnostic subreddit trying to convince people that they are wrong for having faith in something. 

- That is so insulting I had to take a break to calm down. Are you sure what it means to be an atheist? And how atheism relates to gnosticism?

- I'm not very sure about this, but I think the only faith I have attacked so far as evil and inhuman is the Abrahamic system, including Christianity. I feel that you're just defending your faith blindly at this moment.

- I think I have very strong faith, but it is not blind and it tries to allow for my own inherent bias and ignorance. That's why I hesitate to formulate it and that's why I keep it to my self. This does not mean I am unable to share spiritual and mystical experiences with others, but for me the richness and polytopic/multiparadigmatic quality of the experience is as important as its other aspects. I feel better among people who don't try to convince others about specific faith systems and rather try to find common ground and a common language to give tips and reports.

&gt;  But I'll continue to answer your questions because deep down I know that there's a part of you that is dying for answers. 

- Yeah, that's why we're here having this conversation, isn't it? I am looking for questions just as much as I'm looking for answers, though. Even more, to be honest.

- I feel we have reached a point where I feel you kind of miss what I'm trying to say. You basicaly repeat your previous posts. Give me a definition of Demons or Archons, that would solve this problem. I'm not even sure how to reply to the middle part of your last post, sorry. I'll think about it a bit more, maybe something comes up.

&gt; There is enough of everything for everyone but it is people's Greed and other deadly sins that lead to the torment that those that suffer experience.

- I'm not sure how closely you follow the Decline/Divide debate, but our planet and our civilization are in overshoot since the 70s and it's slowly getting worse every year. Americans consume 10 times more energy than a typical contemporary human being, Europeas consume 6 times more energy. We're an unequal, inhuman species that loves to live in systems of hegemony, hierarchy, stratification and caste status. Just... you know... there's not reallz enough of everything for everyone anymore, that's the kind of thinking that created what you call greed. You see, this goes really deep... Abrahamic cults first destroyed Europe, then Africa and S. America roughly at the same time, then N. America and central Eurasia roughly at the same time... there's so much evil spawned and inflicted by people who talk about Jesus/Yeshua (and Moses and Muhammad) and so on that it makes me sick when they try to sound like gnostics... At best, Jesus was the Lovecraft of faith (even with the NHC and other materials included).

RedDevilNumber1,78,reddevils,czjp5yb,0,t3_43oju2,"I don't think it is lack of ambition. 

I think the owners objectives are being more than met and that is to have a financially powerful club. I think they continue to milk us for the next 5 - 10 years and then find a buyer before the brands image and value tanks. Uniteds relationship with winning is no longer the same. Eventually the lack of trophies and players will lead plastics to switch sides, taking the money they fork out on their nice new shirts with them. Sponsors will then decide that we are not the right brand image to use to sell their products to these fans.

The reason we have LvG and the reason the club does not sack him is because he has a reputation, like Fergie, of getting more out of players. Anyone who thinks this current squad is top class needs to have their head examined because I argue that out of 10 games against any of Europes top top teams, our squad will lose 9 times out 10 and that is nothing to do with the tactics. Do you honestly believe LvG stands in the dressing room and says ""now boys, when we have the ball...for GOD sakes do not overlap, do not provide and option or look for space. Seriously now I am not fucking around, I want you all as static as scarecrows out there!...oh and one more thing, passing forwards will get you fucking sacked!!!"" He is doing the best he can with what he has at his disposal.

The under investment is shocking (and do not say ""BUT 250 million!!!!!"". 250 is nothing in todays market when teams like Real and Barca are paying 80 million plus for individual players and we are spending 250 million on a full squad). 

LvGs pride is keeping him at our club because I think he sees just how bad it is. He wants to use the youth but that is not good enough either and the club dithers on the transfer market, making bold claims about a war chest to buy anyone but actually offers him options that he does not feel viable. Seriously, consider since Fergie, which top players have we bought in the bracket of our competitions signings of Hazard, De Bruyne etc? Di Maria that is all. The rest of the fees we pay out are comparable to any of the mid table teams in todays market, 20 million or so for an average or ""promising"" player. I highly doubt LvG says ""No Ed, Bale, nope, Ronaldo, nope, De Bruyne, nope...this Mane lad...he is 10 times the player of these boys. No other manager only me! has noticed he will be worht 200 million in 3 years, lets see if we can get him in."" The man isn't an idiot, he gives a list of players. The club works on it and alternatives. For me it is pretty clear that he gets offered players from the alternatives list.

Other managers see this, Pep is a merc and there is no way he will tarnish his reputation by joining a squad which is pretty much achieving the level of investment that has been put into it. Football has changed and we cannot be so arrogant as to think Manchester United is the holy grail for football managers and especially the top ones. There are 6 to 7 clubs far more appealing. United is a high risk low reward prospect at the moment for any top manager and they will continue to avoid us like the plague unless we start investing some serious cash into established talent.

I'm normally an optimist but the future looks very bleak for the club I love.",UNITED,1454341792,t1_czjoxzh,,78,t5_2rxse,False,1454336756,0,1458218371,Manchester United

I have also seen cars that were ""house built"" like [this car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&amp;v=oSSJUOyeH8A) with a custom chassis, a Peugeot 306 shell and a touring car engine in the middle. Unfortunately the car was banned in 2011. The man who built it also built a Alfa Romeo with a Ferrari engine.

There's also HillClimb, it's not really rally because there are no co-drivers, but it's ran on closed public roads and the cars are pretty insane.

I was speaking in terms of how parties / political groups are classified in Europe. I agree that this classification isn't ideal but that's a whole discussion for itself.

&gt; This isn't categorically crazy

I disagree, it's totally absurd that there will be no immigration and they never even presented a plan how this is supposed to be possible. Look at the US, they can't even stop immigration and their border is tiny compared to Europe. Also the far right started out with crazy nonsense from the beginning on, like claiming that there is a conspiracy against them and that Muslims want to take over Europe.

&gt; far left who simply say everyone can come in. It's basically the same idea. 

I already said I don't support the far left but people seem to miss the point that welcoming doesn't mean that they can stay here. Refugee status is something you need to apply for and is temporary. No major left wing party suggest that we hand out passport and get rid of the refugee application process.

&gt; with the huge amount of sexual assaults, robberies and other crimes going on 

Seriously, this is been massively exaggerated and the far right was literally celebrating every crime so that they can bash immigrants. Also a lot of the reports now start to turn out to be wrong. Anyway, the overwhelming majority of immigrants doesn't commit crimes and I agree that everyone that does should get kicked out. But then again, most people agree with that but the far right claims that we need to kick out all immigrants because some committed crimes.

&gt; Bill Maher is a bit of a twat but his opinion about Muslims is pretty clear

I'm an atheist myself but Bill Maher is a bigot when it comes to Islam and I can't take him serious. Also you can't just apply a ""1 in 8"" is a radial formula to people, that's not how statistics works.

&gt; Let's also not forget that the vast majority aren't refugees from warzones but simply Northern Africans and/or from other regions which aren't designated as dangerous. They shouldn't have been in Europe to begin with and certainly not in West Europe but the left allowed this to happen.

I don't think it's very relevant whether they are economic immigrants or not. Europe simply ignores the reality that people will always come here due to high difference in wealth and safety compared to other place in Africa/Middle East. We should find a solution to deal with this instead of pretending that we can just ignore it.

&gt; allow other politicians to put the blame on the girls that they got assaulted and robbed, for the police to ignore the refugees and literally just looked at the camera's without acting and I could go on.

Fouace,1,soccer,czjr4cj,0,t3_43ob1k,"&gt; From a merchandise and TV point of view, Scotland (and Wales and Northern Ireland) are already fully dominated by the Premier League anyway. Games and highlights are sold to the UK market as a whole and a large amount of Scottish fans have English second teams. Plus five million people is less than a quarter of a Shanghai, there are vastly bigger and easier markets to tap!

True, but the Chinese football culture is far from being as important as in Scotland. Not counting the equipment and networks, Scotland is a fully developed ""country"".

&gt; Back to your point, Serie A overtakiking the Premier League in the European rankings would probably have more to do with the increased competitiveness of the BPL (no easy games to rate fully,) combined with Juve's resurgence surely?

So competitiveness cripples the European results then? I don't believe in this theory. Nor that I believe in its opposite either. I think it has little to do overall, and other things come into play (recruitment network, region advantages which allow Portuguese and Spanish teams to have an edge over the South american players recruitment...). The fact that everybody knows that English clubs get a shitload of money from the TV deals is actually slightly counterproductive as well: in a negotiation table, if you know the demander is rich, you will inflate the price (Roberto Firmino for 45m€? Martial for 50-80m€? Seriously?).

Also, Juve only cannot bring the country coefficient that high, otherwise Ligue 1's coefficient would be better as well (and not in danger to be overtaken by Russian and Portuguese leagues). Serie A overtaking the Premier League is due to some clubs doing better choices with the money they have, it took a while to adapt going from the richest league to the 3rd/4th richest, but they are making it eventually. They also have a better recruitment network we talked about (Palermo for example gets some awesome players every now and then for a steal, like Pastore, Cavani, Dybala...).

The PL's recruitment network is weak because it used to be focused on the British Isles, where the pool of available talent is far from being as big as South America. So instead they buy overrated players from Ligue 1, 90% turning out to be disappointments (and that trend will continue because of PSG's dominance, it's easy to shine in middle-tier teams).",8,False,t1_czjqjdr,,1,t5_2qi58,False,1454340372,0,1458219362,Bayern München

It had some spice or herb that I had never tasted before (I'm a pretty adventurous eater and have eaten many other things in the Balkans, Eastern Europe etc.) and neither my mom nor I could figure out what it was. We were commenting on the interesting taste and not being able to tell what the ingredients were. Anyway, so I was eating this along with octopus salad.

I felt really out of it, hot all over my body, I became flushed and had a panicked feeling. I had no idea what was going on and I told my mom how sick I was feeling. While I sat down in an air conditioned bookstore, my mom ran to a pharmacy and explained to the pharmacist my symptoms (fortunately this happened in Europe!) and the pharmacist gave her some kind of anti-allergy pill. I took it and soon felt better. It was a scary experience.

When I got back home, I told my regular doctor about the whole incident and she said it was definitely an anaphylactic reaction and if it had happened here she would have recommended I go to the hospital.

And they tend to be vocal about it, in an all white audience of course, they shut up the minute a black person walks into the room at work. 

So yeah, even if I ignore civil war history and recent civil rights history, I can't ignore my own personal experience that a lot of racist a-holes seem to really love waving that flag. 

Look, the south lost. They deserved to lose, we all know why. The civil rights oppressors lost and are still losing, we all know why. That flag is more closely tied to those things in history than ""yee haw, let's defeat Boss Hogg!""  And they always will be. The whole idea that we can forget history and make an old symbol now represent something else is kinda silly. You wouldn't try to do that with the Nazi Flag would you? Some symbols just get ruined by hate. We should let it go. 

If you want to celebrate country western culture, wave the Texas Flag. Remember the Alamo! (lol) Let's not prop up a tainted relic.",,False,t1_czjoza9,,2,t5_2rsbl,False,1454340607,0,1458219428,

There are exceptions to this rule like Lithuania, but basketball is the most popular in Mediterranean countries: Spain, former Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Italy, France, Germany. In all these countries basketball is more or less the sport number 2, after football, except Lithuania where it is the most popular sport.  

Basketball in Serbia (and other ex YU countries) has a long tradition. Every school from elementary to college has it's team and there are national competitions on all levels. There are three or four levels of national professional leagues each consisting of between 10 and 20 teams. Most of the teams have it's youth categories. Then there is the regional Adriatic league consisting of the best teams from ex YU. Best teams from this league go to the Euroleage.  

Basketball is also part of the youth culture here. You will see street courts in every neighborhood. No wonder a team from Serbia are the world champions in a newly created FIBA 3x3 street basketball competition. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq2aZm1R7t8) you can see a documentary about those guys.

&gt;[Yes! It's definitely quieter than it used to be, but there are still people around in the American English districts. It's recommended you change your location to there, even if you aren't actually from there. You'll generally see a person or two in random outposts, although it's also not rare to be the only person there. The major hubs (Ascalon/Lion's Arch/Temple of Ages/Kaineng/Shing Jea/Kamadan/Great Temple of Balthazar/Embark Beach) will always have people in them. It also varies depending on the time of day. The busiest times are when it's the evening/weekend in the US and Europe.

ironmantis3,1,kungfu,czjrsm1,0,t3_418e8f,"A form isn't a replication of a fight.  I know why you say this.  Its something I've heard for years with Wah Lum.  But its wrong.  Forget martial arts.  If someone asked you, what's the use of the Pythagorean theory, how would you respond?  You'd teach them the basic principle of the theory.  Then, to fully address the question, you'd give them a real life example, like building an addition to a house and needing to properly fit an awkward corner piece.  That example is not all encompassing of course, its just one of many possible examples.  The point is, in understanding it, and seeing it in action, they may be able to recognize other instances it may be useful and hopefully implement it appropriately to solve their problem.  This is nothing revolutionary.  Its just basic teaching of information.

So, why then would martial arts be any different?  Its not.  A form is just a chapter in a text book.  18 elbows is the chapter on methods to fight a close range.  And the moves are simply examples of basic principles.  Once you understand the principle, the move itself has little value and can be changed accordingly.  In fact, most of the techniques are pretty bad to use in 2016 in a European ancestry nation (US, UK, AUS, etc) where people grew up with western boxing and wrestling.  But the principles that the move taught are still valuable.  Lifting an attack and countering with ""tiger steals the heart"" is a bad technique.  You will get clocked leaving your head that open.  However, slipping the 1st strike to your head while stepping in, and then rolling the cross off your arm protecting your head while simultaneously countering with an uppercut; that's a good technique.  And it still follows: 1) the principles of intersepting, sticking, penetrating in (3 of mantis's 12 keys), 2) the soft methods of lifting and advancing and advancing after contact (2 of the 12 soft methods) and 3) attacking straight in after warding your enemy to expose their center (1 of the 8 hard methods of mantis kung fu).  In other words, that technique in the form was an example of one possible way to apply those concepts.  And that is all a form is.  A set of examples.  Nothing more.  Not a training instrument.  Not a way of correcting technique.  Not a replicate of a fight, especially with mantis given mantis forms each train different concepts; beng bu (big mantis)-introduction to the 12 keys, 8 hard and 12 soft and footwork, cha chui-penetrating through an enemy's defense to strike, lianjie-intercepting and countering; etc.  Examples of concepts, not replicates of fights",,False,t1_cz1rnwj,,1,t5_2qvwm,False,1454341476,0,1458219680,

20quid,2,korea,czjrtpv,0,t3_43l0jh,"&gt;40 hours a week is 36% of your waking time per week. That is, by definition, a part time job.

If your definition of a full time job is having to work every waking hour then yes, an 8 hour work day would be a part time job. Normal people however don't consider every waking hour a full time job, they consider that slave labour.

I'm sorry but if you think 40 hours is a “part-time” job then you must be some sort of lifeless automaton who can go for days without seeing their loved ones or the outside. 40 hours is exactly half of your waking hours in a five day work week. That's a balance that has been fought for since the Industrial Revolution, and the world hasn't exactly gone backwards economically since then. 8 hours a day to sleep, 8 hours a day to work, and 8 hours a day to spend as you wish, that's a very reasonable work-life balance.

&gt;It's the absolute bare minimum.

I believe the absolute bare minimum would be 0…

&gt;Little kids study more than that.

That's probably why the biggest cause of death for the under 35's is suicide. It's absolutely unbelievable that you think that is a desirable situation considering the consequences of it.

&gt;Point to countries with sub 40 hour work weeks all you want

OK I will, South Korea. They legislated for a 40 hour work week in 2004, they just choose to ignore it like a lot of other laws that are inconvenient for their paymasters. Japan has brought in a 40 hour work week, the EU has brought in a 48 hour work week, China brought in a 40 hour work week, Taiwan has adopted a 45 hour work week, Singapore a 44 hour work week. Henry Ford introduced it in all of his factories at the turn of the *last* century, not because he was a compassionate individual, but because he saw it made good business sense. It's not just commie western countries that back a 40 hour week, it's everyone, because it's not simply an “arbitrary number” there's good evidence to suggest that is the sweet spot for a good work-life balance, and that a good work-life balance is good for the company.

Like I have said elsewhere in this thread, cultures may vary but human psychology is the same the world over. There is only so much time someone can work non-stop for, after a point their brain won't let them concentrate and their bodies will give out. If a job takes longer than 8 hours to do then it makes solid economic sense to get two people to do it, since anything done by one person past the 6 hour mark wouldn't be worth paying for anyway. All the evidence I've seen, and all of the witness testimonies in this thread, show that while the hours may be long, productivity is shit. People may work less hours elsewhere but they actually work during that time, which is why Korea is being out-competed on the global stage by basically everyone else.

A workforce that is throwing itself off the roof of the building is also not exactly the most productive work-force either. South Korea has the second highest suicide rate in the world, higher than all other developed nations (including Japan, a country where suicide was as much part of the culture as baguettes were to the French). Is that not a point of deep shame for you, that the system you are an advocate of basically killing people?

&gt;Take pride in your work and work until your work is done.

I get the impression you've never worked a day in your life if you think most desk jobs are jobs with a clear end to them. Also, you can take pride in your work whilst also agree with the mantra “We don't live to work, we work to live.” There are many things we should take pride in, that's what makes us well-rounded people, but if you're taking pride in your work to the exclusion of everything else you're not even living half of your life.

&gt;Do you know how much strain the welfare system in those countries is?

Yes, but do enlighten me as to how a 40 hour work week has directly caused this. I've not seen a single academic publication which lays the blame at it's feet.

If anything the last financial crisis faced in the west was caused by people sitting at computers, in offices, with jobs. Plus you can't exactly say South Korea, with our *superior* work-life balance that disregards the life part, is immune from recession can you?

It's also worth pointing out how much pressure healthcare provides are under the world over because of avoidable lifestyle related illnesses, usually brought on by stress. South Korea is on the verge of a healthcare crisis. Tobacco and alcohol are common vices turned to by Koreans to escape their stress, and the number of accidents caused by drunk driving in this country should make us all feel a deep sense of shame. Funny that, there is an economic cost to working people until they break. Afterwards you have to spend money fixing them

These are some of my favorites (Random locations, mostly in the central/west part of the country):

* **Locations**: Rila Monastery, Cathedral Saint Alexandar Nevski (In Sofia), Seven Rila Lakes (You can also climb Musala then), Belogradchik Rocks, Krushuna Falls, Vrachanski Balkan Nature Park (Вазовата пътека in particular), Perperikon (Thracian).

* **Cities**: Koprivshtica (Plovdiv is another city I really want to visit), Veliko Tarnovo, Nesebar etc etc.

&gt; Any activities or cultural events we should participate in?

Im not an event guy, so I cant really give you much advice.

&gt; How long does it take to travel?

From Sofia it usually takes 4-5 hours by car (Depending on the driver). Most motorways and A-class roads are fine, but the smaller ones can be in terrible condition.

Thessaloniki is possible, but a stretch for a one day visit (I can ask exactly how long it would take), I wouldnt recommend it. Istanbul is even further and Turkey isnt part of the EU (Last time I went they still asked for passports, but that was a while ago).

&gt; Anything we should know?

Bulgarians are typically very friendly to foreigners, but keep in mind that the older generations speak Russian as a second language (Especially out of the big cities). Trying to speak Bulgarian will get you bonus points most of the time, but of course its not crucial.

I was interested to read about the Janteloven. I never thought about equality this way. I guess it is obvious that since everything has both a positive and a negative side, the principle of equality must have them too. Still, growing up where I did, it was always an ideal to strive towards, even if it is impossible to reach. I never realized there *is* a way to push it too far and in the wrong way.

Then again, that is exactly the problem Russia/Eastern Europe has with pushing its students. If you were to ask them or their teachers, they'll probably say it is impossible to reach your true potential without being pushed to your limit. How could you be the best version of yourself if you have resources and abilities left unused? And to choose to be a lesser person than you could be... there is something wrong about it. It is wrong and unfair both towards yourself and the people around you. At least that's what I have been taught.

I think I was 15 when I saw the Imperial Russian Ballet for the first time and changed my definitions of 'perfection' and 'beauty'. The dedication of the dancers and the level of skill they had reached was awe inspiring. Since then I have been touched and inspired and taught lessons about life by many people, true professionalists in their fields. The world would be a lesser place without those people and the hard work they've put in.

But I guess that is the difference, isn't it? Those people chose to push themselves to their limit out of love for what they're doing and because they feel it deserves to be done perfectly. But many others were pushed against their will and in wrong ways for the wrong reasons. I am not talking only about the doping incidents, I am talking about the pressure of high expectations put on students, especially on those who show potential.  

But please don't think bad about Eastern European teachers or cultural values because of the mistakes of people who pushed it too far. Apparently you can do that even with a value as innocent as equality. But me (and many others born in Eastern Europe) have had the luck to encounter teachers on my way who believed in me so much, they never allowed me to stop working on myself, no matter how lazy or complaining I decided to be. It was because of their persistence and commitment to me that I am now working in a field of science that I love and know that my efforts make a difference - both to me and the world. I wouldn't be here without them and they wouldn't have been there for me if we had all grown up in a different culture.

Gruzman,2,news,czjscun,0,t3_43jvxc,"&gt;So you're not an expert on Arab culture, but based on your elementary school's world history class, some news articles, knowing a couple of Arabs, you're willing to say that it's perfectly reasonable to think that the refugees might be a bunch of rapists and criminals.

Ah, I see you're not interested in taking any kind of criticism of refugees at all seriously and you don't have any interest in presenting a serious account of what I'm saying in argument with me because it's too emotional of a topic for you to handle. 

&gt;Furthermore, you're willing to say that they are so culturally dissimilar that it might perfectly reasonable to assume that their ""motivations"" might be suspect, and that they might be so culturally dissimilar that they should be kept out, regardless of whether or not they're criminals or terrorists.

I said the first part, you're adding the second part. I doubt it's really the case that their culture makes them impossible to handle in their host countries, merely more difficult than it otherwise might have been. 

&gt;Cole also points out that the US is able to comfortably accept 70,000 refugees per year, and there is no reason other than irrational fear and prejudice to suddenly shut the door when it comes to Syrians.

I think this is probably the case, too. Although it's not really the situation I'm looking at, which is rather happening across the ocean in Europe and does not involve the same supposedly-meticulous vetting system that America and Canada have afforded themselves for dealing with crises. 

&gt;In fact, we accepted 800,000 Vietnamese in the 1970s, when our population was 25% smaller. Despite cultural differences, the Vietnamese were making great contributions to American prosperity and culture within a generation. 

I don't think this is quite as related to the original topic and cause for concern as you think it is, and I could just as easily point out that Vietnamese in America don't necessarily share all of the regular cultural values of their surrounding host regions even after a generation of safety and integration into the business community. 

&gt;and the ""reasonable"" people who said that it would be folly to accept Jewish refugees, because we could not be absolutely certain that the anti-Semitic stereotypes were false.

You wouldn’t want Angela Merkel’s problems, which now are legion as allies across Europe and within Germany itself turn against the chancellor’s open borders policy.

But a diplomatic flap this week suggests Merkel’s problems could be greater even than they seem, made worse by accusations Russia is waging a campaign of disinformation aimed at stoking anti-immigrant xenophobia in Germany.

At issue is the now-discredited story of “Lisa,” a 13-year-old Russian-German girl from the Marzahn section of Berlin. According to unverified social media posts, she was lured into a car, kidnapped for 30 hours and raped repeatedly by “wild strangers” — migrants — on Jan. 11.

A horrific story, if true. One that could only add to the already widening outrage over the New Year’s Eve attacks that targeted women in Cologne. Yet the air appeared to deflate from Lisa’s story after police in Berlin took to Facebook to debunk the viral rumour. Yes, the girl in question did in fact go missing for a short time, the police statement said, but an investigation showed that she was neither kidnapped nor assaulted.

Good enough? Not for Russia’s state-run First Channel TV. For days the station ignored the Berlin police denials and reported Lisa’s story as fact in an incendiary clip that, what else, went viral anew — shared in the millions. The report struck an emotional chord with Germany’s estimated 1.2 million ethnic Russians, sparking angry demonstrations in several cities.

Also not good enough for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who this week breathed new life into the meme, directly challenging the integrity of German police and alleging a coverup.

“It is clear that Lisa did not exactly decide voluntarily to disappear for 30 hours,” Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “I hope these issues do not get swept under the rug, repeating the situation when a Russian girl’s disappearance in Germany was hushed up … truth and justice must prevail here.”

Lavrov’s German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, lashed back, accusing Russia of using the story as “political propaganda … to inflame and influence what is already a difficult debate about migration within Germany.”

Judy Dempsey, editor of the website Strategic Europe, went further, writing that the manipulation matches up with a broader Russian goal to propaganda “to weaken the EU’s common positions and therefore the union itself.”",OCCI,False,t3_43p42o,,1,t5_2qh4j,False,1454343077,0,1458220168,Occitania

What the fuck are you talking about? I lived. You traveled. Even with just anecdotes you're behind, but let's go to actual evidence.

&gt; America is not mediocre. A country like Sweden, where no one can get ahead in life, is mediocre.

I said Switzerland, not Sweden. If you're bringing up Sweden randomly, at least state why. 

&gt; My uncle came here with literally nothing from a war-torn country, and he's worth millions now.

Wow, congrats to him. That means absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. That's not evidence for a trend, some people win the lottery. That doesn't mean most win the lottery. 

Let's talk facts:




34th in terms of life expectancy! Ouch!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy

And yet we spend the most on healthcare by a lot! We spend 33% more then switzerland and norway but they're in the top 10 life expectancies and we're 34th. Jeez we spend a lot to get mediocre results huh?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita

35th/64 and 27th/64 for Math and Science:

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/02/02/u-s-students-improving-slowly-in-math-and-science-but-still-lagging-internationally/

20th in gender equality rankings:

http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2014/rankings/

Let's look at intentional homicide rate. Switzerland is 10th lowest, Sweden 12th, UK, Germany 20th, USA is a cool 98th from the bottom, aka half way to the top! Mediocre! Who's just above us? (Just above aka lower rate aka better than us?) Egypt! Sri Lanka! India! Belarus! Kosovo! Uzbekistan?! SENEGAL? Bangladesh. Turkey! Fucking Vietnam. They all have lower rate. Just below us is Iran Niger Latvia etc. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

Let's contrast this with how much GDP we have compared to the world. How rich are we compared to the world?

The entire EU has a nominal GDP of 18,500,000 millions, the United States of America has one of 17,300,000 millions. The US is almost comparable to the entire EU, or comparable to Japan, Germany, and China put together. And yet we're mediocre. And we don't provide universal healthcare or education to our citizens, which those countries do. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)

It's shocking how much money the US has, and how little it utilizes for its citizens, and how much we accept mediocrity here. We should be the greatest country in the world given all our advantages, but we aren't. Nuts! And believe me I really want us to be. I want us to be #1 in everything, but we have to do what's necessary to get there and saying things are good enough when they're really not is not gonna cut it. Basically it's like you're saying, yeah I pay 10,000 a month for internet, but at least I have internet! And it's fast! But then I'm pointing out other countries have internet, and for cheaper, and you're saying those a mediocre countries! Not worth discussing! It's almost literally like that. 

&gt; You're probably in your mid 20's. 25-27 is my guess. I'm 38 in a few months. Trust me when I say your values change once you start earning above median income. It's possible if you aren't lazy or stupid.

I'm older than that and I make above median income. It's actually shocking to me that I do, I'm probably overpaid for what I do, but I'm lucky at the moment. I'm going to be paid this year above the median average household income and I'm an unmarried white male with no dependents and only a little low interest (lower interest than average) student debt (below average amount) from grad school that's being paid off. Now that you know where I'm about. And you know how the US measures up short. Reexamine your world view. Do some research.

You've got eumelanin B, a dark pigment, and eumelanin b, a lighter pigment that looks brown. You also have pheomelanin, which is a red pigment. Everyone IRL has these three pigments in some combination to produce their hair colour: redheads have little eumelanin B but a lot of pheomelanin, and fair people have a little bit of eumelanin b. This is all very simplified.

Now I wrangled with the genetics to make some forms of the pigments easier to express. I also added in the possibility for another pigment, which I've tentatively called poliomelanin. I may have even nicked it from actual biology somewhere, I can't remember, I'd have to check my notes, but it stems from a word for grey, because that's what it is: a greyish colour that reflects light in such a way to produce blue. Blue is a right bitch in natural pigment terms, and the blue you see in birds and I think fish is actually a grey, it just looks blue to us.

So with poliomelanin, I reckoned I could have a whole range of colours, depending on the combinations. Polio and pheo make purples, polio and eu b make greens - it all depends on what you inherit. I have made it so that a spectrum of yellows and browns, like real life, are the most seen, followed by a red/pink spectrum with a dominant form of pheo, then the greens and most rare the blues. Hair colours in a population may differ in this rarity depending on where you are in the world and how common the odd pigments are.

Fiddling genetics is fun when you're making stuff up. It's sure as hell not correct but at least it's vaguely realistic.

Oh, I also combined the ideas behind cat colour genetics and budgerigar genetics to develop colour schemes and patterns behind a species of wingy peoples', er, wings. You'd inherit either red OR yellow and maybe a sex-linked blue. Men would only express one colour but women, with two X genes, could express two, red and blue or yellow and blue.

Lubyak,20,AskHistorians,czjti9u,0,t3_43ou26,"The Holy Roman Empire (HRE) offered many things to its members, and its non-electoral princes had their own role to play within the legal structure of the Empire. 

Perhaps first and foremost was external and internal security. For threats outside of the Empire, such as the French or Swedes encroaching on its borders, or the classic threat of the Turks to Christendom, the Empire was intended to provide a united front of princes under the Emperor. The Princes of the Empire had obligations to provide soldiers for the defence of the Empire in general. Declarations of *Reichskrieg*--I'm sorry, I just love that term--could thus meet an externtal threat, and allow even the smallest Imperial prince to rely on the protection of the Emperor and the Empire as a whole if they came under threat from an external power. Of course, the effectiveness of this system is up for debate. 

Even within the Empire, security was an important role. The *Reichsreform* resulted in the declaration of the 'Public Peace'. Essentially, this system was meant to outlaw the use of force to settle disputes within the Empire, and require princes to settle their disputes through a legal process--much like most modern states require their citizens. The Imperial Circles were drawn up to promote and enforce the Public Peace, and the Imperial Aulic Council (*Reichshofrat*) was established to serve as a supreme judicial body for settlement of disputes between the princes. This, of course, was meant to promote stability and security within the Empire, by preventing the princes from resorting to force of arms--justified by claims of right to revenge/vendetta--and binding them to basically go through an arbitration process. 

So, as we can see, there was certainly a benefit to being a member of the Empire, rather than just being a random prince of a small polity in the heart of the Europe, without the protection of the Empire. The Empire provided security against external threats, by ensuring that the Empire could provide forces to the Emperor for their own defence, and security internally, by binding the princes into a legal structure to resolve their disputes rather than merely allowing themselves to fight over it. In addition to all of this, the Empire--effectively--provided a government structure above that of the individual princedom. 

To understand this, let us turn to the *Reichstag*, or Imperial Diet as it is often translated. The Diet was the gathering of the estates of the Empire, and to hold a seat in the Diet, was to be a true Imperial Estate. The Estates are best seen as a convention of the Emperor's direct subjects, who could then discuss and present recommendations to the Emperor. The Emperor could then approve of their recommendations to transform it into Imperial law. The Diet could vote the Emperor money or soldiers to meet a threat, among other issues. The Diet consisted of different 'Colleges': the Electoral College, which of course consisted of the Prince Electors; the College of Imperial Princes, which consisted of the non-electoral princes, both secular and ecclesiastical; and the College of Cities, which consisted of the Imperial Free Cities. The Free Cities were a later addition to the Diet, and were inferior to the Electoral and Princely colleges for a long time. 

As such, as we can see, the Imperial Princes had a voice in the government of the Empire as a whole. This resulted in what was essentially a diarchy between the Princes of the Empire and the Emperor, with both relying on each other in their own way or manner. The Emperor needed the princes to give their approval for his wars and policies, while the princes relied on the Emperor to provide a centrepoint and the enforcement of the laws and policy of the Empire. As such, the Empire did provide advantages to the average Imperial prince, both in terms of garunteeing their own physical security, and of increasing their own imporance by giving them a voice in the government of the wider Empire as a whole.

1. Well I currently use 4 USB 3 ports and with stuff like Oculus coming out the demand for fast USB ports will only go up.  
I could constantly unplug and re-plug devices where it's possible or get a hub (a decent USB 3 hub is 30-50$), but I rather have a few extra ports to have headroom for the future. Personally I won't need extra PCIe slots but the one M.2 slot will be occupied from the beginning (looking at you oh sexy 950 PRO), so I would not have any space for a later upgrade.  
2. I think we agree here. For gaming only, I'd go with a 6600k instead (like I hinted at in my original answer) and I see no CPU bottlenecking with any of the I7/Xeon options.  
3. You are right, the 80W is over the 6700 non K variant (75W actually). I haven't really looked into real power consumption comparisons, I've just read that the Skylakes are great in low load/idle every day scenarios (like &lt; 4W idle) and their max TDP is 50/75W less, so I assumed the power draw under load is also lower. I'll have to look into this  
4. Well true, but then again, my current CPU, a 3770, is going for ~560$ new. The old CPUs' production capacities get reduced while the labs switch production to the new one, one by one. Here in Europe the 5820k is actually 50€ more expensive than the 6700k. The 6700k prices should go down over time as production ramps up, the 5820k might go down for a while but eventually it will go up as supply will go down.   

I don't really like the E3 Xeons, they are getting a little old and they are missing useful everyday features in hardware like audio/video/picture de/encoding. You need to go up to at least 1271 models to get comparable performance. They are amazing for multi core best-value builds though (where you sacrifice some power and features to get the price down).  
  
Sorry for the long read, I will probably post my build plans in this subreddit soon.  
I'm building a new Workstation  
(development that requires 2-3 IDEs running, 1-3 VMs (mostly vagrant/virtualbox 1-2GB Linux boxes), some video conversions, light but frequent compiling etc).  
It should be able to do at least 1920x1200 gaming maxed out / it should be Oculus ready so there is a certain gaming performance need as well.
  
So my profile is a little different, I'm aiming for 32GB ram and an i7 in a quiet system that has low power consumption (at least in ""work mode"").

Baalka,1,worldnews,czju0gk,0,t3_43n4uy,"Good point on the tillage. I don't know enough on the matter to have an opinion, but with all the shit I hear ""conventional farming techniques"" get for overexploitation, contaminations, destruction of the environment (by that I essentially mean huge open fields that are extremely disruptive for the ecosystems), etc. I didn't really look into it, expecting the damage done by organic farming to be less prevalent. 

Your link detailed well the damage done by tillage, but not that it is more prevalent in organic farming ; after a quick search I indeed found that correlation to appear, however there are organic initiatives that seek a lowered tillage. I suppose you pointed it out because it is not taken into account by the EU labels ? 

As for the use of pesticides, well honestly, no, organic food never meant to be entirely pesticide-free. It intends to avoid the use of harmful chemicals – whether for the human health or the environment. If it's proven to not be (hard to *prove* !), it's  good to go. There I must say I am pretty sceptical, as, you said it, EU conventional farming is pretty regulated and safe. However, a total ban wouldn't make a whole lot of sense as farmers couldn't use some techniques which are percieved as ""traditional"" but technically would fall under such a ban. I tend to see it as a stricter variation of the same regulation, which, as those regulations heavily rely on concentrations and quantities, can only be better to even out anomalities, so to say. Although the thresholds established by the EU for conventional farming are orders of magnitude more strict than evaluated to be needed, so I'm not that much concerned on that regard.

As for the ""less nutritionally rich"" argument, it can't be linked to the ""organic"" idea in any way and depends of other factors. Stating that broad a fact without further analysis of all factors and more arguments is most probable cherry picking at its finest. Plus, I've read a couple articles on the blog you linked, and it seems questionable at best.

I had to do some reading to understand what you meant with the E.Coli breakup. In the end, it's been proven to orginate from organic fenugreek cultivated in Turkey, so yeah. I didn't know that. However, that's once again not proof of anything whatsoever, singling out a case has never made a proof. Especially when we're talking about international trade, but that's in fact a very good point that's been brought there ; here it's my personal opinion, but I don't think you should bother to buy organic if it needs to cross half the world, that just plainly does not make sense.

On a more statiscal note, from the couple studies I quickly checked  (among the top results from Google Scholar searching ""health risk organic conventional food"", barring the large amount of research regarding *percieved* risk – which, on a side note, seems disproportionate) (examples [1](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408690290825439), [2](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02652030110113799), [3](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/120-a458/)), the difference in health risks seems negligeable, however there is statistically much less pesticides in organic food, and the consensus *seems* (keep in mind, only checked a couple, although at least they're peer-reviewed, critiques papers) to be that the effects on a broader scale can't be estimated but must be in favor of organic food.

Another side note : I didn't even think of organic meat, as I was thinking from a sustainability point of view, I didn't really consider them. Don't know much about all the processes.


Although I must say, I heavily agree with you when saying ""Modern, conventional farming techniques are slandered in organic marketing campaigns in an effort to increase their own sales."". That's why I put the emphasis on my previous post on third-party evaluations, there really is a lot of shit going on and, that's indubitable, whether you think organic food is inherently good or not, there are a shitton of scams out there.

So you know I'm not a fervent defender of organic, I mostly don't buy organic, and am the first to roll my eyes at a lot of the trendy organic buyers and markets, for all the precited reasons. However, if you try to make as much of an informed choice as possible (once again, a lot of shit going on, even for experts it's not necessarily evident) on what food to buy from a sustainability (arguably, as you pointed out, health) point of view, organic foods are overrepresented.

Edited : interesting to note, although there's a tolerance to some chemicals if they're proven to not be harmful, there's a very strict no-tolerance towards GMOs. That doesn't make a lot of sense to not apply the same rules to both, however I honestly understand the reason behind this. GMOs are simply too recent on the market for us to fully grasp all the possible implications (as an example, the recent case of GMOs in spain which used some genes from another species, which was obviously not labeled when the food was sold. Turns out some people can die from allergies to that other species.). So I understand their will to take a step back regarding GMOs and wait some times before considering it. My personal opinion here is that, once again, regulation and information are the key ; broad sweeping one way or another does not achieve anything, although we don't want cases like the example I gave to happen. There's still a lot to learn.",,1454345558,t1_czjqhqw,,1,t5_2qh13,False,1454344836,0,1458220725,

Am I the only one who understands that the Treaty of Lisbon made pretty clear what the idea was going to be behind the Union after its ratification? You cannot go sign a document just to be part of it and then go: ""Oh wait, actually I don't agree with the core principles of it"".

Why do we have to adapt the Union and its core principles (freedom of movement for people and good,s, etc.) because suddenly some people do not feel it is right for them? If it is not right for you, then just leave the Union. However, that is something they rather not, because they like the money they get from the Union.

We call those things an FTA in general. If Britain wants that, it can leave the Union. Switzerland is part of the market and it isn't asking the Union to change itself for its sudden needs.

Mmm, now I am starting to be a bit too harsh in wordings: While I understand euro-skepticism, I do not believe the Union should change its project. Instead all countries will come to a point where they need to choose between more EU or abandon the project whatsoever.

Mheen004,1,european,czjvuqe,0,t3_43nu7l,"1. Yes, if by Syrian refugees you mean people from Syria and not people pretending to be from Syria. People living in Syria have -in many cases- the options flee or be killed. There are relatively save places in Syria in Assad's territory but the number of 'save' cities is declining and even in this cities you are in danger. A lot of Syrians have a valid reason to flee their country. The part of the ""refugees"" that isn't actually from Syria or other dangerous places of course should be separated A.S.A.P.

2. I think the west should support countries like Lebanon that are taking in a BIG deal of refugees at this moment. I'm not sure on Europe's and America's relations with other countries in the area, but Saudi-Arabia and Israel have no excuse for not taking in anyone in my opinion. There is of course the cultural and religion argument for Israel, wich I do take seriously, but in Syrian regions bordering Israel the number of people being killed by extreme islamic groups is too high for Isreal to do nothing. There is a burden an a possible danger in letting these refugees in, but by denying them completely you only move the burden and the danger to other countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and the EU. If we support more countries taking in great numbers, they will be abble to support more people in their camps, causing less refugees will feel the need to flee the region.
  People often criticize the refugees coming through Turkey and Greece for having already passed save countries and having no need to come to Germany and the rest of Europe. The fact is that many refugees are simply denied in Turkey and Greece already, the east of Europe is also swamped relatively to western Europe. Many have the choice to be homeless illegal beggars or live in massive low supplied camps in the east or go for Germany. I'm not saying we should open the outer borders or invite them like Germany has done, but I'm saying were not going to get the influx to 0. The hard thing here is that I do NOT trust the current Turkish government for one bit although im completely biased on this. What I heard is that they advice Dutch-Turkish people to vote for the current leading party which seems non democratic to me, try to pressure people in to traditional islamic views and of course the censoring of twitter. Seems to me Erdogan is trying to get from a democracy to a islamist authoritarian regime so its hard to cooperate with a government like that in my biased opinion.

3. No, at least in Europe for the time being not. A state has a lot of short term problems with immigration, and with the current situation we have to stop the economic migration to save people who are in direct danger.

Great to see other liberals here, I was shocked by the generalized-hate, some genocide and ""cleaning civil war"" mentions at fist too when I found this subreddit. I soon discovered that many people here a more nuanced than that. This is more an all-free-speech subreddit that tends to be nationalistic because of the rules of r/europe.

Secondly, I think his ability to play a nice weighted ball to an on running attacker will allow all 3 of our mobile strikers to make runs off the back shoulder of the defender and try to make something happen in stride. Those are the types of players we need; intelligent, poised, and adaptable. He's performed on a European Final stage for Benfica and I only see him going up.

BloodyTjeul,1,thenetherlands,czjvyvg,0,t3_43n0en,"&gt; Lees een boek over geopolitiek zoals ""The grand chessboard"" en je ziet gewoon haarfijn uitgelegd hoe het Westen langzaam eerst economisch (EU), dan militair (NAVO) opschuift richting Rusland. In die context is dit dus wel degelijk een opmaat naar toetreding.

Sorry, maar Oekraïne komt zoals het er nu voorstaat niet bij de EU als lidstaat. De EU heeft voldoende instrumenten tot haar beschikking (criteria van Kopenhagen) om lidmaatschap af te wenden, zoals het ook doet met [andere Europese staten die onderdeel zijn van de Europese familie middels associatieverdragen](http://www.europa-nu.nl/id/vh7dosi3s1v0/kandidaat_lidstaten_en_potentiele). Overigens is het verdrag tussen Oekraïne en de EU minder verstrekkend dan zo'n [stabilisatie en associatieovereenkomst](http://www.europa-nu.nl/id/vh7doub3atzo/stabilisatie_en_associatie).

&gt; Daar komt nog eens bij dat ik er absoluut niet achter sta om Oekraïne, een door en door corrupt land waar neonazi's gewapend strijd voeren, geld en vrijstelling van visaplicht te geven. Dat ze nu toevallig op de juiste mensen schieten is fijn maar geen garantie voor de toekomst.

Een visumvrijstelling houdt in dat er vrij gereisd mag worden, voor een werkvisum moet een aparte aanvraag ingediend worden. Los daarvan zijn er geloof ik een hoop mits en maren aan verbonden. Die corruptie poogt de EU juist te bestrijden middels het associatieverdrag. De EU heeft immers belang bij transparante, stabiele buurlanden als partners. Daarom gaat zij dergelijke verdragen aan met haar buurlanden. Je laatste zin begrijp ik niet.

&gt; Ik zou liever betere banden met de Russen hebben, de Amerikanen willen er niets van weten omdat die liever de wereld domineren maar uiteindelijk wonen wij toch meer naast de Russen dan zij (jaja de USA grenst aan Rusland maar ze wonen toch vooral hier in Europa). Ik zie Oekraïne liever als een buffer tussen Rusland en de EU.

De EU grenst middels de Baltische staten en Finland al direct aan Rusland. De betrekkingen tussen de EU en Rusland zullen bovendien niet bepaald verbeteren indien ervoor gekozen wordt om de Oekraïners aan hun lot over te laten. 

Maar het is je goed recht om te denken in termen van invloedssferen en bufferstaten. Rusland opereert immers ook zo. Nu de handen aftrekken van Oekraïne is echter wel een grove inconsistentie met het overige nabuurschapsbeleid van de EU.

sunagainstgold,73,AskHistorians,czjw9q8,0,t3_43ogwa,"A fun feature of structural oppression like sexism and racism is the way it is so pliable to the needs and desires of those who hold power. So in medieval and early modern Europe, whenever we see women exercising power from a position of authority, we should ask ""who benefits?""

Medieval (being the incubator of the Tudor period) laws tended to develop step-by-step through *cases*, particular circumstances whether actual or theoretical. In England, there was never a blanket prohibition on women inheriting land, titles, or a throne. Instead, there were an overlapping series of laws and social customs that led to the general exclusion of women from office--think of the barricade in Les Miserables built of furniture and rubble rather than a solid Berlin Wall. It would take very special circumstances to break through the accumulated barrier.

In the case of noble titles, the major factors inhibiting women from holding them in her own right were coverture combined with marriage rates, and inheritance laws/practices. In coverture, women could inherit property in Tudor England, but if they were married control of that property passed to their husbands. They held any attached titles and sat in Parliament *jure uxoris*, by law of wife. 

Barbara Harris calculates a stunning 94% marriage rate for aristocratic women during 1450-1550. This had two effects. First, it meant that very, very few noblewomen could hold titles on their own. Second, it meant fathers with the choice of how to distribute land among their heirs would be less likely to will titled land to their daughters, since it would leave the family. Family allegience, as we will see, played a key factor in women's exclusion from and achievement of positions of authority.

It is often pointed out that widowhood offered *some* widows the chance to exercise authority in their own right as head of household, *if* they did not remarry. But this was no automatic guarantee. Actual laws varied based on locality. The generous ones allotted widows one-third of the husband's estate. In less friendly dioceses, noblemen's wills are known to specify that their widows can inherit *the clothing they wore while the husband was alive*. That's right, *that's* how deep coverture went. Women didn't legally own their own clothes.

Noblemen in their wills would be much more likely to pass titles on to sons than their widows, again to maintain the title within their families. (If the widow remarried, remember, her title would pass to her new husband through coverture/jure uxoris). So by all these overlapping factors, women were *in practice* excluded from noble titles, if they were not excluded by law.

Now, there are exceptions: Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury; Anne Boleyn, Marquesse of Pembroke. At this point, we enter into the wonderful world of Henry VIII and his wives. Pole was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon when she was married to Henry's brother Arthur; 1504 found her newly widowed, impoverished, and living in a convent. When Henry married his dead brother's wife, and she once more merited a full English court, Pole returned to service. A specific act of parliament--in exchange for a solid payment to the crown, of course--transferred back one portion of her dead husband's land to her, including the Salisbury title. As for Boleyn, that was basically a fiat of Henry's to honor his new beloved.

100% of titled-in-their-own-right peeresses in 16th century England were beheaded.

Was the position of queenship, or rather female kingship, any different? England never wanted a queen regnant. It had faced the question less than a century after its post-Norman rebirth, as Matilda (or Maud) and Stephen duked it out for the throne during that other English civil war. The compromise solution that managed to restore peace set an uneasy precedent. Stephen would reign until his death, but then the throne would pass *through* Matilda to her son.

We see again the importance of *cases* and *precedent*. England's claim to the throne of France--still cherished in Henry VIII's England--rested on inheritance *through* Isabella to Edward. Henry's own reign depended on inheritance *through* Margaret Beaufort to Henry VII.

And that was how it was supposed to be. Women can transmit the right to rule, but not rule themselves. So Henry was *frantic* to have a son, a legitimate heir--and he did! The Third Succession Act of 1543 combined with Henry's will essentially restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession to throne, but *after* their younger brother Edward. Henry had every expectation that the throne would pass to Edward and then to his sons. Scholars generally see the passage of the Act and the provision in Henry's will as coming in large part from the influence of his final wife, Catherine Parr.

Unfortunately for Henry's grand plan, Edward found himself sick, childless, and Protestant. According to law, the succession should pass to his sister Mary, and the 1547 Treason Act prohibited him from altering it (interfering with the line of succession). But there was a big, big problem: Mary was Catholic.

Edward (and his closest advisors) was adamant that the throne not pass to a Catholic. That included his sister Mary, but it also included all close male cousins. So Edward and his circle enacted a few provisions that they hoped would circumvent the Treason Act and ruled that the succession would pass through the (as-yet-unborn) ""heirs male"" of Frances Brandon's eldest daughter (as she had no sons).

But Fortune is a fickle goddess, and Edward died before Brandon's daughter Jane had had time to have a son. A last-ditch measure changed the wording of the law to insert Lady Jane *and* heirs male. And so a queen regnant ascended to the throne of England.

Rather than a temporary bulwark for a male Protestant English kingship, however, Jane Grey's ascension was an opening for the Catholic supporters of Mary. The Tudor daughter unquestionably held the ""public's"" allegience, going back to support for her spurned mother Catherine, and there was a strong pro-Catholic party in an England which was still making up its confessional mind. Against Edward, Mary's supporters had had little ground. But now the issue was queen versus queen: Mary's sex was not the barrier that John Knox's *First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women* had wanted it to be.

Mary, too, died relatively young and childless, and at this point the succession was (a) clear and (b) not something people wanted to mess with, given the tragic fate of Jane Grey. So Elizabeth took the throne, and made Knox--an erstwhile Protestant ally!--pay for his little first blast. And a nation that by all signs never wanted a queen regnant found itself, thanks to legal precedent, the Reformation, and a preponderance of X chromosomes in the gene pool, ruled three times in a row by queens.

33% of queens regnant over sixteenth-century England were beheaded, which is a slight improvement over their noble counterparts. ",europe,False,t3_43ogwa,,73,t5_2ssp3,False,1454348099,0,1458221789,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe

From what I've read, that 2-3% difference is due to greater numbers of women in the elderly age cohort which skews the overall average.  Up until around age 40-50 or so, there are more men for each age group.

sunagainstgold,7,AskHistorians,czjwrbr,0,t3_43ord1,"It often looks to us like medieval Europeans were confused about what Islam ""actually was."" A handful of scholars in the west did make an attempt to understand it for the purpose of countering its arguments to demonstrate why Christianity was superior. However, what we see especially in more popular texts like *Roland* is a range of different portrayals that...well, don't really resemble Islam. Some of this was because they didn't know, some of it was because they didn't care enough to know, and some of it was because there were conventions of what made someone ""evil"" or ""bad"", and if Muslims were evil and wrong, then Muslims surely fit into those conventions.

With *Roland's* ""unholy trinity"" of Mahomet, Apollo, and Termagant, two things are at work. First, the poem portrays Islam as the anti-Christianity. If Christianity has a Trinity that is its one God, Islam has a reverse trinity that is its *false* gods. 

Second, the choice of Apollo is a deliberate reference to--as you point out--Greco-Roman paganism. In the medieval Christian mindset, that meant worshiping idols of rock and gold. The idea here is to portray Muslims as idolators. You could see a vague reference to the Kabaa, which medieval Christian polemic portrays Muslims as *worshipping*, or that could just be a 'deep background' that the *Roland* poet wasn't directly aware of, but influenced the stories he had heard about Muslims.

The choice of specifically *Greco-Roman* gods was a long-burning development in medieval literature. It tied Muslims to the pagan Romans that Christianity had defeated, carrying the promise that Christians would defeat this new threat, too.",europe,False,t3_43ord1,,7,t5_2ssp3,False,1454348795,0,1458222019,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe

Nowadays more and more cashless transactions are handled and banking secrecy by European legislation and separate treaties are less relevant. In 2009 the tax authorities in many countries outside Europe have signed new treaties making it increasingly difficult for their savings in order to evade tax. When it is already saved anonymously, you will still be charged interest by withholding tax.

From 2010 the voluntary disclosure scheme is retrenched and has increased the fine for black savings.

They recruited both MtF and FtM transsexual volunteers and measured their brain volumes in several ways both before and after 4 months of HRT. The result?
The ﬁndings suggest that treatment of MFs with estrogens and anti-androgens decreases the male brain size towards female proportions, whereas treatment of FMs with androgens (not substantially affecting circulating estrogen levels) increases the female brain size towards male proportions. The magnitude of this change (i.e. 31 ml over a 4-month period) is striking, since it signiﬁes a decrease in brain volume, which is at least ten times the average decrease of around 2.5 ml per year in healthy adults (16).""",,False,t3_43npez,,0,t5_2r4b9,False,1454350545,0,1458222610,

There are some things that are going to surprise you about F1 in Europe as compared to NA.  However, there is nothing like watching these cars bottom out heading up Eau Rough towards 200 MPH.  

If you do choose to go to Spa here is my unfiltered advice as an asshole american tourist:

•	The views and the race are amazing; you’ll have a great time rain or shine.

•	In general the area is gorgeous and if you enjoy nature and the outdoors it is really hard to beat.

•	I will remember the race for and the time we spent there for the rest of my life, it was a definite bucket list item.

•	The fans in general are polite and well mannered, but there is a lot of drinking.

•	Speak French, Dutch or maybe German.  You'll be in rural Belgium; English really is not well understood there.
  
•	Cash will make your life way easier at the food vendors.  However the souvenir and team booths all take credit and we had no issues with our NA credit cards there.

•	Other than no privacy out-door urinals and a few poorly maintained chemical toilets be prepared to pay to us the toilets.  Have change (not hard if you’re using cash), be patient and make sure your wife is prepared for that culture shock. 

•	Unless you’re going to spring for VIP, Spa feels a lot more like a three-day rock concert (think Burning Man, Dave Mathews Tour, Warp Tour ETC) than a “high class” F1 race as it is branded in NA.

•	Be prepared to walk.  A LOT.  I'm talking at least 4 to 5 KM up and down hill from the parking to your car. This is with ""decent"" paid parking.  The things that make Spa beautiful also make it a bitch to walk at.  Lots of hills, you’ve been warned. 

•	Traffic in town is HORRIBLE on practice / race days.  Get there early if you plan on picking up your tickets and learn the layout of the town ahead of time.  Generally the ticket pickup is across the street from hotel in town.

•	The food sucks, bring your own otherwise I hope you like Fritas.

gothype,1,europe,czjyloz,0,t3_43ocuy,"&gt; Most of the trade agreements that the UK wants are either already established by for the EU, or being negotiated as we speak. I hardly think that those countries would value trade with the UK over trade with the continent spanning EU.

The problem with this is that trade agreements in certain sectors which would benefit us are/will be left out or restricted due to other nations competing priorities. As an example, the priorities of France re: the French language means that there will be a cultural exemption in TTIP. That's clearly bad for the UK, and it would be both in the UK and the USA's interest in a mutually negotiated trade agreement to have agreement on this due to the shared language. Food imports is another area we'll suffer in part due to other EU nations sensibilities around their own farming industries. 

Leaving aside the USA (the top country we export to) which is a somewhat special case due to it's size - the EU is not even currently negotiating with Australia or New Zealand with which a lack of tariffs on cultural exports would be excellent, China which has a rapidly growing middle class that love European products (c.f https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exporting-to-china/exporting-to-china)

This obviously has to be balanced, however, against the instability of walking away from an FTA with harmonised standards and a large economy already. Whether it's worth taking the economic risk is another thing. It's worth pointing out though that one of the things we do best today, the service industries, is hugely held back within the EU FTA at the moment anyway, which is why they're currently proposing [new rules](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/services/index_en.htm)

&gt; The UK has been a source of interest to the US due to its relationship with the EU. Barak Obama even said ""Having the UK in the EU gives us much greater confidence about the strength of the transatlantic union"" and that ""We want to make sure that the United Kingdom continues to have that influence."" Leaving the EU would degrade our alliance with the USA.

Frankly, I don't think there's much of an alliance left. Obama in particular has degraded any relationship we did have, but I don't think there's been any real mutual benefit for the UK since Thatcher left power - since then we've just been a subservient partner.

&gt; Destabilising the EU also seems to be the aim of other, outside powers (I'm looking at you, Russia and America) and in the end it could be they that hold most influence inside Europe, not the EU or the UK.

If we leave the EU, I'm not really that concerned about the stability of it. If we're in it however, it's obviously in our interest to make it as stable as possible. I'd rather take a neutral outsider position if we left.

At the end of the day, for me, I don't feel any particular cultural attachment to any countries Europe in any way, so that argument is never going to sway me. I don't feel I share any particular bond with a French person, much as I like visiting France, and I definitely share less culturally with an Italian person than with an Australian or American person. If we left the EU and had no travel agreement... travelling would be a bit slower, but it's never been a problem for me to travel to other non-EU countries, so I doubt it would be that much different *with* EU countries if we did leave.

In rest, pufaiala maxima fara repercusiuni - ceea ce imi convine, fiind la randu-mi fumator de baterii. 

Cu toate astea, insa, avem de-a face cu o lege cu un efect benefic, dar teribil de prost gandita/scrisa. Trecand de faptul ca legiferatorii nostri au maturitatea politica a asistentei lu' Capatos si ca au ignorat complet chestiuna diferentierii prin taxare, trecand si peste faptul ca tocmai le-am dat girul, ca societate, unor penibili ilegitimi si adesea analfabeti sa treaca o lege groaznic de restictiva si, tehnic, la fel de intruziva ca fumatul SH, trebuie sa realizam ca astfel de legi ar trebui analizate la rece, nu manate de un heirup colectiv neinformat si de urechismul juridic al nostru, al populatiei generale. 

Inca o data, legea are un scop bun (de a proteja nefumatorii si, in acelasi timp, de a descuraja aparitia de noi cancerosi autodeterminati), dar faptul ca interzice implicit organizarea de spatii destinate exclusiv celor interesati sa faca cancer ""pe persoana fizica"" este nedemocratic. Mai mult, faptul ca tigarile electronice sunt interzise doar in cateva contexte arata ca avem de-a face cu un text de lege scos din cur. Repet: fumez electronica, dar in baza a ce au stabilit alesii ca acest tip de instrument de fumat ar justifica o incadrare mai ""light"" decat tigarile conventionale, tinand cont de faptul ca studiile disponibile pana acum pe subiect sunt stiintific inconcludente din pricina faptului ca nu s-au putut urmari efectele pe termen lung (20 - 30 de ani)?

Drept urmare, avem o lege pe care o tot ridicam in slavi pentru ca ne convine efectul implicit in ciuda imperfectiunilor majore si evidente ale acesteia si ajungem sa ne multumim cu ea, asa sluta cum e, ba chiar sa ne-o si asumam ca fiind o victorie!

Eu zic c-ar trebui sa avem (sau sa ne dezvoltam) maturitatea democratica de a cere proiecte de lege mai complexe, mai nuantate si mai inteligente din partea legiferatorilor sau, daca e sa admitem ca atat pot, macar sa nu le mai purtam cu mandrie stindardul incompetentei.

Anything which shows as more than 3days to ship = do not order. It tends to be a guess when they will get the next shipment in or if they get it at all. You could end up waiting ages for it to even ship if you order anything with over 3days processing time.

Pay for better shipping, you cannot opt to go with free shipping from around the world then complaining it takes ages. It's like $1-2 for whichever is the best shipping method for your country.

If you are ordering multiple things, split the order up based on processing time, everything which ships next day in one order, everything which ships in 3days in another, its also recommended to put batteries in a separate order. This helps to stop one item delaying your entire order.

I've ordered once from the EU warehouse and got the product after 10days of it shipping.

ABProsper,1,news,czk0tsn,0,t3_43jvxc,"&gt;Because you don't help people just because you will benefit from it.

Well that isn't true at all. The ""good feelings"" are the benefit as is the social posturing and public display of how good a person you are. You are benefiting at  the cost of many of your countrymen . You are welcome to do that but its also a public statement that you don't give a damn about what they want. That is pretty risky since all human nature is tribal. 

 &gt;That's like taxi drivers getting mad at uber drivers. If a company found a way to reduce costs kudos to them.

I'm undecided but there are many good reason thatoperations like Uber  should be banned, Also wages are consumption. If wages go lower they get poorer and society gets poorer.  Wealth concentration is a public detriment , if it wasn't Europe would not have embraced Social Democracy as a solution Lower wages make social democracy harder to do. Anyway businesses exists only to serve the public good anyway, they are granted privileges to do so . They are not ""people"" outside of a ludicrous American fiction. when they stop serving the public good with say wage arbitrage or excess layoffs that harm the social fabric, regulation is the job of the State. Its best to regulate lightly when possible but regulation is a must.

&gt;Yeah just like right now migrants are not safe because crazies are going to see this news story and use it to justify violent acts against migrants.

You need to read more about migrant crime. Compared to domestic rates its very very high. Also migrants fail the cost benefit analysis. You or your cronies may want to feel better about helping others but forcing people to accept outsiders is theft of someone else's cultural heritage. Its harmful. Help your own people first. and not 'the people of the world"" are not your people. The people where you were born or now live are. Of course if you are a Leftists you can't see that, I feel compassion for you since you are missing part of what it means to be human. Hell even the refugees get that and as such are far better off than any Leftist could be. 

&gt;Now what about the refugees you ask? Well what of them? They are not European people and its not a given that Europe or the US is responsible for any other people . we might think so in some twisted Protestantism but its foolish to invite in ingrates

&gt;I can't speak for Canada . The US would have been  without much of its  European immigrants after 1800 or so .Our culture originally English (mostly) was heavily effected by immigration from Germany and elsewhere . This was acceptable since well Germans  and the others are orderly and hard working are but the later European immigrants while not a terrible determent  were not necessary. 

Eastern Europeans tend to come from low trust cultures, I don't have any issue with them but the US doesn't need more people or consumers, we could easily have stayed at 1980 levels and prospered for it

More recently Asian immigrants are mostly of moderate value since the majority of them are not scientists and African and Hispanic immigrants are a net drain. Mexicans and Arabs  with an average IQ of 95  or Africans with an 85 or so  are unlikely to be a huge social boon. Its also harmful to homogeneity which is the foundation of a healthy society.

Diversity is inherently a bad thing. 

Now immigration wise gI ask only 7 things 

1 Be skilled 

2  Speak English 

3 Have Western values 

4 Be healthy 

5 Be natal so we can reap the long term benefits 

6 Be hard working 

7 Have an IQ of 120 or more. 

If you meet these criteria , please apply and move here, If not, stay home, 

This will allow  non Whites which I am totally fine with. Quality counts here and these are off the top of my head the 7 best qualities,

I would say you have too many spells and are probably having trouble with AP. You really need [Hergbrashs Binding](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/hergbrashs-binding) so that you can just infinite channel disintegrate. If you can't get that yet, switch Magic Weapon to Conduit. 

You'll also probably want to get rid of Diamond Skin and use Energy Armor - Energy Tap for more resource. You can also use Ice Armor - Crystallize as well. 

Get rid of blizzard and use Familiar - Arcanot (for AP issues), if not use Familiar - Sparkflint.

Get rid of Magic Missile and use Teleport - Safe Passage

For your Black Hole you need to switch to Blazar instead of Spell Steal, but I would recommend using Energy Twister - Gale Force instead, especially if you can find [Ranslors Folly](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/item/ranslors-folly) or Meteor - Meteor Shower

The government isn't a jobs program and we shouldn't be subsidizing these low paying jobs directly through welfare programs and indirectly through higher insurance costs. Looking are Europe (which is just as flawed as we are) you don't see wal-marts, as many retail stores, or restaurants as you do in the US. I think that has to do with the high European labor cost. 

While raising the minimum wage will in the short term raise unemployment. I think in the long term the economy will do better without the massive market intervention these subsidies represent. 

I think the corporate tax rate should be 100%. However, that should come with a 100% deduction for operating expenses including all labor costs and a 100% deduction for cap ex. This would encourage companies to invest people and capital rather than pandering wall street, which got us where we are today.

The only European battleship afaik to carry 16-inch guns is Nelson, built all the way back in the 1920's (I know Lion-class was slated to carry the same 9x 16 inch battery before they were canceled). Meanwhile the US built 10 battleships with 9x 16 inch rifles, including the North Carolina's and South Dakotas that displaced much less then Vanguard/Bismark, not to mention Yamato of course, which is on an entirely different scale in terms of gunpower.

A really clear comparison is Bismark/Vanguard vs the IJN Nagato-class. Nagato is 15,000 tons lighter and is almost 20 years older, yet ostensibly carries a more powerful main battery (8x 16 inch guns vs 8x 15 inch guns).",,1454356405,t1_czjz3mu,,8,t5_2tg3p,False,1454356163,0,1458224606,

IAmFrankCamberlain,10,belgium,czk390y,0,t3_43ovq7,"&gt; 1) What I would actually like to know is what's wrong with the Belgian justice system and how to fix it, 

The legislation gets too complex, there are too many gaps leading to different interpretations. Moreover all courts and tribunals are understaffed in particular the administrative support section is understaffed. Consequently magistrates (example: criminal investigative judges and their clerks) are overburdened with executive administration work which of course has a negative effect on their core business. 

How to fix it? Spend enough money to recruit administration staff. 

&gt;I'd like to ask if you, in the European context that you now operate, know of European countries that DID manage to handle something like the informatisation of their justice department correctly, and maybe some insight on what are the main elements of doing something like that successfully.

I'm sorry but this question exceeds my knowledge. 

&gt; 2) Then for the second question, I don't know if you've ever seen the documentary ""bitter lake"" it's a historical overview of western involvement in Afghanistan and also delves deeper into the disconnect between our vision of a place like afghanistan and the complex reality on the ground, and how that basically prevents actual growth or peace taking root, no matter how many billions you pour into ""reconstruction"". What are some surprising insights you've come to,regarding that disconnect, our vision vs the reality?

First of all one should understand that Afghanistan is theocratic country with a supremacy of the Islam. I remember that I asked an Afghan audience how they could possibly reconcile human rights adopted in their constitution with the application of the Sharia in case of a hudood crime (one of the seven crimes against Allah himself in which case the judge may apply the Sharia, ex: adultery), knowing that the sentence could be death by stoning or amputation of limbs. 

I said ""your constitution forbids cruel and degrading treatment and torture"" and yet you apply such sentences. The answer? The constitution is not our first legal source, the Sharia is.  

It will be obvious that in such a situation cultural changes towards a more open society are very difficult to realize. Furthermore the corruption of government officials  in Afghanistan was a massive problem. In fact the situation corresponded with the explanation that former NATO Secretary General Joseph Luns gave to a journalist when asked to define in short the assistance to ""under developed countries"". Mind you this terminology is no longer accepted since we now speak of ""young democracies"". But in that time Luns answered: ""The assistance to under developed countries is when poor people from rich countries give money to rich people in poor countries"". It is a sad thing to say but I've known this to be a reality in Afghanistan. ",,False,t1_czjxkvd,,10,t5_2qhe6,False,1454357816,0,1458225163,

scattershot22,1,BasicIncome,czk45as,0,t3_43jjwb,"&gt; about the gap between a high school grad and a phd. 

That figure is significant because it says that, on balance, our system is equitable and fair. Yes, there are some at the edges of the low end getting screwed, and some at the edges of the high end getting unjustified money. But on balance, the system is quite fair. 

&gt; The part that concerns me is the percentage of income and wealth that goes to .1% of people. The difference between even a dentist in the 1% say 300k or so compared to the average .01% of about 1.7 mil is massive let alone the guy sitting at 35K.

So what? If the guy earning $1.7M has created $5M in wealth for his employer, is his high salary wrong? 

And why worry about the 0.01%? Every year it's a different list of folks. It's not the same people over and over. It's constantly changing. It's the most successful among us. It's like complaining that the vertical jump of the NBA improves every year, while the rest of the population sucks at jumping. The NBA is BY DEFINITION the best vertical jumpers. Of course it gets better every year. But that doesn't mean that the best vertical jump from 5 years ago is still a top vertical jumper. He's not. He had his 2 years in the sun, and was replaced by someone else. 

&gt;I think a BI should sit at 12K per year per adult. I don't want to give people a comfortable living doing nothing I want enough for food and rent and maybe heat depending on the person.We will still need people to work and contribute for the forseeable future. 

But you are creating value of productivity with that money you have given away. In the end, your purchasing power is a function of the value you create. If we multiply everyone's salary by 10, then the cost of an iphone and rent goes up 10X too. 

In order for someone get get more purchasing power, they have to create more value. 

Or, you have to take it from someone else. But taking it from someone else is the same as taxing that person. You might believe that a massive tax on high earners isn't harmful. But there's plenty of data that says it is. You need only look at long term economic growth between Europe and the US. 

&gt;Did Bill Gates or George Soros work hard and take risks? Absolutely! Is it unfair to expect a 55% tax rate on income above 1.5 mil for those two to issue a guaranteed income to everyone? 

Just curious, but take your average guy earning $5M from work. What tax rate do you think he's paying in a city like LA or NYC?

A refusal to do a message cake which is founded on illegal discrimination (cf. refusing to write ""Jai Guru Dev"" on a Sikh holiday cake) should be punishable.

As to B, I don't understand your point.  You offered the example of a travel agent who doesn't offer a service in the first place (trips to Siberia) being accused of discrimination if he refuses to put such a trip together for members of Group X. If he doesn't offer the service at all (clearly his choice) then his refusal is neutral and nondiscriminatory.

Today in Europe this is 20 weeks, with exceptions for health of the mother and viability of the pregnancy.  In the US, it's 24 weeks.  A full pregnancy is 40 weeks.

kilikki,3,european,czk7xac,0,t3_43opr8,"""cheap"" loans, good interest rates. Stop taking the refugees in, no more loans. 

Money from interest needs to be paid by with even more loans. Pay even more of your GDP as interest to the banks. Take more loan to fund even basic structures of the society, pay interests, take more loan. Take more loan now, pay up later. Pay interests. It is silly to not take more loan when it is given with such good terms and low interest rates. Surely we need more loan? Pay up the interests. Take more loan to pay us back.

When everybody is basically held ransom by the banks in indebted servitude, is it even possible to have real democracy anymore? did we ever have? The moment the debtors decide to stop lending more money the whole of Europe will tumble down like a house of cards. Just look at Greece, the bankers gladly helped them cook their books so that they could get more of that tasty cheap €uro loan, and now the country is a shit. just shit. It will take decades for them to get back up to what they were. Then there is the sweden, its a Laboratory of sorts, of a grand experience of what uncontrolled illegal immigration does to a country. A sign of things to come for the rest of the Europe. Who would have thought a few decades ago, that a country, by many meters one of the best and successful countries in the world would turn into a third world hellhole by the 2030? I certainly didn't think like that even a year before, that report was a rude awakening for me, sweden that far gone already.

As a species we are nothing to the truly rich, less than cockroaches.  Just a resource to be used and depleted at the right time. The WW1 saw the old powers of the Europe decline, while the United States become the bank of the world. Dealing with both sides of the conflict, they racked in hundreds of years worth of the brightest civilizations wealth, and of course cheap loans. 

Loans that were so cheap that the people say ushered the second world war twenty years later, and finalized the fate of the Europe. Perhaps the biggest fall was that of the UK, they controlled nearly a third of the globe. a fucking third! that is insane! and now its all gone, UK is just a pawn of the USA. a pitiful lapdog, eager to please his master. the rest of the europe is just in equally pitiful state.

What you don't understand is that in the USA the entire government isn't dominated by party politics as is typical in Europe because we are a Federation of 50 individual States under a Federal umbrella, with a strong history of independence.  The US Civil War was fought exactly over the rights of individual States to sovereign government. 

The States make their own laws and what Republicans in New York push for may be entirely different than what ones in Alabama push for because of the different constituencies in each state.   

The system is designed so that Alabamans can't effect laws in New York, except where those laws are applied to the entire country on the Federal level.  For instance, until recently, gay marriage was legal in some states and illegal in others.  That is a situation that typically never happens in European countries because you have no sovereign divisions in your countries. 

In a very real way, the States themselves are the entities that vote in the Federal elections, rather than the people directly.  Every state sends Congressional representatives to the Federal government, the number of which is determined by population.  But each State also sends exactly two Senators to the House which is designed as a check against rule by the majority. ",,False,t1_czk2opb,,1,t5_2qh13,False,1454364954,0,1458227561,

Lui pour le coup c'était la première fois qu'il jouait dans une chapelle et il a trouvé l'idée vraiment cool, et il a adoré.

Son rapport à l'argent est intéressant aussi. Il vend son spectacle pas cher du tout pour pouvoir le jouer beaucoup. Il ne prend pas un cachet à la hauteur de sa notoriété et il est pas loin de jouer à perte quelques fois. Il en a limite rien à foutre parce qu'il ne fait pas ça pour l'argent.

Great post.  Exactly what most people miss in these conversations.  Most people would hate pure capitalism or pure socialism.  American capitalism and European socialism are both hybrids of each other.

Most people want some form of a freeish market, some social services, some government regulation, and know these require some form of taxation.  The argument is really in the details of how much of each and where to draw the line.

Bernie supporters don't want some crazy, Venezuelan socialism.  We mostly want increases social services with a small uptick in the progressive tax rate on high earners.

SlimeStack,2,StarWars,czkavq6,0,t3_43r6tj,"I've been reading tons of Star Wars on Marvel Unlimited and there's some great things on here. Let's see if I can remember all the series...

**Old EU**

* Star Wars Infinities - 3 comics based on each of the original trilogy films that shows an alternate route based on a change in one single event e.g. what if Luke failed to blow up the Death Star? Nothing groundbreaking here, but they're fun reads.

* Thrawn Trilogy - originally a novel, so I don't know if this comic adaptation is better or worse, but it's a fantastic trilogy that functions as an alternative sequel to the OT.

* Invasion Trilogy - seems to be set in an era covered in one of the novels, focusing on different character. Great if you want to get a taste of what things could have been like if TFA didn't exist.

* Knights of the Old Republic - I'm only a few issues into this one but it's good so far. The art is great. If you like this era at all this should tickle your fancy.

* Splinter of the Mind's Eye - adaptation of a novel... a really bad one. It's essentially the sequel ANH would have gotten if it wasn't popular enough to get Empire and Jedi and you just shouldn't read this...

* The Star Wars - a gorgeous series based on the original draft for the first film. This is the version that never actually made it to the big screen, so it's very rough, but the art is fantastic and it's very interesting to see the kinds of things George Lucas had come up with at that stage.

**New EU**

Basically just read all of them. It's still new enough that there aren't that many. *Star Wars* and *Darth Vader* are the main on-going series, the former placing the rebels in the leading role while the latter is all about Vader. They're set on the same timeline and they cross over, so you should read both.

Kanan, Lando and Shattered Empire are great too. Leia is a bit meh and I've heard bad things about Chewbacca.

As for novels, I'm half way through Takin and that's a great read if you like the character and want to know more about the Tarkin-Vader-Palpatine relationships.",,False,t3_43r6tj,,2,t5_2qi4s,False,1454368831,0,1458228806,

RandyLiddell,1,germany,czkbb1j,0,t3_43rbf2,"*I used Google translate because of excessive laziness*

I've had enough now finally with violent refugees / asylum seekers! Before my eyes, a young woman was first molested in the subway, then was rioted. Old men who wanted to intervene were attacked!

After weeks and months full of bad experiences I can not control myself easily. I must now publicly express my opinion finally.

Just now it is again escalated, the center of Munich, in broad daylight. I climbed the Sendlinger Tor in the metro Hauptbahnhof. I sat down in a four-seater, opposite a young lady. In four behind her were two refugees. One of them, a young man, probably of Arab origin, they harassed apparently. I noticed it immediately when I saw her expression. He said ""Why do not you answer me in German?"" And she replied ""Because you asked me in English."" I think he had his hand on her back. She turned away and looked in my direction. Since the beginning, I stared at the young man in order to signal to him that I watch.

As the train drove off, hit the asylee with full force against the disc. He was probably angry that the woman had not let him. Several older men shouted that he should stop.

One of these men, who sat in the quad to the left of me was of a third asylum touched suddenly (with orange brown jacket) at the top. He stroked his bald head to mock him. Such disrespect I've only rarely seen ...
I was and am of the opinion that the third party did not belong to the other two. They spoke neither before nor after one another and were separated. He felt at ease only belong because of other asylum seeker was admonished - and not at all suited him.

As was the older gentleman in the bald head touched, he got up immediately. The asylee stood on the seats, walked over to the man and grabbed him by the neck. Everyone stood up immediately, many went in between. Since I had my cell phone in my hand, I was filming and stood just two meters away. I was determined to intervene, if necessary. My heart was racing. When the men went between them, read from the attacker of the old gentleman and fell back into his four-seater. Now there were four asylum seekers before us and made us angry stare and met two other gentlemen. I said that they should behave. Besides and behind me were about 10-15 people. The situation was under control. The train arrived at the Central Station. I called that I call the police. The other shouted that they should get out and they did. I did not call the police because I was told several times by friends that the police themselves become victims said ""We can not do anything!"".

Unfortunately you can only see a small part of what is happening in the video, but I just feel the need to share this.

The rest of us went on and talked about the incident and the overall situation. The people were very frightened. An elderly lady said that you do not even now can daytime before the door. She goes in the evening did not leave the house. Two gentlemen said that it can not go on like this.

Another two or three years ago, I felt much more secure in my native Germany. Your not? I find that frightening and sad.

We give 1-2 million stranger safety, which I find very beautiful and socially. Less nice however I think that we thus lose a lot of our own security, as recent events show throughout Europe.

I'm really sorry for the really needy people who suffer from the reputation of the mass and the prejudices, but it needs something to happen against the violent and disrespectful people among them! Many asylum seekers have no respect for women, no respect for men, not even in front of the Old - let alone in front of our laws and the police.

I'm all for helping people from war-torn countries. We would also want to help, if we were in their place. But we must not tolerate any disrespect, no violence and ignoring our laws and mores! We want to maintain our security in Europe! Every asylum seeker should be expelled from Germany in the first offense; for the safety of the people who want a peaceful life in a constitutional state. In Germany there are laws to which everyone must keep, no matter where it comes from.

Because of this, people didn't care for education that much as it didn't assure them an easier life and better paying job after school. Today, we have too many people over 45 or so, that chose a lifestyle that would've guaranteed them an averagely nice lifestyle and no worries in the past. But times have changed and labourers get the minimum wage now which is not a lot. Especially if you have kids. This has lead to alcohol abuse and everything else mostly associated with us.

It didn't run amok in the EU tho, but in the US.  Where there was less safe guards and what have you.  Yet the EU got hit harder than that of the US.  And despite the EU having way more social programs its economy has not surpassed the US's.  Heck even if you took say California and compared it to the EU, California will still come out head and it has more social programs than the US but less than that of the EU.

That's a bullshit argument. When two places sell the the same items and one sells for less than the other, the one selling for less has to have considerably worse service or other disincentives for people to stop going there. Too many economic studies come to that same conclusion. At least in the U.S.

Interestingly enough this is an effect of the U.S. driving society. Because you have to get in your car and drive somewhere, you tend to optimize as many stops out of the process as possible. Walmart is very effective at this by the wide range of products they carry, and many tend to have gas stations on site too.

I immagine that with two conflicting interests in a body count I'm certainly not going to believe the very conservative estimate of civilian casualties by the Israeli government, so they can say ""See, no genocide!"" If the majority of casualties in Operation Protective Edge were civilian **which they were** and inflicted by the IDF, the most logical reasoning for this would be to accept that they were not avoiding civilian casualties. Also there is no evidence to suggest that Hamas ever used human shields. While there is overwhelming evidence that Israel *did*. 

&gt;It is just to show the hypocrisy of people like yourself who hold Israel to a different standard than anyone else in the world. Israel is the only nation held to such a high standard that they are expected to roll over and die rather than fight back against a bunch of religious lunatics trying to murder every last Jew.

Except no one is holding Israel to a different standard. The world considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization and Israel to be a legitimate government. Why would anybody *not* hold a government to a higher standard than a terrorist organization. The world is holding Israel to the standard of other legitimate governments. The world condemns Hamas. The only people who compare Israel to Hamas are Israelis. 

&gt;No, they are relevant because there are 150 million Russian citizens who are suffering from sanctions yet you aren't riled up about that. It is a clear sign of your hypocrisy and obsession with Israel.

I was riled up about it when it was in the news, but it no longer is. Why when Israel is criticized you Zionists like to point out some other problem in the world? It’s the most suspicious behavior when you are doing something wrong and then point out somebody else’s wrongdoing. 

&gt;The sanctions are the same as a blockade... 

I’m sorry but you don’t know what a blockade is. A blockade is a military force physically preventing someone else from trading with them. All of the countries currently sanctioning Russia right now did so of their own free will because they were unhappy with Russian international affairs, America didn’t make them. On the other hand plenty of countries did not carry out sanctions against Russian, and most of them would be easily squashed by the US military. So I think it’s fair to say that there is no “force” making other countries sanction Russia. 

&gt;Then why is there no mention of it in your comment history?...

If you go back far enough there will be, because I have made comments about it. Just like an Israeli, to be spying on everyone though. Lol. 

&gt;Not powerful enough that it's economy hasn't plummeted.

Yeah, but they’re not on the verge of failing by any means. The Palestinian governments do not have complete control over their territories, hence why the PLO’s authority is disputed, and at this point literally have no control over Gaza, hence why Gaza is fractured and not actually completely controlled by Hamas. Your attempts to put Russia (2nd most powerful country in the world) in the same field as Palestine (fractured governments not even recognized as a state) is ludicrous. 

&gt;If they spent their billions in free aid money building roads, schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure, ...

That aid does go into building the schools and hospitals. The aid is granted by the people that actually go there and build the stuff, or at least oversee it. This is why all those schools that the IDF destroyed in 2014 were UN schools and hospitals. Nonetheless Hamas and Fatah wouldn’t have to be using it to buy weapons if Israel was not constantly invading them. And the UN wouldn’t have to be granting aid if Israel would stop destroying all of their infrastructure. 

&gt;Considering Israel is in control of the land, and someone else wants it, I would say that is disputed land. It was never Palestinian land. IT is a political contrivance to call it anything other than that, lest the Palestinians start hijacking planes again and attacking other countries. They are very good at the terrorism thing.

Really, it didn’t belong to the people that actually lived there?? Actually it belonged to people living in Europe. Yeah that makes since. 

&gt;Except international law is made up. It has no real force or effect. It is a political tool that is written after the fact to call something wrong when the international community doesn't like the outcome of their machinations. And what about arab imperialism that brought them from far away in the arabian peninsula to steal land in the levant? They are the real imperialists, trying to steal the Jewish homeland.

The international laws that Israel is breaking were ones written up before the fact. They were written in response to WWI and WWII because the world saw how ridiculously unethical they had been being. Also learn a little fucking history. I know you jews are tought your history, that’s one of the major points of the religion. The arabs didn’t exist when your ‘homeland’ was taken away from you. The Babylonians took it from the Jews. The arabs took the land from mostly pagans and allowed some jews to actually return. The most amount of Jews living in Palestine modern day Israel was greatest under Muslim rule until British Mandate era, when Zionists started flooding into Israel trying to take the land away. 

&gt;Did you not see the attacks mentioned where arabs from the west bank carried out attacks in Tel Aviv? How they got there isn't really the issue. You claimed they wouldn't be able to attack Israelis if they left the west bank and you were proven to be wrong again. I will quote them for you again.
October 8, 2015, an East Jerusalem arab stabbed 5 in Tel Aviv. http://www.timesofisrael.com/four-injured-in-tel-aviv-stabbing-attacker-killed/
November 19, 2015, 2 Israelis stabbed to death by arab resident of West Bank town of Dura.http://www.timesofisrael.com/one-israeli-dead-as-stabber-attacks-tel-aviv-office-building/
&gt;Both attackers were palestinains, not Israeli arabs. They find their way into Israel and murder regular Israelis, not ""settlers.""

“Both”. 2 criminals justify an entire war and blockades. 

&gt;It is irrelevant that the UN claims that land bought by Jews is not owned by them. The land was bought by Jews, lived on by Jews, and then cleansed of Jews. They returned and reclaimed it. It doesn't matter that you and the UN want to give their homes away to terrorists and those who support terrorism. Israel owns it and the arabs are never getting it back. Too bad. I guess that's what you get when you pick a fight you can't win.

Here you are showing your lack of empathy for an entire group of people and disregard for international law. Cliché Zionist: check. 

&gt;yes, they weren't committing acts of terrorism, right? These were just random stabbing attacks in the middle of a wave of terrorist stabbings, right? Are you so dumb you believe this or do you just have no recourse but to come up with an idiotic dismissal of the facts?

It’s an idiotic dismissal of facts to believe that *you* are able to *know* what someone was thinking before they died unless they told you. Did they tell you or is it just that you assume that they stabbed people because terrorism? 

&gt;I am just going by what you said: ""A lot more would have to die because the current number is minuscule especially in comparison to the amount of deaths of Palestinians."" You said that more Israelis need to die before you think it is ok for Israel to defend itself. 

Because as it currently is, Israelis are using crime statistics to justify full on war. They are using the actions of a few to justify the killing of an entire country. I’m not saying that they should die, I am saying that war would be an appropriate response to an actually significant amount of deaths rather than the current Israeli inflate the feelings of fear amongst the public and then wage war. 

&gt;Again, how stupid do you think everyone is? This is local crime, not terrorism? You are calling the blockade collective punishment, so that means the rocket attacks and tunnel attacks are just local crime?

I never said that the rocket attacks weren’t terrorism. I said that the knife attacks really aren’t. They are individual crimes. Also terrorism and collective punishment are not the same thing. Are you purposely misconstruing meanings of words to support your own agenda? 

 &gt;Do you not see the stupidity of claiming this isn't terrorism? Either way, you just aren't worth the time talking to but please do not misconstrue any future lack of response as agreeing with you or cowing to your arguments. You are just not worth my time because you make dumb, racist comments.

Ah yes, every critic of Israel must be a racist. How could they not see that we have the right to this land because of our ethnic superiority and our ties to a kingdom that’s been gone for 3000 years?",,False,t1_czjh1d7,,1,t5_2qh13,False,1454376484,0,1458231106,

A friend offered to Vinyl print and/or screen print a watch dial blank. 

The watch dial design is inspired by the hour/minute hand layout of the [Flieger B dial](http://www.toptime.eu/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/960x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/l/a/laco_b-muster-pilot-watch_9_.jpg) and the balanced double-numeral dial of the [instrmnt](http://i.imgur.com/Rce9fP2.jpg).
 
It looks a little naked without the watch hands, the plan is to use a 7mm hour hand and a 12mm minute hand that each reach out exactly to their respective rings on the dial. Part of the aim with the dial was to not obscure the numerals with the hands. The idea was to create a dial that could be read very easily.


Please feel free to leave your feedback, especially on:

* the dial design

* vinyl watch face durability

* a source of dial blanks other than Ofrei",,1454377279,t3_43ruf1,,1,t5_2qls5,False,1454376642,0,1458231155,
