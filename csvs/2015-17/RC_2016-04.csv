"&gt;I actually think that the UK leaving the EU won't be a death-knell for the EU project, and consider that a scare-mongering by empathy, but if I were in Varoufakis's position I'd be wanting to consolidate scetpical forces if I now knew my country was committed as Greece is.

I think we may well see a slow winding down.  If we leave the EU I can't see the Netherlands or Finland wanting to sign up for the fiscal transfer union.  I think they may leave the Euro (and perhaps the EU especially in the Netherlands case.)  Denmark and other countries on the periphery may leave the EU as well.  Malta may well do something like Monaco and leave the EU but stay in the Euro.  

The big question is the Euro crisis in southern Europe.  That has the potential to explode at any moment with France, Italy and Spain all at risk of a Greek style crisis.  That could happen now or 5-10 years from now when another recession hits.  Something like that could possibly be fixed by fiscal transfers but they'd have to be huge and create the superstate we've been expecting.  Needless to say not all countries would want to sign up.  Failing the establishment of huge fiscal transfers southern Europe would be pushed/fall out of the Euro and it would basically become Germany+.  Or it could work the other way round.  That would effectively be the end of the EU but the institutions would actually stick around for a long time, much like the League of Nations stuck around for long after it was dead and the British Empire is still around today as the Commonwealth.  

Effectively, I foresee a shrinking of the EU's multiple layers.  This will happen gradually, but also rapidly at times.  However, it all has to start with Britain leaving.  If Britain stays I fear a doubling down of the retardation.  More members joining, more integration, more fiscal transfers.  It'll still all come tumbling down but it will take a lot longer to happen and could be a lot messier.  War is unlikely but I could certainly see something like a Spanish or Greek terrorist group bombing other European countries.  

The one thing that has never happened in the history of the EU is a significant power coming back to a member state from Brussels.  The EU is terrible but it has built this amazing myth of progressivism and inevitability because it just keeps marching forward.  Britain leaving will be the Emperors no clothes moment (though it will take several years for the realisation to kick in.)  The moment everyone sees that this thing they thought was necessary and the future is actually the exact opposite.

"1. His proposals are actually quite moderate by the standards of the first world: Europe, Japan, etc.  In particular, America is paying dramatically more money for worse healthcare quality compared to any of those countries.  And single payer can save businesses money by reducing the financial commitment of their healthcare benefits - a switch from mandatory insurance to a low 6% tax.

2. You actually receive payment to go to college in Scandinavia because it improves the competitiveness of the workforce.  We can not compete with China in a race to the bottom of wages and safety.  Education is the only way.

3. Bernie is the only candidate who comprehends the importance of a liberated internet and respecting our right to privacy.  Hillary is one more of the pro-NSA establishment who do not care about the constitution, and has made comments in favor of censorship [which was the thing that turned me away from her in the first place in the early 2000's].  Trump is a fascist personality so I expect he would be worse.

4. Bernie is a once in a century candidate who, somehow, has swam through a river of Washington BS for decades without sacrificing his integrity.  You should check out the horrible situation in congress and how he somehow had the determination to STILL set a record for the most amendments driven through congress despite his independent status in which he was basically an outsider of either party that he negotiated with:

5. Climate change is THE issue.  Bernie is the strongest by far on climate and has correctly identified it as a national security challenge.

6. Secret trade deals are actually even bigger than climate because the secret deals often have stealth legislation to prevent climate regulation.  These deals are not 'free trade.'  They are complex, thousand page law bypassing the legislative branch.  If the founders knew this would happen it would probably be prohibited in the constitution.  These make law a matter of treaty and virtually impossible to change.

"Personally, no.

I saw this quote somewhere, and it said ""We've agreed that most gods and goddesses are mythological. It's just the one that we don't agree about."" Think about Hinduism. From my understanding, it is the third biggest religion in the world, yet the Western Hemisphere pretty much agrees that Hinduism is mythology.

That's what has to happen for Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Scientology, and every other religion that exists today. Evidently, that isn't going to happen because of the dreaded thing called organized religion. Europe is becoming secular right now, but the Catholic Church still exerts a ""control"" (for the lack of a better word) in the rest of the world. It comes down to their members, who will blindly follow the church, despite its horrific actions. The movie Spotlight showed how priests get away with molesting and raping kids, while the church covers it up. When a follower hears about this, they will probably dismiss it for various reasons. It can be compared to how Trump has so many followers, despite being a racist pig.

The blind following is because of indoctrination. If you were told that God existed and he loves you and if you don't you're gonna burn in hell, you'd probably believe it. I'd like to see an anti-indoctrination law for religion.

Poverty also a hand in it as well. Religion thrives in poverty-stricken areas.

It can't become a thing of the past through force either. Let's say that everyone in the U.S. Government is suddenly an atheist, and a handful of them anti-theists. If they outright ban Christianity, Islam, and all other religions, another world war would erupt, and it would be known as the Atheist Crusades. There were seven crusades in the dark ages, so I estimate that there would be about 15 in the Atheist Crusades.

Unless all those things happen, (minus the Atheist Crusades) religion will stay for a long time.",1,t3_4csf1i,1,0,t3_4csf1i,d1l7v0m,t5_2qh2p,no-knight,False,0,1459472916,Anti-Theist,1463139035,AgentJin,atheism,False,

"Russian 130 mm guns for destroyers (which is different from 130 mm for their new cruiser line) had undergone two separate nerfs. First nerf was right before Russian DD line was released, when WG realized a stealth firing Russian DD is op. So instead of a typical 3.8-4 km concealment penalty for a typical USN and IJN DD guns, 130 mm's penalty is 6 km.

This turned out to be not enough, Russian DD were blatantly op anyway. In particular Kiev had close to 60% average win rate at the time (I think it dropped to about 54% now). So they nerfed 130 mm's HE damage by 300, and fire chance by 2%.

Gremy received neither of these nerfs. It literally has the **pre**-*pre-nerfed* 130 mm, the original, op-as-hell guns at her disposal. Which means it can stealth fire from less than 10 km away (with 5th captain skill) with shell arcs similar to that of a Konigsberg. Additionally she can also stealth fire her torpedoes, which have 8km range. This makes her a **strictly better** Gnevy class, itself is no slouch as a tier 5 DD. In fact, she is **strictly better** than Anshan, a tier 6 DD that also performs very well in her bracket.

If this is not op I don't know what is.

"Hehehe don't loose faith it's all good.

If you want to get a little more philosophical about it: it's an interesting phenomenon that happens to all ""lables""... i'm going to go with labels, that have been oppressed in the past and are no longer.

The recepie seems to be: a specific categorization of humans were oppressed (women, blacks, indians, eastern europeans (because communism)) and at some point, through a lot of hardship and effort they gain equal or close to equal rights. At least in the eyes of the law they get equal rights, racism, sexism, xenofobism on an individual level is a problem of education, not leadership or freedom.

Once they obtain these equal rights, at some point a very small subsection of this group decides to start demanding for more ""rights"", and will use tools that have worked in the past to try and promote these ideals to both gain support and privilage. For example in eastern countries it is not uncommon for people to blame their governments for not taking care of them like the communist regime wold, even though these are the same people that demanded the freedom from the regime. They consider that because the communist government brought them up this way, they should receive special benefits from the current one since they ""can't adapt to the new way"". But when I say people, it's just a small but vocal minority.

Same with neo-feminism or apparently FemiNatzi. Some assholes went like ""Hey look, we got what we wanted... Let's see how far we can push it :D"" and welcome to today. 

As for your argument with that person you mentioned earlier:

&gt;The other person said that he/she doesnt believe that men are buffed in movies etc. because women think thats sexy, but rather because men have power fantasies.

So why doesn't this logic work in reverse? Are chicks in movies not made to look that way in order to be power fantasies for other women? Even tracer in this very game, is she not a strong independent role model for women? Hell I want to be a little bit more like her and I'm a bloke...

And if these same people tell me that a woman will willingly shove plastic in her breasts and ass, have fat surgically removed, alter their bone structure and cartilages only so that they will appeal more to men, I'm sorry but they are full of shit. Also they are full of shit if they tell me that the whole cosmetic and fashion industry was specifically designed or created only so that women can learn how to appeal to men... who most days don't give a rat's ass about it anyway.

No... I'm sorry they're all full of shit...

"It was mostly because so many companies were built by Edison Electric and Thomas Edison was so famous many just kept the name.


From the start Edison was not planning to sell light bulbs, he was selling electric power utilities. It was a big business, in his name, but run a financed by a lot of people. Edison's companies sold power plants all over America and in Europe. By 1890 when Edison left the business they had sold 870 power stations. 



Edison General Electric was merged with Thomson-Houston company in 1892 and Edison's name was dropped.... becoming General Electric. A lot of those old companies kept the Edison name because he was still the most famous guy out there.... still the Wizard of Menlow Park.

"Personally I'm of the opinion that cultural landmarks/installations -- for example: [\[1\]](http://www.taevapiltnik.ee/static/body/pildid/pilt_975.jpg) -- should be 'modernized', while singular statues/busts should be removed. 

--

By 'modernized' I mean: [1] brought up-to building standards; [2] cleaned and repaired, where necessary; [3] installation of multi-lingual placards adding context/history; [4] brought under the purview of a singular government agency, for example the Ministry of Culture.

--

There is nothing gained, in my view, from eliminating all these sites. While uncomfortable, or even unseemly, it's important to preserve the cultural, political, and civic history of a country. 

--

Thus, sites like the one linked above can be useful to that end, while singular prodigious busts, profligate across Eastern-Europe, don't serve a purpose and should be removed (albeit, at least a singular copy of each 'style' should be retained for display in museums.

"&gt; It's like 'conservative' and 'center-right' parties in Europe. They are more to the left than Clinton if you implemented their policies in the US.

I don't think that's true, really. The conservative parties of Europe are, by and large, opposed to immigration, trying to cut back government services, lower taxes, and have demanded economic austerity since the 2008 crash. None of those are to the left of Clinton. [Even the socialist party of France was trying to reform worker rights in a manner that would represent a rightward shift.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-economy-reforms-idUSKCN0UR0OO20160113)

Ideology is, I would argue, far more about *direction* and *velocity* than it is about absolute location. Using healthcare as an obvious contrast: if the US had had universal healthcare implemented in the 40s like FDR or Truman had wanted, there's no way that people like Obama and Clinton would not be supporting the continuation of such programs. A nation's absolute position is going to impact which changes are able to be accomplished in fitting with your political ideology -- while inclusion of absolute position should not be completely discarded, it does not behoove us to ignore direction and velocity of policy changes.

Just like how republicans aren't trying to 100% abolish social security and medicare, I don't think that indicates a position at all equivalent to trying to *create and implement* those measures. In fact, in a very fundamental sense, not changing or removing an existing system represents a conservative viewpoint: it's the approach that involves the least change. That Clinton is not proposing to implement single payer does not represent a position to the right of a European politician who wishes to retain their *already existing* single payer system.

Any careful assessments that go beyond first-impressions would conclude that the rightward parties of Europe are to the right of most democrats, including Clinton or Obama.

"Secret courts?  Are you talking about the FISC?  The one whose proceedings the Supreme Court itself has ruled should remain secret?  The one that handles, primarily, cases dealing with foreign nationals and Americans abroad?  Are you implying that issues of national security should be made public?

The large donations from corporations for campaigns I *do not* view as corruption; and I'll explain why.  Each and every one of us is permitted to donate to our candidate of choice and petition them for laws we want passed, modified, or repealed.  Why should *groups* of people not be permitted?  What, for example, is the difference between a corporation such as Exxon-Mobil lobbying Congress as opposed to, say, the EFF, or ACLU?

Money and favors exchanging hands in exchange for laws and policies?  Please cite a source that did not result in a conviction.

Pork barrel spending is, and has always been, a big problem, but it isn't *corruption*.  Pork barrel spending (whereby Congressmen/women advocate government spending on projects in their home state) is an example of Congressmen actually *serving their constituents*.  To think that the Senator from Iowa has the same duty to New Jersey as he has to Iowa is just ignorant thinking.  Of *course* he'll advocate spending in Iowa instead of NJ.

Raises for Congress when the economy is down?  We don't live in the USSR, Congress doesn't control the economy.  They have no duty to punish themselves when the economy is down.  Especially when this ""raise"" you speak of is a Cost of Living Increase.

As far as term limits go, that isn't Corruption *at all*.  Many people think laws that force term limits are actually *a big problem*.  They think that, if someone is legitimately a good politician, they should be able to be re-elected for life.  I happen to disagree with that idea, but that doesn't mean I think lack of term limits is *corruption*.  Many European states don't have term limits for their politicians either.  Sweden, for example, has no term limits for their Prime Minister.

"If your cringe-meter didn't go off, I probably won't change your perspective just by explaining it. It's very much a ""vibe thing"" and it's just as important how one says stuff than what one says. I'm thinking there's most probably a divide between American and European dating mechanisms, the latter being a bit less blunt. From where I come from, a 'I think you look great and I want to know you' would be considered glib, way too obvious and a little insulting, because coming on so strongly is objectifying. The object of the game would be to never show your cards, but make a nuanced effort to let her know that you're interested. If she's not, you can pull back without losing face and if the feelings are mutual, you can both start the incremental approach. Bear in mind that all this goes for serious relationships, for simple sexual flings, there would very likely be more of a 'cut the bullshit' approach, so again, none of those getting-to-know-you platitudes. To me, the guy in the video was a classic socially awkward creep of the pick-up scene, which has a really off-putting vibe for women, because its objective is maximizing one's odds of sex by strategic manipulation and deceit.

"Alright! Commenting as I crawl through the document. I also left answers to some of your questions on the doc.  
&gt; I sat Aveline down on a bench in the hospital‚Äôs waiting room.  

This sentences feels very modern. Hospitals? Waiting rooms?  

&gt; She‚Äôd be tortured. If I got her a room, I could think of something to avoid it.  

This gets the point across, but it's a bit too tell-y for me.
&gt; ‚ÄúBavaria?‚Äù  

The fact that this guy's name is also the name of the House, which is also the name of a famous European country, is mildly confusing to me. I'm all for using names from history, but especially if it's the name of multiple things in your fictional world you run a higher risk of confusing your reader.
&gt; ‚ÄúAs soon as she gets a room, I'll go.""

You don't specify that this is Bavaria, and the last sentence would imply it's the official that's speaking. I get that it's Bavaria, but your grammar implies otherwise.
&gt; The daimyo‚Äôs door was blocked by someone standing by the entrance.

You mention you don't like this sentence. I don't think the passive tense works here, it's not unique enough a situation to warrant it. I'd try something along the lines of,


&gt; I tried to push open the door, which moved about an inch before I hit something. From the other side, I heard a grunt, and the shuffling of feet as the already-crowded room attempted to make space for one more occupant.  

Not exactly like that, but something along those lines. 

&gt; ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do that,‚Äù the daimyo replied.

*Let's do that* doesn't sound nearly ominous enough to me. It sounds like his girlfriend just asked him if he wanted to get frozen yogurt.


&gt; I shivered, and every sense of being in my body seemed to run away. Everything went cold. My heart sank, and my stomach churned.


The description is effective, but not particularly original.


&gt; ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need her.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese Bavarians,‚Äù one of the councilmen growled.
‚ÄúIf I free her, she‚Äôll just come back to steal,‚Äù the daimyo said.


To me, it seems as if the councilman is talking out of line. The fact his response doesn't get any reaction from the daimyo seems even weirder to me. I dunno, could be me being nitpicky, but seems like this councilman doesn't have much of a sense of chain of command.


&gt; ‚ÄúAre you kidding, Zai?‚Äù Levi chimed from the corner of the room.


Again, for some reason random people chiming in when this guy has just threatened his lord seems bizarre to me. If I were in the army and I pulled a weapon on my commanding officer, you bet your ass the private next to me isn't going to chime in with something like, ""Think of your family!"" He's gonna either A) dispatch me B) sit there and watch, too stunned to respond, or C) help me out, if it's a really weird circumstance.


Of course, this is mostly a personal preference. All I'm saying is that it pulled me out a bit. 


&gt; I looked up at Levi and then to Mei, both dusted in dirt and stained in dried blood. Then I found Caspar, cringing and gripping his leg. I brought my eyes back to the daimyo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a life I can actually save.‚Äù


Probably my favorite passage thus far. 


&gt; I hurried back to the hospital, practically sprinting through the night down the streets of Honua. I dashed through the doors and down the hall to Aveline‚Äôs room. She was asleep in her bed.


You can boil this whole paragraph down to:


&gt; I sprinted through the Honua night. I charged through the hospital and barged into Aveline's room; she was sound asleep.


Or even:


&gt; After sprinting through the Honua night, I found Aveline asleep in her bed.


Both of these cut down on the verbiage and make the story pop more.


&gt; She gripped the sheets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere with you, creep.‚Äù
	‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm the only one on your side; the only one who‚Äôs ever been on your side.‚Äù


To me, it seems like it was too easy to get her to go from ""Creep"" to ""OK I'm gonna follow you."" It makes her seem like she has very little agency in her own life.


&gt; I laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I know a place that might open up this late.‚Äù


To me, this reaction is out of line with how dire the situation is. This might be something he'd say if they were actually dating, with no kidnapping situation going on and no suspicion that Zai might be up to no good. 


&gt; ‚ÄúCan we get a table?‚Äù I asked, pointing to one in the corner.
	He put down the candle. ‚ÄúYeah of course.‚Äù


This is unnecessary. He knows the owner and it's a bar, no way he'd ask before taking a seat.


&gt; 	We sat down, and Albin poured us some tea. ‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù he asked.
	‚ÄúTwo please.‚Äù
	He nodded then left us alone, giving me a wink as he walked to the kitchen.



This is also unnecessary, and makes Albin into a bit of a creep. Also, all these names are very Anglo, yet we're dealing with traditional Japanese architecture/aesthetic. Maybe there's a reason for this, but I don't know it.



&gt; She stared at me, but I looked away. I could tell she didn‚Äôt believe me.
‚ÄúWhere are you taking me?‚Äù she asked.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said.


This exchange doesn't seem as put together as I'd like. She begins by asking what the daiymo plans to do with her, and then she transitions to what their escape plan is. Why is she concerned about both? If she thinks she's just gonna get recaptured, she wouldn't ask about the escape plan. And if she thinks she's gonna escape, she wouldn't ask about what plans the daiymo had for her, at least not initially. 


&gt; ‚ÄúI want to murder him sometimes,‚Äù I said.


A little weird to say, especially when he's hosting the pair and allowing them refuge. It makes Zai seem a bit immature.


&gt; I hesitated. ‚ÄúYou saved me so I guess I owe you.‚Äù
She put down the pancake. ‚ÄúThen you wouldn‚Äôt have dragged me here. What‚Äôs the real reason? Don‚Äôt tell me you like me.‚Äù


This is probably a context thing, but I'm not sure what she's saying here. If she saved his life in the past, then it makes perfect sense that he's saving her life now. That would be reason enough. If by 'dragging me out here' she means taking her to dinner, then I agree that his actions don't really make a lot of sense. If you're breaking someone out of captivity, it typically makes sense to high-tail it out of there ASAP, not stick around and go out for tea and pancakes.


&gt; I hesitated again. ‚ÄúYou remind me of a friend.‚Äù


This is another thing that tells me our main character is immature. He clearly is interested in her, especially because she reminds him of someone else he used to love. The fact he's not open about that makes me think he's not well versed in how to handle these situations.


**general comments**


Going through your questions.


PACE: I mentioned where I though the pacing was off. Beyond that, it's a bit dramatic, but that's to be expected in the fantasy genre. I didn't think it was anything over-the-top.


CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: As I mentioned, I don't think he's unlikable, he has a lot of heroic qualities that make him likable. I think he's slightly immature, in that he doesn't quite know how to express himself directly without resorting to emotion. But that's a perfectly acceptable trait for your character to have -- it gives him room to grow in that direction, if that's the path you choose to take him down. Of course, you can also make his immaturity problems worse, especially if Aveline rejects him or something else goes severely wrong. The important part is that it changes in some way, so that the reader can trace Zai's development as the story progresses. You can also leave him static, if you'd like, but that's a much more boring route.

PLOT: I mentioned that taking Aveline to get some food right after he broke her out is probably not a well-thought-out decision on his part. However, if you want you can chalk that up to your main character being immature/impulsive. 

I also don't know how the daiymo ended his conversation with Zai, so I don't know how appropriate his actions are given the situation. 
Beyond that though, I don't think there's anything too outlandish in the plot so far.   


One final thought: don't be afraid of making flawed or conflicted characters. The fact that you think your character is shallow or selfish means that you're probably too attached to your main character, to the point where you think he needs to be perfect or people won't be interested. There's a screenwriting book called ""Save the Cat"" that simplifies the idea of heroism/main character behavior pretty drastically, and you might find it helpful. It's called ""save the cat"" because your main character should be the type of person who would save a cat that's in danger. It doesn't matter if your character was snorting cocaine off hooker titties right before, so long as they go out of their way to do the right thing when it counts. If your character does that, and you do a good job of focusing the action around them, then you're probably in good shape. You've done that here, so I wouldn't worry about the rest. Just know your character, know their strengths and their weaknesses, and shift those however you want to over time. Just make sure they save any ""cats"" your story might have -- which, with Aveline, he clearly does.

"I wouldn't argue that at all... But it's mostly because morrowind had stuff that the newer games didnt like the badass magic/potionmaking systems.. and SPELLMAKING OMG, I can't even talk about that... I think there was a strength of the game being delivered a lot in text instead of voiced. it made it easier to pack way more dialogue and lore into the game since they didn't have to record voices for all the dialogues. Also, when you read it, it somehow hits your imagination more and you are move involved. That, and there were a lot of hard things in morrowind that went away in later games that somewhat detracted from the experience of leaving a town and heading out on a quest- the biggest thing being the introduction of waypoint markers and a compass pointer to guide you to the objective. It was nice and convenient, and I always liked having it, but I also feel like it kind of made me just rush stumble absent-mindedly through the quests like I was a being pushed along by a chaperon. There was something magic about having to actually read the quest text and get a written description of landmarks and find your way. 

and just stylistically, morrowind delivered a more unique experience- this kinda cool tribal culture and continent that ran on a much less familiar governmental structure of tradition and houses and stuff, rather than the same european/nordic inspired classical RPG feel that Obliv and Skyrim had. Those are cool, but morrowind was just fresher... more mysterious and intriguing. It wasn't like anything I'd ever see when I played it, and it's still relatively unique today. all the Bethesda Elder Scrolls games have been great and well worth playing, but I'm not holding my breath for something that captures me the way Morrowind did.

"To summarise the research: Humans need to acquire Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFA) from their diets. You might know these acids by the omega-3 and omega-6. LCPUFAs can either be acquired directly from animal foods or synthesized from plant foods. Populations that have eaten a plant-based diet for over a long period of time have a genetic mutation that allows them to more easily synthesize LCPUFAs from plant foods. This mutation is found in 70% of South Asians, 53% of Africans, 29% of East Asians, and 17% of Europeans. [Map of the mutation](http://www.unzcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/adaptive-allele-to-vegetarian-diet.jpg). 

What this means is that different populations have different optimal diets for good health and that straying from those diets can be unhealthy in the long run. South Asians are better suited for a plant-heavy diet. This doesn't mean that South Asians can't eat meat. We can, just not in the proportions that Europeans can and still stay healthy.

Out of all countries that post here Canadians are the ones that piss me off the most. Their entire fucking culture makes no sense. What exactly is it that you do? Wear flannel shirts and slurp syrup?

If I think of America I think of guns, pop culture and freedom. Sure, lots of ignorant baboons but at least they wear their retardation like a badge of honor, use it as a cultural identity, their flag promotes the unity of the country with all these stripes and stars.

Germany is orderly, a country that prides itself on its rules and their citizens who follow them. It's also the country with the biggest responsibility when it comes to destroying Europe with its two world wars and government sanctioned refugee crisis. Their flag waves strong colors, black, red and gold. A dominant flag for a dominant country.

Russia is strong and stubborn to a fault. They live hard lives and don't complain about it. Obviously the entire country is pretty much a shithole but it breeds strong people who can take care of themselves. Their flag represents the cold, the white, the blue but also the burning passion in the red, it all comes together to signify that their country is bleak but there is strength in that.

But Canada, what are they fucking known for? Being ""nice"", i guess? Is that your role in the world? Being fucking nice? That's not an achievement. Everyone can be nice. It's easy to be nice. You just don't have to say anything bad.
So what did your fucking country decide to put on their flag to show the entire world what Canada is all about? A leaf. A FUCKING LEAF.

C9 would do as much as best nV, and even then I think it's a stretch. That game would be comparable to the 4OT F.3 v mouz game in terms of how evenly skilled the teams are.

I met two US girls on one of the bounty islands down in southern Cambodia some weeks back. They were engaged back home but had a rule: if outside the USA sex is ok if it‚Äôs only once.

&gt; In my opinion, going overseas and spending your trip trawling for sex is an incredible WASTE of valuable time (and money spent) to explore a new setting as much as possible before you have to leave, so while it might be attractive to some people, most people serious about traveling would try to optimize their time.

I think you are wrong. Sure if you just want to see the tourist highlights and buy some knick knacks made in China then spending time with locals is a waste of time. But if you want to get in under the skin of the culture in a way a mere tourist passing by never will, there is no better way than to befriend some of the local girls.
One girl I‚Äôve been seeing on and off, I sleep over at her place some times, her mother gave me the tour of her Buddhist home, they invited me for Chinese New Year, to go to the pagoda, etc. Another girl I‚Äôm seeing, she invited me to a Khmer wedding the other weekend (nothing quite like seeing Khmer girls dance wild disco dance in flip flops).

"It seems like you're not addressing the most salient issues I'm bringing up, so this is my last comment.

&gt;The US relationship with Australia is not primarily military, and it is not a quid-pro-quo.

True, but it's military relationship is *contingent* on Australian participation.  If Australia doesn't participate, that relationship goes away.  Our military as an institution has finite resources and won't send ships or people out of their way to Australia.  That will lead to a strategic blind spot - you won't be accounted for in strategic planning because we don't deal with you...you'll be like an exceptionally large version of Madagascar.

That will be exacerbated by the widespread perception that you shelved your military on the assumption that we would pick up the slack.  That in turn would be interpreted as gross presumption and an abuse of the relationship and of the US military.  Depending on the internal politics of the US at the time, you might very well see the US openly say that we wouldn't defend a country that refused to defend itself.

You don't seem to have any argument against this point beyond ""but the US would *have* to"", which is demonstrably incorrect (see our nominal allies Ukraine or Egypt).  I don't know why you're ignoring multiple Americans telling you that that's not how our policymakers would react.

&gt;The US invested way more in Japan and Germany while actively discouraging them from militarising because they were strategically important.

Against the prospect of international communism, which both of those countries bordered directly.  You're not as strategically valuable against any power as Germany or Japan were against the Soviet Union and China.

&gt;If there is an existential threat to Australia strong enough that the US cannot defeat it, no amount of Australian military spending will be strong enough to defeat it. If China decides to go imperialist and the US has declined to the point where they can't do anything about it, Australia's only option is to develop a nuclear deterrent while China is busy conquering southeast Asia. Conventional military resistance would be futile.

Okay...you get that a conventional military has deterrent value, yes?  That a country that might otherwise demand something of you will instead ask nicely or offer an exchange? I'm not talking about existential threats or China ""going imperialist"", I'm talking about things like the US-China jockeying currently going on in the South Pacific.  How might Australia be affected by that?

Example 1: China gradually pushes the US out and takes control of Southeast Asian sea lanes.  After a few years of control, China declares that ships moving through their waters (meaning the South Pacific) must pay a tax to offset the cost of securing the sea lanes.  With Australian military: ""No, that's not necessary.  We can secure our own lanes in the south so you don't need to tax our trade.""  Without Australian military: ""Do you need those payments in yuan?""

Example 2: Australia imposes a tariff on Chinese imports that is understandably unpopular with China's government.  China responds by threatening a blockade of Australian ports.  With a military: ""Just try it.  Guarantee it won't be worth it.""  Without a military: ""Okay, you can dictate our trade policy.""/""Please, someone with a military, *halp*!""

A military has uses even if it can't beat a bigger opponent or isn't facing an existential threat or invasion.  As long as it's strong enough to make any coercion by a larger power potentially costly, it empowers the weaker party.  It helps trade, improves relationships with close neighbors by bolstering security and attracts the interest of stronger allies who can strengthen your position even more.

PS - Setting aside all the practical realities that make this a bad idea (and thus make this proposal a practical impossibility), it's a policy of institutional spinelessness.  You've said elsewhere in this thread that the US somehow owes you...we don't owe you anything.  Study WW2, when the Japanese were bombing Darwin and Australia was all but defenseless:

&gt;The Australian Government...regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say in the direction of the democracies' fighting plan. Without inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. ‚Äî‚ÄâPrime Minister John Curtin

To put it bluntly, the Japanese caught you with your pants down (because you were helping the Brits in Europe, no disrespect) and we pulled them back up in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal.  That *was* an existential threat and we helped in short order.  That you're now willing to say that you should give up any responsibility for your own security and just assume we'll handle it...it doesn't really jive with that legacy.  It's not the kind of thing supposed old friends do.  I don't see how you can bank on that friendship while so thoroughly denigrating it.",4,t1_d1lehcc,4,0,t3_4csryu,d1lgbzh,t5_2w2s8, points,False,0,1459487445,104‚àÜ,1463143056,Grunt08,changemyview,False,
"As America attacks Mexico and Canada, the world condemns the U.S and is heavily sanctioned by UN members. Most alliances with the U.S become void. Russia taking advantage of the situation, secretly agreeing with the U.S to not attack each other and leave themselves to their own affairs. Russia quickly retakes much of Central Asia and moves towards Eastern Europe taking Belarus,Ukraine and Moldova. The E.U stays united and becomes more militarized as U.S protection has ceased and Russia encroaches closer and closer to Western Europe. Civil war breaks out in former Yugoslav states between Pro-Russians and Pro-E.U forces and leaks over to Romania and Bulgaria. Russia preps for invasion of said countries. 

Most of Central America and the Carribean quickly surrenders to the U.S while South American countries create a defensive pact against U.S aggression. Guyana and Suriname becomes part of Brazil out of fear of invasion from the U.S. French Guyana knowing the situation in Europe also joins Brazil out of fear that France will be unable to help. Same idea applying to the Falklands as they join Argentina. All of South America forms a defensive pact against the U.S hoping to deter the U.S from invading. The U.S bide their time as they massively fund rebel groups  in South America waiting until civil wars breaks out to weaken the countries before invading. Meanwhile the U.S invades Greenland and Iceland. The U.K, Sweden, Norway, France, Netherlands and Germany step in to stop the occupation. An Atlantic naval war between the participating E.U countries and the U.S ensues. Much of the participating E.U navies are completely destroyed. Iceland and Greenland are occupied by the U.S. E.U countries become more militarized as they realized they are surrounded by both Russia and the U.S.

South Korea, Japan and Taiwan stand by the U.S for protection fearing an invasion from China. China set their ambitions towards South East Asian countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, etc but does not attack the islands in South East Asia instead waiting to see if the U.S weakens. Meanwhile China starts a Coup d'√©tat in North Korea and installs a pro-Chinese government hoping to improve conditions in North Korea eventually aiming to reunite Korea expelling American influence and creating Chinese influence over the peninsula.


The Middle East becomes a giant battle field. Tension between Pakistan and India rise quickly and a full scale war ensues between the two countries. 



All countries south of coastal North Africa breaks out into civil wars ranging from overthrowing tyrants to power grabs from local factions. Other African countries invade each other due to past hatreds. Refugees fleeing to South Africa cause racial tensions to increase significantly and riots regularly break out. South Africa immediately closes their borders after the first few waves. Madagascar closes all ports.  

Refugees from Africa and the Middle East swarm over to E.U states. All E.U states refuse and resort to shooting down any ships coming close to their borders.

The coastal North African countries (excluding Egypt) unite together forming a coalition to stop refugees from entering their countries. The coastal North African countries also secretly fund pirates to raid E.U supply lines hoping to weaken the E.U.

"African slavery existed outside of America. Moreover, the death toll is extremely hard to calculate but even with the most conservative estimates the Atlantic Slave Trade matched, but most likely greatly exceeded, the death toll of the Holocaust (many people forget all the people killed in Africa before the rest were captured). In other words, just the number of people dying to the slave trade was that high, if you were lucky enough to live you got to be treated as livestock for the rest of your life.

Additionally, the goal of African slavery was the systematic subjugation of an entire people, while the Holocaust's was the complete elimination of a people. In terms of these events's ultimate goals, the Jewish people survived and have strong cultural centers worldwide as well as extremely successful communities that preserve their culture. While descendants of the African slave trade on the other hand, continue to suffer from what feels like a never ending list of problems either directly or indirectly linked to their past and are just now beginning to recover (and only in some regions).

Not to mention, in many places the African culture was heavily influenced and changed by the slave holders almost to the point of being unrecognizable. Even in the Carribean, where many countries have stronger ties to their African roots, most of them speak the language of their oppressors. In America, African American culture is very dissimilar to the African ancestral culture. Language, religion, even names are all adapted from European culture. Most of the traditions that are unique pieces of African American culture actually come from slavery and the Civil Rights Era not Africa itself (e.g. music, literature, and cuisine).

So in essence the Nazi mission to eradicate Judaism failed while the imperialist one to mold the ""inferior"" race in their image succeeded. Of course, as you said, the Holocaust took place over a few years rather than centuries which is why the bloodshed is unprecedented and disturbing, but I think you're a bit misinformed on the other side here.",1,t1_d1l9slp,1,0,t3_4cgtf6,d1lgv91,t5_2qh1i,,False,0,1459488649,,1463143308,jfriscuit,AskReddit,False,

Wew lad you sure showed me that's definately 4chan right there, all three of them links and I see images of two actual ""chan"" posts. And even then only one is slightly perhaps incriminating, the other discusses #NYS.

Now for those IRC logs, I got nothing aside from the fact that it's not even labelled as a 4chan room and it consists of 5 - 10 different people.

Now compare that with /r/KotakuInAction nearing 60k subscribers. But sure just paint all of them blindly with the harasser/mysoginist brush. Who gives a shit whether they're male, female, neither, both black, white, asian, hispanic, european, gay, straight or whatever, clearly *every single one* of those 60,000 people just blindly hate women because of the dubious screenshots of a single IRC room.

"Wilders or Le Pen have ideas on how to run a democracy. This is all fine, even if we don't agree with them. There's no reason to ban either. What we're talking here is banning political parties, whose aim is to dismantle democracy as such. This is what ""the self-defending democracy"" won't (and shouldn't) tolerate.


&gt;I believe that a modern European electorate people would never endorse genocide

Probably not, since genocide is an absurdly evil thing. However, that's not the question - the question is, should a party, whose message is ""gas the jews/muslims/gypsies/whatever"" be allowed to exist and compete for power? And if so, should a political party, whose only program would be to murder /u/Zeebaars be?

More importantly, no party would ever run with an openly murderous program. But stripping certain minorities of voting rights, or subjecting them to special taxes or whatver, that's something the majority won't feel. It's a weak point of simple democracy (rule of majority), which is why an actual democracy has the judiciary to be a check against this.  

To sum it up, we're not better people than we were a hundred years ago. We just learnt to use certain types of systems and institutions to direct the human nature in a certain way. These systems (eg. liberal democracy) can be attacked, and not only it's their right, but it's their duty to not roll over, but to fight back.

"A lot of good suggestions here (like Runequest and Numenera) but I can add a few more:

* **Ars Magicka** is set in medieval europe, and has a very well regarded game mechanic for magic.  It's also known for having extensively researched gaming supplements.  If you want to play a game about occult conspiracies in the dark ages, this is where it's at.
* **Exalted** is a White Wolf game from the 90s with a very detailed setting and mythology. It borrows a lot of imagery from anime, and the characters feel pretty overpowered.  But, it gets pretty far away from standard fantasy.
* Speaking of White Wolf, **Dark Ages Vampire** is more of a horror game than a fantasy game, but it combines supernatural things with a medieval setting.
* **REIGN** has a very strange default setting involving humanoid continents and countries written intentionally to avoid medieval European counterparts.  There aren't really any non-human races, except as a result of a wizard going too far down a magic path.  As an added plus, the game mechanics are both neat (it's based on rolling dice and looking for matching sets) and focused on faction-level conflicts as well as the standard adventuring party scale.  There's a secondary setting called **Nain** which is described as ""Harry Potter + Gormenghast""
* **Dungeons: the Dragoning: 40,000**... I don't really know what's going on with this game, but considering how weird the basic set up is (it's like 9 games mashed together, including their mechanics), it's surprisingly ...coherent?  It looks like someone's joke got out of hand and became a labor of love.  I don't know if it's playable, but it's great to skim through.
* **Gurps Magic 2: the madlands** bears special mention for being a fucking weird setting with a lot of body horror elements, and a pantheon of inhuman gods based on the Thousand Acre Woods characters.
* **Rifts: Wormwood** is something that I think started as a standalone game, and got roped into the Rifts umbrella. On it's own, it's a bizarre setting involving a planet of living flesh, crawling towers occupied by some sort cancer-priests, and heroes who get powers by bonding with symbiotic creatures.  Unfortunately, it's saddled with the Rifts game mechanics (which are troubled) and a lot of other baggage from Rifts (like giant robots for no good reason)
* **Dungeons and Dragons** had a couple settings that started veering away from the standard fantasy tropes, with Planescape and Dark Sun probably being the best.  Planescape is pretty awesome through and through, and Dark Sun is a bit more troubled, but still has some excellent ideas in it.

"Oh god... so much ignorance and anti-American prejudice.     
      
In my experience, most Americans don't know shit about Europe, but at least they ADMIT they don't know shit about Europe.  Whereas Europeans tend to know more about America than vice versa, but they don't know nearly as much as they THINK they know.     
      
One random example... they love to talk like Americans are weird for not being a huge soccer country, but the truth is that's common for countries similar to America.  Don't get me wrong, I love soccer and it's my favorite sport, but soccer is really popular in two types of places.  Europe... and countries who are (or recently were) too poor to play many other sports.  Let's not act like Ghana seriously tried out ice hockey and lacrosse, and then decided that soccer was more fun.     
        
I mean if you look at non European first world countries, many of them are not soccer crazy in the same degree as the rest of the world.  USA and Canada.  Australia and New Zealand are big into Aussie rules and rugby and stuff.  Japan IIRC is bigger into baseball.  Korea has soccer #1 IIRC, but baseball is still really big there, as are e-sports.   Even Russia (which is kindof European and kindof first world) has other sports like ice hockey and volleyball very popular.    
       
Or shit, India and China are like 1/3 or the worlds population, but are quite isolated from Europe, and despite not being first world necessarily (I guess they vary heavily by locality), soccer isn't dominant there.     
      
But instead the whole narrative is ""americans don't like soccer because they are arrogant and have to be different, and they don't want to play a sport they can't be world champions at.""   ",3,t1_d1ks43p,3,0,t3_4cpmaf,d1ljkw4,t5_2rbnb,,False,0,1459496389,,1463144586,5510,MLS,False,

Salafist Islamists like JaN and Ahrar ash-Sham where still a minority among the opposition in the first couple years of the civil war.

There was also a huge influx of volunteers after Pearl Harbor that lessened the need for draftees until casualties seriously started mounting (North Africa, Sicily and Italian invasions). As for main areas of deployment for draftees, that would be to the infantry in Italy and Western Europe, as that is where the highest American casualties were suffered. The US Pacific Fleet and Atlantic Convoys was the main destination for conscripted American sailors. The USMC didn't begin drafting until after hostilities began with Japan, and didn't really get serious amounts of draftees until Guadalcanal (August 1942). In total, some 10 million men were drafted into the United States Armed Forces between 1940 and 1947.

As for the conscripts of the other major beligerant nations, the United Kingdom began their draft at the outbreak (September 3, 1939) and continued some degree of conscription until 1963. Most of their conscripts during the war, would find themselves in Western Europe and Italy as well. 

Germany began conscription in 1935, and continued until they were defeated. Most of their conscripts would fight on the Eastern Front, although there was also a heavy presence of conscripts on the Western Front as well. It's also worth noting that many ""German"" conscripts were from conquered territories, such as Chzechoslovakia, Poland, Romania and Ukraine.

The Soviet Union began their draft in 1936 with almost all of their conscripts on the Eastern Front. They also saw action during the Winter War with Finland (November 1939-March 1940) and in Manchuria (1932-1945).

Japan's conscripts were deployed across the Pacific Theatre and China. Mostly China, though. Japanese conscripts faired the worst by far. They were given very little training and Japanese soldiers were expected to feed themselves, which led to horrific treatment of local populations and the Imperial Japanese Army starving to death.

Edit: I forgot to mention that, like Germany, Japan also conscripted many non-Japanese, namely Koreans. These were mostly used as cannon fodder and labour units, though. In fact, it's estimated that 25% of the casualties from Hiroshima and Nagasaki were Korean conscripts.",4,t1_d1ljdgp,4,0,t3_4cswyr,d1lk8qn,t5_2qh3l,,False,0,1459498694,,1463144898,Nastreal,news,1459499112,

Various projects become funded by national UK research funding councils. The same tired rhetoric is deployed with CAP, and workers rights and other things. The EU doesn't have some exclusive ability to fund such programs. If the EU army goes ahead, and in ten years there were a similar refendum on Brexit, then the question would be ""who is going to pay for our defense force?"".

&gt;If you think the government of any colour would replace that EU funding you're sadly mistaken. No votes in it compared with spending the cash on a tax break for older voters. 

Well, I *could* point out the various funding agencies (such as Research Councils UK) that have multi-billion pound budgets, but the main argument against EU funding is what happens when the EU's mood changes?

"&gt; **EU bosses DEMAND European Union flag stars be incorporated into Union Jack**

&gt; EUROPEAN UNION chiefs are drawing up secret plans ordering member nations to incorporate the ‚Äòring of stars‚Äô emblem of the Council of Europe into their flags.

&gt; Graphic artists in Brussels have even drawn up proposed designs which show the blue and gold Flag of Europe either displayed in the top left hand corner or even more brazenly in the CENTRE of the existing national flags.

&gt;The move is being pushed through prior to the UK vote on EU membership on June 23 in what is seen by critics as a cynical bid to officially cement Britain‚Äôs links to the European Union.

&gt; A high ranking Brussels-based diplomat who leaked the plans to Express.co.uk said: ‚ÄúThe idea of incorporating the 12 stars into national flags has been around as long as the Council of Europe has existed.

&gt;‚ÄúWe pushed through the incorporation of the EU flag onto car registration plates in the late 90s and no-one kicked up a fuss, so, to many members this seems a logical next step.

&gt;‚ÄúSome expressed concern that Britain might kick back a little, but usually it‚Äôs just a lot of huffing and puffing in your parliament then Brussels pushes through the legislation it wants.‚Äù

&gt;Critics view the move as the clearest sign yet the EU plans a full United States of Europe.

&gt;Some of the newer, smaller EU states are believed to be keen on the idea and German EU diplomats are pushing for the move.

&gt;But France and Italy are outraged and plan to fight the proposal.

&gt;Claude Boursin, spokesman for the centre-right Partie de Reddition Singe, said: ‚ÄúThe tricoleur is a symbol of French courage in the face of adversity ‚Äì our 'never surrender' spirit. It has mythic status in our country and we will never let it be tampered with.‚Äù

&gt;UKIP MEP Mike Hookem said: ‚ÄúThis whole proposal is an absolute joke. It‚Äôs indicative of how insidious Brussels can be but seriously we'd have to be fools to fall for it.‚Äù

&gt;The European Flag consists of a circle of 12 yellow stars on an blue background. It is an official emblem of both the Council of Europe and the European Union and is termed the ""Flag of Europe"" or ""European Flag"" by both organisations. 

&gt;It was first adopted in 1955 by the Council of Europe and was intended to represent the continent as a whole. ",58,t3_4cuted,58,0,t3_4cuted,d1llea3,t5_2rygj,UKGB,False,0,1459503028,United Kingdom,1463145442,BananaBork,vexillology,False,

Unfortunately it is not this straightforward.

The actual dumping marking is 60% however the formula used to calculate long term injury to the EU comes out at 16%. 

The EC would like to drop the rule so that it can impose the *actual* dumping margin which would still be completely legal (see the US tariff of 261%).

"&gt; Every civil project requires large scale cooperation especially infra projects like roads, dams, railways etc. No farmer wants to give away his land for the construction of road, there are always protests. As for highways they do require large scale cooperation between the Govt. of India(NHAI) and the contractor.

And that's the thing. Contractors don't give a rat's ass about quality since they are not there for welfare of people, no?

&gt;One firm has to design the road, one has to execute it and the govt is the client which has to oversee the work and provide directions. You'll have people working on project who are unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled labours followed by supervisors, engineers, managers and parties with individual interests like the corporates, farmers, politicians etc. However great a civil engineer you are nothing can be accomplished alone in this field. Engineers are not always dealing with educated people, you can write n no. of instruction manuals and show the right way but the onus is onto all the people. You simply can't compare working in a controlled environment with an environment with so many variables.

I'm not too keen in the actual process of construction. But I'm criticizing just the design of the road that is the problem. It is a civil engineer's mistake. (Yeah, I do agree that politicians might play a part in it).

But it is unskilled labour. I don't know why they cannot show basic things. In addition, why not just hire the people with experience again and again?

&gt;We do have proper design codes for geometry it's not like someone wakes up one fine morning and just scribbles on a sheet of paper and the road is made. For example IRC 73 is the code to be followed for Geometric Design of Rural Highways.

Actually, I don't think they even look at that!

I've seen that road code. It is good, besides some design flaws that need to be updated. Some of the signage and markings are straight up copypasta from EU regulations that will not work in India. We need to examine that?

"For those hitting a paywall:

Ireland, the comeback kid, is now among the fastest growing economies in the world, after expanding 7.8 per cent last year, but the country‚Äôs central bank is not letting itself be blinded by the recent roaring success.

While the central bank has upped its growth forecast for this year to 5.1 per cent from a previous estimate of 4.8 per cent, it is expecting lower growth in 2017 and has cautioned that there are ‚Äúsome risks to the outlook from external factors‚Äù.

The central bank has chopped its forecast for growth in 2017 to 4.2 per cent from 4.4 per cent previously ‚Äì although that is still a rate that most European countries can currently only dream of.

Ireland‚Äôs economy expanded by an astonishing 9 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of 2015. That helped it to clock up its fastest pace of annual growth since the hey day of the so-called Celtic Tiger in 2001, when the Irish economy was firing on all cylinders but came to a painful halt in 2008 with a banking and property crash that forced it to seek a ‚Ç¨67bn international bailout two years later.

Recent growth is being driven firmly by domestic demand, the central bank says in its latest economic bulletin. Its chief economist, Gabriel Fagan, said:

&gt;The growth outlook is relatively favourable and domestic economic momentum is strong, although there are some risks to the outlook from external factors. The main driver of growth will be the continuing recovery in employment and incomes, although following its very strong growth in recent years, employment growth is projected to gradually moderate over the forecast horizon.

"As someone who's half American and half Dutch-Indonesian and who has lived roughly the same time in the US as the Netherlands. I think this is a very bad way of looking at things. The situation in Europe and the US are simply so different that it doesn't make sense to compare the two. 

1. Universal healthcare: Yes, universal healthcare could be introduced in the US BUT it is simply never going to happen. Obamacare was a pain in the ass to get enacted by congress, and that was with a Democrat controlled house of representatives and congress. Do you really think the Republicans who strongly opposed Obamacare will suddenly approve universal healthcare simply because Bernie would be elected president?

2. Affordable universities: This is a hard one to get introduced. Here in the Netherlands the universities are financed by a donation of the government in addition to private donations and tuition fees (‚Ç¨1.951) The government finances these donations with tax money. This is possible because the Netherlands has one of the highest tax rates in the world (the lowest tax rate is 36% while the highest is 56%). Unless the US is willing to dramatically increase its tax rate and dramatically decrease military spending (from 3% of the GDP to 1.3%), it is simply not possible.

"Just another +1 for  Song&amp;Dance festival. Whole year of 2018 is being touted as year of celebration, so Song&amp;Dance festivel is likely to be one of the peaks of celebrations no matter what, with plenty of things going on around Riga even if you fail to obtain tickets for actual concerts. 
Festival starts on 30th June,  just week after Midsummer (23rd June, with some more folkorsy celebrations on 20th-21st). Lately Turaida (that's part of Sigulda, halfway between Riga and Cƒìsis) has had a very nice and foreigner-accessible event on 21st June - of course, it's hard to guess whether they do 21st or 23rd (or anything at all) in 2 years time.  Either way, Turaida or no, there will be nice midsummer celebrations somewhere, and you can easily fit both Song&amp;Dance Festival and Midsummer in your 1 month timeline. 

November in Riga is cold and dark. Coming from Australia you may underestimate just how short daylight is even if you strike lucky and see couple of sunny days - even with ideal weather conditions, you'll only get couple of hours of actual sunlight per day. And that just paints everything gloomy and depressing... Sure there will be events and such, but the whole atmosphere is likely to be much less festive.

For contrast around midsummer it barely gets dark at all, and late June-early July is generally the gentlest (not warmest, not guaranteed sunshine, but weather extremes around that time are rare-ish).

Place wise - Sigulda is quite pretty and is quite tourism oriented (and within driving distance from Rƒ´ga) - it shouldn't be a problem to find a place to stay for a month there. Just do youre streetview research as Sigulda - one concern with Sigulda is that it's quite hilly - but some of the new rental prpoperties are in flatter areas, so it might be Ok.  

 If you'll just look around, you might also find a countryhouse somewhere in the vicinity of Riga-Sigulda-Cƒìsis highway - maybe that's the type of trip you're looking for. Celotajs.lv may be of help for such properties, but I wouldn't be surprised if you succesfully found something on airbnb as well. Maybe other redditors can voice in on this one better.  As for medical assistance, if such was neccessary - Sigulda and Cƒìsis both have semi-decent hospitals, some of the best outside of Riga.



If you decide to rent in Riga, the really nice districts are 'Klusais centrs'/'BulvƒÅru loks', ƒ∂ƒ´psala, Me≈æaparks, ƒÄgenskalns- the latter three have their posh parts and derelict parts, so do your own research. MƒÅrupe while not technically 'Rƒ´ga' is also worth a look, maybe Teika - but it's a bit more hit&amp;miss. You may find private houses in other districts as well though, so just see what's on offer. As for legality of airbnb - unless something drastically changes in next 2 years, Riga is the unique place where airbnb is probably more legal than the regular rental market (hello www.ss.lv  - i.e. Latviain craigslist).... It does not rule out hotel lobby suddenly raising it's head due to anniversary, but it's rather less likely than otherwise in Europe.

 Do pay attention for parking on premises - do not rely on public transportation, especially around major events. Same goes for street parking. Riga's public transportation system is  not tourist friendly and parking system even less so.

Do try to find out more about what your grandmother remembers from Latvia, tell reddit and maybe we can help you plan around that?

"&gt; 1 is utter bollocks. The fact is that we pay more money into the EU than we get out, about 2:1

It appears you're just looking at the known quantities [which are money in and money out](https://fullfact.org/economy/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) but a membership fee is not the same as the economic cost or benefit. This is a far more difficult thing to evaluate but if you check with just about any fact checking organisation, they will tell you that opinion is divided but it looks like we roughly get out what we put in.

[Here is one example](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-europe-bring-household-3000/16300) which debunks the counter claim that we get out far more than we put in.

&gt; The IOD concluded that after totting up all the economic costs and benefits, staying in the EU leaves Britain out of pocket, to the tune of 1.75 per cent of GDP.

&gt; A report by NIESR in 2004 suggested the opposite: staying in the EU creates a small net gain, and the UK‚Äôs output would be just over 2 per cent lower a year if we left.

&gt; Note that the difference between these estimates is not vast. Further studies by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the US International Trade Commission found it essentially too close to call either way.

&gt; The author of the IEA paper, the late Professor Brian Hindley, put it like this: ‚ÄúAny economic gain or loss is small ‚Äì almost certainly less than 1 per cent of GDP‚Ä¶ more precise or more sophisticated calculations will not arrive at a large number for either gain or loss.‚Äù

"If I remember correctly only Eden hazard completed more successful dribbles than sterling last year in the league. He also completed the most successful dribbles of any player 21 or under in Europe.  Dribbling is his biggest strength, it's as simple as that. Pellers just doesn't allow him to run at the full back in one on one situations. He's instructed to wait for our overlapping full back. He was given freedom at Liverpool and I believe Pep will give him the same freedom in those situations. If you get chance have a read of Kingsley Coman's comments regarding Pep and the instructions he gave him at the start of the season.

Austria
Italy
Czech Republic
Luxembourg
Germany
Denmark
Sweden
Switzerland

It's easy to compare the homicide rates of countries with gun ownership rates and then see the differences in gun laws. In the case of Switzerland and Austria, you can basically buy certain guns ""over the counter"" with just an ID and a background check.

Which countries have made gun laws stricter over time? If you check the homicide rates even before certain changes in gun laws, you will see that the rates had been going down for years before those restrictions.

For example in 2002, in Germany a kid shot a bunch of other kids and gun laws were made a bit stricter.
Meanwhile the homicide rates:

http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compareyears/69/rate_of_homicide_any_method

Implemented in 2002/03, homicide rates had been going down since the 90s (just like every European country), homicide rates remained basically the same 3 years later and then dropped again by a bit.
I see no correlation at all. You are actually implying that the gun laws are the cause for a drop in homicide rates throughout the Western world. This is completely delusional since at the root it implies that gun ownership is the cause of homicide as if guns themselves make people murder other people.",1,t1_d1lnyem,1,0,t3_4cskwz,d1ls040,t5_2qh13,,False,0,1459519686,,1463148622,AnitaMEDIC25,worldnews,False,

"In every post you make you prove my point with your own words but end up at a different conclusion. You seem like an intelligent person so I can only assume that I am not getting my point across, I will try once more and then that's it, if that doesn't work ""we will leave it there"".      
.  
I will start with a few small points before getting to my main issue, you and your arguments.    
.  
.  

Firstly, I left the air freight/cargo industry just under 20 years ago but I still have mates in the industry and talk to them regularly (they used to ask me to give up my current life and come back to ""real work"" but they have come to realise that I wont do it and want the quiet life (I will live on a boat one day)). After leaving the air freight industry I spent a short time in road exports, depressing industry full of liars but I still have mates in that industry too.  I have spoken to them about this exchange and wish they would join in (they wont, reasons vary from ""I have a job to do"" to ""reddit is for shouty people""). They and I disagree with things in your posts. I will explain in more detail towards the end of this post.  
.  
   
Secondly, My knowledge and experience is relevant and from a different perspective to yours. You are a client of shipping companies whereas I worked for shipping companies, do you really think they tell you the truth the whole time? I have lost count of the number of times I blamed courier errors on the weather (Milan is very foggy, planes have delays. Honest). I have had to tell clients all sorts of rubbish to cover the fact that a truck driver decided to stop for a break at a place he could get breakfast. If Customer Service told the truth they would lose clients daily, the constant lies are the reason I preferred operations over sales or CS (and one of the reasons I left the industry).   
.  
Thirdly if you are doing 1000 shipments a week and just blanketly handing the work to DHL then I think we have identified a problem. I don't care what deal they are offering on price, I don't care what their sales/CS tell you, there are better ways. Price and level of service can be improved if you look elsewhere (and at smaller companies).   
&gt;I am as incentivized as it is possible to be to export to any country, and we assess every possible method we can to get stuff there.   
  
   
Then hire someone to look for you, hire someone who is currently what I was back then. A short term expense will result in long term benefits to your processes.  
.  
But finally we come to you and your words in this exchange...  
You are pro EU. That's fine, a lot of people are and have valid arguments for being so. But your words show you are trying to exaggerate problems with being outside the EU. +4 days to Switzerland is not how the export industry works, not now, not 20 years ago, not 50 years ago. Was it the Easter break? Some places in Switzerland have a holiday the previous weekend as well but decent export companies plan around that (DHL will just process the shipment on the day you give it to them, planning is your problem). Why you experienced this I don't know (and why you experienced +2.5 days to Norway is completely beyond me) but it is not typical of the industry and your one-off experience cannot be used as a valid reason for maintaining EU membership.   
&gt;CH experiences minor delays in customs   
  

Yes, exactly. Minor delays and minor changes to the process. The EU regulates your product, whatever that may be, so one recipe can be sold in multiple countries, but the changes to the export process between EU and non EU are so minor as to be insignificant to a company sending 50k shipments pa.   
.  
&gt;‚Ä¢thats why every practically professional body in the UK points out that there IS INDEED an overhead from stepping outside of the single market, and that will have a real life impact.  
  
Yes, but as you say a minor one.  
.  

&gt;‚Ä¢thats why I sat through a UKTI presentation about the different and additional administrative overheads that will need to be overcome if we exit - all do-able but an additional burden nonetheless (UKTI will expand rapidly if we exit - what do you think they will all be doing?)  
  
""All do-able"", if it was the case that non EU exports had 4 days delay then it wouldn't be do-able.  
.  
&gt;‚Ä¢thats why small businesses would be disproportionately affected - because what larger companies do when they see these barriers is solve them, but smaller companies find themselves not pushing exports as they struggle with the additional overheads   
  
Absolutely agree, and for startups it will be a lot harder. The industry I was in has evolved to fit the current system and the level of service required to help smaller company has gone, but it will return. If there is a need for a certain type of export agent that caters to the smaller company then one will be created, that's capitalism. And the additional overheads are not as great as you may think (back in 97 I sent a single shipment of 2ton to Amsterdam by courier, a corporate bank in London was panicking. Cost to me ¬£250, invoice to them ¬£2000).   
.   
.   
.  
To summarize;  
you putting the wrong information about the delays in exporting outside the EU in this post.  If you did indeed experience a 4 day delay on identical shipments to similar countries sent at the same time, and the only difference was EU membership of the recipient then I can think of no reason for it. Investigate more. Lack of EU membership does not cause that level of delay in exporting. You know this, you admit it in your last post. You talk of ""minor delays"" and how you currently are doing it, but your original stance 2 days ago was ""I am 110% confident that there is indeed a big difference in the practical arrangements of shipping to non-single market countries vs inside the single market"".   Your original stance was ""Big Difference"" and now its ""Minor Delays"", if we take that back to the start of this conversation where are we on the ""economic suicide-Really really bad- a shock - a stressful time - a short period of uncertainty whilst a new structure is built"" scale.

I am aware of the ratios of freight sent by air and road (and sea), it was my job when I was desked based and has been my job since when I was behind the wheel.

"&gt;What happened exactly? Did Putin change, did America do something after Bush left office that spurned Russia?


It's a little bit of both, and a little bit of neither. I'm not really a Russia expert, so I'm not properly equipped to give you a solid answer, but I think that I can provide some insight.

First of all, I think that it's important to keep in mind that unlike Americans, Russians tend to view history through a much broader timeframe. Americans have the privilege of being able to think that history started in the 1700s, Russians do not. Russian history goes back about a thousand additional years, and most of that history involves repeated invasions of Russia from all sides. This gets to another key difference in the American and Russian mindsets: America is in a privileged geographic position, Russia is not. America is surrounded by two oceans and two very friendly countries. Russia is surrounded by empty plains and hostile mountains that have historically served as invasion routes. 

So fast forward to 1945, and you realize why the Russians are in such a good geographic situation. Germany, which has a long and brutal history of conflict with the Russians, is divided and in ruins. Great! France and the UK, which have fought Russia around the globe, are exhausted. Excellent! The historic routes used to invade Russia? Now controlled by Russians, with Russian troops occupying the chokepoints. Phenomenal!

So the whole cold war happens, and it ends with the USSR breaking up. The United States thinks that it won some great historic battle against good and evil. That's easy to think, because Americans' view of history is so short and so full of absolute victories. Russians just don't think that way. Instead, a weak Russia is forced to deal with the fact that it is now vulnerable in a way that it hasn't been since before the Second World War. Many former Soviet States, which are needed as buffers to protect the Russian people, are now aligning themselves with the west. Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania in NATO? Ukraine looking west? Russian power diminished around Eurasia? HORRIBLE. Ukraine was particularly egregious, since it is the birthplace of the Russian people, a breadbasket of the USSR, and was thought to be a huge bulwark of Russian nationalism, especially in the east. The idea that Ukraine was moving into the western orbit and was considering EU (and possibly NATO membership) was really a last straw.

This was never going to be a stable status quo. Things that looked nifty from the Western POV looked like disasters to anyone with a Russian nationalist POV. It was only a matter of time before someone moved to overturn many of these ""western victories.""

And speaking of matters of times, timing was an issue. Going into the first Gulf War, the Iraq Army was widely considered to be among the best in the world. People at the time actually thought that this would be a massive battle that could leave as many as 30k, if not more, Americans dead. Instead, it was a cakewalk for the Americans. Why the discrepancy between the predictions and the results? Because of something known as the third Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA). I need to get back to work so I can't spend much time on this, but just keep in mind that things like GPS, smart bombs, and advanced communications were an absolute game changer that nobody foresaw being so effective. The Iraqi Army didn't even bother to defend a flank because they thought that a desert was impassable, but that was because *they didn't know that GPS existed.* So the Russians, among other outside observers, were horrified that the US was able to overpower the Iraqis so easily. They knew that it wouldn't be possible to challenge the US now, because the US was so far ahead. The Russians, along with others, started modernizing their military in order to catch up, while the US largely stagnated due to the Iraq War. So now the Russians also have a version of GPS called GLONASS, and they have their own smart bombs and advanced communications platforms. Just look at the difference in Russian capabilities in Georgia, which was largely fought ""the old way,"" and their capabilities in Syria and Ukraine, which have involved much more modernized forms of warfare. The Russian RMA in the late 2000s allowed them to achieve something along the lines of parity with the US military, allowing them to challenge the US in a way that they could not have in the 1990s and early 2000s.

**tl;dr:** The post-Cold War status quo was never sustainable, but Russians did not have the ability to challenge it until recently.",23,t3_4cvscs,23,0,t3_4cvscs,d1lt0lw,t5_2sfmf,,False,0,1459521267,,1463149100,emr1028,PoliticalDiscussion,1459532897,

The downside to SoftEther is that multiple people can use a single VPN IP, meaning you might experience lag. Also, there's no guarantee the IP you choose will stay online. It can drop connection at any time, which would suck if you're grinding mobs or something.  

If you plan to play BDO EU/US for good, then buy a VPN. They charge you typically on a month to month basis. Choose one that lets you pick the IP's country, and has good reviews.

I'm not exactly sure how they work, but I'm assuming when you rent a VPN, the service will have you download a program on your computer where you login using your VPN service's login info, and it connects you.

Hi, after a very long time, this is the first MMORPG that I am truly excited about. I grew up on Lineage 2 and spent countless hours grinding with my online friends, participating in large-scale PvP events, and just having great fun in general. I truly hope that Black Desert could allow me to relive some of those moments and meet a bunch of cool people who share same interests as I do. 

I want to try the game first because I'm not sure that my current gig will be able to support it. I use it almost exclusively for work and the GPU is generations behind what's on the market today. 

That's all about me :) I would be very grateful to anyone who would allow me to try the game first before I spend my money on it. ",1,t3_4bar3t,1,0,t3_4bar3t,d1luajn,t5_2w6ir,,False,0,1459523144,,1463149768,robovlk,blackdesertonline,False,

"&gt;Prior to the 2008 NSG exemption, some American lawmakers and Western European NSG members called for India to adopt stronger nonproliferation policies. These included signing and ratifying the CTBT, facilitating negotiations on the FMCT, and adopting stronger safeguards. 


&gt;The U.S. has argued that despite its status outside the NPT, India is sufficiently like-minded regarding nonproliferation to merit membership. Some skeptics, such as Switzerland, might be amenable to this argument if India demonstrated support for nonproliferation through concrete actions. Others, such as Austria, Ireland or New Zealand,may remain opposed on principle unless India joins the NPT, which is extremely unlikely as this would require Delhi to disarm.

"Pretty simple - Swedes see EU as something we pay and give a ton to, while getting very little in return.

Per capita, in terms of pure money in and out, Sweden are among the countries that pay absolutely the most to EU and get the least in return. Countries like Germany, UK and France of course pay more in absolute numbers, but when breaking down the numbers and calculating how much each and every EU-citizen pay or gain from EU, Swedes get the shaft, IIRC only the Netherlands pay more per capita. 

Meanwhile, all the free trade stuff basically mean that Swedish producers and workers have to compete against others from the EU zone on unfair terms - Swedish regulations are in most cases a lot stricter than the rest of the EU, driving up our production costs.

Swedish farmers are a dying breed, they have to adhere to some of the words strictest regulations and taxes, driving up their costs - and then they are supposed to compete against farmers from the rest EU who are allowed to pour antibiotics down the throats of their animals etc.

Most construction works these days use cheap labor from Eastern Europe, companies don't have to pay what's considered a fair salary in Sweden if they bring in guest workers from other parts of the EU - so Swedish workers costs several times more to hire than a Polish or Estonian worker, who are allowed to come and work in Sweden for salaries that's fair in their own countries but would leave a Swede starving and unable to pay rent. 

Lorry drivers likewise face unfair competition, having to follow strict regulations regarding vehicle safety, rest periods, etc, and needing to be paid a wage that you can live off in Sweden, while the competitors from other EU-countries can pay their drivers crap salaries and don't give a shit about regulations, vehicle safety, etc.

This is just some examples, there's more, but the idea is pretty much the same all over - Swedish workers and companies getting shafted and eventually having to shut down/lose their jobs due to not being allowed to compete on the same terms. 

At the same time, the open borders stuff has also meant that suddenly we have Rumanian beggars outside of every store and supermarket - that alone is bad enough for most Swedes. We have a extensive social security that ensure that pretty much no Swede need to go hungry or without a place to sleep - this was something we prided ourselves on, we took care of our poor and vulnerable... but now we have *another country's* poor and vulnerable begging on our streets? WTF?! We fixed our own problems, now we have to fix Rumania's problems? Yeah, no, screw that... 

On top of that though, those beggars have to live somewhere - they have to sleep and shit somewhere - and they did. They built shanty towns - and when the property owners contacted the police to have them evicted, the police said ""LOL NOPE! Not our job!"". Then the property owner got fined for not keeping their property clean and in line with regulations... Some even beggars broke into a holiday cottage and started living there - and when the owners called the police, they got the response that the police wasn't allowed to evict the people who'd broken into and started living in their second home...

Basically, the Rumanian beggars were treated by the police as if they were a group of people who didn't have to follow normal Swedish laws that apply to normal Swedes - This obviously caused a lot of anger, directed primarily at our own police, but also at the EU. 

Another problem with the whole open borders is that we've gotten a lot more organized crime, esp. from Eastern Europe - We have a big problem with organized criminals basically going on tour in Sweden, traveling through the country and stealing where they get a chance, and then being able to easily cross the borders and get out of the country with their haul due to the whole ""free movement of persons"" that we got due to EU. The gas/diesel thefts are esp. bad - since the thieves cause great deal of damages when they drill through the foresting or construction machines to get to the gas-tank, and companies are getting hit repeatedly, threatening their whole existence.

"The Geneva Convention is a joke.  The US is expected to live by it while everyone else ignores it.  On Dec. 8, 1949 Iran signed the treaty, but in 1979 they seized U.S. hostages, tortured them and kept them prisoners for over a year.  

Lebanon signed it on Dec. 8, 1949, and they too took U.S. hostages in the 1980s.

Our enemies ignore the ""rules of war"" -- but we are expected to abide by them and even pay for the rest of the world.   Trump is right -- the Geneva convention, NATO and even the UN are farces - and farces we pay through the nose for.

The nations of Europe are not seeking to  partition the territories of the Russian Federation like they 100 years ago.

Clyne would certainly replace your starting RB.

They knew that under war conditions and spending time in refugee/POW camps, those who refused to go would eventually either starve or succumb to disease without supplies. This would ensure their victory not of the war but of the minds in European nations.

They based their entire modern religion and manifest destiny off of their trademarked ""Holocaust"" that was first introduced in the early 70's as a way to market and exploit the minds of people and the West's coffers of these tools for which modern corporate foundations take a page in extracting taxes from the population through false guilt/empathy. They basically had Germany pay to built israel in their image.

Their holocaust is like 9/11, all but proven contrived only because discussion is made to seem silly and treasonous despite the facts.

"Your argument about manipulation applies in the same way for representatives voting on a proposal in an indirect democracy, but let me expand on it a little bit. not only can the government when proposing a new law formulate it in the way it likes (which might influence the voting the same way it does with referenda) before putting it up to a 'dumbed down' yes/no vote before the representatives, agents can talk to them, seduce them, even buy them to manipulate the vote. this is everyday reality in Dutch politics (my brother quit the game because of it).

No one bothers bribing sixteen million voters (and if they do, i'd say great because i'd get some too).

"&gt; Right now there is a problem and no one dares to talk about it. 

What is the problem though? A travel/visa ban will do nothing to stop the radicalization of Muslims in the US; neither from radical Muslims already resident, nor from social media. The involvement of ""refugees"" in European Terrorism has gone hand-in-hand with European Muslim involvement. In the US, the Muslim terrorists have been citizens, or on extended visas.

Trump's ""solution"" is a placebo made to make people feel safe; like The Wall, it will neither address the problem, nor substantially prevent it from entering the country. It won't stop people from being killed,, but rather it will leave to die tens of thousands of people trapped between Assad's brutality, and ISIS' genocidal ambitions. 

The problem with discussing ""radical Islam"" is that so many people assume there is one set of radicals, and every Muslim is either a radical or a moderate. It's an ignorant, reductionist division of the world; its simplicity is likely why Trump uses it. 

By the way, but as the article states Trump's wealthy Muslim friends won't be subject to the same restrictions. If you can't trust the Us government to vet Muslims, then how could you trust some wealthy businessman/outside politician?

P.S. *We* don't have a problem. Europe has a problem. The Middle East has a problem. The Levant has a metric fuckton of problem.

"* Pucatrade is a pyramid scheme
* 100pp=0.60USD means that people with points wants to cash-out
*  There is a massive push for premium users
* There is nothing stopping Puca in created account, pumping points and sucking from market staples to resale for real $. 

All i said and will be saying is that the perfect solution is provided by magiccardmarket.eu im a user there i buy cards for cash and sell cards for cash. This way i operate using cash and not artificial currency. Also i operate on equal terms with other users which means i'm not being disadvantaged in actually making trades. 

Last but not the least, turning bad cards into good cards can be done and also takes time just like on Puca with one difference, you can always cash out in an easy way.

EDIT:
Why i think Puca model is bad and conjured currency model is bad ? Because XYZ card is tied to TCG mid price but not to the amount of total puca points in circulation. Thats why your 1 puca point loses value when card moves and when new puca points are added in form of free giveaways to the system. In normal economy there is only X USD in circulation and once FED prints ( adds to economy money ) single USD loses its value / buying power. Now in PUCA inflation and hyperinflation happens because by now points lost almost 40% of their value but also what happens in PUCA and doesn't happen in normal economy is that Card Value in PUCA is tied to non puca price as TCG mid. So what you do in Puca trade is effective use of USD dollars in form of PUCA PONITS and buying using dollars in form of puca points but with extra layer of inflation / hyperinflation added on top of it. **PucaTrade company acts like FED but in an uncontrolled way.** (if i'm wrong please explain to me that this doesn't happen) ",2,t3_4cwgdz,2,1,t3_4cwgdz,d1m0qvv,t5_2qn5f,pblue,False,0,1459532175,,1463152809,JakubOboza,magicTCG,1459536540,

&gt; the chemical had no effect on rats fed thousands of times the amount a typical person ingests, government scientists are reporting in the journal Toxicological Sciences.

Now, that directly contradicts [other less reliable sources](http://www.seattleorganicrestaurants.com/vegan-whole-foods/avoid-canned-food/) that claim, ""BPA kills rats in laboratories even at smaller portions, like 1,000 times less than what an average American consumes per meal.""

So, hippie organic food places, the exact same people who are hard-lined anti-GMO, are the same people pushing lies about the risks of BPA. They accurately will point out that 17% of an American's diet comes from canned food, and that 50% of canned food has BPAs used, and they will accurate point out that BPAs are (to a degree) toxic in humans. It's also important to note that BPA's are found in bottled water, and virtually everyone in America is  exposed to BPAs regularly.

**But what is the toxin levels we're talking about here?**

A scientist at the National Institute of Health - you know, people who actually check on these things - says,

&gt; ...even when rats got more than 70,000 times what a typical American ingests, there was no change in body weight, reproductive organs or hormone levels, the scientists reported. ""In the low-dose range, there really were no biologically significant changes observed at all..."" 

&gt; It was only when exposures were millions of times higher than what people typically get that the scientists saw changes like those caused by the body's own sex hormones.

"Well, the Model S is a high end luxury/sports car.  I bought a used Prius myself because I ran the math and no electric car could, in a 6-7 year timeframe, make up for the fact that I could buy the car used for thousands of dollars less.

That's actually interesting math on the gas prices.  I admit, last time I ran the numbers and concluded the Tesla was dramatically cheaper than the Prius, gas costed significantly more.  With $4/gal gas, the Prius is nearly twice as expensive to operate. While I'm in the US, I actually live in a region with $0.06 kwh electricity, so for me, the difference is doubled again.  Re-run your number with 2014 gas prices and my local electricity prices, and you'll get the Prius being nearly four times as expensive as a Tesla.  Obviously, gas prices have halved and my region has cheap electricity.

(Keep in mind that many places in Europe have $8/gallon gas.  So this is obviously very dependent on your region.  The US currently has among the cheapest gas prices.)

I'll agree with you that, based on that math with current US averages for gas and electricity prices, a 52 MPG Prius and a Tesla would get pretty similar transportation costs.  However, the gas is more expensive in most of the rest of the world and the Tesla is cheaper to run in below-average electricity regions, so there's many, many cases in which the Tesla significantly beats the Prius.  Further, both the Prius and Tesla crush the average 30 mpg car.

"&gt;Compared to a lot of European and Scandinavian countries.

This isn't even correct

America is culturally very different to many of those countries as well. Canada has state funded religious Catholic schools? On we to the right on that? Europe has a more regressive tax code? Or we to the right on that? Europe has lower corporate taxes Many European countries have harsher abortion limits America. Europe has far more politically powerful nationalist movements. Many countries in Europe have entirely private emergency services. Europe has far more restrictions on free speech. Australia has way more state censorship. Japan has way stricter immigration policies. The UK has a state religion. So if we're to the left to all those countries on all of those issues, how are we so decidedly to the right in your view?

&gt;I also think it's insane that you're trying to define a party with policies that haven't even been implemented yet, such intellectual dishonesty.

Yes, Hillary is center-left to left depending on the issue. There are many Republican ideas that poll equally well.

&gt;But I'd like the point out how you completely ignore the adoption of the religious right by the Republicans - that single event alone represents a major shift to the right, especially on social issues.

Republicans haven't moved to the right on social policy any time recently. I don't know why you're actually like the conservative party have socially conservative positions makes them far right?

"This is an independent bottling of Caol Ila, the largest Islay distillery. A lot of Caol Ila‚Äôs stuff goes to making blends, particularly it gives the smoky character to the Johnnie walker blends. There are some fantastic independent bottlings of Caol Ila, however this is the first time I‚Äôll be trying something similar in age to the 12 year old original bottling that serves as the core expression.


Maltbarn is a relatively small bottler from Germany, known for good quality, albeit somewhat pricey bottlings.

**Aged 14 years. 58.8%ABV. Matured in a sherry cask. No colour added, non-chill filtered and bottled at cask strength from a single cask.**

* **Nose:**  Very much a Caol Ila. Salty, mineral peat. Bonfire ash. Citric acid. Slight hint of musty old books (refill sherry?). Earthy green herbs, fennel, thyme, sage. Treated thatch roofing. There‚Äôs a slight woody sweetness hiding under all the layers as well.

* **Palate:** Sharp salt and mineral peat. Lemon bitters. Quite a creamy mouthfeel. Some porridge notes. Citrus oil. Sandalwood. Some caramel candies.

* **Finish:** Long. Peat. Ash. Oil smoke. Lemon rind. Brown sugar.

**Rating:** Try this

**Global VFM:** 2/5

**Local VFM:** N/A

This was had a lot of the standard Caol Ila profile, but had a lot more kick and complexity to it on account of being cask strength and without chill filtration. The sherry influence was barely noticeable so probably a refill cask, but a good one. Just a tad on the pricey side of things at around 115 Euros on the EU market.

"As someon who lives in NZ, and down the road from a freedom camping spot that is now closed this is what happens.

The council got fed up with freedom campers using the central city for freedom camping and leaving the city in a mess, so decided to allocated 2 areas in the city for freedom campers, both had public toilets decent sized carpark, and a huge field next to it. it was actually pretty cool to see a dedicated camping site next to the city

Within 2 weeks of it being used, the sports field was being used as a camping ground with tents, cars had somehow made it onto the grass, ruining the field for sports.

The provided rubbish bins were either filled to the brim with human waste or stuff that shouldnt be in it. 

and the public toilets were destroyed. Tourists broke the locks on the toilet doors, the seats themselves, the basins were hanging off the block wall as they tried to sit in them and wash themselves etc.

Now the council wasn't charging for the area at all despite providing amenities, and now they have to pay to repair all the damage that occurred in a 2 month period. 
And not just where i am, there are reports of them shitting in clean waterways and areas that have now tested positive for E.coli. thats bullshit that individuals can do this and suffer no reprocussions. 
I know if i was caught doing it id get a huge fine, yet they get a ""its a freedom camper thing"" just let it go.

I understand that it is not all freedom tourists that do this, in fact when i go to europe in 2018 i plan on doing freedom camping as well, but it was ruined by a large number of people not having respect for the surroundings, the surrounding people and in general human decency.

They are saying that to show solidarity with you, and saying that extremism hurts them as well. What do you want them to say? You want them to denounce it, but seem upset that they distance themselves from it.

&gt;Islam hasn't had that reformation.

I'm not sure the Christian reformation is what you think it was. It was a period of brutal wars. The English Civil war, the Thirty Year War, it's the enlightenment period in which secular thought and liberalism grew. 

This is a great article on the subject.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/17/islam-reformation-extremism-muslim-martin-luther-europe

&gt;Islam hasn't had that reformation and we see what happens in countries like Iran and Afghanistan when the extremists get into the moderate communities.


In the case of Iran, the US and UK overthrew the secular democratically elected Prime Minister because he wanted to nationalize his own oil, and then instituted a brutal dictator, which led to the Iranian Revolution. If other countries hadn't messed with Iran for their own self interest, it would likely be a secular democracy today.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat

In the case of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union and the US used it as a staging ground for their proxy wars for many decades, which led to the country being the mess it is today.

&gt;I think the fear of all of this is heightened right now because we legitimately don't know what's going on in Europe.

"This article is a masterpiece of misinformation.

http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/david-cameron-accused-failing-uk-steel-industry-blocking-eu-lesser-duty-proposal

The UK wanted to raise duty on Chinese steel, and was pushing hard to make this come about faster. What we vetoed was the removal of the lesser duty rule. According to EU regulations the anti dumping measure that can be taken has to be the margin by which the dumping has occurred. However there is something called the lesser duty rule that allows for a lower rate to be applied. This rate is still higher than the current rate, but lower than the dumping margin.

http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/april/tradoc_151017.pdf

The removal of the lesser duty rule means that the dumping margin would have to be applied, not that no increase could be applied at all. And it was thought that given the reliance of British industry on Chinese Steel that the removal of this rule would increase the price so high that it would be damaged.

What the Tata Steel crisis tells us about Brexit is that if we were not a part of the EU we could have swiftly risen the duty to a sensible level that would have protected both the producers of British steel and the British users of steel.",4,t3_4cvx19,4,0,t3_4cvx19,d1m5x8g,t5_2qhcv,,False,0,1459539338,,1463155318,drukath,ukpolitics,False,

"I get what you're saying, but the Noridic nations only have roughly 26 million people living in a pretty small space (comparatively), while sharing a very similar cultural ancestry, race, and belief systems. This leads to a much more homogeneous culture. You get to see a much larger percent of your population on a day to day basis and thus can connect with a far greater percent of your population.

The USA has 320 million people of an extremely diverse ancestral background spread over an area roughly the size of Europe. I don't think the Nordic people have a very strong sense of ""we"" with the people of Portugal, but that's exactly what is demanded of Americans who live on one of the coasts. It's really hard to have a sense of ""we"" when those people are 3000 miles away and have a widely different culture than yourself.  

I personally have a much greater attachment to the people of my region, most specifically those living in my state. I would much rather pay higher state taxes to help the people around me as I can see their struggles on a day to day basis. I think most Americans think the same as me. It's much easier to connect with those who you can routinely see and interact with. 

The problems with Sander's plans is that they address the nation as whole. We already have extremely mismanaged and bloated social welfare programs on the federal level that simply are not adequate for the strains our growing population is putting on them. They require yearly spending increases all while decreasing in their efficiency to effectively distribute the money and services to those who need it. It seems like a very bad return on our investment. 

This is why I disagree with such a focus on the federal level to address the US's problems. I pay a lot of federal taxes now, but it's only from my local governments do I really see any services being rendered to me. It's really hard for me to get behind increasing my federal taxes for the hope that somebody, thousands of miles away from me, is going to be a little better off.

Study the literature on the subject. I mean the data and fact based literature, not the belief based lit.

Look I get it. Most of the people that have visceral reactions to this subject, even discussing it, are doing so because you're both afraid and indoctrinated into the ideologies that have grown over the past 30 years quite rapidly, that there is a sex predator class out there, and that pedophiles and child molesters lurk around every corner waiting to torture a childs mind for the rest of their lives with one act. That is not the truth behind teen+adult sex, though.

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=feminism+age+of+consent+protection+for+girls

    Statutory rape laws (which are called by a plethora of other names) refer to those laws that ‚Äúcriminalize voluntary sexual acts involving a minor that would be legal if not for the age of one or more of the participants.‚Äù The premise behind these laws is that until a certain age, young people are incapable of giving their consent for sexual behavior but the intent behind the laws has morphed over the 700 years or so since they were first codified. The first known law, passed in Westminster England in 1275, made it illegal to ‚Äúravish‚Äù a ‚Äúmaiden‚Äù under the age of 12 (also the age at which a girl could legally marry) without her consent. Later laws reduced this age to 10 or 11. The result was that an underage girl did not have to show that she had struggled in order to prove that she had not given her consent as her older friends did. Age of consent laws, therefore, made it easier to prosecute a man who sexually assaulted an underage girl.

    The acknowledged purpose of these laws was to protect the young girl‚Äôs ‚Äúchastity,‚Äù possibly so as not to ruin her future chances for marriage.

    The acknowledged purpose of these laws was to protect the young girl‚Äôs ‚Äúchastity,‚Äù possibly so as not to ruin her future chances for marriage.

    The acknowledged purpose of these laws was to protect the young girl‚Äôs ‚Äúchastity,‚Äù possibly so as not to ruin her future chances for marriage.

    Though they remained largely unchanged for several centuries, the laws began to morph in the late 1800s and early 1900s as other aspects of societies and the role of women changed. European nations and U.S. states slowly raised the age to 13 and 14 under scientific arguments that this is when young women begin to menstruate and reach physical maturity. In the 1920s and 30s as the modern concept of the teenager began to emerge and movements formed to fight child prostitution and exploitation, the age of consent in most states was raised to 16 or even 18.

    Not everyone agreed with these changes, however, some argued that teenage women ‚Äúwere sufficiently developed not to need legal protection,‚Äù and, moreover, that ‚Äúby late adolescence girls possessed sufficient understanding about how to use the law to blackmail unwary men.‚Äù

    Steven Robertson of the University of Australia Sydney points out in an article that the term ‚Äújailbait,‚Äù gained popularity in the 1930s because people recognized ‚Äúteenage girls as sexually attractive, even sexually active, but legally unavailable.‚Äù

Do some research on the subject. Feminists in particular pushed for raising the age of consent to protect girls from being ""manipulated into sex/used for sex"" by older men. If the idea is to protect them from being manipulated into sex, because of the fake or real aftereffects, then the law should not make a distinction between a 15-17 year old male or a 19+ year old male manipulated a teen girl into sex.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/womens-long-battle-to-define-rape/2012/08/24/aa960280-ed34-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html

    The earliest challenges emerged in the 1840s, just as the women‚Äôs rights movement was coalescing. Reformers tried to make it easier to prosecute white men who had been neither strangers nor violent. They sought criminal penalties to discourage what they called ‚Äúthe licentious man‚Äù from coercing, persuading or pressuring a young woman to have sex, especially through a false promise of marriage. By 1900, their lobbying campaigns had succeeded in most states, making seduction by an acquaintance, regardless of consent or force, a lesser crime than rape but still punishable by fines and imprisonment.

    A subsequent national campaign, endorsed by temperance and suffrage advocates, called for increasing the age at which a young woman could legally consent to sex beyond the common-law standard of 10. At a time when women could not vote, they gathered tens of thousands of signatures on petitions and lobbied male officials. By 1900, they had convinced legislators in 32 states ‚Äî primarily in the North and the Midwest ‚Äî to increase the age of consent to between 14 and 18. These statutory rape laws did not require evidence of force or resistance for a conviction, but the penalties were less severe.

"I'll just copy/paste this analysis I made of TCW Era Maul's physical attributes from another thread.    
  
--------------------
  
**MAUL:**  
  
**PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:**  
A half-Zabrak, half-Human Male, standing at over 2 metres tall, Maul was a physical tank. His Zabrak half allowed him natural pain tolerance and his human half granted him resiliancy.   
Maul's two main feats when it comes to his physical capabilities are his resiliancy/endurance and his martial skill, though the former is more prominant an attribute.   

The majority of his training with Sidious was either bladework, or testing his endurance. Constantly submitted to torture during his training, he was built to resist pain. He has even been able to resist the effects of force lightning subjected upon him by a nightsister, though she was likely no where near as proficiant in the ability as Dooku. Maul, being the physical tank that he is, would be able to endure an incredibly long fight, he would be able to endure glances from his opponents glancing blows and he could endure the pain of being slammed with the force. Wearing Maul down would not work effectively, especially for opponents with dwindling endurance.   Eventually, he would endure and his opponent would begin to slow down, at which point he would take an advantage. Nothing but a strike as decisive as a decapitation, lunge through the chest or bisection/slash deep through the torso would take him out of the fight.  

Maul was a trained martial artist in Teras Kasi. Teras Kasi practitioners was known for being adept at hand to hand combat and using speedy attacks, with offense and defense in mind, able to dodge blows and slip away from decisive strikes. They were also trained to close off their mind from force users, able to defend themselves from mental attacks. Teras Kasi was designed for non-force users to combat force users specifically. Maul used it in tandem with his force augmentation (which further increases his speed) and only the few could match his martial talent.    
  
**DUELING:**  
Although he would use both a double bladed lightsaber and a single bladed lightsaber during his time as a Sith, I will be observing his use of the single bladed variant as it had a more prolific use during his time in the Clone wars, which is where I am examining him.  
Maul would be trained by Sidious to specialize in form VII: Juyo, the final and most agressive of all lightsaber forms. Juyo drew from the dark side and on the emotions, particularly rage, of the practicioner. Many users of Juyo would incorperate Dun Moch into their arsenal, and whilst Maul was more concerned with the physical aspects of the form, he was no exception, using it against Obi-Wan during the clone wars. Juyo users were, however, also known for being very aggressive and offensive, often leaving themselves open to counter attacks.  

Maul would also become proficiant in the use of Niman, particularly the dueling style of Niman, focusing more on the physical aspects rather than incorperating the force into his attacks. Also, particularly, he would focus on using the duel-fencing Jar'kai variant of Niman. As I mentioned before, Niman as a dueling form, was more of a jack of all trades form. It had no particular strengths and no particular weaknesses.     
Although never stated, Maul likely has knowledge of Ataru as he often incorperated acrobatics and martial arts, such as his proficiancy with Teras Kasi hand to hand combat. Form IV: Ataru was a form that incorperated speed, acrobatics and martial skill into the style. A form 4 user would use both their lightsaber and their body as a weapon.  
These styles would complement his physical abilities.  
He was adept at incorperating martial arts into his attacks and utilized both his impressive speed and endurance to his advantage.  
He was also somewhat tactical in dueling his opponents. Rather than charging ahead, if he could not outduel his opponents, he would attempt to control the fight, leading it around and wearing his opponent down, incorperating his endurance by drawing the fight out on his terms, and incorperating his agility and speed by somersaulting and flipping with ease, leading the battle to a place of his choosing, as he did against Qui-Gon.     

-----------------------------------------
 
  
Also, whilst in the TV series and Movies, Jedi and Sith appear to only move as fast as regular humans (except in, what, a single/few instances) in both the EU and Canon (assuming Film novels are still canon, which I believe they are)  Jedi actually move at FTE speeds.  
In some cases, especially powerful force sensitives can appear FTE to the massivly FTE.  
Considering even Grievous can appear largely FTE at times and Maul is the better combatant than, him, I'm inclined to believe Maul is incredibly fast when compared to non-force-sensitive combatants.    
I.E, whilst he cannot use the force offensively in this fight, he can use it to augment his own speed and sense his surroundings.   
However, enough skill, prep or power should be sufficient to defeat him.  
  
Also, in this match-up. Whilst his is unfamiliar with metal staffs in comparison to plasma based weapons, making his style of quick slashing attacks, rather useless, he definitely has incredible strength, speed and martial skill to back it up.

"I'll take the questions one at the time. 

1. The main reason for the whole action was maintaining the feeling of losing control, I feel like.  It was officially part of the Netherlands, so it was tremendously large compared to the NL. Just imagine the bigger part of your country breaking into riots and other turmoil because they want to become independent. 

2. In the end, there was little to no gain from to whole ordeal on the side of the Netherlands: lost 5k; got tapped on the fingers by the US for what happened; and, the shame which there still is to this day. On the other hand, Indonesia lost a huge amount of people, but they got what they were aiming for. Independence. 

3. In the Netherlands there's one of the oldest monarchies in Europe, or even the world for that matter. At the time, we had a Queen, Juliana of I recall correctly from way back when I got taught the stuff. There's a King at the moment, Willem. Although, they have little to no power. They don't make decisions, have unlimited access, et cetera. It's more out of tradition than anything, frankly.

Thought that article also names Geithner as another major villain. 

&gt;the Goldman Sachs view of the economy. You cause collateral damage all over, but that‚Äôs what Wall Street does. You can‚Äôt punish them for it. They‚Äôre just doing what a predatory financial institution does. So Obama said ‚ÄúNo, , I‚Äôm not going to do that,‚Äù [meaning write down the mortgage debts as he had promised voters in Column A]. He came in and appointed Wall Street‚Äôs main lobbyist, Tim Geithner, as Treasury Secretary.

&gt;Geithner appears in almost every dirty dealing episode of the book. He was the bagman. He was the person who [Sheila Baoir] accused of blocking the FDIC when it wanted to take over Citibank, which not only was broke but was a criminalized organization.

&gt;Geithner was suitably rewarded by getting a rich job on Wall Street. The Japanese call that ‚Äúdescent from heaven.‚Äù When you take your rewards, having sold out the economy to your backers, you get a nice job and end up rich for life.

&gt;And when Greece had real problems, the fact that the German and French banks had made too many loans to it, the IMF was going to write down the Greek debt. But then Geithner got on the phone with Europe, and Obama went to the G20 meetings and said, ‚ÄúLook, you can‚Äôt write off the Greek debt, because the American banks have essentially turned into horse race betters. We have casino capitalism. They have bet and promised to guarantee, the Greek bonds. If the Greek bonds are written down, the American banks will go under. And if we go under, we promise we‚Äôre going to bring you down too. We‚Äôre going to bring down the European banks. Do you really want that to happen?‚Äù

&gt;So the gambles made by Wall Street ended up almost driving Greece out of the European Union. Wall Street was willing to tear Europe apart politically just for the Wall Street investment banks ‚Äì basically four banks ‚Äì to make gains by insuring the Greek debt, by treating the financial market like a horse race.

&gt;That‚Äôs where we are now. It‚Äôs not really about imperialism draining foreign economies. It‚Äôs Wall Street making bets. And essentially it‚Äôs by Wall Street running the European Central Bank. Just like Europe has to do burden sharing in NATO, the financial ministries have to do burden sharing with the U.S. Treasury.

Of course the real villains are the wealthy. Rubin and Geithner just work for them. They are the ones we need to feed to the guillotine. ",1,t1_d1mcve6,1,0,t3_4cxuoy,d1md2lf,t5_2qh4r,,False,0,1459549992,,1463158698,alllie,conspiracy,False,
"As someone who is not European but enjoys history I was surprised to find out how big PLC was or that Austria was one of the strongest nations in Europe when I started playing the game, so I had similar questions. But I think the wiki article about PLC answers this pretty well (I copy pasted some isolated sentences that help answering your question):

&gt;State organization and politics - The monarch's power was limited, in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to uphold the Henrician Articles... Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the Pacta Conventa, specific pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war, and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones)... When presented with periodic opportunities to fill the throne, the szlachta exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not found another strong dynasty. This policy often produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able Transylvanian Stefan Batory (1576‚Äì86), the kings of foreign origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house... The Commonwealth's political system was vulnerable to outside interference, as Sejm deputies bribed by foreign powers might use their liberum veto to block attempted reforms. This sapped the Commonwealth and plunged it into political paralysis and anarchy for over a century, from the mid-17th century to the end of the 18th, while its neighbors stabilized their internal affairs and increased their military might.

&gt;Economy - The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the plantation system (serfs)... This economic arrangement worked well for the ruling classes in the early era of the Commonwealth, which was one of the most prosperous eras of the grain trade. The economic strength of Commonwealth grain trade waned from the late 17th century on. Trade relationships were disrupted by the wars and the Commonwealth proved unable to improve its transport infrastructure or its agricultural practices...
Urban population of the Commonwealth was low compared to Western Europe. Exact numbers depend on calculation methods. Accordng to one source, the urban population of the Commonwealth was about 20% of the total in the 17th century, compared to approximately 50% in the Netherlands and Italy. Another source suggests much lower figures: 4‚Äì8% urban population in Poland, 34‚Äì39% in the Netherlands and 22‚Äì23% in Italy. The Commonwealth's preoccupation with agriculture, coupled with the szlachta's privileged position when compared to the bourgeoisie, resulted in a fairly slow process of urbanization and thus a rather slow development of industries... The Commonwealth imported wine, fruit, spices, luxury goods (e.g. tapestries, Pic. 5), clothing, fish, beer and industrial products like steel and tools. A few riverboats carried south imports from Gda≈Ñsk like wine, fruit, spices and herring. Somewhere between the 16th and 17th centuries, the Commonwealth's trade balance shifted from positive to negative.

&gt;Military - Commonwealth forces were engaged in numerous conflicts in the south (against the Ottoman Empire), the east (against the Tsardom of Muscovy, later known as the Russian Empire) and the north (the Kingdom of Sweden); as well as internal conflicts (most notably, numerous Cossack uprisings). For the first century or so, the Commonwealth military was usually successful, but became less so from around the mid-17th century. Plagued by insufficient funds, it found itself increasingly hard-pressed to defend the country, and inferior in numbers to the growing armies of the Commonwealth's neighbors.",4,t3_4cy0ko,4,0,t3_4cy0ko,d1md4ys,t5_2uqat,,False,0,1459550101,,1463158729,aka_someone,eu4,1459550378,

"&gt;Could something like the EU tariff throttle the dumping of Chinese steel matched with a large government package such as tax cuts and investment to modernise the and this eventually drive down the price of steel be effective ?

In theory.

TATA's argument is that the government should subsidise the British steel plant more to much other countries. 

It's like the rich saying you should give us a tax break or we will leave the country, apart from the more we subsidise steel works unless there's actual innovation and improvement it's just wasted money.

&gt; Lastly would it also not to an extent spread out the cost ? So construction costs goes up but modernising the industry would get it to drop in the long term and there remains a steel industry.

Apart from the fact this is unlikely to happen. China just has lower costs than us, in particular because the Chinese government is backing their steel works and subsidising it all. Even if we do manage to become more efficient, China can still just subsidise their steel. 

That's even ignoring that fact that the UK has some of the lowest productivity figures in the G8 and we don't have a great track record with government bailouts for manufacturing companies.",1,t1_d1ktr3j,1,0,t3_4cp8rh,d1md813,t5_30c1v,,False,0,1459550238,Labour Member,1463158768,Kitchner,LabourUK,False,

"L'anse aux meadows in Newfoundland (Canada) is dated to right around 1,000 AD (+/- a few years) and was quickly abandoned. So this site is likely to from right around the same time, as it's also on Newfoundland. The saga's talk about voyages further south from the L'anse aux meadows site, So people have been hoping to find the other site (or sites) for a long time.

Pretty much any history course that deals with North American settlement, Medieval Europe or Vikings will at least briefly cover L'anse aux meadows or give it a quick mention, Sometimes giving note to the possibility of other settlements.

I've been to the L'anse aux meadows site one summer, There is not much is there. The place basically consists of a tour guide or two and another employee in the visitor's building that has a very small gift shop with snacks, and a few small rooms with artifacts, replicas, and paintings that depict what the site may have looked like, Outside there are some recreated buildings and a boardwalk that runs around the place. The site is remote even by Newfoundland standards, Being at the northern edge of the Island.

The new site looks to be just as remote, Although I can hardly wait to see what they find there.

The point I want to make here is that ""Viking"" settlement of Newfoundland is nothing new, it's well documented and established in academia. So any Mormons thinking of Nephi and friends are going to be sorely disappointed.

"Friedrich Paul Berg

Today at the former German concentration camp at Dachau, it is no longer claimed that Jews or anyone else were ever killed in the gas chamber there. In the room that is supposedly a gas chamber, one can clearly read a sign written by the museum authorities in five languages which says, ""THE GAS CHAMBER disguised as a 'shower room' ‚Äì- never used as a gas chamber.""[1] Although the room was completed in 1942, it was never used for its intended purpose -‚Äì presumably, it was used for other purposes; perhaps it was used as a shower room after all.

At the western end of the crematorium building which houses the so-called gas chamber ""disguised as a shower room,"" one can today see and walk through four delousing chambers which were used to fumigate clothing.[2] The only explanation regarding these chambers is a sign above them, also in five languages, which simply says ""Fumigation cubicles"" in English and Desinfektionskammern in German. There is no mention anywhere within the camp of the important fact that these chambers used Zyklon-B to fumigate clothing as well as other articles placed within the chambers.

The ""shower room"" is not a gas chamber at all, but the so-called ""fumigation cubicles"" are gas chambers. Moreover, the ""fumigation cubicles "" are extremely well-designed gas chambers which represented, and may still represent, the state of the art in gas chamber design. They were the product of more than 20 years of research and development into the application of hydrocyanic acid (often referred to simply as cyanide) for the extermination of vermin. This is clearly shown by the extensive German technical literature from the end of World War I through World War II on this subject.[3]

The delousing chambers at Dachau were far superior in design to the gas chambers which are still used in this country for the execution of criminals. As a consequence of their design, the operating procedures for the delousing chambers at Dachau were quite simple; for example, although gas masks had to be available, the operators were only required to use them in emergencies or in special situations. By contrast, the American gas chambers for executions still require the use of gas masks during the normal post-execution procedures. Compared to the American gas chambers, the German delousing chambers at Dachau were also safer to operate and far less expensive to construct.[4]

At the end of this article I have added a translation of one of the many articles that can be found in the German wartime technical and medical literature discussing the proper use of Zyklon-B for the control of typhus through the extermination of its principal carrier, the body louse. (See appendix.) The article by Emil Wustinger is especially important because of the numbers it gives to show the extent to which the Zyklon-B delousing technology was actually used by the Germans to save people from the ravages of typhus. According to Wustinger, 25 million people had already had their clothing and personal belongings fumigated from the start of the war until the beginning of 1944. This number is, interestingly enough, the same as the one which appears in the Gerstein statement as the number of people who had been ""killed"" in gas chambers.
Zyklon B
Until the introduction of DDT by the Americans and by the Germans in 1944, the delousing of not only clothing but also living quarters, especially barracks, and railroad trains in order to kill body lice was the only effective means of controlling the spread of typhus. Until the arrival of DDT, the most effective pesticide for killing body lice, i.e., for delousing, was Zyklon-B.

When Exterminationists claim, as Raul Hilberg did in The Destruction of the European Jews (1961 edition, pp. 565-67) that Zyklon-B was simply the commercial name for prussic acid (hydrocyanic acid is the chemical term generally used for prussic acid), or that it was hydrogen cyanide solidified in pellets which passed ""immediately"" into the gaseous state upon being dropped into a gas chamber, they merely show that they have no idea as to what their great murder weapon really was.

Zyklon-B was, and still is, essentially a porous material with liquid hydrocyanic acid absorbed into it with a small amount of chemical stabilizer and warning ingredient added.[7] The absorbent material was generally diatomaceous earth but paper discs were also used, especially in the United States. After the hydrocyanic acid had completely evaporated, the porous material ‚Äì now completely harmless ‚Äì could be returned to a Zyklon dealer and refilled.

The speed with which hydrocyanic acid evaporates out of the Zyklon granules or paper discs is not instantaneous. Although the hydrocyanic acid does immediately begin to leave the porous material as soon as a can of Zyklon-B is opened, that does not mean it leaves all at once. On the contrary, it still takes about half an hour for most of the cyanide to leave under normal conditions and under normal room temperature, about 68 F. Even more time is needed for all the cyanide to leave the granules.

According to Dr. Gerhard Peters, who was the managing director of DEGESCH and who from the early 1930's through World War II was probably the most prolific advocate of Zyklon-B:[8]

. . . As a general rule, the material is spread out in a layer which is 1/2 to 1 cm thick, after which most of the hydrocyanic acid has already evolved after half an hour.[9]

Although the process begins immediately, it is nonetheless a gradual process. It can be speeded up by dispersing the granules in thinner layers or by using smaller granules to begin with or ‚Äì what is most important in order to understand how the standard delousing chambers worked ‚Äì by forcing air through the granules and/or by the addition of heat.

The importance of heat not only to prevent condensation during the venting of a cyanide gas chamber but also during the gassing phase itself is evident from the very title of a German patent which was granted to DEGESCH in 1940. The title of patent no. 700469 which took effect retroactively on July 26, 1934 reads:

Method for generating the necessary heat for the vaporization of poisonous substances for gases used for pest control [emphasis added]

The text of the patent explains at some length the need for heating in order to accelerate the release of fumigating gases such as hydrocyanic acid. The patent includes a schematic drawing showing the same circulatory equipment arrangement which was probably used in all of the standard DEGESCH gas chambers.

The importance of heat to the venting process is spelled out in the following text from Peters and W√ºstinger.

... As a consequence of the extensive preheating of the fresh air entering at D, the venting of the chamber is completed in 10 to 15 minutes. The carts can then be driven out and the articles of clothing can be immediately returned to their owners who in the meantime have had their bodies deloused.[10]",1,t1_d1mbx61,1,0,t3_4cie31,d1me8xm,t5_2qh4r,,False,0,1459551943,,1463159252,nrgiseternal,conspiracy,False,

"It's pretty much common in Poland for teams to struggle at some point. It's a long winded story, but only genuinely committed owners seem able to stand up to the ultras and make it clear that they're not particularly bothered if one stand lies empty because of the behaviour/otherwise of the ultras. The rest - for instance - ≈ölƒÖsk - have no such owners, hence the ultras turn stadiums into their personal playground. But then : even if the hooligans don't run the entire show, there's still plenty of nonsense going on behind the scenes. There was one particular scandal a few years back in Pozna≈Ñ when it was found that the leader (who had a stadium ban) of Wiara Pozna≈Ñ (the biggest ultras group) was actually running the catering at Bulgarska. 

The relations between teams (not just in Poland, but in the whole of what Brits would call Eastern Europe) is hideously complicated. For instance, we (Lech Pozna≈Ñ) have a friendship with KSZO Ostrowiec because some of our hooligans didn't get beaten up when they were in Ostrowiec. It goes beyond national borders - sometimes it's just because of common hatred, sometimes there's history involved. For instance, Lech Pozna≈Ñ hate Lechia Gda≈Ñsk because Lechia merged with Olimpia Pozna≈Ñ many years ago, and Olimpia Pozna≈Ñ were one of the so-called ""police"" teams during Communism while Lech were very much the people's team. 

From there, it leads to Lech Pozna≈Ñ hating ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw, because ≈ölƒÖsk and Lechia are friends. I'm not sure if it's still up to date, because I seem to remember something about the agreement ending between the two, but I don't remember. 

So: are you still following? From there, you get European friendships, which are sometimes too weird and long winded to be explained in any sensible way. Sometimes it's as simple as the previous mentioned situation between Lech Pozna≈Ñ and FK Sarajevo, but other times, it can be because small groups of ultras have established links with another team for whatever reason (if you ask me : probably something illegal was involved).

"Fair enough.

Though from a business sense, in the situation where one is applying a sceptical eye to all cases being made and finding they are possessed of little merit, the better option is to remain with the known quantity.

As for a compelling economic case, I can only share my understanding of it. I am not an economist, nor am I precisely a backer of the EU; just someone who finds themselves dismayed by a surge of wrong-headed right wing populism potentially walking Britain into an ill conceived action.

What we get is membership of the single market, and the ability to direct policy within the EU. These are not easy things to quantify, but with the first it's reasonably easy to see how elimination of trade barriers among our closest trading partners is a big boon to business. A good amount of people who are pro Brexit are also pro EEA; I don't feel this is an unreasonable statement to make. I know the counterpoint is to scream 'FTA!', but after having looked at how these things work, it's clear that such a deal is not going to offer the same benefits as EEA membership.

As for the second point about the ability to direct policy, it's even harder to quantify. Parking the political side of things, I see this as a necessary power to retain in order to continue pushing the single market to suit Britain's interests. Full liberalisation of services is foremost in my mind here - there's been some headway made in this area, but there's room for a lot more, and we will need to be pushing for it from positions of influence within the bloc to make it happen. Liberalised services are an incredibly difficult thing to make happen - the EU market is probably the only place in the world where it could be possible, and the benefits to our economy would be significant.

"Nobody bar a doubtful Cech comes back from injury.

Nobody gets injured during the internationals. But workloads differ:

* Heavy: Alexis, Campbell, Elneny, Ozil, and Bellerin all played 180 minutes. In particular, Alexis, Campbell, Elneny had 2 important qualifiers outside Europe. 

* Medium: Giroud, Kos, Welbeck, Chambers basically played 1 game. 

* Light: Walcott and Iwobi didn't start. Ospina is a GK. 

The goal of this match is to

* 1. win and get 3 points, revenge
* 2. score more goals to catch up goal differences
* 3. prepare for West Ham away next weekend

Now there are a few controversial points:

* GK(Cech Vs Ospina): If Cech is fit, play Cech. He needs to regain some match fitness before travelling to West Ham to redeem himself from the opening game of the season. 

* CB(Gabriel Vs Per): This one is difficult. Gabriel has the pace so we can play a high line and he is certainly better in this game against Ighalo who exploited Per's lack of pace in the FA Cup.  Per has the height, composure, and experience. I am leaning towards Per because Andy Carroll will certainly come on at some stage of the West Ham game and we need to give Per some game time to be fit. His experience will also be important in the final run of the season and it is awkward to bench the captain now. It is a 45/55 decision, truly difficult. Wenger will start Gabriel though. 

* Alexis(Left Vs. Right): Alexis' goal threat is minimised on the right but he is a better team player there. I still believe Aleixs' long term position will be on the left flank(with a fast striker up front). But in this particular game where Watford's LB is Ake, we need to exploit his weakness. Ake is said to have a good season but in the 2 games he faced us, he got dribbled past by Alexis, Ozil, and Bellerin repeatedly. His positioning and 1v1 are bad. Play Alexis on the right to fuck him up. 

* Winger(Iwobi Vs. Campbell Vs. Walcott): We need a fresh winger because Ozil, Alexis, Elneny, and Bellerin all had heavy international workloads. Walcott is not a good option when hard work is needed. Campbell lacks stamina and had 2 world cup qualifiers outside Europe so Iwobi should start.

* ST(Welbeck Vs. Giroud): Giroud has scored 0 goal in his last 10 PL matches. Start a fast striker.

"&gt;That's completely bunk, nobody here includes Native American history or European history when they think of American history. The vast majority of American history occurs after 1750.

True, but I think the same could be said of Russian history before the Grand Duchy of Muscovy in the 13th Century. Most people aren't talking about stuff happening in 750 AD when they discuss Russian history, so it's more like an additional 500 years of history AT MOST, not 1000. I know the Russians like to tie themselves to the Byzantines and ""third Rome"" and all that, but if we're being realistic...

Sorry to nit-pick, because I thought your analysis was pretty good otherwise, though perhaps underplaying Russian expansionism in favor of the ""under siege"" theme, but still.

"Stoner- John Williams ""the best American novel you have never heard of"" Stoner is about one man's life. William Stoner, the son of stoic Midwestern farmers grows up to become a professor of English literature and suffers through a brutal marriage. Highly recommended. Quick read. Good story. Simple. I would call it the most perfect novel I have ever read. Not incredibly ambitious (like I said, it is the life of one man).

I would also recommend John Williams's other two novels butchers crossing and Augustus. Butchers crossing is a western about an eager Ivy League student who moves west to come closer to nature (he fell in love with emerson's writing). He joins the buffalo hunter Miller on an epic expedition into a secret valley of prime buffalo, but nature can be just as harsh as it is beautiful.

Augustus is an epistolary novel about the life of gauis octavius, the adopted son (nephew by blood) of Caesar (the one who said et tu??!) this book won the national book award.

The Long Ships. An awesome adventure story about Vikings! Really fun story to follow as the Vikings travel around Europe and wreak havoc. Plus, treasure. 

Empire Falls by Richard Russo captures small town Maine perfectly. Russo can be pretty funny at times (if you enjoy Stoner and Empire Falls check out Russo's Straight Man. It's a funny novel that also deals with academia).

Here is one I'm sure no one has heard of... Honey from the Lion by Matthew Neil Null. The author is about 30 years old, and I think he could be the next Cormac McCarthy. His prose is difficult in the way that the prose of Blood Meridian is difficult. honey from the lion tells a story of the early days of West Virginia (where I am from) and follows a man named Cur as he attempts to unionize the workers of the timber industry. The book is 250 pages, but I wouldn't say it's a quick read like John Williams's 3 novels are. No, take your time on this one, but if you like southern gothic American literature, this book is wonderful.

And lastly, I'm currently reading Warlock. I wrote all of the above titles because I strongly recommend them. Warlock was strongly recommended to me because I have been reading a number of westerns this past year (blood meridian, lonesome dove, butchers crossing). I'm only a hundred pages in, but I'm not sure I love it. Unlike butchers crossing and blood meridian, the narrative does not strictly follow one crew. Instead, the point of view changes again and again as the author tries to introduce the reader to the many characters in the town of Warlock. This has been a bit confusing at times, and I've found myself rereading sections already. I'm hoping I can get acclimated to the novel's world and then really get into it, but for now I'm not sure I'd recommend this.",3,t3_4ch182,3,0,t3_4ch182,d1mi8p1,t5_2qhps,,False,0,1459559120,,1463161202,Kowalkowski,literature,False,

Most high frequency traders actually earn rebates from the exchanges for the liquidity they provide to the market. Liquidity yields better prices and helps all traders.

Before that the big improvements in health was improvements in sanitation engineering.  We could go on in a standoff on this issue.

"Okay look, the original image/joke relies on comparing events in two different times. So the whole premise of the discussion is already founded on comparing incongruent contexts. For what it's worth, I found the cartoon humorous and poignant. But again, to deconstruct it, the joke is saying ""what European nationalists are saying now is absurd in light of what seems to be a lack of awareness about your own history."" So the whataboutist says ""Muslims have a history too."" But it's not totally irrelevant because the original joke relies on history. Now, if the original image had been comparing the refugees on a boat (contemporary) with the caption ""invasion"" to drone strikes with the caption ""not an invasion"" (also contemporary), then someone saying ""Muslims have a history too,"" then that kind of whataboutist argument would be totally irrelevant.

"&gt; do you think freedom is something you always have to maximize ?

Absolutely. The problem with social welfare programs is that they are a quick fix and don't address the underlying issues. They aren't sustainable. At least in the U.S., children these days aren't taught to think creatively about free market solutions. Instead they are taught that government will handle all their problems. For example, healthcare in the U.S. is prohibitively expensive because of a government-sanctioned monopoly: The American Medical Association (AMA) and the [RUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Society_Relative_Value_Scale_Update_Committee). It amounts to a government-protected monopoly over the licensing of medical professionals and procedures. That's not a free market at all and people somehow blame health insurance companies who are only following the rules.

Another example #1: Would the European countries have such great social welfare programs if they had to spend for their own defense and maintain a military? In other words, those societies which have abundant social welfare programs, but are also defenseless, aren't sustainable.

Another example #2: Why do people support laws prohibiting them from the means to defend themselves? This works great if the police are protecting you 24/7. It works great if the police are totally incorruptible. But neither of these things are the case.

Another example #3: Instead of government funding public schools directly, how about government gives vouchers to parents/students so that they could choose the school they wish to attend? The best schools will get the most customers, and the bad schools will go out of business. It's not eliminating the role of government in education, but is instead shifting the choice on parents/students to choose the school.

The biggest anti-poverty program in the world was Deng Xiaoping's opening of the Chinese market to the world in 1978. 1 billion people lifted *themselves* out of poverty, not a government program or welfare.

&gt; a government is only as powerful as the support it gets.

Which is why everyone should be skeptical and wary of government at every turn. I'm not saying government is a bad thing. Government is very necessary and not all government programs are bad. However, when there is a choice between a free market solution (sometimes you have to be a little creative) and a government program, all things being equal, it's best to give people freedom.",1,t1_d1lmk60,1,0,t3_4csxat,d1mnwot,t5_2qh1i,,False,0,1459569953,,1463163873,alanwattson,AskReddit,False,

"&gt; Guns are absolutely not harder to produce than cocaine and heroin.

Quality guns that are accurate, powerful, and don't jam or catastrophically misfire due to manufacturing impurities? Yeah. They're pretty hard.

I may be mistaken, but the most difficult recreational drug to make is LSD. And even then, the sound guy for the Grateful Dead was able to supply the counterculture movement with most of its LSD in the '60s. He manufactured 10 million doses between 1965 and 1967.

Heroin and Cocaine are relatively easy to manufacture in bulk compared to guns. [Here's](https://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Bulletin07/bulletin_on_narcotics_2007.pdf) one of the ways they make heroin in Afghanistan, starting on page 21. Cocaine is easy to make, but only grows well in certain climes.

Meanwhile, totally ordinary people can make weed and meth in their own homes. Bath salts and Krokodil just show the length that people can/will go to to get high. There's no stopping it. It is *much* easier to control guns. Like I say, people can make shitty zipguns but they won't work well or last very long.

&gt; a gun can continue working flawlessly for decades

Yes, but a gun is no use to a criminal once he's used it a few times. Or even once. And if he's not using it semi-regularly, then why does he want one in the first place? There's a reason criminals typically dispose of their weapon after killing someone. Yeah, you could argue that the expense of a new one in a hostile legal environment would drive more criminals to hang on to their guns, but the prospect of death or life in jail is still going to offset that a great deal.

&gt; Plenty of countries in central and south america have near total gun bans, and organized crime still obtains guns. 

And plenty of countries in Europe have near-total gun bans and there is very little gun violence or violence in general compared to the US. Not to mention others like Japan, Australia, and even China (please don't bother bringing up the knife attacks). Also, if you enshrine the US Constitution as the basis of government in a random African country, it's not going to turn out like a carbon copy of the US, for a whole host of reasons. That would hardly be an argument against the Constitution in 1789.

Besides, I've already outlined the way I think would be best to proceed. And it doesn't involve banning guns.",-1,t1_d1mki9y,-1,0,t3_4cwaiq,d1mo5rw,t5_2qh1e,,False,0,1459570487,,1463163991,empfindsamkeit,videos,1459571013,

"I enjoy hearing him destroy the establishment's weak corruption politicians. He isn't giving up anytime soon, Trump will fight for the people and I have a feeling a LOT of people would fight for him. He is a true conservative, not these neocon idiots in DC.

They want  us to hate Russia because Russia has a strong leader and isn't afraid to show it. They're not letting the few secular Arab countries left (Syria) fall into the hands of Islamic groups who hate each other as much as they hate the Syrian government. And I think that's legit

But really I am all in for trump. He is an honest man, you can tell he speaks from the heart. A true patriot. no BS evangelical pandering pre-planned speeches lIke the rest of the political class... but man, he is getting so far in the race because he appeals to _Americans_. We want jobs, we dont want the TPP or any of that shit. That's why if they kill Trump off or screw him outta the nomination, I feel a revolt coming on.

Trump's no political animal, he's completely the opposite. A politician wouldn't say or bring up half the issues Donald does. He could easily beat Hilary, he's our only hope man... why don't you feel he's foreal though? He's nothing to gain from this campaign, he's doing it for his country that he sees going down the shitter. I was extremely cynical of politics before Trump came along and stirred things up enough to get the big dogs coming after him, that's when I knew he was foreal in what he says. He doesn't have that ""holier-than-thou"" attitude that every other candidate has and waiting for him to be assassinated to join the cause of restoring America is a bad idea. Because he has the best security ever and it won't happen, even if the elites send a hit squad of BLM or Bern-outs to nail him, his security would take care of them nicely. Not to mention he always carries his CC license and gun.

I'm not trying to convince you one way or the other, but at least vote Trump when he wins the nomination. It's either Trump or the royalty of America- the Clinton family. So either a real red blooded American or another 8 years of needless wars, provoking Russia, and flooding our country with ""refugees"". I don't want my children to grow up in an America that isn't even American anymore. Just like what these fuckers are doing to Europe, I am sick of it and he is the only hope to stop this bullshit going on.

This is the most important election in over a century IMO... and I'm not boutta to stand down and let another useless globalist politician take over my country. We've had enough of that and their agenda and I hope you are too. No more Clintons, Bushes, or any of the rest of em.

"As a Portuguese speaker, I feel like I have an ""unfair"" advantage when it comes to speaking languages. It's pretty much a non-existing accent. Yes, if you make zero effort you notice it, but anyone that learned English before his 20's won't have the tiniest accent or will easily remove it. Otherwise it sounds a lot like a Russian accent.  
Eitherway, English is pretty much the hardest thing for a Portuguese person to pronounce. The 'r' sound, like in ''car'' or ''Caroline'' is really really hard for Adult Portuguese people to get used to.  The Portuguese soft 'r' is pretty much the same as the Japanese one. And our hard 'R', like you'd expect in a word like 'Ralph' or 'Radical' is way more similar to the 'R' in 'VRRRROOM', not the throaty french 'R', but the tong actually touched the palate and trembles. It actually ends up sounding like a mild Russian accent.  
Japanese is a non-problem. If you read the romanji like you'd read portuguese you'll be correct 99% of the time. 

All in all, an European Portuguese accent seems way easier to shake off on most languages than an English, Spanish, French or even a Brazilian Portuguese one.  

I might have gone completely off topic, but I just felt the need to ramble for a bit. I have no idea if Korean would be harder to pronounce for a Portuguese person than English, but I doubt it. In general Portuguese people have trouble with the softer sounds. Weird vowels and hard consonants are rather easy, and from the korean shows and music I've listened to, those don't seem too common in Korean. Though I'm not sure if Japanese is that easy for English speakers. Those 'Arigatou's' with really hard american accents you hear in movies sound pretty damn weird.

"I don't know why people are always spouting off nonsense about American leagues being ""socialist.""  Sports Leagues are about the most capitalistic entities in the country.  What is more capitalistic than a pure monopoly?

There have been plenty of other leagues.  You know what happened?  The NFL and AFL had a merger, the NBA and the ABA merged, the National League and the American League formed the MLB.  That is straight up capitalism.  As a league the NFL has killed the USFL, XFL, and a host of other competitors through its monopoly.  They are ""nonprofit"" which gives them tax advantages, they force local economies to build them stadium while threatening to leave.  It is a MONOPOLY, that's pure capitalism.  The teams are franchises.  It's only direct competitor is its feeder leave.us.

Beside that point it is simple.  US sports developed out of colleges, not clubs, so the setup is different.  You want lower division fans?  High school sports.  There are legitimate high school sports fans in this country.  I can't imagine it's much different from shitty European football.  Next up is college.

"&gt;Oh well happy kwanza to you!

Kwanza? I study Islam academically and I think I can answer this for you. As a preface, I'm one of the people who is disgusted at the anti-Muslim rhetoric out there. I can't go on /r/worldnews anymore because it's full of idiots who know nothing about the religion and nothing about Islamic politics. I could talk all day about why they're wrong, but this is not the place.

It is wrong to say ""ISIS are not Muslims"" and it is extremely unhelpful to separate them from the religion. My tutor actually has spoken on national TV and written articles about this exact topic. He is a Shi'a Muslim and an academic, and he argues - quite correctly I think - that if you ignore the religious roots of the group then you cannot possible grasp the problem. Because their ideology, their beliefs and their objectives, are entirely religious. They fit within a framework that is Islamic (albeit a distinct brand of fundamental Islam) and their justifications are entirely theological.

If you disassociate them from Islam, then you have to explain their motives and actions by completely different terms. This is something you hear a lot: 'They just don't know how great Western culture is'. 'They are poor and marginalised so turn to violence.' 'They are responding to the US occupation of Iraq.' 'They are responding to European colonialism.' 'It is all about oil'. So on and so forth.

Some of those things have elements of truth - marginalisation, poverty and retribution certainly are causes as well. Yet the biggest cause, above anything else, is their religious belief. If you are an atheist like me, you can only truly understand this by imagining how you would see the world if you were a fundamentalist Muslim.

Once you do that, (and it requires a basic understanding of fundamental Islam that I don't have time to write here), then it all makes sense. It works the same for if you imagine you were a fundamental Christian - this might be easier to imagine. 

If I believed that the world was going to end and I had to obey the law of the all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful deity in order to reach eternal paradise, I'd do whatever the hell was needed to get on his good side. If that means killing people, why wouldn't I? This world is just a temporary, physical one. It's worth it for infinity in paradise. And they are non-believers anyway, they know nothing.

If that is how you see the world and that is how you understand it, then these acts of violence make sense. The whole Islamic State makes sense.

Where it gets extremely tricky and sensitive is how non-fundamentalist Muslims fit into the picture. The same for non-fundamentalist Christians, or Jews. Because the fundamentalists would argue, and in a way I agree with them, that the beliefs of these people are so far removed from the original message and meaning of the religion that they are not truly Muslims, or Christians or Jews. In order to achieve a form of Islam, or Christianity, or Judaism that is acceptable to 'Western society', you have to reshape and twist the doctrine of that religion SO MUCH that it can start to not make sense at all. 

Christianity is the perfect example. I live in Britain, which is a former Christian, now secular country. The majority of people are atheist - the Church has lost most of its power and influence. I think that this happened because the Church in this country was forced to adapt to the new ideals that came out of the Enlightenment. By doing so, over a long period of time, the doctrine of Christianity became so divorced from its scripture that it stopped making sense. As a schoolchild, I was made to go to church twice a week. The priest would tell us that Christianity preaches equality, freedom and love for everybody, including people from other faiths. But then we would go and read the Bible, and it didn't have that message at all. It told us to commit genocide on people of other faiths. It was violent, and brutal, and had so many historical problems with it that it was hard to believe. The religion didn't make logical sense any more. The result of this was a generation of people turning away from Christianity, and now you have a secular Britain.

To a much more limited extent, the same is happening to Muslims in Western countries. Many of my friends are Muslim. Yet they don't pray 5 times a day. They don't have multiple wives. They follow our legal system, not shari'a (there are a lot of misconceptions about shari'a, but that's another story). Why? Because this is how they had to adapt their religion in order for it to fit within a Western framework.

So many of them would read the Qur'an and the Hadith collections and realise how far removed they were from the fundamentals of the religion. Western Islam has to reinterpret and abstract the scripture so much in order to remodel the religion as acceptable to post-Enlightenment ideals, that it no longer makes sense to a lot of Muslims. Many turn away from religion entirely and become atheist. But many go the other way, and begin to follow the scripture fundamentally. These are the ones who, in the west, turn to groups like ISIS. are more likely to turn to extremism and violence (although this not always the case).

That is why it is unhelpful to say these terrorists are not Muslim. If you do so, you cannot discover any of what I have just said. You limit your understanding, and you actually make it easier for the discourse to become 'us vs. them', rather than peaceful and loving as it should be. 

I hope that helps, I don't normally write these sorts of things on Reddit because nobody on /r/worldnews is intelligent enough to grasp concepts beyond ""us and them"", ""Muslims r bad"". I would truly suggest learning about Islam - we in the West are disgustingly under-educated. I don't know everything, but having learned the theological and political history of Islam and the Middle East, I am constantly frustrated at how little people know and how uneducated their opinions are. It has a beautiful and rich history, and there are misunderstandings and misconceptions around every corner. 

TL;DR: Those who disassociate ISIS from Islam and say they are not Muslims are wrong, and this argument makes it impossible to truly understand their motives and objectives. However, the other side, which argues that all Muslims share these motives and objectives, are also wrong. The real answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Fundamental Islam IS incompatible with Western-style liberal democratic society. But so is fundamental Christianity - that is why much of Europe has turned away from the Church and towards secularism. It is not just Islam. It is all of these religions, with severely outdated doctrines and dogmas, that are incompatible.

**Introduction**

To preface this discussion, I will begin by saying that this analysis will primarily be focused on East Asian beauty standards, and how they have evolved from the ancient to the modern, post-Cold War time period. I know that there are quite a number of people who browse this sub that are Southeast Asian or South Asian in ethnicity/background, so if anybody is interested in posting about the progression of beauty standards pre- and post-Western European contact for these groups, I would be very interested to hear about it.

**Modern Beauty Standards-- Straddling Two Worlds**

The current East AA woman faces a unique dilemma when it comes to the concept of beauty. Just as the East AA woman is expected to come to terms with two cultures that she faces when growing up, she also faces two very different beauty standards: Western-Anglo and East Asian beauty standards. 

The current expectations for the ideal Western woman is as follows:

* White ethnicity, preferably Anglo-Saxon
* Blonde hair
* Light-colored eyes (blue, green, etc.)
* Small, ski-slope nose
* Tall
* Slender, hour-glass figure
* Long legs
* Ample bust size
* Tan, sun-kissed skin

From the East AA woman‚Äôs perspective, this is an impossible ideal to achieve, simply because of the fact that many East AA woman do not fit the primary requirement to be considered as the embodiment of hegemonic femininity in Western society--**she is not white**. 

On the other hand, when the East AA woman seeks to find connection to a more attainable beauty standard, she usually seeks out to embody the East Asian beauty standard. However, the East Asian beauty standard still represents an impossibility in attainment, as its standards are as follows:

* Pale, white skin
* Large eyes with double eyelids
* Tall, straight nose with high nose bridge
* V-line chin
* Tall
* Slim with long legs

Double eyelids, within the context of East Asian countries, are especially seen as the mark of someone who possesses extraordinary beauty, being a staple attribute that almost every modern Japanese, Korean, and Chinese celebrity possesses, whether it be attained by birth or by surgery. The upholding of this particular trait has reached a fervor within the past decade, with an ever-increasing amount of surgery being conducted on East AA women in Japan, South Korea, China, and other East Asian countries.

This increase in skin-whitening procedures and Asian blepharoplasty (double eyelid surgery) has unsurprisingly caught the attention of Western media, and has been lambasted consistently as East Asian women hating on their ethnic features and ‚Äúwanting to become white‚Äù. Many opponents of this proposition, most being East AA women, counter back by saying that these beauty standards were formed independently by East Asian cultures, claiming that pale skin has historically been considered beautiful, as a marker of a person from nobility, while double eyelids are possessed by 50% of East AA women and the kind of double eyelid that is desired is a slight fold atop the eyeline instead of the deep folds found in Caucasian women. While both arguments skim upon some truthful elements relating to this phenomenon, the real answer is actually at the intersection of both of these somewhat poorly thought out explanations, and will require an examination of ancient East Asian beauty standards, the role of beauty and its evolution within changing socio-political landscapes, and the development of its current incarnation in the modern era.

**Ancient East Asian Beauty Standards (AKA Pre-Modern, Western Colonization Times)**

Contrary to the way Western media would have the average viewer believe, East Asian beauty ideals are not as set in stone and rigid as they may seem, and have actually been in flux from time period to time period, as well as differing from country to country (China vs. Japan vs. South Korea). Cultural exchange was quite extensive among East Asian countries for thousands of years, and while each kingdom and time period had its own unique bias towards certain attributes, the primary attributes that were considered beautiful were as follows:

* Pale skin (the symbol of nobility and wealth) with touches of pink (showing the harmony between white and red)
* Thick, shiny and long black hair
* Finely shaped black eyebrows
* Slender, smooth limbs (think hands, feet, arms, etc.)

These traits were described extensively in poetry and historical accounts of various figures of nobility, with sophisticated phrasing used to describe the beauty of the imperial consorts that had existed at the time as exemplification of extraordinary beauty. Phrases such as pale, white skin being described as ‚Äútransparent crystal‚Äù and ‚Äúwarm jade‚Äù, and delicate hands being described as ‚Äútender bamboo shoots‚Äù were a few of the many ways to describe the exceptionally beautiful East Asian woman. 

Despite the similarities found among East Asian countries throughout time, each time period/kingdom had distinct biases towards certain traits, some in opposition with each other over time when East Asian beauty standards are looked at broadly over time and location. 

The Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392-1897), where a rare beauty (Ï†àÎåÄÍ∞ÄÏù∏; jeol-dae-ga-in; Áµ∂‰ª£‰Ω≥‰∫∫) (Ï†àÏÑ∏ÎØ∏Ïù∏; jeol-se mi-in; Áµ∂‰∏ñÁæé‰∫∫) was expected to possess the 30 elements of beauty, with three elements fitting into each of the 10 core attributes of exceptional beauty: 

&gt;1. skin, teeth, and hands should be white (ÏÇºÎ∞±; sam-baek; ‚Äú3 whites‚Äù; ‰∏âÁôΩ)
2. pupil, brow, and eye lashes should be black (ÏÇºÌùë; sam-heuk; ‚Äú3 blacks‚Äù; ‰∏âÈªë)
3. lips, cheeks, and finger nails should be pinkish (ÏÇºÌôç; sam-hong; ‚Äú3 reds‚Äù; ‰∏âÁ¥Ö)
4. neck, head, and limbs should be long (ÏÇºÏû•; sam-jang; ‚Äú3 longs‚Äù; ‰∏âÈï∑)
5. teeth, ears, and feet should be small (ÏÇºÎã®; sam-dan; ‚Äú3 shorts‚Äù; ‰∏âÁü≠)
6. chest, forehead, and the middle of forehead (ÁúâÈñì) should be wide (ÏÇºÍ¥ë; sam-kwang; ‚Äú3 wides‚Äú; ‰∏â‰æä)
7. mouth, waist, and ankle should be narrow (ÏÇºÌòë; sam-hyeop; ‚Äú3 narrows‚Äù; ‰∏âÁãπ)
8. hips, thighs, and breasts should be firm/full/thick (ÏÇºÌÉú; sam-tae; ‚Äú3 fulls‚Äù; ‰∏âÊ±∞)
9. finger, neck, and nose should be thin (ÏÇºÏÑ∏; sam-se; ‚Äú3 thins‚Äù; ‰∏âÁ¥∞)
10. nipple, nose, and head should be small (ÏÇºÏÜå; sam-so; ‚Äú3 smalls‚Äù; ‰∏âÂ∞è)

Meanwhile, in Japan, during the Edo period (1600-1868) when the Tokugawa shogunate was in power, blackened teeth was considered the epitome of beauty, and long legs in China were never lauded as particularly attractive until the modern era. Breasts in China were never traditionally emphasized, as they were seen as unimportant to the distinguishment of a beautiful woman, and was actually seen as immoral to consider given that ‚Äúsexiness‚Äù was considered to not be exemplified by a pure and virtuous beauty that was likened to the goddesses of ancient Chinese folklore. 

The ideal figure was also in constant flux as well throughout history. This is especially seen in the difference in beauty ideals between the Han Dynasty in China (206 BC to 220 AD) and the Tang Dynasty of China (618-907 AD). Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty and Zhao Feiyan of the Han Dynasty, two of the Four Great Beauties of Ancient China, were imperial consorts that were known for their exceptional beauty and served as embodiments of the physical ideals of their respective time periods. 

Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty had wide, round hips, and a plump, full waist. These physical characteristics were deemed desirable due to the country‚Äôs cosmopolitan status within the context of the world at the time, and the idea that a woman who had these attributes were not only healthy and able to produce many offspring as deemed necessary by Chinese agrarian beliefs, but also seen as affluent and able to afford excess. Coupled with her overall fitness, she was considered the cosmopolitan beauty of her time with graceful looks, mannerisms and her acclaimed expertise in the vigorous whirling dances of the nomads. On the other hand, Zhao Feiyan of the Han Dynasty possessed a slender figure, with her waist described ‚Äúas delicate as a sheaf of white silk,‚Äù and a slim figure being considered the embodiment of a delicate, pure and virtuous beauty.

These historical records not only show that East Asian societies do not hold a rigid, monolithic standard of beauty, but that the concept of what was considered to be beautiful has varied from kingdom to kingdom and time period to time period, with some beauty ideals that are held in complete opposition to each other. 

**Windows to the Soul - The Myth of the Universal Beauty of Large Eyes in East Asia**

Contrary to the ‚Äúscientific‚Äù studies that Western media has churned out stating that large eyes throughout the world are considered universally beautiful, including East Asia, the historical accounts of the traditionally beautiful East Asian woman have rarely mentioned the importance of double eyelids versus monolids in judging beauty, and some have even held narrow, small eyes in favor of large eyes in some points of history.

""The hatred that men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become fewer and less considerable, so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely just when they have least fuel. I have already given the reason for this phenomenon. When all conditions are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend the eye, whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity; the more complete this uniformity is, the more insupportable the sight of such a difference becomes. Hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself, and that it should grow by what it feeds on.""

"Cross-comment I wrote in the [r/France thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4c94m7/english_the_french_connection_la%C3%AFcit%C3%A9_youth/) about this exact article:


The [original article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-03-24/french-connection) only examines macro-level factors - that is, the structural level. From the original article:


&gt; It turns out that the best predictor of foreign fighter radicalization was not a country‚Äôs wealth. Nor was it how well-educated its citizens were, how healthy they were, or even how much Internet access they enjoyed. Instead, the top predictor was whether a country was Francophone[.]


First off what is 'radicalization' ? Which data points are considered radicals and which ones are not considered radicals ? Why these data bases and not others ? Secondly, what about micro-level (individual) and meso-level (organizational) factors ? One reason why salafi-jihadism is spreading and growing in France and Belgium is because the salafi-quietist and tabligh movements have been present since the 1970s-1980s. They laid the foundation for the salafi-jihadi movement. The salafi-jihadi movement is a violent sub-movement of the pan-Islamic movement (or Islamism), while salafi-quietism an tabligh are non-violent sub-movements.


Thus these meso-level factors, and many others need to be taken into considerations. The same can be said for micro-level factors. Further, at the macro-level, the discussion of immigration strategies (integration versus assimilation) is missing, for example.


While the French government's (and maybe Belgian, but this is not my area of focus) lack of actions toward the salafi-quietism and tabligh movements are a factor in the current make-up of salafi-jihadi networks, this is not the sole factor. Has French society failed parts of its youth in the *banlieues* ? Yes. BUT, they have also failed themselves by not trying as hard as they could. That is, some are not fighting for their well-being and taking a easier route - blame others and do nothing. The door swing both ways.


&gt; We suspect that when there are large numbers of unemployed youth, some of them are bound to get up to mischief. When they live in large cities, they have more opportunities to connect with people espousing radical causes. And when those cities are in Francophone countries that adopt the strident French approach to secularism, Sunni radicalism is more appealing.


Sure, that is true. But this does not explain violence. It makes sense of 'radicalization' (whatever that means). It is a well known fact (at least in academia) that most radicals do not undertake violence and violent actors are not the most radical individuals (in terms of ideology). McCants and Meserole seem to be confusing salafi-quietism/tabligh with salafi-jihadism. It is rare for a salafi-quietist to turn to violence (see el-Difraoui). What matters is the common ground they have. Many individuals on a path to salafi-quiestism/tabligh will turn to salafi-jihadism, but rarely an established salafi/quietist/tabligh (this is not to imply that salafi-quiestism and tabligh are 'blame-less' in all this). In any case, *la francophonie* does not explain this.


McCants and Meserole conclude:


&gt; [Initial findings] may be way off, but at least they are based on the best available data. If the data is wrong or our interpretations skewed, we hope the effort will lead to more rigorous explanations of what is driving jihadist terrorism in Europe. Our initial findings should in no way imply that Francophone countries are responsible for the recent horrible attacks‚Äîno country deserves to have its civilians killed, regardless of the perpetrator‚Äôs motives. But the magnitude of the violence and the fear it engenders demand that we investigate those motives beyond just the standard boilerplate explanations.


Their conclusion thus points to examining more tri-level factors (macro, meso, and micro) than simply one level of factors - an approach their study did not undertake - at least it seems as their methodology is missing. In fact, as u/Ryggart in the [r/France thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4c94m7/english_the_french_connection_la%C3%AFcit%C3%A9_youth/), each factor is not tested separately. 


In sum this article's conclusion is weak - this is even without going into the discussion of quantitative studies in the social sciences (not that I am against them, but generally, such studies fit the subject to the model rather than the other way around, and they make sweeping generalizations without qualitative second-thoughts).",1,t3_4czo9e,1,0,t3_4czo9e,d1msg8t,t5_3b5ej,approved,False,0,1459582464,,1463166024,Iwillchooselater,JihadInFocus,False,

"[MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: You established the Leadership Principle, which you have described as a system under which authority existed only at the top, and is passed downwards and is imposed on the people below; is that correct?

GOERING: In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I should like once more to explain the idea briefly, as I understand it. In German parliamentary procedure in the past responsibility rested with the highest officials, who were responsible for carrying out the anonymous wishes of the majorities, and it was they who exercised the authority. In the Leadership Principle we sought to reverse the direction, that is,.the authority existed at the top and passed downwards, while the responsibility began at the bottom and passed upwards.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, you did not believe in nd did not permit government, as we call it, by consent of the governed, in which the people, through their representatives, were the source of power and authority?

GOERING: That is not entirely correct. We repeatedly called on the people to express unequivocally and clearly what they thought of our system, only it was in a different way from that previously adopted and from the system in practice in other countries. We chose the way of a so-called plebiscite. We also took the point of view that even a government founded on the Leadership Principle could maintain itself only if it was based in some way on the confidence of the people. If it no longer had such confidence, then t would have to rule with bayonets, and the Fuehrer was always of the opinion that that was impossible in the long run-to rule against the will of the people.]

....


GOERING: I beg your pardon, I did not quite understand the question, but I could perhaps answer it as follows:

I consider the Leadership Principle necessary because the system which previously existed, and which we called parliamentary or democratic, had brought Germany to the verge of ruin. I might perhaps in this connection remind you that your own President Roosevelt, as far as I can recall-I do not want to quote it word for word-declared, ""Certain peoples in Europe have forsaken democracy, not because they did not wish for democracy as such, but because democracy had brought forth men who were too weak to give their people work and bread, and to satisfy them. For this reason the peoples have abandoned this system and the men belonging to it."" There is much truth in that statement. This system had brought ruin by mismanagement and according to my own opinion, only an organization made up of a strong, clearly defined leadership hierarchy could restore order again. But, let it be understood, not against the will of the people, but only when the people, having in the course of time, and by means of a series of elections, grown stronger and stronger, had expressed their wish to entrust their destiny to the National Socialist leadership.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The principles of the authoritarian government which you set up required, as I understand you, that there be tolerated no opposition by political parties which might defeat or obstruct the policy of the Nazi Party?

GOERING: You have understood this quite correctly. By that time we had lived long enough with opposition and we had had enough of it. Through opposition we had been completely ruined. It was now time to have done with it and to start building up.

"&gt; the better option is to remain with the known quantity.

You'd think so but this is not the case. And it is really difficult because our intuitions tell us to go with what is known over unknown, but this is a cognitive bias that we are hard wired with. There are many related phenomena that all share the same underlying heuristic of a bias towards information:

* Anchoring; where we stick with the information we heard first over better more reliable information later. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring
* Information Bias; the tendency to seek out information even when it will have no bearing upon our decision. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bias_(psychology)
* Sunk Cost Fallacy; the tendency to stick with something that we have already invested into over switching to something else better. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation
* Familiarity heuristic; the tendency to rate something as better based upon how familiar you are with it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiarity_heuristic

A lot of people talk about uncertainty as if certainty exists. Big financial powerhouses don't make money out of certainty - after all if everyone knows that the price of something is going to increase they are not going to sell, so you cannot make money out of buying low and selling high.

Furthermore businesses that try to stick with only the familiar option tend to not last very long. Adaptability to uncertainty is a key requirement of all large businesses, especially those that deal with liabilities. Coping with uncertainty is a daily exercise.

So all the comments regarding uncertainty are an exercise in fear of the unknown. If you are uncertain then you don't know, so you cannot say that it will be worse, just that you don't know if it will be better or worse. Now I do think that the leave campaign are doing a terrible job explaining this, and I think it is right that they are challenged to come up with a plan. Although I agree that things are not going to be as bad as many of the post-Brexit scenarios make out it might be, I do think that the comments from the leave group come across as weak and dismissive rather than reassuring. As a campaign tactic it is just terrrible.

For your other points, rather than argue I just want to present my initial reactions. I'm interested to see what your take on my reactions are.

&gt; What we get is membership of the single market

We don't need to be in the single market to get a trade deal, and there are quite a few nations with an FTA. Why is the membership fee worth the difference between access to the single market and access to the market via an FTA?

&gt; and the ability to direct policy within the EU.

All negotiations are an attempt to negotiate policy in the other nation. If we were to open a trade deal with Brazil then we would get to influence them and they would get to influence us. I don't see how this is any different than being in a union with Brazil where we both influence each other. The downside is that when being in a union you have to make sure that all parties are happy before you can progress which makes deals slower and more dilute. Why is being in a political union any better than just being a partner?

&gt; I know the counterpoint is to scream 'FTA!', but after having looked at how these things work, it's clear that such a deal is not going to offer the same benefits as EEA membership.

Whilst I agree that the more distant the less benefit I feel that this is looking at just one side of the coin. To make up random numbers here let's say that being in the EEA was worth 10 wotzits and being in an FTA was worth 6 wotzits. However being in an FTA opens up access to other global markets and this is worth 8 wotzits. If you only look at the relationship with the EU you see a loss from 10 to 6, but if you look at the whole picture you see a gain from 10 to 14. Why is being in a union that prevents us from making our own deals with other nations seen as a good thing?

&gt; Liberalised services are an incredibly difficult thing to make happen - the EU market is probably the only place in the world where it could be possible, and the benefits to our economy would be significant.

Why do you think this? Other than geographical proximity I don't see a lot of benefits. Our legal framework differs, and is far more similar to commonwealth nations and the US than France or Germany (a more practical reason for doing deals with the commonwealth nations than a sense of tradition which sadly seems to be the only argument I see put forward). Moreover financial services are based on English&amp;Welsh contract law. Countries like Japan have to adapt to our legal system when they want to deal with Wall Street or Hong Kong. Being able to sell them our expertise is something that the EU prevents us from doing at present as the duty rate pushes us to an uncompetitive position. Why would leaving the EU change any of that for the worse?

"&gt;Aho ei ole ollut politiikassa yli kymmeneen vuoteen?

Aho ei ole ollut *poliittisissa luottamusteht√§viss√§* kymmeneen vuoteen. Politiikkaa voi harrastaa my√∂s luottamusteht√§vien ulkopuolella. Esimerkiksi Vanhanen teki politiikkaa perheyritysten keskusliitossa lobbaamalla ty√∂nantajalleen edullisia lakeja. Se oli helppoa, kun p√§√§ministerikauden j√§ljilt√§ oltiin sinutteluv√§leiss√§ kaikkiin virkamiehiin ja ministereihin. 

Yleisell√§ tasolla: on hirve√§n helppoa ajatella ett√§ politikointi on vain sit√§ ett√§ saa uusittua virkansa nelj√§n vuoden v√§lein p√§√§st√§kseen p√§√§tt√§viin positioihin. Rehellisempi n√§kemys on, ett√§ luottamusteht√§v√§ antaa *mahdollisuuden* politikointiin. Ovia politikointiin tulee my√∂s muuta kautta: esimerkiksi sill√§ ett√§ olet suuren sanomalehden p√§√§toimittaja ja alat kirjoittamaan pro-EU-p√§√§kirjoituksia juuri ennen kansan√§√§nestyst√§. Tai menem√§ll√§ uutisv√§lineiden eteen kertomaan kuinka pankinjohtajana (eli asiaan perehtyneen√§ ihmisen√§) Suomi on pulassa ellei siirryt√§ regressiiviseen verotukseen.

Ministerin kyky onnistua ty√∂ss√§√§n edist√§√§ yhteisi√§ asioita kyse ei ole pelk√§st√§√§n siit√§ mill√§ pallilla istutaan. Onnistumiseen liittyy asia- ja ihmistuntemusta sek√§ kyky√§ tehd√§ poliittisia vaihtokauppoja. Loppujen lopuksi: ministeri on ty√∂ss√§√§n yht√§jaksoisesti vain maksimissaan nelj√§ vuotta (usein kaksi) kun virkamies on voinut tehd√§ samaa teht√§v√§√§ vuosikymmeni√§. *Kyll√§, herra ministeri* on hauska koska se on totta. Jotta ministeri oikeasti voi suorittaa teht√§v√§ns√§, ei se tapahdu  k√§skem√§ll√§ virkamiehi√§, vaan k√§yt√§m√§ll√§ asemaansa avatakseen ovia ja puhuakseen asianosaisille yksi kerrallaan kunnes ""v√§√§r√§t"" vaihtoehdot putoavat p√∂yd√§lt√§.  Olen jutellut Mauri Pekkarisen kanssa p√§√§lle vartin. Tuona aikana h√§n esitti monia n√§kemyksi√§ joista olin ideologisesti eri mielt√§ (ydinvoima, ty√∂tt√∂myyden syyt) ja useamman kerran huomasin h√§nen suoranaisesti valehtelevan viitatessaan tilastoihin. T√§st√§kin huolimatta jos minun olisi pit√§nyt √§√§nest√§√§  keskusteltavista asioista (kuten Fennovoiman ydinvoimalalasta) olisin saattanut helposti toimia Pekkarisen ehdottamalla tavalla. Esko Aho on v√§hint√§√§n yht√§ taitava. Ja h√§n p√§√§see juttelemaan ihmisten kanssa, koska h√§nell√§ on edelleen useita yritysten hallitusten pestej√§, kontakteja virastoissa ja ministeri√∂iss√§ puhumattakaan siit√§ ett√§ *kuka ei haluaisi puhua entisen p√§√§ministerin kanssa*? 

TL;DR: T√§rke√§ ei ole onko poliittisia luottamusteht√§vi√§, vaan p√§√§seek√∂ juttelemaan niit√§ jotka suoraan tai ep√§suorasti voivat p√§√§t√∂ksiin vaikuttaa. Esko Aho p√§√§see. 

----------------------

Voidaan tietenkin kysy√§ ett√§ eik√∂ Aho saa sitten ottaa vastaan t√∂it√§ joita haluaa. Tietenkin saa. Vapaa maa etc. Mutta mik√§ on hyv√§ Aholle ei v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ ole hyv√§ Suomelle. Valtiomiehiksi kutsutaan politiikkoja jotka ovat nousseet asemaan miss√§ he eiv√§t oikeastaan en√§√§ tarvitse luottamustoimia edist√§√§kseen n√§kemyksi√§√§n. Meid√§n on tapana odottaa heilt√§ eritt√§in varovaista ja koko kansakuntaa edist√§v√§√§ k√§yt√∂st√§, koska heid√§n on helppo k√§ytt√§√§ t√§t√§ valtaansa v√§√§rin. Se ett√§ t√§ll√§inen ihminen ottaa vastaan teht√§vi√§ jotka vaativat yhden intressiryhm√§n edun pist√§misen muiden p√§√§lle on eritt√§in huonoa k√§yt√∂st√§ silloin kun tuo intressiryhm√§ on kotimainen/kaupallinen ja l√§hestulkoon valtiopetos silloin kun kyse on Ven√§j√§st√§. Ja varsinkin kun kyse on n√§in raskauttavasta tapauksesta kuin Ahon. ",7,t1_d1mkcgl,7,0,t3_4cwtpm,d1mt4su,t5_2qlq3,,False,0,1459585111,,1463166346,OWKuusinen,Suomi,False,

I started with a BSc in biology (we covered about everything: microbiology, botany, cellbiology, immunbiology, zoology etc) to get a better idea about what I want to do later. I quickly figured out that I wanted to focus on zoology and that I definately wanted to stay in research. I managed to get I cool thesis in ecology.
