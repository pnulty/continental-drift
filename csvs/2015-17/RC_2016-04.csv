False,0,1459468908,,1463137793,explainlikeimfive,yodatsracist,,False,1,"&gt;Can't we just refer to them all as jihadi's to avoid confusion?

Absolutely not.  Groups like the AKP in Turkey and Ennahda in Tunisia are religious conservative democratic parties that happen to be Muslim.  They're like Christian Democrats in Europe and Latin America or perhaps like the Republicans in the U.S., in that their base is in religious social conservatism (and generally being pro-business development).  If there's ever going to be a stable democracy in Middle East, it will include these social conservative parties.  Now, some disagree with calling these parties ""Islamists"" since they do *not* want to install Shari'ah law in their countries, but it's often a continuum from them to parties that do want ""Shari'ah inspired"" or outright Shari'ah law. There was much ink spilled in Egypt, for instance, whether Shari'ah was going to be *a* source or *the primary source* or some other formulation of Egyptian law.  

Anyway, assuming this was a good faith question, you should check out Charles Kurzman and Ijlal Naqvi's article ""Do Muslims Vote Islamist?"" which not only goes into Islamist vote shares, but also discusses how Islamist parties broadly defined have, by pretty much every measure, generally moderated (slowly) as they participate in elections.  You can download the [a pdf of the article here](http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/do-muslims-vote-islamic).  It's an academic article, but it's written almost like a magazine article so it's not *super* boring (I'm linking this article because the moderation over time, quantified in this article, is important to realize).  That was published before the Arab Spring, and Kurzman has a follow up (Didem Türkoğlu) called ""Do Muslims Vote Islamic Now?"" from last year ([link](https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_democracy/v026/26.4.kurzman.html), but unfortunately I don't think it's freely available--you can at least read the abstract).

But the short answer is, if you're serious about fighting jhadist terrorism, it's an important distinction to make since these ""Muslim Democrats"" are willing and necessary allies in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda (and eager, even, because the countries they run are persistent targets of jihadist terrorism).",t1_d1l0inb,1,0,t3_4co5py,d1l5b9b,t5_2sokd,

I'm from Romania, where gaming is comparatively way more common as a hobby for a lot of people. A lot of us are very much into things like CS, League, Dota and MMOs. I say comparatively because now that I'm in the Netherlands I feel like a freak. There are huge differences, within Europe, in the way we perceive this hobby. 

Why? Well, Romania is way poorer and there are a lot less things to do for entertainment. We do one thing good, which is nightlife, but other than that your options for fun and hobbies are very limited. Here in the Netherlands everyone seems busy and active all the time: biking, traveling, at cafes and restaurants all day. The solution for many Romanians is escaping the boredom of mundane life through online gaming. For the Dutch (and most of the developed part of Europe), it seems like more of an excuse to be lazy and not do anything interesting during the day. I remember how we were walking around town one day with this group of European students and we passed a dark game store. One of German students quickly pointed out how ""it looks shady"" and ""it was made dark because creepy gamers enjoy that"". For this reason I'm always a bit covert about being a pretty passionate gamer, until I am comfortable with admitting it. 

Now going back to why I believe the US is more accepting. I stayed in Massachusetts for a semester last year and I could already see gaming organizations/clubs in the University I went to. It was very surprising, because I have yet to find someone as (or more) invested in gaming as me in my home uni, and I'm fairly casual nowadays. These guys in the gaming club were the hardcore squad, the real deal. I'm not sure what the causal factors are here but at least in terms of online gaming, you have the advantage of a very large player-base who all speak the same language. You are much more homogeneous than we are. Try playing League on EUNE and you will understand why I am very skeptical of meeting other players. Sure, you will typically see English or nothing at all in chat, but 50% of games will have chats in 3 different languages, each trying to out-swear the other. It's a mess. Online gaming is less enjoyable here especially when there is an important communication component, so this might be something worth considering so you can better understand why I'm doubtful about the gaming-online-dating scene.

Through this lens, I would posit that in many respects, Sanders actually is fiscally conservative in the long run, all things considered:

* **Tuition-free state college:** While expensive in the short term, it has the future benefit of educating the populace in a similar manner that state-sponsored K-12 schooling did 100+ years ago. With the U.S. and world growing more technological and less agrarian, college education is needed to keep a civil and technological edge with other countries. Not to mention, educated workers will earn more, resulting in increased revenue (even if tax rates were to even out or go down slightly in the future).
* **Infrastructure investment:** You mention Eisenhower-era conservatism in another comment. As you know, Eisenhower pushed for the Interstate Highway System and many other projects, which cost billions of dollars. Granted, many of these were justified under the military need of the Cold War, but the economic impact and improvement for civilians shows this to have been an enormously good investment, one which has been severely lacking in the attitudes of today's fiscal conservatism (a bit of ""Penny-wise, pound-foolish"" if you ask me, the way we've deferred maintenance funding), not to mention the sad state of our rail system compared to 100 years ago or Europe. A substantial investment in our infrastructure—as Sanders proposes—would increase the national debt in the short term, but the future gain on that investment (especially when coupled with pro-U.S. labor and trade agreements) will pay dividends for years to come.
* **Single-payer health care:** The [fiscal benefits](http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2016/01/27/medicare-really-unrealistic/79414698/) in terms of reduced overhead and billing have been touched on by others. That said, it will be immensely expensive to implement, but I think a look at intangibles is in order. With a proper focus on preventative care and healthy lifestyles, national health will increase, leading to a more reliable, productive workforce, which is good for the bottom end as well.

I could go on, but I think I've made the point—my philosophy minor is coming through a bit strongly here. Depending on your own views and definitions of fiscal conservatism, many of Sanders' policies can fit into that viewpoint (admittedly, some easier than others).

Depends where you're going, for how long, and when. London, for example, is vastly more expensive than Prague or Berlin. It also depends on the season. March-October is typically peak season in the northern hemisphere, and hostel rates will be about double what they are in the winter. In the winter, a typical hostel in London would be about £11/night. In Prague it'd be €5/night. Amsterdam would be €12/night. You've obviously got to budget in food (I seem to spend about €10-15/day on that), alcohol (in Prague, beer is cheaper than water!), random cash for random stuff, and travel both within the city, and to your next destination, which can be anything from €5 for a bus from Warsaw to Krakow, to $800 for a flight from NYC to Amsterdam. (Pro tip: Amsterdam Schiphol is one of the best airports to fly into in Europe, say, compared to London Heathrow, because Schiphol charges the airline less to land there.)

Australia requires a minimum of AU$5000 if you're going on a working holiday visa. But you can work there too, and they pay really well which can fund other travel. If you want to live in Europe for a while, I know the Netherlands and other European countries give out working holiday visas to Americans as well.

On a complete side note, I read through some of the other comments and one talked about how it's almost impossible for Americans to GTFO without a degree. That's so ridiculous wrong. I'm in Prague and there are a shitton of Americans and Canadians here that got their TEFL and are teaching English here. I also worked with an American from Texas in a bar in Amsterdam. People go abroad to study all the time, and of course, there are working holiday visas available in many countries, which could keep you going for YEARS.

&gt; What kind of jobs should I look for if I need money abroad? I'd assume the usual like fast food, anything readily available.

Bear in mind you'll need an appropriate visa to work. Don't count on being able to get a job without one. Assuming you do, bar work, hostel work, being a waiter/waitress, and teaching English are the common ones that come to mind. There's also stuff like leading pub crawls, but unless you're doing that for fun, don't bank on that for cash! I've seen too many people not actually make money from those!

If you're a software developer like me, that makes things a lot easier and I can work from wherever so long as I have an internet connection, my laptop, and a power supply!

Cold emailing bars/restaurants/hostels does work. Helps to have some experience in this field too, but it generally won't be hard to pick up that kind of job while you're working to save cash. It really depends on where you're going though, and developing a knack for selling yourself is useful as fuck. There are also Facebook groups for ""jobs in x city"". Craigslist isn't big outside the US, but there are often local equivalents, for example, Gumtree in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. There's also indeed.com which works in many countries (and has local sites), but is generally more geared to professional work. If you move to a city and have a working holiday visa, for example, search the subreddits for that city. People have probably posted something similar in the past.

Also, if you get a working holiday visa somewhere, just have a quick Google about what kind of formalities you'll need to go through. For example, research opening up a local bank account and whether you need a local equivalent of a SSN (which would be a BSN in the Netherlands, a TFN in Australia, a NI number in the UK, etc). Basic stuff like that. Most banks in Australia will let you open up an account before you even arrive, but they're somewhat exceptional.

&gt; Do you have any suggestions for like, a phone plan? I could live without a smartphone if it's more cost efficient to have a brick phone instead haha

Don't live without a smart phone. Just don't do it. Brick phones are useless when traveling. Google Maps, Google Translate, Google Chrome, and Gmail on your phone are things that can come to your rescue and give you information when you need it. It will make your life so much easier when traveling. There are apps like Citymapper that will get you around certain European cities better than anything else, and of course, Facebook, Skype, and WhatsApp are awesome for keeping in touch with people. You'll also meet a lot of people along the way that you'll want to keep in touch with too. Some of the best friends I've ever made have been people I started out drinking with in a hostel bar! Keep your smart phone with you. Also, be wary of using public computers or ones at internet cafes. I've seen too many people get their passwords stolen because of them.

It's best to have an unlocked phone (or get yours unlocked) before you go. WiFi is pretty much ubiquitous now, but you can often pick up a local SIM card wherever you are if you really need it and are staying for any length of time. [Prepaid with Data](http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data) lists prepaid plans with data globally. I have seen a lot of Americans sign up with T-Mobile in the US because they apparently give free international roaming with data.

&gt; What are some things I, as a travel noob, should bring that I might not think of?

A good travel adapter (read Amazon reviews), a padlock for a locker, and a (microfiber) towel are the three most forgotten items I saw. One of those external batteries for your phone can save you in a pinch. If you're taking long bus rides between countries, think about how you're going to entertain yourself too. You'll figure out most of this stuff along the way anyway. One thing not to take is a neck pillow or some other crap like that. Space is at a premium in your luggage!

Also, travel insurance that covers both loss/theft of your shit, as well as health coverage abroad. It's rare something happens, but when it does, travel insurance is a fucking lifesaver. Good travel insurance isn't expensive and urgent healthcare abroad (if you need it) is generally awesome and won't be a big deal financially. Of course, read the terms of the policy! I hear good things about [World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/) and will probably be using them when I go to Australia for a year in a few months, but I'll let you in on a dirty secret: I'm horrific for buying insurance. I probably should stop being so complacent!

&gt; So I have just a few questions, what are some signs of a good hostel vs. one I should stay away from?

I'm going to give you two examples of a great hostel and a bad hostel. First, [Amstel House](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Amstel-House-Hostel/Berlin/12736/reviews) in Berlin. I stayed here and *loved* the place. Everyone else loved it there too, and I recommended it to a friend and he loved it too. You'll see people whining about trivial shit in the reviews, but over all, good things are being said. That's a good place.

On to the bad one. I've never stayed here, but I know London hostels very well especially as I ran one there. [This](http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hostel-639/London/4483/reviews) is one of the worst that is well known to hostel staff; it has a reputation!

The one thing that's a deal breaker for me when I'm looking at a hostel review is recent complaints about bed bugs. They're very, very, very rare in reality, but as rare as they are, I don't fuck around with bed bugs. Thankfully it never happened at the hostel I ran, and most hostels are fucking amazing at dealing with them if they happen, so don't develop an unwarranted phobia of them! :-) In reality, you will probably never see one.

When I'm booking a hostel, I'll book one or two nights to start with, see how I like the place, and if I want to stay longer, I'll extend if possible. This works out better in the winter and midweek. Some cities get ridiculously booked up at weekends and mid-summer. Again, you'll figure out this stuff as you go!

&gt; Holy shit dude thank you, this is exactly the kind of information I need. I really appreciate it.

I think we may well see a slow winding down.  If we leave the EU I can't see the Netherlands or Finland wanting to sign up for the fiscal transfer union.  I think they may leave the Euro (and perhaps the EU especially in the Netherlands case.)  Denmark and other countries on the periphery may leave the EU as well.  Malta may well do something like Monaco and leave the EU but stay in the Euro.  

The big question is the Euro crisis in southern Europe.  That has the potential to explode at any moment with France, Italy and Spain all at risk of a Greek style crisis.  That could happen now or 5-10 years from now when another recession hits.  Something like that could possibly be fixed by fiscal transfers but they'd have to be huge and create the superstate we've been expecting.  Needless to say not all countries would want to sign up.  Failing the establishment of huge fiscal transfers southern Europe would be pushed/fall out of the Euro and it would basically become Germany+.  Or it could work the other way round.  That would effectively be the end of the EU but the institutions would actually stick around for a long time, much like the League of Nations stuck around for long after it was dead and the British Empire is still around today as the Commonwealth.  

Effectively, I foresee a shrinking of the EU's multiple layers.  This will happen gradually, but also rapidly at times.  However, it all has to start with Britain leaving.  If Britain stays I fear a doubling down of the retardation.  More members joining, more integration, more fiscal transfers.  It'll still all come tumbling down but it will take a lot longer to happen and could be a lot messier.  War is unlikely but I could certainly see something like a Spanish or Greek terrorist group bombing other European countries.  

The one thing that has never happened in the history of the EU is a significant power coming back to a member state from Brussels.  The EU is terrible but it has built this amazing myth of progressivism and inevitability because it just keeps marching forward.  Britain leaving will be the Emperors no clothes moment (though it will take several years for the realisation to kick in.)  The moment everyone sees that this thing they thought was necessary and the future is actually the exact opposite.  ",t1_d1l57z4,2,0,t3_4csdpz,d1l6azz,t5_2qhcv,

We have a common language and, under a Medicare-for-all system, standardized forms/procedures, etc. When treating a foreigner in a European country, much more common there due to sizes of the countries and EU's lack of internal borders, there are translation issues, formatting data for another country, and all the other bureaucratic steps when billing another country for services. Besides, European countries have more diversity than many Americans may realize, especially with Schengen allows for populations to freely settle anywhere in the EU.

Due to our size and an already established Medicare system, implementation and administration should be fairly streamlined in the United States. We also have the added benefit of being able to look at decades of foreign experience with single payer systems and avoid the mistakes they've made along the way.

As far as the size of these countries, we also have a proportional number of taxpayers so I don't see where the size of a nation matters at all. If anything, because Medicare would cover 330+ million people under Sanders' plan, the ability for the government to leverage costs of medicines and equipment is far greater than what any European country could bring to bear.

One last note about individualism and it ties to the healthcare issue. I used to live in Finland where these social programs are very strong even for European standards.

First nerf was right before Russian DD line was released, when WG realized a stealth firing Russian DD is op. So instead of a typical 3.8-4 km concealment penalty for a typical USN and IJN DD guns, 130 mm's penalty is 6 km.

This turned out to be not enough, Russian DD were blatantly op anyway. In particular Kiev had close to 60% average win rate at the time (I think it dropped to about 54% now). So they nerfed 130 mm's HE damage by 300, and fire chance by 2%.

Gremy received neither of these nerfs. It literally has the **pre**-*pre-nerfed* 130 mm, the original, op-as-hell guns at her disposal. Which means it can stealth fire from less than 10 km away (with 5th captain skill) with shell arcs similar to that of a Konigsberg. Additionally she can also stealth fire her torpedoes, which have 8km range. This makes her a **strictly better** Gnevy class, itself is no slouch as a tier 5 DD. In fact, she is **strictly better** than Anshan, a tier 6 DD that also performs very well in her bracket.

If this is not op I don't know what is.

(Have your dictionary handy.)

* *Nine-Headed Dragon River: Zen Journals 1969-1982* is famous author and Zen Master Peter Matthiessen's account of his early years of study, culminating in monk vows and awakening experience. This classic is important also for its record of how Zen (or at least *Japanese Rinzai* Zen) took root in America. If you are hungry for autobiography, read Matthiessen's *The Snow Leopard* before this one, as they form a single arc in time.

* *Crooked Cucumber* is a wonderful biography of the great Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki. This book is an easy, enjoyable read, but also dense with actual Dharma teachings — in Suzuki's unique style.

* *Only Doing It for sixty years*, a biography of Zen Master Seung Sahn is more of a jumble of anecdotes, but the stories themselves paint the picture of an exceptional being, and always carry the seed of his teaching.

* Lama Govinda's *The Way Of The White Clouds* is as much a record of a threatened civilization (Tibet before the Chinese invasion) as it is a personal account of mystical exploration.

* Tenzin Palmo's *Cave In The Snow* is a modern classic, her account of 12 years of solitary meditation in a Himalayan cave. There's also a short film with the same title.

* *The Mahasiddha And His Idiot Servant* is John Perks' raw, brazenly honest, fascinating account of his time as attendant of crazy-wisdom teacher Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, and Perks' own spiritual transformation.

* Going back in time, Alexandra David-Néel was the first European to explore Tibet (when foreigners were still barred from the country). Her encounters with yogis, shamans, and monks are recorded in her own autobiographical accounts as well as in the contemporary biography *The Secret Lives of Alexandra David-Neel: A Biography Of The Explorer Of Tibet And Its Forbidden Practices* (which is the one book I haven't read, of those listed here).

False,0,1459476674,,1463140145,HistoryofIdeas,mosestrod,,False,2,"&gt;how our ideas about morality have changed, and how this has informed different conceptions of political and private life

I wonder if you do the inverse as well? i.e. how difference modes of political/private life ""inform"" morality. 

I am very inclined to the Adorno (stolen partly from Nietzsche) reading which sees morality as essentially a lie that covers for reality. I.e. the morality of Enlightened Europe being simplistically ""equality, fraternity, liberty"" and how far the reality of European history has been from that ideal. In-between the ideal and the reality it covers we gain a method of critique which plays one against the other (without being corrupted by either); *the amoralist is still as alone in this as in the days when he turned the mask of evil upon the normal world, to teach the norm to fear its own perversity.*

False,0,1459477758,,1463140461,unitedkingdom,Tech_AllBodies,,False,7,"&gt; Source? The name of the project is ""Medgrid"" and it still appears to be active. It's a long way off of course.

Oh, this is a much smaller project I was unaware of. You realise the whole thing is 20GW 'capacity' with 5GW 'capacity' going to Europe? That's only about half the generation of Hinkley point C going to Europe (not that we should build Hinkley C...). So this project is basically meaningless.

And it still doesn't do anything for a 'statistical battery' since Africa is largely on the same time/solar day as Europe.

&gt; Well, it's apparently already economical, given existing usage of HVDC? The red links in this map are already in operation.

No, those links are not very far. And if you pretended to 'track' an individual electron, it won't be going very far from the power station before it got used. It's not like the link from SE-UK to NE-France is powering houses in SE-Italy.

&gt; Battery tech isn't cheap either and all of it so far has serious environmental impact (afaik), at best flooding a valley and at worse using toxic heavy metal based chemical batteries.

It doesn't have to be literally a battery, you just need some kind of dispatchable power to back up non-dispatchable renewables. That could be tidal, nuclear, batteries, compressed air, hydro, etc.

&gt; Hydro also has extremely fast spin up times, so nuclear and hydro with pumped storage alone would be perfectly viable with heavy investment in both. However I would not consider nuclear as a ""non-polluting"" source by any measure. Now is not the time to invest in nuclear power, newer systems are coming through the development cycle and I'm all for letting others take the lead and have to deal with the teething issues.

Nuclear and hydro are also the cheapest dispatchable non-CO2 sources we have. So I don't know what you're trying to imply with ""*heavy investment in both*"", since Tidal is hilariously expensive in comparison.

Also 'Nuclear' is not one thing. There are several different ways of doing it, and we are currently using the least efficient, least safe, most waste-producing kind (and have always been). We should be looking to deploy liquid fuelled molten salt reactors (LFTRs) and proliferation resistant fast-breeder reactors like the Travelling Wave reactor (the one that interests Bill Gates). Also we should continue to fund Fusion R&amp;D in the hopes that comes to fruition.

&gt; The UK could easily power all of it's needs with tidal and pumped storage alone.

This is total misinformation. [RenewableUK, who may have a bias in making the figures look better than they are](http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wave-and-tidal/), estimate it's 20%. *AND* that's 20% of our *ELECTRICITY*, not total energy, *AND* it includes a tad of wave power too, not tidal alone.

Electricity makes up ~13.4% of the UK's total energy needs. So 20% of that makes ~2.7% of total energy need from Tidal possible.

Once we start moving all transport, heating, etc. to non-CO2 sources (i.e. non-CO2 electricity) it's going to become abundantly clear that there is no silver-bullet and we need large amounts of solar, storage, nuclear, etc. All inclusive, not one or the other.

[977 upvotes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4c1cl5/i_challenge_any_supporter_of_hillary_clinton_to/d1e83m8)  This is a step by step critique of Sanders' positions and policy proposals. Not a thing about Hillary's feelings or policies.

[424 upvotes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4c1cl5/i_challenge_any_supporter_of_hillary_clinton_to/d1ehnw4)  More critiques of Sanders' proposals.  The only thing remotely touching on Hillary's stances is the bit about her making hard decisions on when and who and why to bomb a country.  

[276 upvotes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4c1cl5/i_challenge_any_supporter_of_hillary_clinton_to/d1ed8t0)  Another list of things the poster dislikes about Bernie. The only touch on her policy is where the poster admits he *doesn't like* Clinton's stance on the NSA.  

As far as your example of my line of questioning, let me try and give you some answers:  


&gt;Talking to Bernie supporters I'm often told they support him because he ""seems like he really cares"" and ""he says he's against things I'm against"", and when I ask how he's going to do it they never have an answer other than ""by starting a political revolution.""  

This is one of my frustrations with Bernie's campaign. I would love to see more downticket support from him.  That being said, I do understand the limitations of only getting donations from individuals - you don't have the extra funds to support state and local politicians.  Part of the political revolution idea is that voters need to take time to educate themselves and support local and state candidates who espouse the same progressive ideals.  



&gt;When I ask about his opposition to free trade they say ""it takes away American jobs"", but when I point out that lowering trade barriers was a large part of FDR's plan to end the Great Depression and was a huge part of post-war prosperity they have no answer.  

The Reciprocal Tariff Act that FDR supported is a good deal different than modern deals like the TPP, TTIP and NAFTA.  The global markets, the transportation options, the high mobility of industries didn't exist in post-war Europe and Asia.  There weren't huge swaths of Chinese factories for American businesses to buy out and relocate to.  The broader implications of the Investor-State Arbitration is particularly spooky, and did not exist with those old deals.  Bernie is skeptical of the motives and benefactors of these new deals.  And due to how secretive the negotiations of the TPP was I appreciate his opposition.  


&gt;When I ask about his unscientific views on GMOs, nuclear energy, and belief in fringe theories on health (cervical cancer is caused by a lack of orgasms and being angry), on economics (lump of labor), I'm told that he's just such a straight shooter that even if I disagree I should support him because I know what I'm getting/  

Sanders wants a moratorium on new licenses for nuclear plants. His reasoning behind this is to give boosts to cleaner technologies in generating a larger share of the nation's power.  

As for GMOs, let me link you to one of his policy pages - [He wants to label them, not ban them.](http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-agriculture/)  Sanders doesn't even go into the topic of Monsanto trademarking genetically modified strains of seeds, and suing the everloving shit out of small farmers who had the misfortune of growing and harvesting downwind from a factory farm.

As far as the ""fringe"" health thing goes - find me *one* instance of him suggesting any such cancer cause in the last 30 years. Not a stream of consciousness editorial from 1969, but an actual political treatise, speech, or bill.  Citing an item from 40 years ago as Bernie's health care policy is a bit ridiculous.

And the ""Lump of Labor"" claim is never mentioned on his site or his policies.  The claim that working poor families need to work 60-80 hours a week between multiple jobs to afford to live is...and if that gets grouped in with the right wing attack point of ""lump of labor"", then so be it.  I agree with him 110%  

&gt;It's rare that I hear a Sanders supporter talk about Sanders' actual policies. They'll talk about how goals and how he's against bad things and wants good things, but can't explain how increased competition for jobs in manufacturing apparently ""steals"" jobs and drives down wages but increased competition for skilled labor will increase jobs and wages.

These points aren't super coherent, and it's kind of hard to determine what attack you're making here...but I'll give it a shot -

Sanders claims that free trade deals entice and encourage businesses to move their operations out of the country so they can charge foreign workers far less.  At that point the American worker is no longer competing for a manufacturing job, because that job is no longer located in the United States...unless they're willing to relocate to Puebla, Mexico and get paid less than $10.00/hr.

&gt;They can't explain how Bernie is a hero for going against the majority of voters on gay marriage and defense spending and war, but Congress is bad because they don't follow ""the will of the people.""  

I'm sorry, but is this an attack on Bernie championing civil rights because polling showed the majority of the county was anti-gay?  I'm *totaaaaaly* ok with him ""bucking the trend"" in that instance.

&gt;They can't explain how we should all sacrifice a little more in order to benefit the poor and downtrodden, while so many of them would rather see Trump take office than sacrifice their holier-than-thou attitude.

This has nothing to do with Sanders' policy, and has everything to do with your negative feelings about a minority of Bernie supporters.

&gt;Sometimes I feel like when they're not claiming he's the only honest candidate and plugging their ears to any discussion of economics, law, or public policy, they're out of their comfort zone.

I'd be happy to further talk about politics, the law, and public policy in regards to Sanders positions, and I feel perfectly comfortable in doing so.

&gt;Now imagine me saying ""I'd love someone to explain why they support Bernie."" You're not going to answer, you're just going to call me a dick misrepresenting the views of Bernie's supporters and trying to belittle them.

I can't speak to your level of dickishness, but I tried my best to answer all of your questions about Sanders' policy and keep things civil.  I'm sorry you didn't like my characterization of the Clinton supporters I've spoken to.  I understand that it is anecdotal and not a full representation of Hillary fans.  But please understand that I'm going by what I see and hear, not some fabricated attack.

&gt; I sat Aveline down on a bench in the hospital’s waiting room.  

This sentences feels very modern. Hospitals? Waiting rooms?  

&gt; She’d be tortured. If I got her a room, I could think of something to avoid it.  

This gets the point across, but it's a bit too tell-y for me.
&gt; “Bavaria?”  

The fact that this guy's name is also the name of the House, which is also the name of a famous European country, is mildly confusing to me. I'm all for using names from history, but especially if it's the name of multiple things in your fictional world you run a higher risk of confusing your reader.
&gt; “As soon as she gets a room, I'll go.""

You don't specify that this is Bavaria, and the last sentence would imply it's the official that's speaking. I get that it's Bavaria, but your grammar implies otherwise.
&gt; The daimyo’s door was blocked by someone standing by the entrance.

You mention you don't like this sentence. I don't think the passive tense works here, it's not unique enough a situation to warrant it. I'd try something along the lines of,


&gt; I tried to push open the door, which moved about an inch before I hit something. From the other side, I heard a grunt, and the shuffling of feet as the already-crowded room attempted to make space for one more occupant.  

Not exactly like that, but something along those lines. 

&gt; “Let’s do that,” the daimyo replied.

*Let's do that* doesn't sound nearly ominous enough to me. It sounds like his girlfriend just asked him if he wanted to get frozen yogurt.


&gt; I shivered, and every sense of being in my body seemed to run away. Everything went cold. My heart sank, and my stomach churned.


The description is effective, but not particularly original.


&gt; “We don’t need her.”
“These Bavarians,” one of the councilmen growled.
“If I free her, she’ll just come back to steal,” the daimyo said.


To me, it seems as if the councilman is talking out of line. The fact his response doesn't get any reaction from the daimyo seems even weirder to me. I dunno, could be me being nitpicky, but seems like this councilman doesn't have much of a sense of chain of command.


&gt; “Are you kidding, Zai?” Levi chimed from the corner of the room.


Again, for some reason random people chiming in when this guy has just threatened his lord seems bizarre to me. If I were in the army and I pulled a weapon on my commanding officer, you bet your ass the private next to me isn't going to chime in with something like, ""Think of your family!"" He's gonna either A) dispatch me B) sit there and watch, too stunned to respond, or C) help me out, if it's a really weird circumstance.


Of course, this is mostly a personal preference. All I'm saying is that it pulled me out a bit. 


&gt; I looked up at Levi and then to Mei, both dusted in dirt and stained in dried blood. Then I found Caspar, cringing and gripping his leg. I brought my eyes back to the daimyo. “It’s a life I can actually save.”


Probably my favorite passage thus far. 


&gt; I hurried back to the hospital, practically sprinting through the night down the streets of Honua. I dashed through the doors and down the hall to Aveline’s room. She was asleep in her bed.


You can boil this whole paragraph down to:


&gt; I sprinted through the Honua night. I charged through the hospital and barged into Aveline's room; she was sound asleep.


Or even:


&gt; After sprinting through the Honua night, I found Aveline asleep in her bed.


Both of these cut down on the verbiage and make the story pop more.


&gt; She gripped the sheets. “I’m not going anywhere with you, creep.”
	“If you can’t tell, I’m the only one on your side; the only one who’s ever been on your side.”


To me, it seems like it was too easy to get her to go from ""Creep"" to ""OK I'm gonna follow you."" It makes her seem like she has very little agency in her own life.


&gt; I laughed. “It’s fine. I know a place that might open up this late.”


To me, this reaction is out of line with how dire the situation is. This might be something he'd say if they were actually dating, with no kidnapping situation going on and no suspicion that Zai might be up to no good. 


&gt; “Can we get a table?” I asked, pointing to one in the corner.
	He put down the candle. “Yeah of course.”


This is unnecessary. He knows the owner and it's a bar, no way he'd ask before taking a seat.


&gt; 	We sat down, and Albin poured us some tea. “The usual?” he asked.
	“Two please.”
	He nodded then left us alone, giving me a wink as he walked to the kitchen.



This is also unnecessary, and makes Albin into a bit of a creep. Also, all these names are very Anglo, yet we're dealing with traditional Japanese architecture/aesthetic. Maybe there's a reason for this, but I don't know it.



&gt; She stared at me, but I looked away. I could tell she didn’t believe me.
“Where are you taking me?” she asked.
“I don’t know,” I said.


This exchange doesn't seem as put together as I'd like. She begins by asking what the daiymo plans to do with her, and then she transitions to what their escape plan is. Why is she concerned about both? If she thinks she's just gonna get recaptured, she wouldn't ask about the escape plan. And if she thinks she's gonna escape, she wouldn't ask about what plans the daiymo had for her, at least not initially. 


&gt; “I want to murder him sometimes,” I said.


A little weird to say, especially when he's hosting the pair and allowing them refuge. It makes Zai seem a bit immature.


&gt; I hesitated. “You saved me so I guess I owe you.”
She put down the pancake. “Then you wouldn’t have dragged me here. What’s the real reason? Don’t tell me you like me.”


This is probably a context thing, but I'm not sure what she's saying here. If she saved his life in the past, then it makes perfect sense that he's saving her life now. That would be reason enough. If by 'dragging me out here' she means taking her to dinner, then I agree that his actions don't really make a lot of sense. If you're breaking someone out of captivity, it typically makes sense to high-tail it out of there ASAP, not stick around and go out for tea and pancakes.


&gt; I hesitated again. “You remind me of a friend.”


This is another thing that tells me our main character is immature. He clearly is interested in her, especially because she reminds him of someone else he used to love. The fact he's not open about that makes me think he's not well versed in how to handle these situations.


**general comments**


Going through your questions.


PACE: I mentioned where I though the pacing was off. Beyond that, it's a bit dramatic, but that's to be expected in the fantasy genre. I didn't think it was anything over-the-top.


CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: As I mentioned, I don't think he's unlikable, he has a lot of heroic qualities that make him likable. I think he's slightly immature, in that he doesn't quite know how to express himself directly without resorting to emotion. But that's a perfectly acceptable trait for your character to have -- it gives him room to grow in that direction, if that's the path you choose to take him down. Of course, you can also make his immaturity problems worse, especially if Aveline rejects him or something else goes severely wrong. The important part is that it changes in some way, so that the reader can trace Zai's development as the story progresses. You can also leave him static, if you'd like, but that's a much more boring route.

PLOT: I mentioned that taking Aveline to get some food right after he broke her out is probably not a well-thought-out decision on his part. However, if you want you can chalk that up to your main character being immature/impulsive. 

I also don't know how the daiymo ended his conversation with Zai, so I don't know how appropriate his actions are given the situation. 
Beyond that though, I don't think there's anything too outlandish in the plot so far.   


One final thought: don't be afraid of making flawed or conflicted characters. The fact that you think your character is shallow or selfish means that you're probably too attached to your main character, to the point where you think he needs to be perfect or people won't be interested. There's a screenwriting book called ""Save the Cat"" that simplifies the idea of heroism/main character behavior pretty drastically, and you might find it helpful. It's called ""save the cat"" because your main character should be the type of person who would save a cat that's in danger. It doesn't matter if your character was snorting cocaine off hooker titties right before, so long as they go out of their way to do the right thing when it counts. If your character does that, and you do a good job of focusing the action around them, then you're probably in good shape. You've done that here, so I wouldn't worry about the rest. Just know your character, know their strengths and their weaknesses, and shift those however you want to over time. Just make sure they save any ""cats"" your story might have -- which, with Aveline, he clearly does.

Breaking the game so now the player either has to give them money to make it somewhat playable, or put it on us to revert to a previous patch. Ridiculous.

The problem is the development mechanic. They changed the base manpower and tax for much of the map (mainly out of Europe) that made it much weaker. They then allowed the AI to use the development mechanic and left the player unable to use the same mechanics. It is literally unfair. Most people will say ""I dont see the big deal, I usually never touch development."" Well, I dont like playing European nations.

False,0,1459482215,,1463141684,atheism,AreYouSherlocked,,False,1,"The majority of Muslims live in Muslim countries, most of which have been polled thoroughly the only ones that haven't wont allow the fucking polls so lets assume they're worse.. Also according to pew, the median percentage of Muslims who favour sharia as offical law is well over 50% everywhere except Europe and Central Asia (at least as of 2013). I'll say 75 million in Europe even though thats far higher than any data suggests. and about a 150 million in Central Asia (again way higher than data suggests). That *very* generous estimate gives you 225 million Muslims of whom only 15% favour sharia. Half of the remaining 1.4 billionish muslims worldwide is 700 million (again huge underestimation) in Favour of sharia law.

Lets just pick 1 other stat for fun, 76% of of the Sharia supporters in South Asia favour death penalty for apostates. Apparently 84% of people in South Asia favour Sharia, I'll do some math for you since you're clearly too lazy. South Asia is specified as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 20 million in Afghanistan, 175 million in Pakistan and 130 million in Bangladesh. 
325 million people of whom 84% support Sharia, cuts it down to 273 million of whom 76% support death if you change religions, that's about 200 million people in just 3 countries. Do you really want to do this experiment in North Africa and the Middle East? Apfghanistan produces 2.5 million refugees per year btw.

I'll conceded pure tribalism is probably responsible for more bloodshed but religion, belief in superstition (scape goating for example) are a close second and specific beliefs have specific consequences, e.g Muslims have no problem with stem cell research because the Quran says the soul enters the body at 6 months or there around.

Also religion plays on our most basic faculties, fear of death, willingness to serve, greed. It is a great tool for unification and a perfect excuse for violence and immoral acts. You have to concede that Jainism is not the same as Islam or Christianity though, and that there are differences between the big monotheisms that explain why at least 95% of suicide bombers are Muslim.

Stalin was literally seen as a god by his people and he had the church as his most critical ally, but yeah, Atheism, sure...

Your number of 100,000 comes from Saddam Hussein lol, solid source.

The Jainist 'caste system' separates beings based on how many sensory organs they have, humans are on the same level. I could also add Buddhism since it was originally a refutation of the Caste system in Hinduism

LOL, yeah like freedom of speech does so well in Canada and Europe compared to the U.S

&gt;* Just hours before the deadline on Thursday, China requested the UN Committee, which is considering a ban on the chief of the Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM, to keep on hold the designation.

&gt;* After the attack on the IAF base at Pathankot on January 2, India in February wrote to the UN calling for immediate action to list Azhar under the Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee.

&gt;* The submission was armed with strong evidence of the outfit's terror activities and its role in the Pathankot attack that killed seven Indian military personnel.

&gt;* India also told the UN Sanctions Committee that not listing Azhar would expose it and other countries in South Asia to threats from the terror group and its leader.

False,0,1459484679,,1463142375,pics,southernbenz,,False,1,"&gt; Lincoln's election, however, caused the South to throw a massive temper tantrum.

It was an unlawful occupation of foreign land; of course South Carolina ""attacked"" the Ft. Sumpter.  But keep in mind, the SC governor ordered for the walls of the fort to be dismantled and the Union soldiers to be sent north unharmed.  Dismantle the walls, his people did (albeit by cannon balls), but the Union soldiers were sent north unharmed.  

&gt; The South was split on the issue.

Agreed.  Importing foreign slaves was already unlawful in four southern states, and Georgia was still debating at the outbreak of the war.  New York and Massachusetts were busy sending a lot of money down to SC and GA in the form of the slave trade because the trading companies were MA and NY companies, but the importation of foreign slaves was already made illegal in those states. So, they paid the South to do their ""dirty work"" and then attacked the South.

&gt; The war would never have started in the first place if Lincoln wasn't anti-slavery,

The war wouldn't have started in the first place if the soldiers at Ft. Sumpter had packed up and went home when they were politely asked to do so.

&gt; By comparison, the North despised slavery, not just for its effects on the slaves, but for the way that it created an elite slaver class, the notorious ""Slave Power"". They saw the Southern elites as no different from the aristocrats of Europe.

...are you honestly trying to suggest slavery wasn't ***widespread*** in the North?  That's ***outrageous.*** Are you forgetting that lawful slavery still existed in New York until 1827, and Maryland, a state that never succeeded and (for all intents and purposes) fought for the North, only abolished slavery after the Emancipation Proclamation?

And no matter how many wars the West fights for Jewish/International Zionist interest, it will never be able to prove otherwise. This is because Judaism is an inherently racist and deliberately polarizing ideology that seeks to keep its ""Chosen"" bloodlines pure, and hence will find ""irrefutable"" evidence of goyim conspiracy and pathology even when none exists. 

For example, [a failure of the U.S. to fight more wars for Israel and an agenda to take an America First instead of an Israel First foreign policy ""proves"" that large elements of white America are ""anti-Semitic"" in the sick mind of this particular indoctrinated Jew](http://www.jewishjournal.com/brackmans_history_matters/item/donald_trump_from_america_first_to_americas_worst), whose mentality is quite common among even average Jews.

But now that the Jews have pathologized the European majority, the Islamist invaders are reaping the benefits, as the left rallies around the ""vulnerable"" minority, doing exactly what the Jews trained it to do through endless cultural Marxist, media, liberal and p.c. brainwashing.

This was obviously an unanticipated outcome that the Zionists didn't foresee; they always intended that the left would rally entirely around the Jews, because they always imagined that they would have total control of mass media and the general public narrative.

They never anticipated that the rise of the Internet would, for example, allow the truth to get out that the Zionists were the ones behind the war on Islam (using 9/11 and a ""War on Terror"" as a pretext) and consequently couldn't anticipate how the introduction of another minority (originally intended to help the Jews counter the Christian/European ""pathological"" majority) would become a mortal threat to the Jews when that minority found out the Zionists (and their corrupt stooges) were the ones responsible for death and displacement of millions of their brethren in Islamic lands.

Now the Muslims are enraged not only at the Jews, but at the West for allowing the Zionists to so thoroughly infiltrate and instigate a war on Islam.

This is why if the West is to survive, the entire lot (Zionists, Islamists, and their corrupt and corrupted whores, stooges and brainwashed useful idiots) are going to have to be thrown out of the West and sealed in the Mideast.

It is a BBC Documentary (also shown by the Irish state broadcaster RTE), presented by former Conservative MP Michael Portillo:

""By trawling through records suppressed for most of their existence, it tells of a conflict on the streets of Dublin one hundred years ago and sets these events against the backdrop of the Great War in Europe.  Featuring interviews with a wide array of contributors including renowned journalist Robert Fisk, former British Minister of State for Security and Counterterrorism Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones and former Chief of the General Staff General Lord Dannat,The Enemy Files explores hidden motives, withheld data and questionable interpretations of the facts.

This documentary goes to the heart of the intelligence that the British State had access to prior to the 1916 rebellion and the ever-increasing role that the rebels sought from Germany – “our gallant allies”.   Portillo of course, brings an understanding to the proceedings that reach far beyond the remit of the traditional presenter.  As a former Defence Secretary he has insight into the mindsets of the men who decided who lived and who died.

But Portillo creates something larger and more compelling than the mere particulars. He explores the Rising and goes well beyond it, to the darker side of warfare.  Hidden motives, withheld data and questionable interpretations of the facts are everywhere.

The Enemy Files is a challenging and controversial documentary that shines a light on the difference between truth and fiction, offering an alarming glimpse at the many distortions that shape our history.""

Use of darknet enabled realtime chat, otoh, I'm a little more surprised by, outside of understanding that thus far, most Islamic militants are not particularly impressive when it comes to using technology.  They may make Fox News viewers surprised by their ""high tech"" escapades, but frankly, they've done nothing to suggest to me that they use best practices.  Indeed; most of the planning for the larger profile relatively recent attacks across Europe were planned using plaintext in the clear comms.  They're not bothering with the darknet for the same reason people still pirate content in the clear rather than using vpn's or darknets -- for the vast majority of cases, government dragnet surveillance, while being a good tool to control the government and the masses, is not particularly good at stopping attacks.  This may change in the future if the sigint folks get a bit better at parsing all the data they collect, but given the exponential rate at which data is growing on the 'net I'm dubious that they'll really do it effectively within the foreseeable future.  It's generally a waste of tax money and effectively an assault on the constitutional societies that supposed democratic republics are responsible to, and as I think most anyone in this sub probably agrees that it should be shut down.

In any case, if they got better at parsing all the in the clear data they gather, seriously, .i2p works just splendidly with irc, which should be entirely usable across nearly all possible platforms without the additional software being required outside of the core i2p services themselves, as any irc client can be set up to run with a proxy service.  This isn't too complex if you're not busier trying to blow people up for offending your imaginary friend than you are practicing good opsec and generally problem solving.

I mean it's not like the Nazis and Japanese were going to go all ""Man in the High Castle"" on America's ass, let's be realistic, but we're emotionally close enough to Europe that the Brits losing sovereignty to the Germans would take a toll on the American psyche.

I'm sorry, but 20th century war was WAY worse than some lords going at it with swords.

*That being said*, you can categorize BC according to their androgenic effect, from anti-androgenic to pro-androgenic. Acne thrives on high androgenic activity - the characteristics of it are thickened skin, overactive sebum glands, higher and thicker hair growth, and in worst cases alopecia, hirsuitism and acne. As you can see, it could be your acne is caused by either too many androgens, or high sensitivity to them (that was mine because I did my blood tests and I had normal androgen amount). When you take an anti-androgenic BC it could be that you will see also reduced hair growth (including your head) so do be aware of that. Here's a nifty guide, but in my opinion it only shows the most used, and there are newer (and possibly better) fits: http://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitness/news/a5087/contraceptive-cheat-sheet/ . Another thing to mention is - some drugs are kinda old school, and ortho tri-cyclen.. I think that one's pretty old but don't quote me on it. The newer you go, the less active drugs you take which is healthier.

Ok so that being said I'm in Europe, so you might need to look around for alternative names - my first one was Belara.

After about 1,5-2 years of taking it I was starting to get migraines, so my gyno immediately took me off preventatively. This shouldn't put you off trying it, again, for some people it has no side effects. Apart from the headaches (which coincided with a stressful time in my life) it basically massively improved my life even apart from acne, from body hair to mood stabilisation to regular SHORT periods without heavy bleeding no more worry of anemia etc..

One random example... they love to talk like Americans are weird for not being a huge soccer country, but the truth is that's common for countries similar to America.  Don't get me wrong, I love soccer and it's my favorite sport, but soccer is really popular in two types of places.  Europe... and countries who are (or recently were) too poor to play many other sports.  Let's not act like Ghana seriously tried out ice hockey and lacrosse, and then decided that soccer was more fun.     
        
I mean if you look at non European first world countries, many of them are not soccer crazy in the same degree as the rest of the world.  USA and Canada.  Australia and New Zealand are big into Aussie rules and rugby and stuff.  Japan IIRC is bigger into baseball.  Korea has soccer #1 IIRC, but baseball is still really big there, as are e-sports.

Yes, but their killing was largely over a 4 year period. The same could be said of the Soviet Union, to some degree. About 1/4 of the mass death during their rather long existence occurred in just 3 years; notably The Great Depression.

&gt;What does Nazi Germany have to do with you or me?

A lot. It is one of the only political entities that has existed with the intent of depopulating large portions of the globe. And I didn't bring them up; I was replying to someone who compared a measly famine to that.

&gt;Poland was geographically proximate to the famine and ruled over by the same regime.

2 things; Poland occupied part of Ukraine at the time, and while there wasn't a massive famine there, they weren't particularly nice to Ukrainians either ... in fact, when Germany took over the Ukrainians started rounding up and killing Poles in retribution ... something the Soviets had managed to avoid between 1939 &amp; 1941.

And secondly; Poland was never ruled by the Soviets. It was ruled by Communist Poles, who had support from the Soviet Union. That is not the same thing. Most of these Eastern European countries that are playing the victim card these days are being incredibly dishonest about their own role in these events. Interestingly, Ukrainians have been some of the most willing to admit direct collaboration to me, despite the fact that they WERE controlled by the Soviets.

&gt;In any case, it was clearly part of what he was talking about when he said the USSR was almost as bad as the Nazis

**Anyone who says that is a Holocaust denier**.

Simple.

&gt;If someone saying someone who killed 14 million people is almost as bad as the Nazis riles you up so much, you need to get some perspective.

I'm not riled by people criticising Stalin. I'm the ONLY ONE in this thread listing specific crimes carried out by the Soviets. But that's because I'm demonstrating, effectively, that they're not comparable at all to what the Third Reich did. Katyn for example ... 22,000 dead. It was the Soviets single largest crime in Poland ... ever. The Germans committed single acts of barbarity and violence in that country that killed over 1 million people.

&gt; Natan formed in January 2002 as a Melodic Black Metal band and started playing concerts in Belgium and Holland shortly after that. Also in 2002 a 8 track demo CD 'Akeldama' was recorded, and received good critics. In 2004 and 2005 the status of the band got boosted by their memorable gigs in Germany, Switzerland and Holland, and with the release of the 'Nevel' EP.

&gt; The songs from the Nevel CD also got released on a split CD on the Mexican label Atolinga Records.

&gt; Despite the band being slowed down constantly due to line-up changes and some members' absence because of professional reasons the band managed to keep on going.

&gt; In 2007 Natan toured Belgium, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France on a first 10 days European tour.

&gt; After that, they began to write songs for the debut album, which they recorded early 2008, right before their first mini tour in Spain. After returning from Spain, Natan were signed by Iron Age Records from London for the debut album 'Het Zicht Van De Dood', released in September 2008.

&gt; Now the train is rolling, with songs on many magazines' sampler CD's, great reviews, interviews and the first gigs in England and Scotland... Who's gonna stop them? Read more on Last.fm.

However, 6v6 can add a level of complexity to building teams, selecting spawn distribution, etc.  I think 6v6 would be more interesting and gets my vote.
- Conq or Dom:  Domination.  It seems that PGI has done a decent job selecting balanced placement of the cap zone around the the comms thingy.  This is not necessarily true of the Theta cap point on all maps.
- Tons or Classes:  Tonnage-based.  Weight class-based choices usually means that people only bring 35, 55, 75 ton 'mechs.  (Assault distribution is a bit better, normally.)  I prefer there to be more viable choices for 'mech selection.

While hub-gear bikes are generally low-maintenance, when something does go wrong it can be expensive or time-consuming to repair, and not all local shops have experience with these hubs, whereas most can adjust a derailleur in 5-10 minutes and replace cables and housings in slightly longer. And once dialed in, a good derailleur system won't need anything but occasional cable tension (quarter-turn or so on the barrel adjuster) and maybe yearly cable and housing replacements.

Also, from what I've seen changing a flat tire on a hub-gear bike can be challenging, as many has horizonat dropouts for chain tension, which require precision when putting the wheel back in.

If I had a cargo bike—like a Bakfiets—I would probably want an internally geared hub, mostly because of the ability to shift when stopped, but I've not had any real issue with a good derailleur setup on a normal bike. That said, I wouldn't be averse to trying it—we're just not always as advanced as many European cycling countries.

Owners in North America are looking for decent investments. In the USA, the franchise model actually has a tendency to be profitable - it produces surpluses much more consistently than the European model and is the reason why the NFL, NBA, and MLB are so rich. This model brings high upside, but low downside. This is what American sports owners are used to, and a pro/rel system simply doesn't offer that - it provides low upside with very high downside.

&gt;You say that there's no reason for them to vote for it, but bearing in mind that they're already committing to a long term investment, there are excellent incentives to a promotion/relegation system.

There aren't. Financially, pro/rel is inferior to the franchise model. Logistically, pro/rel is inferior to the franchise model. Legally, the implementation of pro/rel offers possible oblivion via lawsuits that the franchise model does not. 

&gt;In the long term, no one doubts that it would increase the competitiveness of the league, which attracts players and attracts global audiences.

There's no evidence of that. If anything, it is the other way around: forcing a pro/rel system with the NASL (and dragging a host of unprepared franchises up to the top tier before they have been properly vetted) could easily scuttle the competitiveness of the top tier. Relegation battles are no more compelling or hard fought than playoff races. MLS can increase competitiveness very effectively without pro/rel. Finally, there is no reason to believe that this would draw an audience or attract more players. 

The fact is that many leagues (the majority of those on Earth, in fact) run on pro/rel systems and simply have not seen any of the benefits you're assuming will apply to MLS. They're not particularly competitive, they're not that attractive to talent, they don't get a ton of global viewership relative to MLS, and they're not very stable.

People won't get out of poverty if they're being exploited to work for the lowest possible wage at the worst possible conditions. The only this doesn't happen is if those same poor countries mandate that employees are paid a fair min. wage and require decent working conditions. Once and if it becomes as more expensive to move from the US to other countries, those same countries will lose the millions of jobs that were once there and move back to US or to other, cheaper, more exploitative countries. Corporations are about profit, not helping people out of poverty. If the government isn't interested in helping it's people, then those people suffer.

https://youtu.be/IGcUxcYz3ng


OP also left out the fact that they showed SC on Korean TV game channels before replays or vods so it amplified the whole PC Cafe copy cat point.

People didn't really have better than 56k until around 2002+ and even then the speeds weren't that great and video recording and file hosting sites were hard to come by. We used to watch tiny VODs of games in like well below 240p.

The point about blizz making winding maps that favored air, also is part of the reason why Terran became dominant. We all know T benefits the most with chokes and cliffs. And that is part of the reason why Boxer switched from Protoss to Terran. All those maps were god awful.

Other points about how shit ladder was,  you could do /stats and it would show rating and win-loss-disc. People would rage quit by pulling their phone cord out in order to not give you win points. And then they could just remake a new account if they got too many discs. Smurfing was also rampant. Win trading shit would happen all over because IIRC the rule was you could play someone only twice in a row, but could play another person then play them again twice in a row.

People would host games with titles like ""1v1 LT 1400+ Cablehost+ NO DC"" and all kinds of variations. If your game was up for more than a minute it would fall off the list basically. So you had to constantly remake. That wasn't really a bad thing though, wasn't hard to remake as it saved the info and map folder selection. Much better than the arcade/custom garbage we have in SC2.

You also had to have 10 melee game wins in order to play ladder. So people would just host comp stomp games (2+ players vs 1 comp because just you vs comp wouldn't count as a win) and farm wins quick. There was a minimum game time of 2 minutes on all games where it would be a draw if ending sooner. So people would unally and backstab these people. It was actually quite a challenge and fun to join a 3v1 comp stomp on [Bloodbath](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft/Blood_Bath) and try to take out 2 live players and a computer.

I wouldn't say SC died, but the blizzard ladder system did. It was too shitty a system and unmaintained. Which is why the many private servers over the years tried to take over, mainly korean servers. Which obviously caused issues with players from EU and NA trying to play on them. And I used to check users and games being played about every month, and BW was pretty solid at 50k games at any given time on USWEST up until SC2 beta dropped. 

So most of the good players, formed teams and team channels where they would play games with each other and rival clans. Naturally randoms would congregate in these channels and a few other non team channels where people would play team games of hunters, BGH, or lost temple mainly. It used to be channels with the 'Clan XXXXX' tag were moderated by an account by that name, then it changed to 'OP XXXXX'. So many channels like X17 on east or Marlboro on west would be constantly full (among other well known channels). It always felt like there was a strong community because of this. Speaking of servers, There were 4 : USWEST, USEAST, ASIA, EUROPE.

 The last bit about the game dying isn't really true. Europe, NA, and Canada had tons of really good players that all played for over a decade (and there were always 1 or 2 guys from random countries around the world that were on the same level). On teams, in tourneys, etc. Most of it was grass roots stuff and for very little money. However, everyone trained to play for WCG every year (which also had very shit maps every time [better than blizz maps though] ) and winning in your region netted you money and bragging rights, as well as seeding you into the main event where you could get owned by korean gosus. I think the only time I remember seeing a foreigner beat a korean was in 07-08 Blizzcon when Testie (who was partially retired) took games off Nal_Ra. I snuck onto his computer afterwords and uploaded the replays to Teamliquid.

&gt;The duty rate, if any, is imposed in order to remove the injury caused to the EU industry and to restore a level playing field – no more, no less. So duties are never punitive.

If the maximum tariff is 16%, its because that is the maximum anyone has been able to show is being subsidized. But as I said the real problem is that the EU is being too slow in actually investigating the issue. That 16% is only one one type of steel product- rebar.

Mijn vriendin komt van de krim en zij gelooft in het principe dat mensen die hard en eerlijk werken (fysiek en/of mentaal) recht hebben op een luxer leven. Ze houdt van haar geboorteland natuurlijk net zoals dat ze heimwee heeft naar haar familie op het geannexeerde eiland. Maar als je nagaat dat zij in haar kindertijd meemaakte hoe rijke ouders hoge cijfers voor hun kinderen op school 'kochten' terwijl zij hard moest leren of hoe zij door het stof werd gehaald voordat zij hier nog maar enkel en alleen kon studeren (dus niks geen verblijfsvergunning na het studeren, daarna hup terug) dan is het niet vreemd dat zij ongeïnteresseerd reageert als ik haar om haar voorkeur vraag voor mijn stem. Ze gunt het beste voor haar geboorteland maar dan wel onder de voorwaarde dat ze het moeten verdienen en niet verwend toegedient krijgen. Ontwikkel je eerst maar eens.

Hun journalistiek is bevooroordeeld, de mensen die ze interviewen laten ze niet uitpraten en de meeste vragen die zij stellen zijn concluderend opgebouwd waardoor enkel het antwoord 'ja' (of iets in die trant) nodig is om ze gelijk te geven.

And that's the thing. Contractors don't give a rat's ass about quality since they are not there for welfare of people, no?

&gt;One firm has to design the road, one has to execute it and the govt is the client which has to oversee the work and provide directions.

Engineers are not always dealing with educated people, you can write n no. of instruction manuals and show the right way but the onus is onto all the people. You simply can't compare working in a controlled environment with an environment with so many variables.

I'm not too keen in the actual process of construction. But I'm criticizing just the design of the road that is the problem. It is a civil engineer's mistake. (Yeah, I do agree that politicians might play a part in it).

But it is unskilled labour. I don't know why they cannot show basic things. In addition, why not just hire the people with experience again and again?

I've seen that road code. It is good, besides some design flaws that need to be updated. Some of the signage and markings are straight up copypasta from EU regulations that will not work in India. We need to examine that?

False,0,1459513591,,1463147083,podemos,Jorge_D,,False,3,"El asunto ha ido incorporando matices que obligan a ajustes en la estrategia.

El matiz más tenebroso es el pufo envenenado que deja el PP al gobierno que le suceda (incluidos ellos mismos, si fuera el caso): **¡Un ajuste de 24.000 millones impuesto por el Eurogrupo para cumplir con los criterios de estabilidad presupuestaria!**

Pedir ( ya no digamos ""exigir"") una relajación del ajuste, avocará al gobierno entrante a una negociación infructuosa (véase Portugal). Tras la cual, cabrán solo dos alternativas: 


1) Agachar la cabeza y bajarse los pantalones para tragar, recortar y desdecirse de promesas electorales en sentido opuesto (lo que se llama ""gobernar con pragmatismo y responsabilidad de Estado"").


2) Intentar negociar y, si el Eurogrupo insiste en imponernos su trágala, ir a una confrontación del estilo de la que intentó Varoufakis en su día.


Para la primera alternativa, de cara a la galería, alcanza con Snchz y Naranjito: en menos de 2 horas estarán de regreso de Berlin, exhibiendo orgullosos y sonrientes como si fuera una victoria, las medidas y recortes dictadas por Schüable contándonos las ventajas que las mismas le aportarán a España. Es decir: lo mismo que el Guindos cada vez que le arriman una alcachofa.


2) Para la segunda, el único que es capaz de encarar esa lucha es Podemos: ni el P$OE ni C's etuvieron, ni están ni estarán por la labor. Pero para eso Podemos debería poder formar gobierno por sí mismo, y actualmente ese no es el caso. Y una coparticipación de Podemos en un gobierno con el P$OE solo lograría que quedemos pegados a la opción 1. Y la sufriente opinión pública nos asociaría a los recortes impuestos por los partidos de la casta: adiós a Podemos como herramienta popular para el cambio. O eso, o Podemos debería romper la coalición con el P$OE y pasar a la oposición.


En ambos casos, ganan los reaccionarios del IBEX 35 y sus acólitos.


En esta encrucijada política, y teniendo en cuenta lo que se nos viene en forma de recortes, estratégicamente a Podemos le conviene estar en la oposición y darle caña al Gobierno sin descanso y sin el menor escrúpulo hasta que se instale en la opinión pública la idea de que con P$OE y C's el resultado es el mismo que con el PP, y que cualquier algternativa de mejora o alivio frente a las imposiciones de los mercaderes europeos solo pasa por Podemos y una alianza de *izquierdas* que no incluya ni a los sociataliberales ni a los fachas de C's y PP.


Así que, estoy seguro que quienes dirigen la estrategia de Podemos ya están pensando en unas elecciones anticipadas. Y que todas estas movidas no son más maniobras para situarnos en una posición lo más favorable posible de cara a la próxima campaña electoral.


Entre esas movidas está la renuncia de Pablo a integrar un futuro gobierno, pero aclarando que la vicepresidencia debe ser para alguien de Podemos. **Porque ya sabe que para el P$OE y C's el problema no es él (como cacarean)... sino Podemos, lo que representa y a quienes representa.**",t3_4cuqfz,3,0,t3_4cuqfz,d1loqig,t5_31h78,

It appears you're just looking at the known quantities [which are money in and money out](https://fullfact.org/economy/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) but a membership fee is not the same as the economic cost or benefit. This is a far more difficult thing to evaluate but if you check with just about any fact checking organisation, they will tell you that opinion is divided but it looks like we roughly get out what we put in.

[Here is one example](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-europe-bring-household-3000/16300) which debunks the counter claim that we get out far more than we put in.

&gt; The IOD concluded that after totting up all the economic costs and benefits, staying in the EU leaves Britain out of pocket, to the tune of 1.75 per cent of GDP.

&gt; A report by NIESR in 2004 suggested the opposite: staying in the EU creates a small net gain, and the UK’s output would be just over 2 per cent lower a year if we left.

&gt; Note that the difference between these estimates is not vast. Further studies by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the US International Trade Commission found it essentially too close to call either way.

&gt; The author of the IEA paper, the late Professor Brian Hindley, put it like this: “Any economic gain or loss is small – almost certainly less than 1 per cent of GDP… more precise or more sophisticated calculations will not arrive at a large number for either gain or loss.”

Except the extreme right-wing parties, noone is even beginning to suggest something as extreme as ""ban all muslims"". The reactions of for instance a Ted Cruz is much more extreme than what any mainstream political party is stating over here. Everyone here is very much aware that most muslims are just going about their business and are not the ones causing the problems. However, what is happening is that this recent wave of terrorism is a very harsh wake-up call. 

For years, the immigration policies here (at least in Belgium) were basicly: ""just supply them with the basics, wait a few years, and they will integrate themselves"". It has become increasingly obvious this is simply not happening. Muslims seem to struggling economically, they are over-represented in the crime-data and seem to be slowly becoming more and more extreme. The answer to the why question is most likely very complex and all political agents are trying to address these issues along multiple vectors hoping something will stick. But the truth is: we really don't have an answer yet and we're just trying to come up with it along the way.

What is happening however, is that Europe is only now openly admitting that there IS a problem. It used to be a huge taboo to point to those crime-numbers for instance and only very recently are all political parties admitting that there is a problem that needs to be adressed. 

I feel many Americans underestimate the effects that WWII still has on the European soul. Most of us have grown up with grandparents that lived through those times. We have heard their stories... Many of us have dug up unexploded grenades or helmets in our own backyards. We are all intimately familiar with the events of WWII, we have visited the graves. Alot of us have seen the concentration camps in person... 

Europe is walking on a tightrope... but we have not yet descended into a red scare and I don't think we ever will. We've had our mass-hysteria once, and it is a central aspect of why the European Union even exists... Europe is more than just an economic union. It is based on the desire to never ever have a war in these parts of the world again. It is based on a desire to protect each European citizen from their own government; to protect them from racism, to protect them from extremism. And that is why the entire refugee crisis and the current immigration problems are so hard to deal with. 

The next few decades WILL be tough, and very hard choices will have to be made. I'm sure Europe will lose more of it's innocence in the coming years but I don't think we're headed for a red scare and I don't think there will ever come a time were our borders will be closed and a specific ethnic group will be targeted.

Ah my bad. I've wasted way too much time playing Victoria 2 to be making that mistake.

&gt;but the UK sure as hell wouldn't back the Republicans. They're a joke over here, everyone sees Republicans as gun-toting, bible-bashing red-necks over here (I know it isn't true, but most people don't care that much). 

As I said in another post, I kinda doubt any actual alliances would come down to political stereotypes. I think what is most likely to happen is that our allies throu their full support behind the President, regardless of party affiliation, because he would still be the de facto head of the US military. I was just pointing out that there are several parties currently in power throughout Europe that have joined a forum with the Republicans meant for parties that hold similar views so that they can exchange ideas and coordinate political strategy.

On a side note, just out of curiosity, is your social circle mainly to the left or do you have a lot of exposure to conservatives as well? I'm assuming that you, like most of reddit, fall on the left side of the spectrum, and I've always been a little skeptical when I see comments on reddit saying that Europe universally view Republicans as their more extreme stereotypes. It just seems a little convenient given how left reddit tends to be. I'm don't want to be dismissive of it (since you would definitely know better than me), but I'm honestly curious if it's something you've heard a lot of Tories say as well. My only experience would be with my second cousin's family who lives in London, and they don't seem to think that. That's just one family, though. I know in America, at least, the rural-urban divide tends to separate the two sides and prevent exposure so a lot of people tend to grow up in echo chambers for one side or the other.

False,0,1459518978,,1463148418,soccer,pisshead_,,False,6,"&gt; which one of various reasons as to why American League football won't be taken seriously in the grand scheme of things

If they had a league full of world class players that shit all over the Euros and SAs in the WCW, and were regular WC contenders, then it would be taken seriously. I don't think the man on the street is really as obsessed with league formats as reddit is.

&gt;US leagues for other sports are allowed to be closed off and franchise based because their leagues are the best (or only) leagues in the world for their respective sports. That just can't be the case for football when they are very far behind the biggest leagues.

This doesn't make any sense. US leagues don't have relegation because the owners wouldn't allow it. Of course it's for profit, why else would people spend billions on a speculative sports league without the chance of making any money out of it? Football was never big enough in America for an 'organic' league made out of works and church teams to become professional. 

When MLS started it lost money, a lot of money. It was only kept alive by investors funnelling more and more money into the furnace. There's no way it would have survived relegation, it was hard enough to get 10k people to watch the league champions, never mind a minor league team, and Euro-style 'clubs' wouldn't have had the money to survive the losses.

What Europeans don't realise is that America is a multi-sport country. In Europe, if your town's football team is in the third division you go and watch them anyway. In America people will instead watch the NFL team, the NBA team, the MLB team, the NHL team, the college teams playing in 80k stadiums etc.",t1_d1lfhky,6,0,t3_4csrxj,d1lrkic,t5_2qi58,

Technological and scientific progress was incredible in Nazi Germany (Operation Paperclip wasn't just for fun, German scientists were ridiculously good), so in some ways, Europe could have been more ahead. If they took over Europe without the war, consolidating it into one country under their leadership, it would probably have more influence on the global scale than the total mess of a ""unified Europe"" we have now. And they were industrious as well, realizing great projects with speed and efficiency - the Autobahn or Volkswagen, for example. So yes, it's imaginable that Europe might have been better off in some ways.


But this is all, of course, extremely hypothetical. There are so many things that could, and probably would go wrong in this scenario. So, before people start going on about this, I'll do the reality check myself.


* Nazi Germany wouldn't exist without all the concentration camps, mass murders, and so on. The eradication of the lesser races was one of the core principles of the ideology.


* Since WWII came shortly after WWI, which saw the dissolution of old empires and the rise of nationalism (contributing to the establishment and power of the Nazi Party in the first place), it's hard to imagine that this sort of unified Europe could exist for long before people started wanting their little nation states back. They wouldn't be content with being under the rule of what would essentially be an empire again.


* Taking over Europe without the war would have been impossible.


And so on. Also, unified Europe has been, in some form or another, proposed for hundreds of years. It never worked out, because in the end, people want nation states. They always have and always will. It's one of the reasons the EU is failing so miserably. Everyone feels more like a German/Czech/Italian/Spaniard than like a ""European"". The nation state will always be the priority for people - it's in our nature.

It's a little bit of both, and a little bit of neither. I'm not really a Russia expert, so I'm not properly equipped to give you a solid answer, but I think that I can provide some insight.

First of all, I think that it's important to keep in mind that unlike Americans, Russians tend to view history through a much broader timeframe. Americans have the privilege of being able to think that history started in the 1700s, Russians do not. Russian history goes back about a thousand additional years, and most of that history involves repeated invasions of Russia from all sides. This gets to another key difference in the American and Russian mindsets: America is in a privileged geographic position, Russia is not. America is surrounded by two oceans and two very friendly countries. Russia is surrounded by empty plains and hostile mountains that have historically served as invasion routes. 

So fast forward to 1945, and you realize why the Russians are in such a good geographic situation. Germany, which has a long and brutal history of conflict with the Russians, is divided and in ruins. Great! France and the UK, which have fought Russia around the globe, are exhausted. Excellent! The historic routes used to invade Russia? Now controlled by Russians, with Russian troops occupying the chokepoints. Phenomenal!

So the whole cold war happens, and it ends with the USSR breaking up. The United States thinks that it won some great historic battle against good and evil. That's easy to think, because Americans' view of history is so short and so full of absolute victories. Russians just don't think that way. Instead, a weak Russia is forced to deal with the fact that it is now vulnerable in a way that it hasn't been since before the Second World War. Many former Soviet States, which are needed as buffers to protect the Russian people, are now aligning themselves with the west. Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania in NATO? Ukraine looking west? Russian power diminished around Eurasia? HORRIBLE. Ukraine was particularly egregious, since it is the birthplace of the Russian people, a breadbasket of the USSR, and was thought to be a huge bulwark of Russian nationalism, especially in the east. The idea that Ukraine was moving into the western orbit and was considering EU (and possibly NATO membership) was really a last straw.

This was never going to be a stable status quo. Things that looked nifty from the Western POV looked like disasters to anyone with a Russian nationalist POV. It was only a matter of time before someone moved to overturn many of these ""western victories.""

And speaking of matters of times, timing was an issue. Going into the first Gulf War, the Iraq Army was widely considered to be among the best in the world. People at the time actually thought that this would be a massive battle that could leave as many as 30k, if not more, Americans dead. Instead, it was a cakewalk for the Americans. Why the discrepancy between the predictions and the results? Because of something known as the third Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA). I need to get back to work so I can't spend much time on this, but just keep in mind that things like GPS, smart bombs, and advanced communications were an absolute game changer that nobody foresaw being so effective. The Iraqi Army didn't even bother to defend a flank because they thought that a desert was impassable, but that was because *they didn't know that GPS existed.* So the Russians, among other outside observers, were horrified that the US was able to overpower the Iraqis so easily. They knew that it wouldn't be possible to challenge the US now, because the US was so far ahead. The Russians, along with others, started modernizing their military in order to catch up, while the US largely stagnated due to the Iraq War. So now the Russians also have a version of GPS called GLONASS, and they have their own smart bombs and advanced communications platforms. Just look at the difference in Russian capabilities in Georgia, which was largely fought ""the old way,"" and their capabilities in Syria and Ukraine, which have involved much more modernized forms of warfare. The Russian RMA in the late 2000s allowed them to achieve something along the lines of parity with the US military, allowing them to challenge the US in a way that they could not have in the 1990s and early 2000s.

**tl;dr:** The post-Cold War status quo was never sustainable, but Russians did not have the ability to challenge it until recently.",t3_4cvscs,23,0,t3_4cvscs,d1lt0lw,t5_2sfmf,

They had their blame to go around, sure, especially when they made a lot of Neoliberal concessions. But I think equating the Kirchner administration to the origin of all of this, isn't how we should be approaching the situation.

Developing World Economies are not an easy thing to run, especially when you adopt ideological instances that are not favourable to Europe and the USA. Just remember how Cristina was aligned with the Foro de São Paulo and her instances related to the Malvinas. If that doesn't bring heat enough from the USA and their Imperialistic allies, I don't know what would bring... Just see Venezuela and how speculation coming from the centers of Capitalism accelerated their crisis. 

Besides, I hardly doubt the Kirchners had much control in their own country anyway. Latin America does have a problem with internal reactionary Industrial oligarchies that do whatever it is in their range to sabotage their own economy, so they blame the Left and their Social expendings. 

Even if the Kirchners ""just took advantage"" of a situation, Macri in the other hand is destroying Argentina on purpose, giving gifts to their Elite friends and punishing the common worker based on the fanatical faith of the ""free market"". Those are two different Argentinas and one of them is terribly worse than the other. One of them, at least gave consideration to Social expending, the other isn't. And as much we hate being in this situation, we don't have any option than to choosing one of them.

I'm up for a Left opposition against Cristina and Macri, sure, but we need to be very careful for this opposition not backfiring on us. We need to try to get rid of Neoliberal influence without throwing away the good legacies that were left for us. I say this as a Latin American and knowing we're in this mess altogether, whatever affects Argentina will affect Brazil too.

It is not a vote to cement FPTP, or to be used to claim that superior systems like PR aren't wanted

Second, viability is not a black and white easily determined fact.  Was the baby 20 or 21 weeks? At this point, we have had a 21 week old survive.

All the ways and means that made it possible are now gone, having been supplanted by the ones we now depend on, which are rapidly becoming untenable. In addition, the resources that drove European expansion and the concomitant cultural flowering are now depleted or spoiled, and the remainder is vigorously contested. 

In short, civilization is unlikely to just tumble back to a previous state of advancement, such as that of 17th century Europe, given that the conditions necessary for its existence are now absent. It is instead likely to tumble back a whole lot farther, possibly to the paleolithic-- which is to say, not civilization, really. 

I don't mean that only natural resources are lacking, or even that the global demographic scene is totally and crucially different from that of the year 1600. I mean also that the folkways, mores, norms, institutions, crafts, castes, useful arts, and entire worldviews that made up 17th century European society are practically extinct. So not only the resources are gone but also the culture, and you don't just build a culture overnight, not even if and when the culture you have doesn't work anymore. Human populations have simply never behaved that way. 

I think it's a common assumption that if modern technology failed for some reason, society could just revert to a more ""primitive"" tech level. To view 17th century Europe in this way is a mistake.

These data demonstrated extremely low human exposures as a result of normal application practices. Furthermore, the estimated exposure concentrations in humans are &gt;500-fold less than the oral reference dose for glyphosate of 2 mg/kg/d set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA 1993). In conclusion, the available literature shows no solid evidence linking glyphosate exposure to adverse developmental or reproductive effects at environmentally realistic exposure concentrations.

Meta-relative risks (meta-RRs) were positive and marginally statistically significant for the association between any versus no use of glyphosate and risk of NHL (meta-RR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.6, based on six studies) and MM (meta-RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9; four studies). Associations were statistically null for HL (meta-RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.7-1.6; two studies), leukemia (meta-RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6-1.5; three studies), and NHL subtypes except B-cell lymphoma (two studies each). Bias and confounding may account for observed associations. Meta-analysis is constrained by few studies and a crude exposure metric, while the overall body of literature is methodologically limited and findings are not strong or consistent. Thus, a causal relationship has not been established between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of LHC.

&gt;There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect related to glyphosate treatment. The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Note that there was a weak but slight association with multiple myeloma that the authors suggest that further follow up is required. Also this was among applicators who inherently are exposed to significantly higher amounts of glyphosate than end product consumers.

Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

&gt;In the opinion of BfR, the classification of glyphosate as ""carcinogenic in Group 2A"" (probably
carcinogenic to humans) as published in the 20 March 2015 issue of the ""Lancet"" journal
comes as a surprise, since other evaluations performed by supranational bodies such as the
WHO-Panel of the Joint Meeting of Pesticide residues (JMPR, 2004), and also by national
regulatory agencies such as the U.S.EPA had concluded the contrary, i.e., that glyphosate
was not carcinogenic. Unfortunately, the database on which the IARC evaluation is based is
not known, since a background monograph that is usually produced by IARC following the
evaluation meetings has not yet been released. Therefore, a comprehensive and scientifically
sound consideration of the data and arguments that led to the IARC- conclusion is simply

People in Europe are starting or merging clubs all the time despite the saturation of teams and the intense competition that comes with those conditions. 

All it takes is a grass-roots movement of supporters offering reasonable amounts of money (not much different than a political campaign or fundraiser) or one main investor that shares your enthusiasm for the sport. It's what every single club in Europe owes it's existence to, barring a few exceptions.

By the time of US occupation/nominal independence, they had been wholesale importing *peninsulares* -- immigrants from Spain and the Canary Islands -- to bolster the number of white folks. Many left after the Revolution, and Oriente Province never reached the kind of parity that they did elsewhere.

Most slaves coming to Cuba were West African, and a plurality were Yoruba coming from present-day Nigeria. The religion/cosmology of those people is *Ifa*, and their deities are called *orishas.* Obatala is the orisha of creation and justice, and is generally top orisha. Esu is one of the chief orishas since Esu controls one's fate -- even the fate of orishas -- and is the orisha everyone in the physical plane must communicate through to reach the metaphysical plane.

When slaves came to Cuba, Yoruban religion mixed with the religions of other slaves from other parts of Africa. It also syncretized with the saints of Catholicism as a well of dissembling, of saying one thing to whitey while practicing another behind their backs. In Cuba, this religion formed into what today is called Santeria, just as Haiti has Vodun, Brazil has Candomble, etc. Practitioners are called Santeros and Santeras.

The 26th of July was always based in Oriente province, a majority black, actively santero province. The 26th of July colors are black and red. Esu's colors are black and red. Even though black/red are insurrectionary colors in a European tradition, when it reached the people in Oriente it became something more than that. Many rebels wore *elekes*, beaded necklaces worn by Santeria initiates that are in the colors of a particular orisha, in this case Esu. By the time Batista fled the country and Fidel is doing his victory procession across the country, Cubans are looking at these rebel columns as an army with Esu marching at its head. When these columns reached Camp Columbia outside Havana and Fidel gave this speech, he was already seen as blessed. Then these doves landed on him -- doves are a symbol sent by Obatala -- marking him as favored by the orishas.

&gt;Tell me again how cutting social security to US levels and lower is something that would reduce our crime rates.

Guess what Vermont with all those guns has a murder rate just on par with you. Without a social safety net. 

&gt;Ah yes, the old ""trickle down economics."" I remember that working very nicely. Oh, wait...

Trickle down is about tax breaks for the rich in order to incentivize them to spend. Please do some reading. 

&gt;No, believe me when I say that giving the people with the most money more of it by means of tax cuts won't solve poverty. 

Never said that would. It will allow you to keep what you earn. Decreasing taxes on corporations to make it profitable to be based here will. It will get people working and get them money.

&gt;Let's look at another crime increasing factor: the criminal justice system. It's not based on rehabilitation and reintegration into society (which makes sure ex-inmates have a chance to become productive members of society rather than being forced into crime again to survive.), it's based on punishment. 

Yep I totally agree this is a problem.

&gt;The for-profit system helps a lot with this; inmates who leave make sure that federal spending on this prison is reduced, they have less prisoners after all. You know basic economics I presume so when I say that that's an incentive to not allow reintegration you understand it.

I don't personally agree with Gary on that topic but its far from the most important topic in this debate. It has some positives and some negatives. 

&gt;What about those with mental illnesses? Gary Johnson has no plans to help them with treatment they can't afford themselves. If I recall correctly, the Sandy Hook shooter was a mental health patient. No, he won't help them, he literally told them to stop being a victim (seriously he said this, I'll link it to you if you'd like). Unfortunately that doesn't work outside his dream world.

I agree with him. Letting these people be victims is the problem, we are not going to stop these lunatics. You can't stop them in europe and we can't stop them here. What we can do is protect people with trained responders at high risk locations like schools. Having someone on scene and trained to deal with the threat is the safest way to deal with them. Not putting up a no gun zone sticker on the window. How does that help?

Case in point: in the past year with one of my clients, I've worked with about 150 senior individual contributors who are at the top of their professional ranks. The org is a very well known international NGO; these people work with senior government officials all over the globe. They've reached a point in their careers where the opportunities to get promoted are becoming extremely scarce - there are about 400 people at their level and about 5 opportunities per year to get promoted to the next. The org is having exceptional difficulty keeping these people happy, because so many of them want to get promoted. Why? Status. They make good money, they can live easily in the US or Europe and their immigration status is protected by the NGO, the benefits are like nothing I've ever heard of in the corporate world, and they do really fascinating, challenging work with a good bit of autonomy. But they're dissatisfied because they want to get promoted again, and by and large can't or won't.

Granted, I'm citing anecdotal evidence here just as you are. My point, though, is that where *you* individually made the choice that satisfies you, in my experience of studying, working with, and observing people and organizations over the past 15 years, I don't see many people with the level of emotional maturity or self-awareness that's required to make the choice you made. The people I cited above are almost all Ph.D's, they're in their 40s &amp; 50s, and they've made it to the top of their ranks. One would think they'd be able to find professional fulfillment in their day-to-day tasks and relationships. But for many, the thing that matters most is getting promoted to a new and higher level, even if no real opportunity exists, and even if those roles (rare as they are) come with responsibilities these people admit they would find odious. It is a super-fascinating conundrum.

So I guess the more I think about it, the more I see that people chase an illusion - not strictly status itself, but the psychological reward that they believe attaches to status. 

In any case, I'm glad to know you made a good choice for you and that you're fulfilled. That's what really matters in work, after all.",t1_d1m1ehz,5,0,t3_4cvaw3,d1m25p5,t5_2rete,

There was, as is often the case with wars, more than one factor that caused the South's defeat in the civil war. I wouldn't say the south was ""backwards"" per se, but it certainly lacked the industrialization of the north as it was a largely agrarian society that grew in the south. The role of industry for the north allowed the union to produce weapons, supplies, ammunition, etc on a scale that the south simply could not keep up with. The North's dominance in terms of railroads also was a product of the industrialization. The north had far more track which allowed for faster transportation of troops and supplies, whereas the south had far less infrastructure, and most of what they had was not connected on a network and had varying gauges of trains. Point being, the North's industry allowed for faster transportation, but also allowed them to simply out-produce the south. Other factors include what I believe to be Lee's poor judgement in overall strategy, lack of European support for the south, and the Union blockade on the south that denied them income and materials they needed to wage war.

To make up for the missing cash income due to slots item removal  from CS convert *+Max Slots* CS items into *+Max Weight* items

3) get rid of of bank slots, stashes have to be infinite, and because it just cluttering the gameplay with **clickworks make a beautiful game boring**. Storage buildings must be converted into something useful, still no idea on that, but see #3

3) allow workers to produce, with appropriate new facility buildings, everything (except maybe fishing) we can produce by processing, i like to play tycoon game, i don't like to crash rocks, defending my farm from vile insects and neither milking cows.

4) Make easier for alts levelling life skills, i.e. if you have an higher life skill with any alt it will be easier to level the same skill on your alts *with a lower skill cap* and the skill levelling speed bonus will be depending on the max skill cap every alt has reached, so every bit and piece a char has learned by skilling up will add up to aid each other *lower skilled* alt in the family levelling up.

**!!! LEAST BUT NOT LAST AT ALL !!!**

&gt; +50 Extra Weight,
&gt; +8 Extra Inventory space.
&gt; 20% reduction on Tax sales in Auction House
&gt; +1 Luck
&gt; 2x Karma points gain increased
&gt; Unrestricted access to Appearance Change - so you can change your character appearance when ever you like, to what ever hair style or face you like, no restrictions.
&gt; 2) Unlike our Daum EU, which only disable Cash Shop item selling on Auction House for the launch phase, Gamenet clearly and boldly said, that Cash Shop items on Premium server  will never be sold on Auction House.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Leveling to 50 on Premium server, will give you for free:  2 Cats and One full armor costume. ( at different level). You also get 1 Cat from the Pre-order package. So every player that reach lvl 50 will have Full costume set and 3 cats at no extra price.
&gt; 
&gt; For reaching proffesional lvl 5 in Fishing - you get a Free Fishing Costume.
&gt; For reaching proffesional lvl 5 in Horse riding - you get a free Horse riding Costume.

You are correct in that it IS the Pentatonic foundation of the A minor scale. It also is the Blues scale without the tritone. Insert an F#/Gb and you have one of the most basic and pure Blues Scales in use. 

You are also correct about the use of the scale in Asia, but its not limited to Asia. Just about every country, especially in the Western European tradition uses the pentatonic scales in their folk songs, including the US. And we use this scale in some of our minor folk songs as well as the Dorian version or RE Penton and in some cases the Mi Pentaton. Just as the major scale can be rotated to form the church modes, their pentatonic counterparts do the same. 

You could also call it the Aeolean Pentaton and its true that no what you call it, it sounds so sweet! 

I used it as an introduction to my elementary kids to prepare them for the Blues. Its rather easy to learn to hear the pentatonics and that is why Kodaly uses it to teach the young students because the children of Hungary learned to sing the Hungarian folksongs and they were predominately in the pentatons. He then used the songs that they already knew and trained the kids to sing and play the music together and then he used it to teach them to read, write and hear the music in the pentatonic scales and then he filled in the blanks as they got older and more experienced.

Now that we have 2 World Cup under our belts, we have a real incentive for players to make the switch, and the World Cup has also brought in a ton of resources for the federation, which has become one of the most professional in the world. Roots really have nothing to do with it, we have players on the team that have never been to Algeria, don't speak Arabic, didn't have a passport when they first got called up and basically no almost nothing of the country. 

I think if Jamaica becomes a major player in the region (and becomes a regular at the World Cup), you'll definitely see a lot more English-born Jamaicans make the switch.

This isn't even correct

America is culturally very different to many of those countries as well. Canada has state funded religious Catholic schools? On we to the right on that? Europe has a more regressive tax code? Or we to the right on that? Europe has lower corporate taxes Many European countries have harsher abortion limits America. Europe has far more politically powerful nationalist movements. Many countries in Europe have entirely private emergency services. Europe has far more restrictions on free speech. Australia has way more state censorship. Japan has way stricter immigration policies. The UK has a state religion. So if we're to the left to all those countries on all of those issues, how are we so decidedly to the right in your view?

&gt;I also think it's insane that you're trying to define a party with policies that haven't even been implemented yet, such intellectual dishonesty.

Is this a joke? Half of the thing liberals attack Republicans for are things they want to do but haven't done yet.

You attack Republicans for wanting to repeal. You attack Republicans for wanting to limit abortions. You attack Republicans for wanting to implement voter id(something everyother European nation does btw). 

A parties idea doesn't have to passed to be a definte part of the parities platform.

&gt;In fact many of Hillary's idea poll well with Americans and they seem pretty tame in comparison to truly left platforms ala Bernie Sanders.

Yes, Hillary is center-left to left depending on the issue. There are many Republican ideas that poll equally well.

&gt;But I'd like the point out how you completely ignore the adoption of the religious right by the Republicans - that single event alone represents a major shift to the right, especially on social issues.

Republicans haven't moved to the right on social policy any time recently. I don't know why you're actually like the conservative party have socially conservative positions makes them far right?

The best text for the education of young princes in warfare is *De Rei Militari*, by the great Vegetius! This worthy ancient, though he was in fact a Roman, knew the glory of Christ and was extremely wise in all the ways of war. His genius and insight into battle is obviously the result of divine inspiration. Of course he could not have predicted some of the great changes in the methods of war since his day. The powder of our guns is more effective at reducing the walls of a fortification than any siege implement ever devised (with the possible exception of treachery). The true education in battle, of course, is practical experience, not books. No scholar, though he may describe the glories and hardship of war with keen insight, can understand battle unless he has fought in it. We have commanded soldiers since the age of [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shrewsbury). Our military skills were further honed, like the edge of a sword, when Our royal father (may he rest in peace) commanded Us to suppress the revolt of the cursed Welsh rebel Owain Glyndŵr. By the time We took the throne following Our father's death in 1413, We were fully prepared to reopen war with the French and reclaim Our rightful throne of France. We were, by the grace of God almighty, totally successful at the field of Agincourt. We won Our crown and Our lovely Queen Katherine of Valois in the years after my victory. Reading Vegetius is well and good for the theoretical scholar and young nobles who are not yet old enough for battle, but by the time a prince becomes a man, he must be ready to take the field and command his men from the front ranks.

A lot of Caol Ila’s stuff goes to making blends, particularly it gives the smoky character to the Johnnie walker blends. There are some fantastic independent bottlings of Caol Ila, however this is the first time I’ll be trying something similar in age to the 12 year old original bottling that serves as the core expression.


Maltbarn is a relatively small bottler from Germany, known for good quality, albeit somewhat pricey bottlings.

**Aged 14 years. 58.8%ABV. Matured in a sherry cask. No colour added, non-chill filtered and bottled at cask strength from a single cask.**

* **Nose:**  Very much a Caol Ila. Salty, mineral peat. Bonfire ash. Citric acid. Slight hint of musty old books (refill sherry?). Earthy green herbs, fennel, thyme, sage. Treated thatch roofing. There’s a slight woody sweetness hiding under all the layers as well.

* **Palate:** Sharp salt and mineral peat. Lemon bitters. Quite a creamy mouthfeel. Some porridge notes. Citrus oil. Sandalwood. Some caramel candies.

* **Finish:** Long. Peat. Ash. Oil smoke. Lemon rind. Brown sugar.

**Rating:** Try this

**Global VFM:** 2/5

**Local VFM:** N/A

This was had a lot of the standard Caol Ila profile, but had a lot more kick and complexity to it on account of being cask strength and without chill filtration. The sherry influence was barely noticeable so probably a refill cask, but a good one. Just a tad on the pricey side of things at around 115 Euros on the EU market.

No, you must still be in doubt about whether it can work, because it has not existed. If it had existed and failed several dozen times, as Marxism has, then your ability to say it should be dismissed is MUCH GREATER than if it has never been tried and thus we have never seen empirical results from its implementation.

We've seen results of Marxism, and it has failed over and over. Marxism is in a FAR worse place than ancap in terms of plausibility.

&gt; And again, such arguments could be used against democracy and capitalism in Europe until the 20th century; this is not a reasonable argument to dismiss an ideology.

And you nailed it, too, I am from America but I do genuinely want to understand it better because it seems like people are trying to put out fire with fire.   
I definitely understand it better now with the context of the different cultures and the desires from some refugees to change the laws and impose the systems they grew up in.   
It sucks because the media tells very select stories, especially when the news comes overseas to here since the US is really quite removed from the whole situation in general.   
And I've only really heard the ""They want Sharia law"" argument from people like Trump, which is absurd because that is really not an issue that comes to America since we have a much much smaller Muslim population, as you pointed out. With that said, I can definitely see the truth in that statement when applied to the situation in Europe because of the much larger concentration of refugees. What I'm saying here is that I had the impression of ""that's bullshit"" to the fear of Sharia law because when used by US politicians it's baseless fear/hate-mongering, but now given more insight from people like you, I definitely see it is a much more relevant issue in Europe.   
So thank you for your response/explanation. One thing I do worry about is that I still find it slightly problematic to lump this desire for Sharia law onto *all* of the refugees, because I do know there are many who do not have that desire. But it's a really hard situation in terms of identifying who wants what, so I don't know how else you would exactly distinguish between the Muslims who just want to live versus those who want to bring their laws over here.

The problem is that a lot of what we have previously understood about nutrition has been profoundly *wrong.* And, I suspect, we will continue to make and correct mistakes well into the next century or two. 

For example, right now we have a massive sugar endemic, and we're only starting to realize it. Sugar, in the quantities that they are commonly consumed, is *incredibly* bad for us. Especially all that processed sugar like HFC. Moreover, it's *addictive*. If you haven't already, I suggest you try to completely remove all sugar from your diet for a week. If you're like most Americans and Europeans, you'll experience headaches and tremendous cravings. That's basically a *withdrawal.*

But you've also got a massive industrial powerhouse that wants to keep consumption at these levels. All that soda and candy (not to mention the other high carbohydrate junk food like chips and crackers). And of course the massive corn lobby in America that wants to make sure Americans are scarfing down stupid amounts of HFC. We practically need to go through the same problem we went through with tobacco.

Pus-me a olhar para as estrelas e de repente senti que o tempo começou a ter algumas quebras, era como se eu estivesse em modo debug no universo e conseguisse ver a realidade para além dos filtros normais, a observar a realidade por aquilo que ela é, como se estivesse separado dela; assim como uma pessoa vê o código assembly de um programa a ser executado no Olly Debugger. Às vezes voltava à realidade, outras vezes voltava ao modo debug... ia e vinha, em ondas.

Até que de repente aconteceu algo que eu não estava nada à espera e foi tão intenso que só de pensar agora estou a ficar com arrepios: Comecei a absorver toda a natureza à volta e as fronteiras da minha consciência ficaram extremamente maleáveis e começaram aos poucos a fundir-se com o resto das coisas à minha volta: árvores, pedras, terra... e cada vez mais e mais rápido, céu, espaço, estrelas... até que fundi-me com todo o universo, em todas as dimensoes espaciais e na dimensão temporal.

And many great men have raised such an accusation. Martin Luther wrote in his book ""Of The Jews And Their Lies:""
""They stabbed and pierced the body of the young boy Simon of Trent. They have also murdered other children...The sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they who imagine to be the people of God, and who desire to and think they must murder and crush the heathen. Jesus Christ, the Almighty Preacher from Nazareth, spoke to the Jews: ? Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning...""
""He (Martin Luther) accused them (the Jews) of all those fictitious crimes which had made Europe such a hell for them. He, too, claimed that they poisoned the wells used by Christians, assassinated their Christian patients, and murdered Christian children to procure blood for the Passover. He called on the princes and rulers to persecute them mercilessly, and commanded the preachers to set the mobs on them. He declared that if the power were his, he would take all the leaders of the Jews and tear their tongues out by the roots."" (Stranger than Fiction, p. 249)
The Struggle of Der Sturmer: The only newspaper in Germany, yes, in the entire world, which often screamed the accusation of ritual murder into the Jewish face, was Der Sturmer. For more than ten yeas Der Sturmer led a gigantic battle against Judaism. Which caused Der Sturmer to be under constant attack by the Jews. Dozens of times it has been confiscated and prohibited.
Its workers, most of all its editor Julius Streicher, were dragged into court hundreds of times. They were convicted, punished and locked into prison. Der Sturmer came to know the Jew from the confession which Dr. Conrad Alberti-Sittenfeld, a Jew, wrote in 1899 in No. 12 of the magazine Gesellschaft:
""One of the most dangerous Jewish qualities is the brutal, direct barbaric intolerance. A worse tyranny cannot be practiced than that which the Jewish clique practices. If you try to move against this Jewish clique, they will, without hesitating, use brutal methods to overcome you. Mainly the Jew tries to destroy his enemy in the mental area, by which he takes his material gain away, and undermines his civil existence. The vilest of all forms of retaliation, the boycott, is characteristically Jewish.""
The Der Sturmer was not stopped for several years. Just in Nuremberg alone there have been fought dozens of Talmudic and ritual murder cases in the courts. (Now you know why the Nuremberg trials were held against the German Military leaders, it was retribution by the Jews on their hated enemies the Germans). Because of the Jewish protests the attention of the world was focused on these cases. Thereafter heavy convictions followed. At first no judge had the courage to expose the Jewish problem. Finally in 1932 (court case lasting from October 30th to November 4th) Der Sturmer won its first victory. The jury found the following:
1). Der Sturmer was not fighting against the Jewish religion; but against the Jewish people. 2). The Talmud and Schulchan aruch are not religious books. They have no right to be protected under the religious paragraphs. 3). The laws of the Talmud which are quoted and published in Der Sturmer are exact quotations from the Talmud. 4). The laws of the Talmud are in harsh contradiction to German morals. 5). The Jews of today are being taught from the Talmud.
With this verdict Der Sturmer brought about the first big breach in the Jewish/Roman Administration of Justice, which was given the job before the National Socialist revolution to protect Judaism and its government. The jews, of course, became greatly agitated about this. But for De Sturmer this success was an omen of the victory yet to come. Of course, Der Sturmer did not stop half way. It knew what had to be done. It was their duty, or so they believed. To frustrate the gigantic murder plot of Judaism against humanity. It was their duty! To brand this nation before the world, to uncover its crimes and to render it harmless. It was their duty! To free the world from this national pest and parasitic race. Der Sturmer would fulfill its mission. It would, for a time, light up the darkness with the truth which shall eventually rule the world. And it would always direct itself according to the following proverb: ""He who knows the truth and does not speak it truly is a miserable creature.""
The Laws of The Talmud: If one wishes to learn and understand why the Jews can commit such insane crimes as ritual murder, they must know the Jewish secrets. They must know the teachings of the Torah (The Talmud), and the Schulchan aruch. These laws and teachings are proof that the Jews feel themselves superior to all nations, that it has declared war on all other races, and that it is the sworn enemy of the whole of non-Jewish humanity. Even Tactius, the Roman historian who lived shortly after Christ (55-120) A.D.) wrote:
""The Jews are a race that hate the gods and mankind. Their laws are in opposition to those of all mortals. They despise what to us is holy. Their laws condone them in committing acts which horrify us."" (Historian V. 3-8)
The Jew knows that when the non-Jewish world knows his laws and sees through his plans that he is lost. Therefore, by threat of death he forbids their translation and publication. A well known Jewish scholar (Dibre David) writes:
""If the Gentiles (non-Jews) knew what we are teaching against them, they would kill us.""",t1_d1m66g4,-5,0,t3_4ct3xr,d1m6by0,t5_2qh4r,

As to the former, Lee probably gets more credit than he deserves as an individual, but regardless the South's generals were far more competent than the north. Many of his feints and in-battle strategies are still taught at West Point and the like as textbook examples. By comparison the North's generals were atrocious -- although perhaps that's really why the Southern generals looked so good. It's really a testament to the superiority of the Southern leadership and enlisted men -- and their cavalry in particular -- that the war lasted as long as it did.

The South did have substantial European support -- especially England (as the Brits' textile mills were desperate for the South's cotton). The problem for the South was that they couldn't really utilize that support (or trade that very cotton for the arms they so needed) because of the North's blockade that you mentioned.",t1_d1m25z5,3,0,t3_4cwyw3,d1m6hal,t5_2qh53,

Demographics: we have 300+ million people. We have the largest population of any first world country, with a high obesity rate. Obesity leads to heart related issues, which are some of the most expensive medical procedures on the market. Similarly, with free-further education, we have a large number of students, AND as a culture we strongly believe that everyone should go to college. Which means, we have, by ratio, higher levels of people applying for colleges and tertiary schools. Compare 92% in the US to 60% in Germany.  And then apply that to the sheer number of people in the US. 

Also, where as first world nations like in Europe have the luxury of having a lot of their population centered in a few cities, the US population is spread out, with certain states such as California being far far more richer, and more expensive to live in than states like Montana.

So you may say, well why don't you instead allocate more tax resources towards that.
To which I'd reply: And what, ask the rest of the first world nation to actually defend themselves rather than relying continually on American military power to protect them? our military budget is large for a reason. And there is a reason why European countries have such relatively small militaries and continually rely on the US for any kind of military intervention (such as in the mid-east which the Europeans are far more dependent on than the US).

But then, more than half of our budget already goes to things like Social Security and Welfare, and try pushing any kind of reform in those things and you'd be essentially committing political suicide.

The rifle is to weaken the shielding without entering the vicinity of the other Spartan.

[And yes, I do expect them to punch each other to death.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/halo/images/2/2f/Palmer_fighting_Scruggs.png/revision/latest?cb=20140227001748)

&gt;There's no reason to claim that it's ""more advanced"" to any degree that actually matters, as it lacks the feat for that assumption to be logical.

It can do things nothing today can, like survive atmospheric reentry without means of significant deceleration, heat shielding, etc., as well as the impact itself. 

&gt;And holy crap, are you really parading around ""ODST armor protects from handguns"" as if that means anything? Hint, modern hard body armor can take getting shot with pistols all day with no problems.

1. Proof?

2. Modern handguns and M6 magnums are completely different. Most guns do not have high explosive .50 caliber rounds

&gt;You're literally using gameplay mechanics while at the same time claiming that what we play in the game has little relation to what's actually happening. This isn't really a logical stance. I mean, we can totally use gameplay if you want to (I actually think the supposed divide between gameplay Chief and fluff Chief is very exaggerated and the result of nitpicking outliers), but if we do then there's no real point to this conversation, as Flood forms (and friendly marines) can clearly kill you with assault rifles

[That isn't a gameplay mechanic, armor regen is canon. Nanotech from the Mk.VII has been implemented in GEN2 suits to keep them going without damage.](http://halo5universe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/H5-Beta-Armor-Body-MarkVIGen1Scarred.jpg) I'm not being the hypocrite here.

&gt;That's not how shrapnel works; grenade shrapnel is by its very nature low velocity and easily stopped by body armor. If it is effective against vehicles, it's because of its explosive power.

Force per square inch then. At a certain point, it's pretty much undeniable that if something can survive an explosion of a given magnitude, it'd survive, say, a bullet. Even if they don't correlate so directly, the implication is there.

&gt;also, Spartan armor being tougher than 'light armored vehicles' means pretty much nothing unless the type of vehicle is specified; I have no doubt a Spartan is better protected than a Ghost for example

It's obviously referring to a human-made vehicle since everything was designed to combat other humans.

&gt;first and foremost the assumption that the only sniper rifle he could possibly be referring to is an anti-tank rifle

The SRS99-AM rifle is not an anti-tank weapon, it's anti-matériel. It's also the only human weapon outside of the Hard Sound rifle and experimental railgun to be ever called a sniper rifle in the Halo universe. Without the precedent set for other weapons, you need to prove it wasn't a SRS99-AM.

&gt;secondly that he even knew he hadn't been killed in the brief second he thought it was sniper fire, since he dismisses that possibility when ""his vision cleared"".

I'm struggling to understand what you mean by this. Spartans obviously have enhanced reaction times and senses, and their HUDs should keep them in the loop about stuff like the state of pressurization of their suit. He would know pretty much instantly had he been shot, with or without his vision, since there's all sorts of other means providing the information, like sound and touch. 

&gt;Do we have any actual reason to believe they were 'special'?

Because while they are both AP, M118 is used in *everything*, fucking *everything*, yet this is the first time we hear about this other armor piercing ammunition and Kurt displays expressed interest. Are you telling me the rebels don't normally use AP when the UNSC makes it pretty much standard issue? 

&gt;Actually, if you read the book, he was specifically commenting on the fact that they brought AP at all- he makes no reference to the specific type of round, nor do his comrades need him to for them to immediately understand his meaning. Apparently they're not standard for these guys.

That's ridiculous. The majority of Insurrectionist equipment is old UNSC stuff. How long ago do you think they just started using AP rounds? 

&gt;The design has nothing to do with it, I was specifically referring to the fact that it's thick rear armor was insufficient for resisting .50 BMG.

And?

&gt;It's still canon, more so than actual gameplay, which you have attempted to cite.

Wrong on both accounts, never did I cite gameplay, and game manuals have never been accepted canon anywhere.

&gt;No it's not, it's high tech body armor that they use for stealth ops:
They had used these black suits before. They were form-fitting, lightweight polymer body armor. They could deflect a small-caliber round and had refrigeration/heating units that would mask infrared signatures. The integrated helmet had encryption and communications gear, a heads-up display, and thermal and motion detectors. It's clearly the same armor they normally use. If you have a feat suggesting that the black soft sections of the armor can withstand assault rifle fire (btw, that ""titanium nanocomposite"" bit- where does that come from?), share it.

How is that any different from what I said, without the extra tidbits?

[Anyway, this is what it is referring to.](http://www.halopedia.org/images/d/d6/H4-MJOLNIR-Skinsuit.jpg) That's the titanium nanocomposite, as described by page 30 of the Halo Encyclopedia. [What you're referring to is this](https://youtu.be/4yc5DNIUkrk?t=2098). See the difference? They're not the same.

&gt;MC is worried about some ODST's rifles breaching his suit after depleting his shields.

No where is this stated.

&gt;Scruggs quickly dispatches two Spartans and several other combatants with just a SAW. 

How can you be certain it was the SAW that killed them?

&gt;Years before, Palmer was forced to retreat from battle after several Insurrectionist boarders with assault rifles managed to get a few hits on her.

Scans?

&gt;The Spartans in GoO said that they were risking their lives by possibly exposing themselves to light machine gun (7.62 AP) fire.

Which you refuse to acknowledge for being clearly more powerful than what want to give credit for.

&gt;A high caliber Innie rifle was considered enough of a death sentence for Buck's whole unit to freak out.

Explain.

&gt;Elites with comparable equipment to Spartans get taken out all the time by assault rifles and even weaker weapons in books and cutscenes. So do Brutes.

Uh, no. Brutes and Elites typically nerf themselves intentionally. They could be running into battle with much more powerful equipment on the regular but choose not to. Hell, Brutes often don't bother wearing much if any armor at all. [Here's what it looks like when an Elite is using comparable equipment to a Spartan.](https://youtu.be/RUQ3k4KpL1c?t=743)

&gt;""The crystalline projectiles are slow and ineffective to even light armor and will simply bounce off of them"".

Where are you getting that from? We've had at least two Spartans in MJOLNIR die from blamite shards.

&gt;Funnily enough, Spartans still spend a good deal of time in the EU fighting humans.

It's really not that common, relatively speaking. Maybe more in the EU, but across the series they make up like 10% of the encounters Spartans actually struggle in, if that.

&gt;The aliens are hardly ""megaOP"", they routinely get gunned down by regular marines

Is that so?

&gt;and their ""ultra-deadly weapons"" are not so ultra-deadly going by their official stats and every single visual showing.

1. Official stats?

2. Every single visual showing?

&gt;""Basically magic"" is ""a simple feature""?

Compared to Polymerized Lithium Niobecene, yes. At least we have materials like [Aluminum oxynitride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxynitride) today. Just make that, but with lots of fancy tech, and you have a MJOLNIR visor.

&gt;He's clearly getting hit across his body rather than having the force of a blow specifically concentrated on his face, hence why the shield bash launches him, so that's not actually as impressive as you think. 

You think it's unreasonable to suggest that the shield hit him face first?

&gt;Unless you can actually quantify how hard Locke was hitting, then you still don't have a case for arbitrarily declaring his visor (or heck, the rest of his helmet) immune to 7.62x51mm. A punch and a bullet are not remotely the same thing.

[Okay, fine, here's Cal-141 taking a gravity hammer to the face, which just barely causes it to crack.](https://youtu.be/2kPvBqSlIEc?t=835) That's easily at least 2 tons of force being applied to the faceplate. 

Now you're probably thinking ""boy, does this guy not understand how armor works"". Listen, at a certain point, it doesn't matter whether or not it's piercing or blunt force, it's still lbs/in^2 , or in this case a few hundred lbs/in^2 . You can't deny that. I bullet being sharper than a hammer stops mattering after a certain point, and this feat should demonstrate that.",t1_d1liif2,3,0,t3_4c54lz,d1m92i6,t5_2s599,0202

This is by many considered the end of the Viking era. Civil war errupted etc since Hardrada was killed in the battle of Stamford and he had many claimants to the throne of Norway.

The settlers in the Americas had little backup from home since Scandinavian rulers had more interest in domestic issues rather than conquest in new lands and crittical mass of settlers would not be achievable with the scarce population in Scandinavia.

Most likely, the settlers of the americas went back to Norway, Iceland etc. Possibly some settlements overrun by the natives. There are sagas of settlers going back to Europe. One woman for example, Guðríður Þorbjarnardóttir who lived around 1000, gave birth to the first (recorded) European in the Americas. His name was Snorri Þorfinnsson.

Some good number of decades prior, for example, the parliament said that the king was only allowed to have 3000 men, and he would have to ask the nobility for more. Which they often refused.

The Sejm made many other corrupt, and bad, decisions, and effectively left Poland as a weak, laughable thing.

By the time of the First Partition, Poland had effectively become a Russian puppet, although there were a few revolutions from time to time which Russia had to put down. As such, Russia was getting kind of sick of Poland.

The Russians had been beating back the Ottomans multiple times, resulting in a shift of the balance of power of central/eastern Europe towards Russia.

The Austrians were considering taking on Russia in an attempt to restore a balance, but France, which was trying a friendly policy with both, suggested that Prussia give Austria Silesia back, and Poland would give up Prussia proper and parts of Latvia. Prussia was not interested, but did not want to risk another war with Austria. So, the three effectively came up with the idea to eat away at Poland. Austria was not wholly keen on it at first, but eventually the King of Prussia's brother egged them into agreeing.

So to answer your first question, Poland's relations with Russia were poor because they were a bunch of rioting little bastards who resented the situation as the Tsardom's puppet that they had gotten themselves into, their relations with Prussia were poor because they owned parts of Prussia (the region) and some other German territory, and their relations with Austria weren't really the reason Austria was interested so much as maintaining the balance of power was.

With the second partition, Poland once again revolted against Russia, which was allied to Prussia, and so the two punished it by eating away at it some more.

The third was for much the same reason.


Nobody else really cared because of the balance of power being kept, and it was a contemporary argument that the partitions were justified since the Sejm's policy of liberum veto (effectively, any vote had to be unanimous or else it would fail) had fucked over the entire country. Russia also used the justification of parts of its new territory having been owned by the Rurikids (first Tsars) in the past, and so it had had claim to them.

--------------------
  
**MAUL:**  
  
**PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:**  
A half-Zabrak, half-Human Male, standing at over 2 metres tall, Maul was a physical tank. His Zabrak half allowed him natural pain tolerance and his human half granted him resiliancy.   
Maul's two main feats when it comes to his physical capabilities are his resiliancy/endurance and his martial skill, though the former is more prominant an attribute.   

The majority of his training with Sidious was either bladework, or testing his endurance. Constantly submitted to torture during his training, he was built to resist pain. He has even been able to resist the effects of force lightning subjected upon him by a nightsister, though she was likely no where near as proficiant in the ability as Dooku. Maul, being the physical tank that he is, would be able to endure an incredibly long fight, he would be able to endure glances from his opponents glancing blows and he could endure the pain of being slammed with the force. Wearing Maul down would not work effectively, especially for opponents with dwindling endurance.   Eventually, he would endure and his opponent would begin to slow down, at which point he would take an advantage. Nothing but a strike as decisive as a decapitation, lunge through the chest or bisection/slash deep through the torso would take him out of the fight.  

Maul was a trained martial artist in Teras Kasi. Teras Kasi practitioners was known for being adept at hand to hand combat and using speedy attacks, with offense and defense in mind, able to dodge blows and slip away from decisive strikes. They were also trained to close off their mind from force users, able to defend themselves from mental attacks. Teras Kasi was designed for non-force users to combat force users specifically. Maul used it in tandem with his force augmentation (which further increases his speed) and only the few could match his martial talent.    
  
**DUELING:**  
Although he would use both a double bladed lightsaber and a single bladed lightsaber during his time as a Sith, I will be observing his use of the single bladed variant as it had a more prolific use during his time in the Clone wars, which is where I am examining him.  
Maul would be trained by Sidious to specialize in form VII: Juyo, the final and most agressive of all lightsaber forms. Juyo drew from the dark side and on the emotions, particularly rage, of the practicioner. Many users of Juyo would incorperate Dun Moch into their arsenal, and whilst Maul was more concerned with the physical aspects of the form, he was no exception, using it against Obi-Wan during the clone wars. Juyo users were, however, also known for being very aggressive and offensive, often leaving themselves open to counter attacks.  

Maul would also become proficiant in the use of Niman, particularly the dueling style of Niman, focusing more on the physical aspects rather than incorperating the force into his attacks. Also, particularly, he would focus on using the duel-fencing Jar'kai variant of Niman. As I mentioned before, Niman as a dueling form, was more of a jack of all trades form. It had no particular strengths and no particular weaknesses.     
Although never stated, Maul likely has knowledge of Ataru as he often incorperated acrobatics and martial arts, such as his proficiancy with Teras Kasi hand to hand combat. Form IV: Ataru was a form that incorperated speed, acrobatics and martial skill into the style. A form 4 user would use both their lightsaber and their body as a weapon.  
These styles would complement his physical abilities.  
He was adept at incorperating martial arts into his attacks and utilized both his impressive speed and endurance to his advantage.  
He was also somewhat tactical in dueling his opponents. Rather than charging ahead, if he could not outduel his opponents, he would attempt to control the fight, leading it around and wearing his opponent down, incorperating his endurance by drawing the fight out on his terms, and incorperating his agility and speed by somersaulting and flipping with ease, leading the battle to a place of his choosing, as he did against Qui-Gon.

Also, whilst in the TV series and Movies, Jedi and Sith appear to only move as fast as regular humans (except in, what, a single/few instances) in both the EU and Canon (assuming Film novels are still canon, which I believe they are)  Jedi actually move at FTE speeds.  
In some cases, especially powerful force sensitives can appear FTE to the massivly FTE.  
Considering even Grievous can appear largely FTE at times and Maul is the better combatant than, him, I'm inclined to believe Maul is incredibly fast when compared to non-force-sensitive combatants.    
I.E, whilst he cannot use the force offensively in this fight, he can use it to augment his own speed and sense his surroundings.   
However, enough skill, prep or power should be sufficient to defeat him.  
  
Also, in this match-up. Whilst his is unfamiliar with metal staffs in comparison to plasma based weapons, making his style of quick slashing attacks, rather useless, he definitely has incredible strength, speed and martial skill to back it up.

Here's my dilemma:

I'm eyeing the Amex Hilton current high bonus offers and want one of them, but I'm not sure which one would be best. I'm leaning towards the 100,000 offer if I can get approved for it (hit things pretty hard the last 7 months) since I won't plan on keeping this card after the first year. I already have the no-fee Citi card, but the Amex card is probably better for daily earning. On the other hand, I'm likely to close my Citi AA later this year so I wouldn't be opposed to having one card at each major bank.

I'm over thinking this, I know. I think this is a six in one hand, half dozen in the other situation, but which card would y'all go for of the Amex Hiltons?

Any cards I'm overlooking? I don't think I can touch any more Chase cards. My current Hyatt app is in 2-week pending mode so I'm looking at other banks.",t3_4ck9yn,1,0,t3_4ck9yn,d1mcqmh,t5_2vrf0,

Thought that article also names Geithner as another major villain. 

&gt;the Goldman Sachs view of the economy. You cause collateral damage all over, but that’s what Wall Street does. You can’t punish them for it. They’re just doing what a predatory financial institution does. So Obama said “No, , I’m not going to do that,” [meaning write down the mortgage debts as he had promised voters in Column A]. He came in and appointed Wall Street’s main lobbyist, Tim Geithner, as Treasury Secretary.

&gt;Geithner appears in almost every dirty dealing episode of the book. He was the bagman. He was the person who [Sheila Baoir] accused of blocking the FDIC when it wanted to take over Citibank, which not only was broke but was a criminalized organization.

&gt;Geithner was suitably rewarded by getting a rich job on Wall Street. The Japanese call that “descent from heaven.” When you take your rewards, having sold out the economy to your backers, you get a nice job and end up rich for life.

&gt;And when Greece had real problems, the fact that the German and French banks had made too many loans to it, the IMF was going to write down the Greek debt. But then Geithner got on the phone with Europe, and Obama went to the G20 meetings and said, “Look, you can’t write off the Greek debt, because the American banks have essentially turned into horse race betters. We have casino capitalism. They have bet and promised to guarantee, the Greek bonds. If the Greek bonds are written down, the American banks will go under. And if we go under, we promise we’re going to bring you down too. We’re going to bring down the European banks. Do you really want that to happen?”

&gt;So the gambles made by Wall Street ended up almost driving Greece out of the European Union. Wall Street was willing to tear Europe apart politically just for the Wall Street investment banks – basically four banks – to make gains by insuring the Greek debt, by treating the financial market like a horse race.

&gt;That’s where we are now. It’s not really about imperialism draining foreign economies. It’s Wall Street making bets. And essentially it’s by Wall Street running the European Central Bank. Just like Europe has to do burden sharing in NATO, the financial ministries have to do burden sharing with the U.S. Treasury.

Of course the real villains are the wealthy. Rubin and Geithner just work for them. They are the ones we need to feed to the guillotine. ",t1_d1mcve6,1,0,t3_4cxuoy,d1md2lf,t5_2qh4r,

Wow.  I'd like to know what people think 'failing subcultures' means.  I replied to someone else, but I'm referring to the hidden communities - the poor, minority, gangs, mentally uncomfortable, etc.  We prefer to cover these areas up and pretend they don't exist.

We have systematically trapped people into these areas and give them few means to escape.  If they dare try, we throw them in prisons and again - ignore them.

Personally, I think Bernie is a great choice for the 'down-trodden' in our communities.  However they are experienced and the only people that manage to throw a buck or two their way have a ""D"" next to their names.  They don't trust old white guys ... and why should they?

Today at the former German concentration camp at Dachau, it is no longer claimed that Jews or anyone else were ever killed in the gas chamber there. In the room that is supposedly a gas chamber, one can clearly read a sign written by the museum authorities in five languages which says, ""THE GAS CHAMBER disguised as a 'shower room' –- never used as a gas chamber.""[1] Although the room was completed in 1942, it was never used for its intended purpose -– presumably, it was used for other purposes; perhaps it was used as a shower room after all.

At the western end of the crematorium building which houses the so-called gas chamber ""disguised as a shower room,"" one can today see and walk through four delousing chambers which were used to fumigate clothing.[2] The only explanation regarding these chambers is a sign above them, also in five languages, which simply says ""Fumigation cubicles"" in English and Desinfektionskammern in German. There is no mention anywhere within the camp of the important fact that these chambers used Zyklon-B to fumigate clothing as well as other articles placed within the chambers.

The ""shower room"" is not a gas chamber at all, but the so-called ""fumigation cubicles"" are gas chambers. Moreover, the ""fumigation cubicles "" are extremely well-designed gas chambers which represented, and may still represent, the state of the art in gas chamber design. They were the product of more than 20 years of research and development into the application of hydrocyanic acid (often referred to simply as cyanide) for the extermination of vermin. This is clearly shown by the extensive German technical literature from the end of World War I through World War II on this subject.[3]

The delousing chambers at Dachau were far superior in design to the gas chambers which are still used in this country for the execution of criminals. As a consequence of their design, the operating procedures for the delousing chambers at Dachau were quite simple; for example, although gas masks had to be available, the operators were only required to use them in emergencies or in special situations. By contrast, the American gas chambers for executions still require the use of gas masks during the normal post-execution procedures. Compared to the American gas chambers, the German delousing chambers at Dachau were also safer to operate and far less expensive to construct.[4]

At the end of this article I have added a translation of one of the many articles that can be found in the German wartime technical and medical literature discussing the proper use of Zyklon-B for the control of typhus through the extermination of its principal carrier, the body louse. (See appendix.) The article by Emil Wustinger is especially important because of the numbers it gives to show the extent to which the Zyklon-B delousing technology was actually used by the Germans to save people from the ravages of typhus. According to Wustinger, 25 million people had already had their clothing and personal belongings fumigated from the start of the war until the beginning of 1944. This number is, interestingly enough, the same as the one which appears in the Gerstein statement as the number of people who had been ""killed"" in gas chambers.
Zyklon B
Until the introduction of DDT by the Americans and by the Germans in 1944, the delousing of not only clothing but also living quarters, especially barracks, and railroad trains in order to kill body lice was the only effective means of controlling the spread of typhus. Until the arrival of DDT, the most effective pesticide for killing body lice, i.e., for delousing, was Zyklon-B.

When Exterminationists claim, as Raul Hilberg did in The Destruction of the European Jews (1961 edition, pp. 565-67) that Zyklon-B was simply the commercial name for prussic acid (hydrocyanic acid is the chemical term generally used for prussic acid), or that it was hydrogen cyanide solidified in pellets which passed ""immediately"" into the gaseous state upon being dropped into a gas chamber, they merely show that they have no idea as to what their great murder weapon really was.

Zyklon-B was, and still is, essentially a porous material with liquid hydrocyanic acid absorbed into it with a small amount of chemical stabilizer and warning ingredient added.[7] The absorbent material was generally diatomaceous earth but paper discs were also used, especially in the United States. After the hydrocyanic acid had completely evaporated, the porous material – now completely harmless – could be returned to a Zyklon dealer and refilled.

The speed with which hydrocyanic acid evaporates out of the Zyklon granules or paper discs is not instantaneous. Although the hydrocyanic acid does immediately begin to leave the porous material as soon as a can of Zyklon-B is opened, that does not mean it leaves all at once. On the contrary, it still takes about half an hour for most of the cyanide to leave under normal conditions and under normal room temperature, about 68 F. Even more time is needed for all the cyanide to leave the granules.

According to Dr. Gerhard Peters, who was the managing director of DEGESCH and who from the early 1930's through World War II was probably the most prolific advocate of Zyklon-B:[8]

. . . As a general rule, the material is spread out in a layer which is 1/2 to 1 cm thick, after which most of the hydrocyanic acid has already evolved after half an hour.[9]

Although the process begins immediately, it is nonetheless a gradual process. It can be speeded up by dispersing the granules in thinner layers or by using smaller granules to begin with or – what is most important in order to understand how the standard delousing chambers worked – by forcing air through the granules and/or by the addition of heat.

The importance of heat not only to prevent condensation during the venting of a cyanide gas chamber but also during the gassing phase itself is evident from the very title of a German patent which was granted to DEGESCH in 1940. The title of patent no. 700469 which took effect retroactively on July 26, 1934 reads:

Method for generating the necessary heat for the vaporization of poisonous substances for gases used for pest control [emphasis added]

The text of the patent explains at some length the need for heating in order to accelerate the release of fumigating gases such as hydrocyanic acid. The patent includes a schematic drawing showing the same circulatory equipment arrangement which was probably used in all of the standard DEGESCH gas chambers.

The importance of heat to the venting process is spelled out in the following text from Peters and Wüstinger.

... As a consequence of the extensive preheating of the fresh air entering at D, the venting of the chamber is completed in 10 to 15 minutes. The carts can then be driven out and the articles of clothing can be immediately returned to their owners who in the meantime have had their bodies deloused.[10]",t1_d1mbx61,1,0,t3_4cie31,d1me8xm,t5_2qh4r,

Cap space, future draft picks, young players.  Their logjam of big men (Embid, Okafor, Noel, Saric) doesn't really matter because in the long run they'll be moving one, maybe two of them.  Their GM is kinda of the mindset that if you aren't competing for a championship, you might as well suck and get a higher draft pick.  But really that's just a simplistic take.  They're also just sitting on a shit ton of cap space.  Question is whether or not the increased cap room next year is kinda cutting into any benefit they've had of saving cap room.  Personally I think absolutely it will.

I've always had a thing for rebuilding teams across NFL and NBA.  It's one of the main reasons I really became a Bobcats fan back in the day.  I think their GM's ""Process"" is okay but I think they've bombed on draft picks.  The little bit I know about Saric (who is over in Europe) I just don't see anything.  To me he just seems like another average Euro player.  The fans are really putting all their hopes on the oft-injured Embid, and I'm not seeing it there either.  They're hoping he can be a two way player but honestly it just looks like they've drafted two rim protectors (Embid &amp; Noel) and a solid offensive forward in Okafor.  They'd be deadly in they could go back in time and make all the right picks.

One problem with their logjam of big men is the idea that other teams KNOW they have to move probably two of them, so they can bid low.  And I think that's somewhat true but assuming more than one team is interested shouldn't matter.  

Overall I think the idea was okay but the execution has failed.  I got to see Okafor in high school and I'm a big fan.  I think he'll be a very good PF in the league and I hate the crap street fight that happened to him.  But really the Process would've been best if they could mold all these guys into one PF with all their talents.  I think the Timberwolves have done in two years what the 76ers won't do in the five their GM promised.  If the 6ers were looking at KAT and Wiggins on their roster right now, they'd be saying that the Process worked.  Unfortunately they have a couple injured rim defenders, a developing big man in Europe, and an offensive forward with no defense.  It just doesn't look good.

Sorry for the length, I think it's pretty fascinating.  Pretty impressed if they just sit and let their GM do this for 5 years as was the original plan.  Kinda depends on what kind of moves they can make.  Jimmy Butler on the trade block would be huge for them.  I'd rather be an exciting mid-round playoff team like the Hornets than be in their position though to be honest.  No hatred towards them intended if any 76ers fans are lurking.

The formula G has a quantified variable y. The Gödel number #G does not; it *represents* G in a strong way that manipulations of G can be translated into arithmetic operations on #G, but #G itself is just a natural number (like 213 or 163648582) and has no ""quantified variables"". It is a category error to think of it as having one. Similarly, your predicate q is actually an arithmetic predicate, a predicate dealing with numbers; it takes any number whatsoever as input and it's only on the meta level, when you put the number of a formula into it, do you get the meaning that you described.

Edit: To further address your confusion, you don't ""unpack"" the Gödel number of a formula to get the formula itself any more than you unpack the word ""Europe"" to get the actual continent of Europe. There's simply no ""packing"" or ""unpacking"" whatsoever. #G is a number, and you substitute it into the formula G as you would any number. For instance, 123 is a number, so you can substitute it into G and get a closed formula that will have a truth value. It doesn't matter if 123 is actually the Gödel number of any formula; G itself doesn't even ""know"" anything about formulas! Thus there is no problem with overriding quantified variables with G(#G) at all; it is only when the truth value of this formula is interpreted at the meta-level do we get the desired meaning from it.",t1_d1m2d0q,3,0,t3_4cw9b9,d1mggp9,t5_2qh0n,

Of the four continents that didn't take over the world (Asia, Africa, Australia, America), they got screwed over by:

Africa: I'm not sure on this one. Africa had large amounts of area, access to domesticated megafauna, and trade. I want to blame geography on this one though: large amounts of Africa are desert (the Sahara), which also blocks a lot of trade and farming; limiting the size of tribes, and preventing them from becoming a civilization.

America: Megafauna. No big animals that they could domesticate and make use of.

Asia: Bad luck. In the 1300s, China was poised to take over the world, and sent sailors around the world. Then a change in power resulted in a technological dark age and period of xenophobia; similar to what happened in the 900's in Europe. Unfortunately for Asia, this happened right before world control was possibly, giving Europe the world.

Australia: Geography. It's basically one big desert. Modern farming practices have helped, a little; but California (400 thousand km^2 ) produces about 1/3 as much food as Australia (7 million km^2 ).",t1_d1mfk8a,2,0,t3_4crmua,d1mgk85,t5_2sokd,

Each turn starts with a hand of cards being dealth out to both players. The cards have a set number of operation points that are used to exert influence over countries across the globe. The cards also have events on them that are specific to each player, or neutral events. All of the events have historical meaning and reference real events. The cards can be played for their point or there event, but if you play a card for points and it has your opponents event on it, it is triggered. This makes the cards the real game, with the board being the score keeping mechanic.

The great thing about this game is the more you play the better it gets. You start to feel a flow. The rules are easy to learn, but the strategy is hard to master. It is a longer game, the first time you play it will take 4-5 hours so settle in with someone who is willing to make a day of it. 

The best thing about this game is how much it feels like you are playing out the cold war. The operation points are used to either spread influence, or you can try to coup a gov't to quickly oust the opponent from a battleground country. The coups can trigger the DEFCON to decline, and if it gets to 1 that triggers nuclear war. If a player initiates nuclear war they lose straight up.

These events on cards trigger actions on the board that can help or devastate you. For example the Fidel Castro card automatically cedes control of Cuba to USSR. Where as the card Marshall Plan allows the US to exert influence all over Europe. A neutral card would be something like the Olympics.

To me at this point it almost feels like chess. I get my hand of cards on turn 3, look them over and by this point I know the deck so well that I know my opponent has certain cards just because they aren't in my hand.

###Updated: 2/16!

*.*

###Adds the Rogue class to the game. Inspired by the Scout from Long War and a new Ghost archetype, previously unseen in XCom. The Rogue focuses on improved concealment and flanking possibilities.
*****
Equipped with an SMG and a pistol, the Rogue uses high mobility to create flanking opportunities. With the Ghost tree, use concealment and damage bonuses to assassinate targets before returning to the shadows. With the Lone Wolf tree, create flanking opportunities that provide defense bonuses and extra survivability while on your own. Designed to take advantage of LWS' SMG PACK mod.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#[Custom Abilities](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618036260)

##[Skill Tree]( http://imgur.com/l6FaPBa)

* **[Blindside]** - Pierce armor and do improved damage while flanking the enemy.
* **[Shadowborn]** - Greatly reduced detection radius while concealed. Also, minor increase in crit and accuracy while in stealth. 
* **[Keep Your Head Down]** - Bring back Low Profile from Xcom EU/EW. Half Cover is treated as High Cover, except all cover now lends less overall defense.

* ~~**[Ambush]** - Set up an ambush over a small area, striking the first unsuspecting enemy to cross over. Greatly improved crit chance and accuracy. EDIT: REMOVED from game temporariliy. MAY consider putting it back in if re-vamped 
* **[Recon]** - Scout the area, marking all targets in a large cone while remaining hidden. Can be used in stealth to contribute to the team while retaining concealment options. Adds +10% aim and 10% crit in an AOE for two turns. 
* **[Concussive Shot]** - Fire a concussive blast from your pistol, giving a chance to disorient your foe, stun your foe for 1 turn, or stun your foe for 1 full turn and leave them dizzy upon waking up, depending on multiple dice rolls, your rank, and the target's will. 
* **[Riposte]** - Feign weakness, as you taunt your enemies into an easily parried attack. Parry the first attack against you with your pistol, deflecting and stunning the attacker if your shot lands.
* **[Cheap Shot]** - Strike at your enemy from the shadows. If the enemy is killed, retain concealment.
* **[Blaze of Glory]** - Strike at every enemy in range as you go down in a Blaze of Glory. But are you really dead?
* **[Infiltrator]** - GTS ability that allows the rogue to match the hacking skills of the specialist (melee only). Also gives the Rogue a free move action point after killing a unit or hacking.
* **[Self-Sufficient]** - The Rogue is less susceptible to mind attacks and can freely patch up any minor wounds and conditions if he hasn't used an ability each turn. 
* **[Lightning Reflexes]** - Lightning Reflexes returns from Xcom EU/EW. Allows for more teamwork compared to Shadowstep. 
* **[Natural Born Killer]** - The Rogue now has two toggle-able stances. One that deals more damage the lower the target is, and one that deals more damage the healthier the target is. A 5-turn cooldown makes sure the Rogue plans ahead as to what stance will be needed. 
* **[Taste of Death]** - The Rogue gains collects souls each time he scores a kill or an assist. Each soul counts as a single stack (1/2 for assists). At 0, 2, 4, and 6 stacks the Rogue deals 1,2,3 and 4 bonus damage. At any time, the Rogue can consume all the souls he is carrying to heal for 15% hp per stack, resetting the damage bonuses.

#Note from the Author

The purpose of the Rogue Class Mod is to bring alternate playstyles to how the game is approached. The Rogue relies more on flanking the enemy for shorter range shots; therefore, relying less on RNG and more on combat strategy. This leads to very high risk, but highly **calculated** gameplay. Balance will always be my number one priority for this mod. If your experience is either underwhelming or overwhelming in any way, please leave feedback, as I will constantly be making adjustments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Patch Notes 4/1



*  Added 3 new skills: Self Sufficient, Natural Born Killer, and Taste of Death

*  Riposte is now an activate-able ability which will taunt an enemy into attacking the Rogue. The Rogue will parry the first attack and has improved chance to hit.

&gt;Nativism is the political position of preserving status for certain established inhabitants of a nation as compared to claims of newcomers or immigrants.

The phenomenon has been studied especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, as well as Europe in recent years, where immigration is seen as lowering the wages of the less well paid natives. Thus nativism has become a general term for 'opposition to immigration' based on fears that the immigrants will distort or spoil existing cultural values.",t1_d1mdbk5,7,0,t3_4cxs5o,d1mhqmm,t5_2tk0i,

For this little observation I'm doing, I will refer to Omni Evolution as DE (Dream Evolution) instead of OE.  
This will begin with some pros then follow up with cons and explanations to points of some cons  
*****  
Pros/Understanding:  
Method one generally (from what I understand) states that you can trade in duplicates for a certain amount of currency to buy one unit from a selection.  
**tl;dr** Get dupes, get another money, get new unit from a shop.  

&amp;nbsp;

  
Method two suggests an exclusion of ""non-meta"" units from the gacha. 
*****
Cons (I thought of at least)  
Method one:  
 * Is easily broken if players can evolve (some not all) fodder units to 5*s (what would the value of these be?).  
 * Units in the trade shop would have be a represented value decided by who? The company? The players?  

&amp;nbsp;

Method two:  
 * While having only 7* possible be in the pool is pretty neat, it skews the pacing the game has.  
 * Does not address what would happen if previous non-fodder receive 7* evo/DE  
 * This can standalone without the first method.  
*****  
Method One Cons Explanation:  
The shop to grab units ""unattainable"" to some is a good idea, but crops up some issues.  
 * For one, based on the number of unique units in-game, the list is extensive and may in fact crash some player's game if done incorrectly.  
 * Players would soon value ""meta"" units over others.  
 * How would the value of each unit be decided? Their Kit, Status, Player survey or Company decision? (both buying and selling)  
 * This system can be out-ruled by the farming idea of method two.  
 * Some fodder units can reach 5* or even 6* level (let's say... Mifune) what will that be worth? less than RS units or equivalent? Who decides this?  

&amp;nbsp;

Method Two Cons Explanation:  
I will not be using bullet points as a deeper talk is best to understand the psychology. I understand you have some sense based on EC's F2P psychology.  
A player has only so much cost to support ""meta"" units in a squad. This is especially true of pseudo-new and new players under Level 110.  
One of the real goals of a F2P game is its survivability. Yes getting money is part to support it and get new content out. However, none of that matters when players **breeze** through content and think , ""Easy. There is no challenge. I just have to get this guy, get this machine, get this chick and I win,""  
While most of us appreciate the aspects of this game, newcomers browsing the market generally do not. The most prominent feature would be Auto-Battle where the players do not actively interact with the interface and lose the value of attentive details.  
Next point of Legacy 7*/DEs, since these are added post-fact of the system, in theory, they are also included in the pool or are they still free fodder like how EU once farmed for Priscilla in a dungeon?",t3_4cyirh,2,0,t3_4cyirh,d1mi05y,t5_2zich,tppub coatedCap

It really just depends on how you want your trip to go. If you want to cook your meals, and eat out only sometimes, or you want to stay in hostels/couchsurf, you'll probably be spending less.

EUROPE

Dublin and Limerick grow to megacity status, further complicating my attempts to make that part of the map readable. Warsaw joins them; that Swedish European core is stacked. To the south they citadel-bomb Ravenna.

AFRICA

DIRE DAWA IS FINALLY ANNEXED. Hallelujah. In other news, Kumbi Saleh expands (which might be the first time I've had to change something in Mali for, like, ever.

ASIA/OCEANIA

Vietnam starts to recover as Mongolia found a new city, Darhan. As has been pointed out by others, Suntar is literally nuked off the map. Nhang Hong is (somewhat frustratingly) annexed. Further south, Australia annex Bidyadanga and found a new (mystery) city in New Caledonia (near Parihaka).

Besides, humans have a great capacity for learning new languages -- changing your dialect/accent is even easier.

Anyways, linguistics is more concerned with describing languages than saying what is better or worse. If you look at  AAE (in terms of vocab and syntax) without comparing it to English, you see very quickly that it's just like any other language: it has a rich vocabulary and consistent phonology and grammar. In that regard it's a lot like Yiddish, the bastard language created by Jews living in ghettos across eastern Europe. To a proper German citizen of the 1800's, Yiddish probably sounded like what AAE does to you: it had a vocabulary containing all sorts of weird words from other languages, and the parts that were taken from German were pronounced weird. Now obviously saying ""Yiddish is a legitimate language"" didn't change much for those Jews, but what it *does* do is validate the culture of the people who speak it.

It is, though, for the most part, a place of casual commenting, one-liners, cheap jokes, and generalizations.  This would explain much of the negative comments about nearly any topic, including China and its tourists.  

There is a portion of Reddit that is racist, as is true in American society as a whole.  Some of the racists are aggressive/violent, as in real life, and most are casually racist or unaware of their racist, as in real life.  

China, while not a ""true"" enemy in the way that the Soviet Union was in the Cold War, is, at the least, seen as a potential or rising rival, economically and militarily.  This lends itself to shallow nationalism and seeing the Chinese as the ""other.""  Though people aren't as hostile as they would be toward a true enemy (such as the Axis Powers), people will show a dislike toward a potential rival (such as 1980s Japan).  

China does have a problem with tourists.  This can't be denied.  You don't have to ask Americans what they think--one can simply ask people in Hong Kong what they think of those from mainland China.  But this is also true of a lot of tourists--the Chinese aren't the only ones with a bad reputation.  The idea of the ""ugly American"" comes directly from other people's experiences with American tourists post-WWII.  The British have a terrible reputation for their weekend bashes in Europe.  I know many in the Philippines have very strong views on the Koreans who visit and do business there.  

TL;DR:  Reddit can be racist, but is mostly lazy and uncreative with many of its jokes and observations.  Also, China isn't a random country--it is one rapidly rising and rivaling the West.  Finally, the stuff said about Chinese tourists is not necessarily untrue.  ",t3_4cwamz,1,1,t3_4cwamz,d1mkijq,t5_2rfyw,

I didn’t bother facing Peter. Instead I watched the whiskey swirl around in my pewter cup. “What does she want?”

“I believe, payment. Sir.”

I sighed, though not as if I hadn’t expected it. It had been almost a month since I’d paid off a debt. Six months since fostering any new ones.

“I suppose you should send her in,” I said. I waited for Peter’s fading footsteps before I rose from the gold-plated chair by the window. Down below, the duchess’s personal guard were circling the walls. She must suspect I’ve been dishonest.

It can be funny, comparing your current life to that of the past. I’ve done things I would have deemed immoral, maybe even downright evil, from my cozy office chair five years ago. Now look at me. I’ve got half of Europe on my payroll; the other half is out bartering and fighting over my notes.

At least I started out as an honest man. Well, as honest as I could. It’s not my fault I had a thousand years on these guys. I gave them electricity and modern hygiene, I think I’ve paid my dues as a self-proclaimed time-traveling wizard. I’d say the title of god-king is earned. God forbid they ever found out how I really got here. Leaping out of a fifty-story window while trying to write my suicide note is cringe-worthy, no matter the century.

I slid open the desk drawer, pulling out the tattered notebook. The pen had long ago ran out of ink. To think I had worried about that. I hid it from my followers easy enough. Writing with quill took a little getting used to, but they couldn’t tell the difference.

I ran my finger down the empty spiral. It wasn’t until the paper ran out that I was truly in trouble. Even the peasants could see that the new notes didn’t have the lines of destiny. I assured them they were worth face value just the same, but the euphoria had worn off. By that time, resources had started to dry up. War and famine are expensive! My fake money doesn’t grow on trees.

Footsteps were becoming audible again. I grabbed the spiral and strolled back to my chair. I could see more horses on the horizon.

“The castle is under my control now,” said the Duchess from the doorway. “Now tell me where you stockpile of gold is. Or will I need my men to beat it out of you?”

I smiled. With one hand I pushed open the window. With the other, I tossed the duchess the empty notebook. “That’s the last of it.”

Anyway, when controlling for all metrics, the Netherlands ranks as the #9 in overachieving. This would makes sense based on their relatively small size and high achievement short of world cup wins. Others that you mentioned: Spain @ 15, England @ 23, France @ 24, Italy @ 30 (with negative correlation instead of positive, I suppose indicating they are not performing beyond their expected rate). Overachievement was defined at the actual minus the expected goal difference when accounting for games played. England @ 0.051 is pretty close to right where it's expected. The Dutch boasted 0.486. This was based on 49 countries in Europe ranked relative to each other. 

In a world ranking, only Spain broke the top 10 at #8. According to the book, Spain is much smaller and poorer than neighbors like Germany and France (google varifiable), and should not be held to the same expectations, thus it is overachieving with its recent success.  France and Germany are traditionally the land powers in Europe (read: large populations w/ money), and given their wealth it makes sense that they would be successful. 

Italy is the one that kind of bends my mind: not a particularly big nation relative to the others (60 million), a low GPD comparatively (only Spain is lower), only England is listed as having played more games (2 more), yet they have 4 world cups, a Euro, and a handful of podium finishes in each. France, a bigger and richer country with comparable experience, can only claim 1 world cup and 2 Euros, and has big chunks of time where they did not qualify for tournaments. Looking at the German record isn't even fair in comparison: 4 world cups, 3 Euros and 13 podium finishes between the two tournies. Yet somehow, Germany and Italy are considered underperforming based on the analysis. Not perfect I guess just like most models. 

As expected, the US ranks as #4 on the world list of under performers. The book rationalizes this by saying that the US just doesn't care to allocate it's resources to the game. Other world under achievers include Canada (#1), Malaysia, India. ",t1_d1mcmxx,1,0,t3_4cv2a3,d1mmzhx,t5_2qi58,93

False,0,1459573930,,1463164729,food,FuujinSama,,False,5,"As a Portuguese speaker, I feel like I have an ""unfair"" advantage when it comes to speaking languages. It's pretty much a non-existing accent. Yes, if you make zero effort you notice it, but anyone that learned English before his 20's won't have the tiniest accent or will easily remove it. Otherwise it sounds a lot like a Russian accent.  
Eitherway, English is pretty much the hardest thing for a Portuguese person to pronounce. The 'r' sound, like in ''car'' or ''Caroline'' is really really hard for Adult Portuguese people to get used to.  The Portuguese soft 'r' is pretty much the same as the Japanese one. And our hard 'R', like you'd expect in a word like 'Ralph' or 'Radical' is way more similar to the 'R' in 'VRRRROOM', not the throaty french 'R', but the tong actually touched the palate and trembles. It actually ends up sounding like a mild Russian accent.  
Japanese is a non-problem. If you read the romanji like you'd read portuguese you'll be correct 99% of the time. 

All in all, an European Portuguese accent seems way easier to shake off on most languages than an English, Spanish, French or even a Brazilian Portuguese one.  

I might have gone completely off topic, but I just felt the need to ramble for a bit. I have no idea if Korean would be harder to pronounce for a Portuguese person than English, but I doubt it. In general Portuguese people have trouble with the softer sounds. Weird vowels and hard consonants are rather easy, and from the korean shows and music I've listened to, those don't seem too common in Korean. Though I'm not sure if Japanese is that easy for English speakers. Those 'Arigatou's' with really hard american accents you hear in movies sound pretty damn weird.

The Nazis claimed that high-degree Masons were willing members of the Jewish conspiracy and that Freemasonry was one of the causes of Germany's defeat in World War I. In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler wrote that Freemasonry has succumbed to the Jews and has become an excellent instrument to fight for their aims and to use their strings to pull the upper strata of society into their designs. He continued, ""The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self-preservation begun by Freemasonry"" is then transmitted to the masses of society by the press.[7] In 1933 Hermann Göring, the Reichstag President and one of the key figures in the process of Gleichschaltung (""synchronization""), stated ""in National Socialist Germany, there is no place for Freemasonry"".[8]
Loge „Libanon zu den 3 Zedern“ in Erlangen, Germany. First meeting after World War II with guests from USA, France and Czechoslovakia, May 1948.

The Enabling Act (Ermächtigungsgesetz in German) was passed by Germany's parliament (the Reichstag) on March 23, 1933. Using the Act, on January 8, 1934, the German Ministry of the Interior ordered the disbandment of Freemasonry, and confiscation of the property of all Lodges; stating that those who had been members of Lodges when Hitler came to power, in January 1933, were prohibited from holding office in the Nazi party or its paramilitary arms, and were ineligible for appointment in public service.[9] Consistently considered an ideological foe of Nazism in their world perception (Weltauffassung), special sections of the Security Service (SD) and later the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) were established to deal with Freemasonry.[10] Freemasonic concentration camp inmates were graded as political prisoners, and wore an inverted (point down) red triangle.[11]

On August 8, 1935, as Führer and Chancellor, Adolf Hitler announced in the Nazi Party newspaper, Voelkischer Beobachter, the final dissolution of all Masonic Lodges in Germany. The article accused a conspiracy of the Fraternity and World Jewry of seeking to create a World Republic.[12] In 1937 Joseph Goebbels inaugurated an ""Anti-Masonic Exposition"" to display objects seized by the state.[8] The Ministry of Defence forbade officers from becoming Freemasons, with officers who remained as Masons being sidelined.[3]

During the war, Freemasonry was banned by edict in all countries that were either allied with the Nazis or under Nazi control, including Norway and France. Anti-Masonic exhibitions were held in many occupied countries. Field-Marshal Friedrich Paulus was denounced as a ""High-grade Freemason"" when he surrendered to the Soviet Union in 1943.[13]

The preserved records of the RSHA—i.e., Reichssicherheitshauptamt or the Office of the High Command of Security Service, which pursued the racial objectives of the SS through the Race and Resettlement Office—document the persecution of Freemasons.[10] The number of Freemasons from Nazi occupied countries who were killed is not accurately known, but it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime.[14]
Italy

Benito Mussolini decreed in 1924 that every member of his Fascist Party who was a Mason must abandon either one or the other organization, and in 1925, he dissolved Freemasonry in Italy, claiming that it was a political organisation. One of the most prominent Fascists, General Cappello, who had also been Deputy Grand Master of the Grande Oriente, Italy's leading Grand Lodge, gave up his membership in the Fascist Party rather than in Masonry. He was later arrested on false charges and sentenced to 30 years in jail.[15]
Hungary

In 1919, Béla Kun[16] proclaimed the dictatorship of the proletariat in Hungary and Masonic properties were taken into public ownership. After the fall of the dictatorship of the proletariat the leaders of counter-revolution as Miklós Horthy blamed the Hungarian freemasons for their First World War defeat and for the revolution. Masonry was outlawed by a decree in 1920. This marked the start of raids by army officers on Masonic lodges[17] along with theft, and sometimes destruction, of Masonic libraries, records, archives, paraphernalia, and works of art. Several Masonic buildings were seized and used for anti-Masonic exhibitions. Fortunately, the masonic documents were archived, preserved and may still used for research.

In post war Hungary, lodges were re-established, but after five years[17] the government described them as ""meeting places of the enemies of the people's democratic republic, of capitalistic elements, and of the adherents of Western imperialism"". They were banned again in 1950.[3]
Spain
Francisco Franco

It is claimed that the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera ordered the abolition of Freemasonry in Spain.[18] In September 1928, one of the two Grand Lodges in Spain was closed and approximately two-hundred (200) masons, most notably the Grand Master of the Grand Orient, were imprisoned for allegedly plotting against the government.[19]

Following the military coup of 1936, many Freemasons trapped in areas under Nationalist control were arrested and summarily killed in the White Terror (Spain), along with members of left wing parties and trade unionists. It was reported that Masons were tortured, garroted, shot, and murdered by organized death squads in every town in Spain. At this time one of the most rabid opponents of Freemasonry, Father Juan Tusquets Terrats, began to work for the Nationalists with the task of exposing masons. One of his close associates was Franco’s personal chaplain, and over the next two years, these two men assembled a huge index of 80,000 suspected masons, even though there were little more than 5,000 masons in Spain. The results were horrific. Among other countless crimes, the lodge building in Cordoba was burnt, the masonic temple in Santa Cruz, Tenerife, was confiscated and transformed into the headquarters of the Falange, and another was shelled by artillery. In Salamanca thirty (30) members of one lodge were shot, including a priest. Similar atrocities occurred across the country: fifteen (15) masons were shot in Logrono, seventeen (17) in Ceuta, thirty-three (33) in Algeciras, and thirty (30) in Valladolid, among them the Civil Governor. Few towns escaped the carnage as Freemasons in Lugo, Zamora, Cadiz and Granada were brutally rounded up and shot, and in Seville, the entire membership of several lodges were butchered. The slightest suspicion of being a mason was often enough to earn a place in a firing squad, and the blood-letting was so fierce that, reportedly, some masons were even hurled into working engines of steam trains. By 16 December 1937, according to the annual masonic assembly held in Madrid, all masons that had not escaped from the areas under nationalist control had been murdered.[19]

After the victory of dictator General Francisco Franco, Freemasonry was officially outlawed in Spain on 2 March 1940. Being a mason was automatically punishable by a minimum jail term of 12 years.[20] Masons of the 18º and above were deemed guilty of ‘Aggravated Circumstances’, and usually faced the death penalty.[21]

According to Francoists, the Republican Regime which Franco overthrew had a strong Masonic presence.[citation needed] In reality Spanish Masons were present in all sectors of politics and the armed forces.[22] At least four (4) of the Generals who supported Franco's rebellion were Masons, although many lodges contained fervent but generally conservative Republicans. Freemasonry was formally outlawed in the Law for the Repression of Freemasonry and Communism.[23] After Franco's decree outlawing masonry, Franco's supporters were given two months to resign from any lodge they might be a member. Many masons chose to go into exile instead, including prominent monarchists who had whole-heartedly supported the Nationalist rebellion in 1936. The common components in Spanish Masonry seems to have been upper or middle class conservative liberalism and strong anti-clericism.[24]

&gt; The phonology is drab

English has one of the most complex vowel phoneme inventories of any language I've ever come across; most languages have simply /a, e, i, o, u/ and lack other vowels like /æ, ɪ, ɛ, ʌ, ɔ, ʊ, ə/ or any of the diphthongs. Also, different dialects of English include different phonemes and allophones with little predictability (particularly with regards to /x, θ, ð/). Oh, and may I point out how rare those dental fricatives are? 

&gt; no grammatical gender

Only about a quarter of the world's languages have grammatical gender. And a few adjectives in English do actually decline for gender, mostly adjectives and nouns borrowed from or inspired by French (e.g. *blond[e]*, *actor/actress*).

&gt; unatural[sic] borrowing of Latinate and Greek borrowings

Most languages of Europe (as well as a lot of non-European languages) have borrowed tons of words from Latin and Greek. Both languages were lingua francas of Europe for centuries, after all. It's totally natural for that to happen and I'd actually find it super bizarre for a language to resist adoption of Greek or Latin vocabulary under such conditions.

&gt;This view has been contradicted by several academics, such as Peter Winn, who writes that the role of the CIA was crucial to the consolidation of power after the coup; the CIA helped fabricate a conspiracy against the Allende government, which Pinochet was then portrayed as preventing. He stated that the coup itself was possible only through a three-year covert operation mounted by the United States. He also points out that the US imposed an ""invisible blockade"" that was designed to disrupt the economy under Allende, and contributed to the destabilization of the regime.[6] Author Peter Kornbluh argues in his book The Pinochet File[30] that the US was extensively involved and actively ""fomented""[30] the 1973 coup. Authors Tim Weiner, in his book, Legacy of Ashes,[31] and Christopher Hitchens, in his book, The Trial of Henry Kissinger [32] similarly argue the case that US covert actions actively destabilized Allende’s government and set the stage for the 1973 coup.

&gt;The U.S. provided material support to the military government after the coup, although criticizing it in public. A document released by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 2000, titled ""CIA Activities in Chile"", revealed that the CIA actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of Allende, and that it made many of Pinochet's officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military, even though some were known to be involved in human rights abuses.[33] The CIA also maintained contacts in the Chilean DINA intelligence service. DINA led the multinational campaign known as Operation Condor, which amongst other activities carried out assassinations of prominent politicians in various Latin American countries, in Washington, D.C., and in Europe, and kidnapped, tortured and executed activists holding left-wing views, which culminated in the deaths of roughly 60,000 people.[34][35] The United States provided key organizational, financial and technical assistance to the operation.[36][37][38] CIA contact with DINA head Manuel Contreras was established in 1974 soon after the coup, during the Junta period prior to official transfer of Presidential powers to Pinochet; in 1975, the CIA reviewed a warning that keeping Contreras as an asset might threaten human rights in the region. The CIA chose to keep him as an asset, and at one point even paid him. In addition to the CIA's maintaining of assets in DINA beginning soon after the coup, several CIA assets, such as CORU Cuban exile militants Orlando Bosch and Guillermo Novo, collaborated in DINA operations under the Condor Plan in the early years of Pinochet's presidency.",t1_d1msaqv,4,0,t3_4cy6l6,d1msf0o,t5_2qh13,

The [original article](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-03-24/french-connection) only examines macro-level factors - that is, the structural level. From the original article:


&gt; It turns out that the best predictor of foreign fighter radicalization was not a country’s wealth. Nor was it how well-educated its citizens were, how healthy they were, or even how much Internet access they enjoyed. Instead, the top predictor was whether a country was Francophone[.]


First off what is 'radicalization' ? Which data points are considered radicals and which ones are not considered radicals ? Why these data bases and not others ? Secondly, what about micro-level (individual) and meso-level (organizational) factors ? One reason why salafi-jihadism is spreading and growing in France and Belgium is because the salafi-quietist and tabligh movements have been present since the 1970s-1980s. They laid the foundation for the salafi-jihadi movement. The salafi-jihadi movement is a violent sub-movement of the pan-Islamic movement (or Islamism), while salafi-quietism an tabligh are non-violent sub-movements.


Thus these meso-level factors, and many others need to be taken into considerations. The same can be said for micro-level factors. Further, at the macro-level, the discussion of immigration strategies (integration versus assimilation) is missing, for example.


While the French government's (and maybe Belgian, but this is not my area of focus) lack of actions toward the salafi-quietism and tabligh movements are a factor in the current make-up of salafi-jihadi networks, this is not the sole factor. Has French society failed parts of its youth in the *banlieues* ? Yes. BUT, they have also failed themselves by not trying as hard as they could. That is, some are not fighting for their well-being and taking a easier route - blame others and do nothing. The door swing both ways.


&gt; We suspect that when there are large numbers of unemployed youth, some of them are bound to get up to mischief. When they live in large cities, they have more opportunities to connect with people espousing radical causes. And when those cities are in Francophone countries that adopt the strident French approach to secularism, Sunni radicalism is more appealing.


Sure, that is true. But this does not explain violence. It makes sense of 'radicalization' (whatever that means). It is a well known fact (at least in academia) that most radicals do not undertake violence and violent actors are not the most radical individuals (in terms of ideology). McCants and Meserole seem to be confusing salafi-quietism/tabligh with salafi-jihadism. It is rare for a salafi-quietist to turn to violence (see el-Difraoui). What matters is the common ground they have. Many individuals on a path to salafi-quiestism/tabligh will turn to salafi-jihadism, but rarely an established salafi/quietist/tabligh (this is not to imply that salafi-quiestism and tabligh are 'blame-less' in all this). In any case, *la francophonie* does not explain this.


McCants and Meserole conclude:


&gt; [Initial findings] may be way off, but at least they are based on the best available data. If the data is wrong or our interpretations skewed, we hope the effort will lead to more rigorous explanations of what is driving jihadist terrorism in Europe. Our initial findings should in no way imply that Francophone countries are responsible for the recent horrible attacks—no country deserves to have its civilians killed, regardless of the perpetrator’s motives. But the magnitude of the violence and the fear it engenders demand that we investigate those motives beyond just the standard boilerplate explanations.


Their conclusion thus points to examining more tri-level factors (macro, meso, and micro) than simply one level of factors - an approach their study did not undertake - at least it seems as their methodology is missing. In fact, as u/Ryggart in the [r/France thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/4c94m7/english_the_french_connection_la%C3%AFcit%C3%A9_youth/), each factor is not tested separately. 


In sum this article's conclusion is weak - this is even without going into the discussion of quantitative studies in the social sciences (not that I am against them, but generally, such studies fit the subject to the model rather than the other way around, and they make sweeping generalizations without qualitative second-thoughts).",t3_4czo9e,1,0,t3_4czo9e,d1msg8t,t5_3b5ej,approved

GOERING: In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I should like once more to explain the idea briefly, as I understand it. In German parliamentary procedure in the past responsibility rested with the highest officials, who were responsible for carrying out the anonymous wishes of the majorities, and it was they who exercised the authority. In the Leadership Principle we sought to reverse the direction, that is,.the authority existed at the top and passed downwards, while the responsibility began at the bottom and passed upwards.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: In other words, you did not believe in nd did not permit government, as we call it, by consent of the governed, in which the people, through their representatives, were the source of power and authority?

GOERING: That is not entirely correct. We repeatedly called on the people to express unequivocally and clearly what they thought of our system, only it was in a different way from that previously adopted and from the system in practice in other countries. We chose the way of a so-called plebiscite. We also took the point of view that even a government founded on the Leadership Principle could maintain itself only if it was based in some way on the confidence of the people. If it no longer had such confidence, then t would have to rule with bayonets, and the Fuehrer was always of the opinion that that was impossible in the long run-to rule against the will of the people.]

....


GOERING: I beg your pardon, I did not quite understand the question, but I could perhaps answer it as follows:

I consider the Leadership Principle necessary because the system which previously existed, and which we called parliamentary or democratic, had brought Germany to the verge of ruin. I might perhaps in this connection remind you that your own President Roosevelt, as far as I can recall-I do not want to quote it word for word-declared, ""Certain peoples in Europe have forsaken democracy, not because they did not wish for democracy as such, but because democracy had brought forth men who were too weak to give their people work and bread, and to satisfy them. For this reason the peoples have abandoned this system and the men belonging to it."" There is much truth in that statement. This system had brought ruin by mismanagement and according to my own opinion, only an organization made up of a strong, clearly defined leadership hierarchy could restore order again. But, let it be understood, not against the will of the people, but only when the people, having in the course of time, and by means of a series of elections, grown stronger and stronger, had expressed their wish to entrust their destiny to the National Socialist leadership.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: The principles of the authoritarian government which you set up required, as I understand you, that there be tolerated no opposition by political parties which might defeat or obstruct the policy of the Nazi Party?

GOERING: You have understood this quite correctly. By that time we had lived long enough with opposition and we had had enough of it. Through opposition we had been completely ruined. It was now time to have done with it and to start building up.

You have it all wrong. Society has been progressing to a post-man eschaton since the beginning of the enlightenment. It is inevitable that the Hegelian dialectic will, by combining thesis and antithesis inevitably result in a merger of masculine and feminine traits resulting in a culmination of the anti-civilizational drives of the unconscious body of humanity (aka women) in the form of the ultimate emasculated man, the *last man* as predicted by the soothsayer Nietzsche himself. This archetypal form is especially obvious throughout the 20th century in the form of women entering the workforce, women attempting to become the intellectual equals of many and of course, rampart cuckoldry.

While there was a chance for man to redeem himself, the peace movements of the 60's, along with the general impotence of Europe after the Second World War removed the most effective ways for boys to become men. While the greater mass of men are now reeling from this loss, a brave group of trailblazers have gone about reconstructing the primal field in which man once proved himself by getting really good at video games and by calling feminists fat over the internet.",t1_d1lv549,1,0,t3_4cw67r,d1msw29,t5_38jid,

You'd think so but this is not the case. And it is really difficult because our intuitions tell us to go with what is known over unknown, but this is a cognitive bias that we are hard wired with. There are many related phenomena that all share the same underlying heuristic of a bias towards information:

* Anchoring; where we stick with the information we heard first over better more reliable information later. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring
* Information Bias; the tendency to seek out information even when it will have no bearing upon our decision. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bias_(psychology)
* Sunk Cost Fallacy; the tendency to stick with something that we have already invested into over switching to something else better. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_escalation
* Familiarity heuristic; the tendency to rate something as better based upon how familiar you are with it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiarity_heuristic

A lot of people talk about uncertainty as if certainty exists. Big financial powerhouses don't make money out of certainty - after all if everyone knows that the price of something is going to increase they are not going to sell, so you cannot make money out of buying low and selling high.

Furthermore businesses that try to stick with only the familiar option tend to not last very long. Adaptability to uncertainty is a key requirement of all large businesses, especially those that deal with liabilities. Coping with uncertainty is a daily exercise.

So all the comments regarding uncertainty are an exercise in fear of the unknown. If you are uncertain then you don't know, so you cannot say that it will be worse, just that you don't know if it will be better or worse. Now I do think that the leave campaign are doing a terrible job explaining this, and I think it is right that they are challenged to come up with a plan. Although I agree that things are not going to be as bad as many of the post-Brexit scenarios make out it might be, I do think that the comments from the leave group come across as weak and dismissive rather than reassuring. As a campaign tactic it is just terrrible.

For your other points, rather than argue I just want to present my initial reactions. I'm interested to see what your take on my reactions are.

&gt; What we get is membership of the single market

We don't need to be in the single market to get a trade deal, and there are quite a few nations with an FTA. Why is the membership fee worth the difference between access to the single market and access to the market via an FTA?

&gt; and the ability to direct policy within the EU.

All negotiations are an attempt to negotiate policy in the other nation. If we were to open a trade deal with Brazil then we would get to influence them and they would get to influence us. I don't see how this is any different than being in a union with Brazil where we both influence each other. The downside is that when being in a union you have to make sure that all parties are happy before you can progress which makes deals slower and more dilute. Why is being in a political union any better than just being a partner?

&gt; I know the counterpoint is to scream 'FTA!', but after having looked at how these things work, it's clear that such a deal is not going to offer the same benefits as EEA membership.

Whilst I agree that the more distant the less benefit I feel that this is looking at just one side of the coin. To make up random numbers here let's say that being in the EEA was worth 10 wotzits and being in an FTA was worth 6 wotzits. However being in an FTA opens up access to other global markets and this is worth 8 wotzits. If you only look at the relationship with the EU you see a loss from 10 to 6, but if you look at the whole picture you see a gain from 10 to 14. Why is being in a union that prevents us from making our own deals with other nations seen as a good thing?

&gt; Liberalised services are an incredibly difficult thing to make happen - the EU market is probably the only place in the world where it could be possible, and the benefits to our economy would be significant.

Why do you think this? Other than geographical proximity I don't see a lot of benefits. Our legal framework differs, and is far more similar to commonwealth nations and the US than France or Germany (a more practical reason for doing deals with the commonwealth nations than a sense of tradition which sadly seems to be the only argument I see put forward). Moreover financial services are based on English&amp;Welsh contract law. Countries like Japan have to adapt to our legal system when they want to deal with Wall Street or Hong Kong. Being able to sell them our expertise is something that the EU prevents us from doing at present as the duty rate pushes us to an uncompetitive position. Why would leaving the EU change any of that for the worse?

Aho ei ole ollut *poliittisissa luottamustehtävissä* kymmeneen vuoteen. Politiikkaa voi harrastaa myös luottamustehtävien ulkopuolella. Esimerkiksi Vanhanen teki politiikkaa perheyritysten keskusliitossa lobbaamalla työnantajalleen edullisia lakeja. Se oli helppoa, kun pääministerikauden jäljiltä oltiin sinutteluväleissä kaikkiin virkamiehiin ja ministereihin. 

Yleisellä tasolla: on hirveän helppoa ajatella että politikointi on vain sitä että saa uusittua virkansa neljän vuoden välein päästäkseen päättäviin positioihin. Rehellisempi näkemys on, että luottamustehtävä antaa *mahdollisuuden* politikointiin. Ovia politikointiin tulee myös muuta kautta: esimerkiksi sillä että olet suuren sanomalehden päätoimittaja ja alat kirjoittamaan pro-EU-pääkirjoituksia juuri ennen kansanäänestystä. Tai menemällä uutisvälineiden eteen kertomaan kuinka pankinjohtajana (eli asiaan perehtyneenä ihmisenä) Suomi on pulassa ellei siirrytä regressiiviseen verotukseen.

Ministerin kyky onnistua työssään edistää yhteisiä asioita kyse ei ole pelkästään siitä millä pallilla istutaan. Onnistumiseen liittyy asia- ja ihmistuntemusta sekä kykyä tehdä poliittisia vaihtokauppoja. Loppujen lopuksi: ministeri on työssään yhtäjaksoisesti vain maksimissaan neljä vuotta (usein kaksi) kun virkamies on voinut tehdä samaa tehtävää vuosikymmeniä. *Kyllä, herra ministeri* on hauska koska se on totta. Jotta ministeri oikeasti voi suorittaa tehtävänsä, ei se tapahdu  käskemällä virkamiehiä, vaan käytämällä asemaansa avatakseen ovia ja puhuakseen asianosaisille yksi kerrallaan kunnes ""väärät"" vaihtoehdot putoavat pöydältä.  Olen jutellut Mauri Pekkarisen kanssa päälle vartin. Tuona aikana hän esitti monia näkemyksiä joista olin ideologisesti eri mieltä (ydinvoima, työttömyyden syyt) ja useamman kerran huomasin hänen suoranaisesti valehtelevan viitatessaan tilastoihin. Tästäkin huolimatta jos minun olisi pitänyt äänestää  keskusteltavista asioista (kuten Fennovoiman ydinvoimalalasta) olisin saattanut helposti toimia Pekkarisen ehdottamalla tavalla. Esko Aho on vähintään yhtä taitava. Ja hän pääsee juttelemaan ihmisten kanssa, koska hänellä on edelleen useita yritysten hallitusten pestejä, kontakteja virastoissa ja ministeriöissä puhumattakaan siitä että *kuka ei haluaisi puhua entisen pääministerin kanssa*? 

TL;DR: Tärkeä ei ole onko poliittisia luottamustehtäviä, vaan pääseekö juttelemaan niitä jotka suoraan tai epäsuorasti voivat päätöksiin vaikuttaa. Esko Aho pääsee. 

----------------------

Voidaan tietenkin kysyä että eikö Aho saa sitten ottaa vastaan töitä joita haluaa. Tietenkin saa. Vapaa maa etc. Mutta mikä on hyvä Aholle ei välttämättä ole hyvä Suomelle. Valtiomiehiksi kutsutaan politiikkoja jotka ovat nousseet asemaan missä he eivät oikeastaan enää tarvitse luottamustoimia edistääkseen näkemyksiään. Meidän on tapana odottaa heiltä erittäin varovaista ja koko kansakuntaa edistävää käytöstä, koska heidän on helppo käyttää tätä valtaansa väärin. Se että tälläinen ihminen ottaa vastaan tehtäviä jotka vaativat yhden intressiryhmän edun pistämisen muiden päälle on erittäin huonoa käytöstä silloin kun tuo intressiryhmä on kotimainen/kaupallinen ja lähestulkoon valtiopetos silloin kun kyse on Venäjästä.

False,2,1459585337,,1463166373,todayilearned,AllThatJazz,,1459585879,2229,"My friends and I were actually phone-phreakers in the early to mid 1980's. 

--------------------------------

Essentially, we would use analog-modem cradles, connected to IBM-PC's and Apple ][e machines, to go to BBS-systems. 

BBS = Bulletin Board System.

In my opinion... these BBS systems were actually the precursors to websites, and existed since at least the late 1970's! 

But the only catch: most of the really interesting and underground BBS' could only handle about 1 to 5 visitors at a time, on average, (with the majority of such systems only handling one visitor at a time).

Most of them were running off Unix systems, but many were also running off IBM-PC's (1st generation, driven by MS-DOS!).

--------------------------------

Anyways, on these BBS systems you would find instructions for an incredible array of cheap to build electronic devices (such as blue boxes), as well as instructions on hacking the phone-network without a blue box... 

In addition, there were plenty of instructions on gaining access to a wide array of databases, that were left WIDE-OPEN in the early 1980's! 

--------------------------------

FOR EXAMPLE: 

rather than build an entire blue box, I used my Texas Instruments 99/4A computer to play the correct hack-tones into the phone line, including the infamous 2600 frequency tone, simply by using a simple command in what was the very first TI-Basic: 

""Call Sound ([Frequency], [Duration])"", 

and then I would hold up the phone cradle to the TV speaker emitting the correct sequence of tones that I had scripted, including the infamous 2600 frequency tone that let you get up to all sorts of mischief. 

--------------------------------

Some of those BBS system sites, also gave you instructions and phone numbers to Unix databases that you could simply dial into on the phone network, and rather easily view the database. 

We dialed into an airline/travel reservation system, which we had fun with a few times, by inserting fake but vulgar names on the passenger list for upcoming flights. 

There was also a real-estate company Unix-database system that we also dialed into, and messed around with a bit, leaving ""funny"" messages for the employees! 

--------------------------------

I guess as young teens... we somehow thought this was hilarious at the time! But now as an adult, I look back and say: ""Didn't I have anything better to do with my time!?""

--------------------------------

But as well, on those BBS systems, we would often find daily updates to MCI-Long-Distance-Calling-Card numbers. 

So... what that means, is you would simply dial the MCI toll free number. 

And then you would get a second dial tone, and enter the MCI calling-card number, followed by the number you wanted to dial. You would then have over a month of free long distance calls using that MCI-card number, before MCI caught on to that particular card, and would cancel it. 

NOTE: MCI was a long distance carrier company at the time.

--------------------------------

ANOTHER INTERESTING anecdote from that time... 

Given that we were kids (young teens, about 14 years old...) there wasn't really many people we knew to call long distance... so even though we had the ""power"" to jump around the world's phone network, and reach anyone we wanted... 

there just wasn't anyone we knew, or wanted to call long distance! 

So... instead, we would simply spend hours of fun time on public pay phones, dialing various countries around the world. 

Our most interesting call was probably to a US Antarctica research station at the time! 

The Antarctic scientists actually stayed on the line with us for over an hour, talking and answering questions... But during the call, the scientists suddenly got a bit worried/skeptical, asking things like: 

""Isn't this phone call going to cost your parents a lot of money?""

And we would try to say something to the effect of: ""Don't worry our parents are rich! So we can stay on the line and talk some more!"" [sounds of giggling in the background!]

--------------------------------

EDIT... ANYWAYS... this comment is getting really long... so I hate to add more... but... 

What finally put an end to my phone-freaking days was this: 

After almost a year of this fun, the Bell Telephone company actually got wise to us, and tried to bust me red-handed! 

We always used pay phones... but nevertheless, one day after I spent an hour or so dialing on a public pay phone, a bunch of numbers in Europe and China, simply for the fun of it, SUDDENLY a Bell Telephone van pulled up across the street to my location! 

Rather quickly, 3 guys got out, holding Walkie-talkies, and talking into them, then looking right at me. 

So that's when I decided to get the heck out of there, and then jumped onto my bike (a BMX bike at the time!), and took off peddling my bike like a mad man, in a state of panic. 

As I looked back they were actually running trying to catch me, but luckily there were some woods/forest trails right nearby, so I dove my bike onto the trail, then went deeper into the forest trails, further than I ever went before... 

And thus I got away! 

That was the end of my phone-freaking and hacking days!

I'm a white guy living in Japan. My race makes a huge difference to everyday things like buying clothes and getting a haircut.

I'm not fat; I just have a sticky-outy white person's butt, and need just a little more room back there or the crotch crushes my privates.

When I get a haircut, I only bring pictures of white models, because I've found that if I use the Japanese hair models in the glossy magazines they have at the salon, my hair will not come out that way. I also have to go to a new stylist a few times before he or she gets the hang of working on my hair. 

And, as you say, this makes the biggest difference at the doctor. White men in their 30s are at their highest risk of testicular cancer, and should be screened annually, and do self-checks monthly.

&gt;Trump has a history of invoking the death penalty without regard for its limitations.

BRING BACK THE POLICE!” He did not specifically reference the Central Park jogger attack in the ad, but its timing made the connection inescapable.

&gt;All five teenagers were eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to multiple years in prison for the Central Park rape. Then, years later, it was revealed that none of them had actually committed the crime.

- How much access to television and Internet is available to immigrants in reception centers, accommodation centers and other types of accommodation available to them?

- How much media content do they consume from Germany (German TV, radio, newspapers...) as opposed to that from their countries?

- How do they access content from their countries? Have you seen them (from your volunteer experience) use Youtube or other video streaming services?

&gt; Your opinion will only truly matter, if you research this topic and see the people in person, be it on the streets or in the camps. It's easy to judge numbers and documents and this can easily lead to rushed decision making and prejudices. It's always different for people who work in this environment.

I agree, unfortunately this reddit post is the closest I can get to actual people at the moment.

They have to really, really want to come here and face all the trials that come with legal immigration. Most of the legal muslim immigrant population is the US is pretty alright from my experience. Some may claim otherwise, but I have been met with nothing but hospitality and friendlyness from my muslim friends and their families. Based on polls, muslim immigrants in the US hold significantly more western views than any European country; in fact, I would say that even some of the more traditional ones hold very similar views to ""traditional"" christians (homosexuality is bad, don't have sex until you're married, etc.) I don't agree with them, but their views are at the very least socially compatible. I can absolutely believe that some of them would support Trump.

If you want successful immigrants from such different cultures you have to make it so that they must really, really want to immigrate and appreciate the opportunity. If they want to immigrate even through the extent that US immigration laws hold them to, then they will most likely successfully assimilate. It's shitty, yes.

I can only base my opinion on peoples personalities from what I see in clips on this subreddit, mostly. And my opinion of any player is based on numerous in-game and out-of-game clips that each slightly change my opinion of that player.

I don't have a list of videos supporting my dislike of any particular player, and I don't have a list of videos supporting why I like another player. I don't think you have such lists either. It's a mostly subconscious process that we all use to decide how we feel about people.

I don't think Krimz is a horrible guy, I don't want bad things to happen to him, I wouldn't wish physical pain on him, nor financial ruin. I just think that, based on the things I've seen, I've subconsciously built up what I think of him as in my head as being quite arrogant and occasionally bad-mannered. And because I don't know him personally, it could very well be that if we sat down together and had a beer he'd be the coolest guy I ever met, I don't know.

Commence by informing of your poor taste regarding musics, establish dominance by mentioning cryptic albums from the 80s, aka the golden age of Metal of course. Continue with aggressive expletives all the while insulting your heritage, provide more albums from the 80s, but now including records from the 90s that were influential to the genre. Develop into a mindless borderline tyrannical assault on the album in question, argue the lack of riffs and provide a nostalgic throwback to Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, aka when metal was good. Progress by mentioning the lack of Metal songs and subtly admit that if it's not Metal, it can only be considered shit. Contribute with subdued personal insults regarding your intelligence and overall taste, not just music now, anything; contrasting with self-boasting and patting my own back regarding just how fucking cool I am for listening to nothing but Atmospheric Depressive Black Metal recorded only in the caves of north Iceland, on Winter, on dusk, wearing my robe and wizard hat (the one with the point end that has corpse paint).

Develop a small social commentary about the ""new bands"" that are trying to be Metal, but can't because they aren't playing what's trending among the 9th-level of hell, aka underground metal for the cool kids, aka Cavernous Death Metal. Squabble the possibility that these ""new bands"" actually work as a barrier to ""newbies"", aka filthy casuals, and somehow reach the conclusion that it is so much better for Metal to stay perpetually underground, using the reason that these filthy casuals, aka disgusting-pieces-of-shit-that-only-care-for-pop-culture, only want catchy choruses (but actually use the word chori as the plural of chorus). Use an absurd amount of exclamation points to pass off as a very intelligent individual and justify it by throwing mentions to Power Metal, aka Flower Metal, as the false genre of Metal that all metal newbies listen to. *Munch on a few doritos while Rain Upon the Impure plays in the background*. Advance with the Power Metal argument by mentioning USPM as the true form of Power Metal praising only Tyrant and Agent Steel, but only Skeptics Apocalypse, because Unstoppable Force was not as fast; and slightly praise Blind Guardian as the only tolerable European Power Metal band, but only the first two albums of course.

Conclude with an acknowledgment of the length of the writing and surprisingly admit the waste of time it was to even make this discussion, positively affirming that nothing will change anyone's mind, therefore rendering the quarrel mute. Make one final push and firmly insist that I am indeed the smartest person in the world and that my musical taste is superior to yours in every way, shape and form. Briefly mention once again that Babymetal is for losers and indicate once again that the music is just catchy while reiterating on the abysmal lack of riffs. Notice that the vocals were not mentioned and assert this paragraph as a false conclusion. Invoke the need to continue on this proven unnecessary tirade against false music and verbally insult an entire country for having created J-Pop. Mention the bullshit melodies. Mention the lack of riffs. Mention the girly children voices. Mention the lack of riffs. Mention the shit guitar solos and that keyboard solos are not real solos. Do one small nod to Yngwie completely out of place. Allege the Death Metal growling as the universal form of singing. Praise the riffs on 80s Thrash Metal (in particular Vio-lence). Mention that children singing is among the worst things in the world, only toppled by children choirs, which in itself is only toppled by children themselves. Mention the lack of riffs. Mention the importance of the riff. Casually dismiss women as a proper human being and defend that Metal is for men! Return to the vocal solo-debate and dismiss them as shit.

Once again, recognize the avoidable wall of text and oddly apologize for it, but at the same time making the reader feel like it was somehow their fault. Provide the final enlightening words that perfectly encapsulate all that was said: ""Babymetal sucks!"".

&gt; 
&gt; The steel industry was shaken hard by the financial crisis in 2008. The banking industry was helped enormously to recover from that. I hope that we can see as much support for the steel industry and its workers now that they face their time of greatest need. Steel has been at the very foundation of our national identity for generations. It has given so much to us a country. Now is the time to honour that contribution.

Then the comments in that article give an idea into the flack which are along the lines of Tories won't save plebs. 

Either way, the line of argument seems to be gov should step in, save it for now and hope it becomes profitable in the long term and then sell it back at a profit. Alternatively, hold until a private sector buyer comes along. 

Gov stepping in doesn't seem to make sense as the industry seems in long term decline, financial services (or automobiles and insurance in the US examples weren't in terminal decline). I'm not convinced either by arguments that steel is imperative for national security - Port Talbot is about 1/3 of UK capacity of around 900 (whatever metric is used to measure steel output). Still leaves 600 domestically produced. Additionally, we could import from the US or Europe (Netherlands) or China if required - that seems diversified enough. 

Gov should step in to retrain or foster a new long term industry for the area, something which hasn't always been done in previous cases of mines closing down for instance. 

Private sector buyer seems unlikely. The plant itself seems to requires a lot of modernisation, the pension deficit is likely to turn off buyers, the industry is suffering globally (who's going to have capacity to purchase and integrate?). Also, potential buyers would probably be inclined to wait for a potential administration and pick out the best assets at a discount.

Lot of Moroccan and Turkish immigrants that live here. Most of them are nice as neighbours and people, but there are also people who want to pick a fight or steal. More than in other neighbourhoods in the Hague. Nowadays there are also a lot of East-european people living here, but personally I haven't had any problems with them. 

Also, don't wear (a lot of) jewellery at night and in the winter also nog during day. It's not that bad of a neighborhood, but I experienced bad things and so did others that live her in the schilderswijk.

And about the riots, it was all over the news, but that's the baddest that happened here and I really don't expect that it will happen again anytime soon. :) 

Pros:
- the Hague market is nearby, good cheap food
- many (food) stores in the neighbourhood
- much choice of public transport
- probably a cheap room (low rent) 
- good variety of stores and cheap food
- overall nice people (that mind their own business)

Cons
- can be unsafe for a girl to walk at night, I would say the worst that would happen (if something happens) is catcalling.

Personally I can't think of any other major cons at the moment.

Don't:
- walk with an expensive phone out of your pocket at night. Crime rates are higher in the winter months. 

Also.. 
- how ridiculous it may sound, but if you're a Muslim, you've not much to be afraid of, cause majority is Muslim (not implying that they are bad people.)

Now it's not just the width, it's also how large the outer diameter of the tire is, and thus how close it sits to the BB/seat post. Also if you plan on riding in sticky mud you need more clearance than say on a bike that just has bigger tires for comfort.

&gt; In the USA religion dicgates the lives of the people to a level that reminds of the dark ages.

There is no such era as 'The Dark Ages' as you probably think exists. *there was a period where we find few great Christian thinkers in the West so Church historians sometimes called those 'dark ages*. 

The 'Medieval' times were a time of tremendous advancement coming from the only 'dark ages' we might describe which might be a time when Rome degenerates. But the 'Middle Ages' are just fantastic for Europe. Christendom. Ages of discovery, preservation of knowledge then rediscovery of, education, etc then especially around 1000 where what could be called the real birth of the 'modern scientific method'.

Oh there is another problem level:
&gt;In the USA religion dicgates 

No, the USA isn't especially religious. I mean a dozen other countries to the South of the USA could be said to be more religious. Italians, Spanish. This liberal myth about the USA being somehow especially religious just isn't true. I can also suggest to you that here in China people are actually more motivated by religion (thats another story). 

&gt;dicgates 

dictates. very poor choice of words to describe American religious practice which is why I'd suggest the USA isn't so especially religious. *If Only* more Americans had their behaviors, choices 'dictated' by their religions. During a recent Trump Town Hall an answer from the host is ""Well, I'm against Abortion as a Catholic but I obey the laws of the land"" and the guy is somehow voting 'pro-choice'. This would be bewildering to many other people around the world. Americans are not prone to religion 'dictating'. 

&gt;It too adds to the dumbification.

It simply doesn't. It hasn't before. The USA is surely *less* religious now than every before. It's arguably been dumber. There just isn't a consistent correlation other than what John Oliver or Bill Maher viewers are trained to think. You can visit Liberty U. or Kings College or whatever you want and find it full of brilliant people, geniuses even, high IQs etc.

&gt;If there were less dumb people, there would be more smart people and the world would be in a better place. 

Sorry but history totally disagrees with you. The turn of the last century. Lets just say 1900 to 1940 and take a guess who many experts said were among the most educated, skilled, the 'smartest' folks were?

It was considered something of *The* intellectual center of the world (yes, many agreed over Edinburgh or London) and many would have pointed at Berlin. It was a center of both math and science but also the highest arts. Its where the brightest wanted to be. Not only that - a government of the day actually believed they could attain a kind of perfect world by deliberately filtering out and then into government those with the highest IQs, filtering them through the most advanced and rigorous University systems until producing the smartest most educated Nazis members.

You can also choose to feed your brush some oils at first. Sometimes I don't feel like slapping some argan oil right on my hair because it'll look like greasy spot. I put some on the pins, then brush it through my hair.

Casualties have been reported on both sides.

The attack on Yugoslavia was not planned long beforehand but rather a reaction to the coup d'etat in Belgrad after the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had signed the Axis pact in March 1941. While the new government under Peter II said they wanted to honor the pact, the Nazis did not trust them and order the attack in order to help the Italians out in Greece. Hitler personally decreed that Serbia was to be made responsible for the attack, which is why they were placed under military administration directly.

The decision to allow the NDH to happen has a very particular background: One, the Nazi leadership didn't want to commit too many troops to occupy Croatia. Two, the Italians insisted on a puppet government in Croatia with the idea in the background that they wanted to draw Croatia into their sphere of influence. After the conservative party refused to collaborate, the Ustasha was a sort of last resort to operate the state.

In the occupation policy of Serbia however, a lot of racist sentiment against the Serbs (also historically fueled by Serbia in WWI) played a huge role in occupational policy. When encountering resistance in Serbia, the Germans often committed atrocities against civilian population not involved in the resistance with the argument that they were Balkan people, i.e. especially prone to violence and treachery in the Nazi view. In the time frame from September to December 1941 alone, the Wehrmacht shot about 20.000 civilians, including the male Jewish Serbs, as part of their campaign of retaliation against Partisans and Chetniks, most of them not involved civilians. In the area of the Save-Drina bend during this action, it was Wehrmacht policy to arrest every male Serb they came across and place them in Concentration Camps while the women and children were forced to flee to the nearby Cer mountains.

The population of Serbia and to a certain degree in other republics of Yugoslavia were under general suspicion because of their place in Nazi racial theory. This is also why Yugoslavia lost something between 7 and 10% of its total population in WWII, which after Poland and the Soviet Union is one of the highest such losses percentage-wise in WWII.

Another example are the Slovenians. Their country was annexed by the Germans and its inhabitants should be forced thourgh a brutal campaign of violence and deportations to be ""Germanized"" as they were seen as potentially of a better racial make-up than their neighbors. So the general racial policy of the Nazis did not know the category of the South Slav and attitudes between different nationalities differed, even those who were seen as ""racially better"" had to suffer tremendously for it.

That's incredibly problematic to phrase it like that. Maybe American whites don't actually need ""deal with"" anything. Maybe you just need to realise your position of privilege and give the minorities some fucking breathing room without judging and evaluating them constantly. (Note: I realise the OP of this may not be white, but this is a primarily white forum that the question is being asked to, so I am addressing the subreddit more than I am addressing the OP.)

Any solution to problems like discrimination has to be grassroots and bottom-up, it cannot come from above. Nowhere is this seen better than in foreign NGOs coming into Eastern Europe to push for LGBT rights. Instead of actually helping, they have hindered the local movement by associating LGBT rights with the West and something foreign to the domestic culture.

But to answer your question. Try to help already progressive voices in those communities. Do not come from a position of privilege and power, do not lord over people acting more enlightened than them. Assist the grassroots movements in the best ways you can but do not take them over.

False,0,1459605174,,1463168841,Ethics,UmSoYeahIWasThinking,,False,1,"Regarding empowered consent, I totally agree with you that sometimes there's a lot of pressure to choose sex work rather than a less well paid job -- in some countries where there is no legal enforcement of fathers making financial contributions to their children's upbringing this is particularly true. I've seen this. For these women the choice is less empowered and I would advocate laws to force men to provide for their children, or cases where the man also has insufficient funds, for the state to help. This is pretty much what happens in some European countries. The point is that it's circumstances which cause women to be in vulnerable positions and these circumstances can and should be tackled to give them more power in their choices.

Yes, I guess were not too far off each other's reasoning when it comes to pleasure and well-being.

Regarding objectification,my meaning was that we can be friendly and treat a bus driver with dignity, but still not really treat them as an individual. Maybe it's not a good comparison to make. Of course, there's far more chance that an individual in the sex industry is suffering from harmful objectification. I was really trying to point out that people provide services for us and even when we're polite and treat them with dignity, we're still using them, but it's not harmful. I don't see why objectifying someone has to go hand in hand with not treating them well. I guess this is my main point in all of this. 

One can both respect an individual and treat them with dignity and yet sleep with them on a one night stand and not give them much further thought, can't one? Two individuals can agree to use each others bodies in that way. Stripping away all the reasons why a woman might be pressured into sex work, making it not an empowered choice, can we say that adding money into the equation doesn't necessarily make something wrong.

I would say that lusting is objectification. Having a one night stand is objectification. Both of these things are placing the main focus on using another's body for one's pleasure. Is such objectification necessarily harmful? Or would you say these things are not example of objectification? If they are instances of objectification, as I would classify them, then objectification is not necessarily harmful.

To make it a little personal. I lust after women. But I treat women with great respect and in many ways feel closer to women than to men. I don't think I'm harming women when I objectify their bodies and enjoy the high art of nature. It brings pleasure and seems like a healthy part of life. I feel as though I'm totally pro-objectification going by the definitions I read. But I'm also pro-respect, treating all people with dignity, giving all people as much power as possible in their choices. 

Do people really just mean treating people without respect when they talk about objectification? If that's what they mean, why don't they just say that? If they mean to say that using another's body is wrong then where do they stand with one off sexual encounters (without money being involved)? And if one off sexual encounters, in which, it's pretty clear to me two people are using each other's bodies, why does the addition of money necessarily make it unethical?  

I know that's a load of questions. But they are all connected. I just don't get the reasoning of people being anti-objectification when everyone, even those anti-objectificationists are doing it, and it's not necessarily harmful.

Regarding negative stereotypes about women and only treating them as objects then of course I agree this is unethical and something to be fought against.

Thanks again for any further help with this.

The black/hispanic organized (disorganized, lol?) gangs shoot each other enough for this to happen, as well as their culture is more prone to violence. They, together, account for a majority of crime in the country.

In wikipedia's article here, they mention this:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States

&gt; Overall, Black Americans are arrested at 2.6 times the per-capita rate of all other Americans, and this ratio is even higher for murder (6.3 times) and robbery (8.1 times)

Norway (for now...) is mostly ethnically homogeneous, which puts less tension. We have parallel cultures, and so we have to deal with the consequences.

This makes me think that perhaps we need to address black societal problems if we want to lower the murder rate of the United States, instead of currently turning the other way.

The amount of guns we have per the amount of crimes is really low, so I think that we shouldn't trade our rights away to the government, especially as the murder rate is lowering over time.

I think this idea of privatizing everything and putting people's lives on a measuring scale based on profit is detrimental. 

The only conclusion I've been able draw is that the Fire Department, Police Department and the Military are socialized programs that in general protect higher value assets from losing value.

Other deranged right wing extremists from other nations banded together with these idiots, circlejerking about how horrible immigrants are, etc. 

Then the German local elections came up and even in the most right wing state the right wing extremist party not even got a third of the vote and the winning party was - you guessed it - Merkel's party (i.e. right wing conservative Christian party).

These include not only staple food crops, but wild species ranging from the smallest prokaryotic (bacterial) cells to the largest trees, mammals, insects and so on. 

Due to the interconnectedness of all kinds of ecosystems all over the world, extinction of one species can lead quickly to the extinction of another, and another, and in a very short space of time the (from a geological perspective) the *entire world* may be uninhabitable to all but a few species. 

For example, consider the rapidly-declining populations of honeybee species all over the world, most notably in North America and Europe. While factors other than climate change, such as the use of insecticides, influence their decline, the local or indeed global extinction of certain pollinator species would spell ecological disaster, as plants found themselves unable to reproduce (due to nothing being present to carry their germ cells from one flower to another). Given that bees and similar pollinating animals such as wasps and certain species of birds are necessary for producing a significant portion of our food, this is not an issue which can be ignored.

Zooxanthellae, which are prokaryotes living on the surface of coral reefs and within some species of jellyfish, provide another example. Zooxanthellae work to provide oxygen as well as other nutrients to species living in and amongst the corals, and provide many other ecosystem services as well. Due to the increasing water temperature and acidity (the latter of which is largely caused by dissolved carbon dioxide in the water), zooxanthellae populations are declining rapidly, again harming biodiversity and potentially causing ecological disaster. 

Additionally, a rapidly-changing climate (regardless of whether or not this change was caused by human activities, which it *certainly was*) leads to increasingly violent weather events amongst other effects. These events threaten our homes and lives. 

Rising sea levels, caused largely by melting of polar ice (which is in turn caused by global warming), threaten not only a frightening amount of homes with low elevation above sea level in the first and third world alike, but pose an extremely large existential threat to ecosystems in or near the ocean. 

These are some of a tiny handful of reasons why global warming is ""so bad."" Many scientists argue that we have in the last few decades entered a new global epoch, known as the **Anthropocene**. The prefix *anthro* literally means *human*, and *anthropocene* means a global epoch caused entirely by human activity (mostly, but not entirely, anthropogenic climate change). The reason for the introduction of this phase is that humans are now recognized as a leading, if not *the* leading, cause of extinction amongst other species as well as changes to the Earth's climate, hydrology, and atmosphere.

To answer your question, there are many people (including myself) who believe that anthropogenic climate change is the largest existential threat currently faced by us as a species.",t3_4d1q58,2,0,t3_4d1q58,d1n0mbt,t5_2sokd,

Dignitas vs Naventic didn't play well on the first game but it was because they didnt expect to lose against TNL. The more they played, the more they were confident and the more they dominated game 2 and 3. And I think there is a gap between Naventic and Dignitas.

Same thing happens for C9, they didnt expect to lose against EDG and they played really badly on game 1 against mYi. But in game 2 and 3, mYi was dominating almost the whole games and C9 did the difference in the last 2minutes. In EU, mYi is not seen as a top team (more like a good team who has the perfect day in the EU qualifiers) and I think C9 wouldn't win against team dignitas.

If Typhoons can take off in the UK, conduct a sortie over Libya, and return to the UK, they can get to Ascension which we share with the Americans - who were nice enough to extend the one runway it used to have which was still somewhat out of range for our East Europe cold war based aircraft.

Flame Juggler generally trades better and faster against opponents' minions - battlecry can pop a Divine Shield or kill a token, and the 2 attack means that it can actually kill something right away. Playing a Haunted Creeper and have the opponent fearlessly drop a Knife Juggler that you are then unable to kill is not great. Flame Juggler also trades better against Shielded Minibot.

Flame Juggler is also generally better against Priest, although that is a somewhat rare matchup. Holy Nova and Lightbomb do not kill it, it is not as good of a Cabal target, and when buffed with Defender of Argus it actually goes outside Cabal range, unlike Haunted Creeper, which just becomes a perfect target.

As for Gormok, the deck is perfectly capable of activating it without Haunted Creepers. What Gormok is really good for in this deck is that 4-8 point burst to any target in the lategame, when Paladin is not expected to have much.

Furthermore, as the deck generates plenty of 1/1 tokens anyway, having something with a bit more health is often useful.

On the other hand, Haunted Creeper is obviously really sticky and can provide some protection against board clears. If staying on the board is the problem, Haunted Creeper is better than Flame Juggler. Haunted Creeper is also better against Fiery Waraxe, but not necessarily against Death's Bite.

I have also played a lot of Warlock Zoo with Flame Jugglers instead of Haunted Creepers (peaked at #30 legend on EU with such a list) - it is definitely viable depending on what decks you face.",t1_d1n035n,28,0,t3_4d1eg8,d1n0v4s,t5_2w31t,

It is being called one of the fastest city circuits ever for a Formula 1 race with a straight-way of 2.2 KM (but you'll see from turn 16 to 1; its mostly straight. 

The track will take drivers down the main highway that runs up against Park Boulevard - a scenic walking park along the Caspian Sea, around the historic walls of Old City and then past the Parliament building. I used to live about 3 blocks from turn 3. I can tell you that the little stretches of road through the city after turn 1 through turn 7 will be intense. 

Turns 8-12 I think look deceptively difficult, but the real challenges I predict will be through 13, 14 and especially 15. They are positioned in places that I believe drivers may want to take a little more risk &amp; we could see some exciting positioning before the straight after 16. The curbs in most of the city area are about 1 foot (.3 meters) high with no shoulder. The part around Old city will involve sharper turns, steep(ish) elevation changes and then getting to throttle it hard on after 16. Regardless, it is such a tight track that we can hopefully expect an incredible and high speed finish. 

It should be an incredibly entertaining circuit to watch. Additionally, the circuit provides for TONS of great vantage places to watch - several bars/restaurants on top of buildings in Old City &amp; I'm sure Park Boulevard &amp; the lot outside Parliament will be fitted with stadiums like they did with the European Games.

 * Handling of China

&gt;A lot of things fall under this and this is one of the biggest deals for me regarding foreign policy, but Clinton antagonized Beijing leadership at every turn. She pressed them on their currency, she harassed them about religious prosecution, she repeatedly sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to Taiwann, she fought against their border right (biggest example of which was flying American soldiers through a Chinese no-fly zone just to prove that they wouldn't shoot it down), she also made the environment for every conversation that the US had with them (even pressing them on an issue that the US itself hasn't resolved). These are all important issues, but my problem was that she would treat with China and bring a list of demands, all the while never doing anything to attempt to improve Us-China relations.

 * Basically did the same with Russia
 * And somewhat with India
 * ...and the entirety of the middle East other than Israel where she massively expanded their military

It paints a really nasty picture for the UK, and a bad one for the EU.

I think you're focusing too much on the impact on the EU, without taking the impact of the UK in mind.

Most naysayers seem to think that because the EU will bleed a little, they'll continue trading. Meanwhile the UKs economy is being absolutely destroyed... So once again, what is the UK bringing back to the negotiation table when the EU will suffer either way? It'll still be in the EUs best interest to leverage a better deal out of the Brexit then UK. Then it just depends which nation will chicken out first, EU or the UK. If the EU waits it out for the UK to propose a better deal ... Well, then the prospects look really bad for the UK.

Best outlook reading so far is then access to the single market, while paying the full entry free (unlike the reduced rate the UK has now), like Switzerland. But wouldn't the UK end up paying more then?",t1_d1n11gk,5,0,t3_4d0too,d1n2lv0,t5_2qhqb,

Those sailing in small fleets with aggressive intentions became known as Hunters. They preyed on the weak, targetting indivisual ships.

False,0,1459617260,Sociology of Religion,1463171960,AskSocialScience,yodatsracist,,1459618606,6,"So, right, most less developed countries start out with most of their GDP concentrated in the primary sector (that is, in the direct extraction of resources: mining, timber, fishing, agriculture, oil, etc).  Some countries have been able to invest reinvest proceeds from the primary sector into the secondary sector (manufacturing).  This has been China's recent success, for example, and Mexico's, too, and early important steps for both Korea and Japan.  These days, however, the richest counties have economies based the tertiary sector, the service sector, not the secondary sector.  Very few countries have been able to make that leap from a middle income country to a high income country.  Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Israel are good examples from the 20th century, but they're not necessarily models that are easy to emulate (Japan was the first country to really innovate cheap oversea manufacturing; South Korea had *heavy* state investment in unprofitable, uncompetitive heavy industries like steel for years before it paid off--as recently as the 1970's, North Korea's economy was doing better the South Korea's; Singapore sits on some of the most profitable shipping routes; Israel has had innovation driven in part by high human capital immigrants; though I know little about Taiwan's story).

This problem is often called the ""Middle Income Trap"" ([see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap)), which is one of the big questions in development economics.  Botswana's primary sector is profitable enough that it has become a middle income country without making a large manufacturing sector.  Economists don't necessarily see that a problem, but they do wonder about where Botswana and similar countries will go next.  Of course, one of the big debates in development economics is if there even *is* such a thing as the middle income trap. And among those who do believe in the ""middle income trap"", there's a big debate whether the ""middle income trap"" or the ""low income trap"" is harder to get out of.

But overall, that's what I think you're really failing to take into account here: starting position.  Most of Sub-Saharan Africa started out with incredibly low incomes and low levels of general economic development (education/human capital, infrastructure including basic things like roads and electricity, etc etc).  [Look at this chart from the *Economist* comparing per capita GDP in 1960 and per capita GDP in 2008](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/03/focus-3).  Really have a good look at it, because I think it's the crux of why other people have down voted you.  Notice that it is *rarer* (and then, by a certain logic, harder and more impressive) to move from low-income to middle-income, as Botswana has, than it is to move from middle-income to high-income.  Indeed, notice how many more countries are in the ""becoming poor"" bloc, where they moved from middle income in 1960 to low income in 2008.  That's the low income trap that economist also talk about.  Empirically, Botswana's success is quite quite notable, and I don't think any economist would write it off as quickly as you have, especially not those who believe the ""low-income trap"" is harder to escape than the ""middle-income trap"".  Now, like I said, not every development economist believes in the middle income trap (I think most do?) so for a criticism of the concept of the middle income trap, the Economist has this somewhat technical article meant for a popular audience called ""[The Middle Income Clap Trap](http://www.economist.com/node/21571863)"" (I'm not sure about the current state of the debate in development economics--maybe you can ask a separate question about the low and middle income traps if you're curious).  For a criticism of that criticism, see the more technical follow up article [Middle Income Trap: A lot of Chow](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/02/middle-income-trap)"" which argues that whether or not evidence for a middle income trap exists, the evidence for a *low* income trap (the one Botswana and few other countries have gotten out of) is very robust.  Mere resources aren't enough, and there's some debate in development economics whether resources hurt or hinder economic development (see ""the resource curse"" or ""Dutch disease"").

As for another success stories, look to the The Seychelles.  It has developed a strong tourist economy (part of the tertiary sector) and is by many standards is either on the verge of moving out of the middle income trap and becoming a high income country, or has recently done so.  And it has done so with relatively few resources (besides tourism, its economy like Iceland's is heavily dependent on fishing).  Again, another success that development economists regularly point to coming from a majority-Black country--though I should say that race in the Seychelles is complicated and as far as I can tell, the vast majority people (something like 70%) are racially mixed (but in America and Europe, like Obama, they'd generally be ""read"" as Black).

Edit: But just make sure you're not ""moving the goalposts"" constantly, and every time someone finds a good, and regularly pointed at success, you're not saying ""no, no, no this isn't *really* a success"".

The 34c is a decent razor, but it is not particularly efficient. It's a step up from your VdH razor, but not a big step, and it's not nearly so efficient as all the other razors that have been mentioned. The 38c is the same head with a ridiculously oversized handle and a ridiculously oversized price tag. Neither razor is particularly well-made - Merkur is notorious for sloppy plating work.

Each [Edwin Jagger razor](http://www.amazon.com/Edwin-Jagger-DE89bl-Chrome-Plated/dp/B003LW4L2W) uses exactly the same head as the Maggard V3 and [Italian Barber Protege](http://www.italianbarber.com/products/razorock-protege-double-edge-safety-razor-with-se-handle). But the EJ handle is plated base metal instead of machined stainless steel, so that's a strike against it. Plus, the EJ razor costs more. Assuming you live in the US or Canada, there is absolutely no reason to buy one.

A Muhle razor uses the same head as Edwin Jagger - in fact, the two companies co-developed it - but is egregiously overpriced. In the EU they're not such a bad deal, but in the US all Muhle products cost about double what they're worth.

One of the territories at the time was British Mandatory Palestine. In the later years of the Ottoman Empire, large amounts of Jews had began immigrating to this territory to avoid persecution in Europe, but this territory was already inhabited by a group of people that we refer to as Palestinians today. During the period of the British Mandate, both the Jews and the Palestinians hated living under British rule and openly revolted until the UN proposed a plan to carve Mandatory Palestine into two countries: Palestine and Israel. The Jews were ready to accept this deal, but the Palestinians refused because they believed that it was 100% their land and to accept anything less would be wrong. This led to war between all of the neighboring Arab states and the Jews, ultimately ending in Israel declaring independence in 1948 and sovereignty over the entirety of Mandatory Palestine. In Geopolitical terms today, when we talk about Palestine we are referring to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank, and that's the Palestine that is referred to in the song. However, it's the official policy of every single Arab state, except for Egypt and Jordan, that Israel does not exist and they will not officially recognize it. For this reason, in the Arabic translation Israel is omitted and replaced with Palestine to keep the flow of the song. It's a much more complex issue than I can begin to describe here, but this is a basic explanation for why they'd omit Israel from the song",t1_d1n4qml,97,0,t3_4d0whh,d1n5dxv,t5_2qh6e,

With the Timurids, I'd force them to give you a persian core (and not much else) in the first war.  Keep the truce as short as possible.  Then you can release persia as a vassal and make the timurids give them back their cores in subsequent wars.

Biggest starter mistake people make when having connectivity issues is to conclude it is out of their control. You have to troubleshoot fully, and start with doing the correct things beginning with what you have direct control over yourself. 

A big indicator that you still have more things to troubleshoot is that you reference other games and services when you have trouble with HOTS. That really only means two things. That you have a connection to the internet, and, that those OTHER services are working as intended :)

1. Nearly all of Sanders' ideas have been successfully implemented in Western Europe. So as policies, they're very realistic. If you mean political reality, Sanders has also been clear about this - what it really takes is a strong grassroots movement. And he's built that - look at all of these first time voters and independents he's picking up. And on many of these key issues, like Medicare for all, the vast majority of Americans support him. I also think it's simply inaccurate to say political change is slow and steady in the U.S. It also comes in fits and starts. Look at what the Civil War did to the balance between federal and state relationships. Look at Teddy Roosevelt and his push for federal regulations. Look at the New Deal. Look at every civil rights victory. All radical ideas.

2. Like what?

3. Does Sanders say we should abolish Wall Street? That seems to be the gist of your point. It's also long past the time we take a real look at poverty and it's correlary, income inequality. And the most recent issue - the 2008 recession that decimated middle class jobs - the ""haves"" have yet again enjoyed almost all of the economic gains. Class warfare has been waged by the rich in numerous ways since the 1970s, decreasing their own taxes and decreasing regulations on industries from which they disproportionately benefit. You can sum up most of what Sanders is saying by quoting Eisenhower of all people - that's how far this problem has gone, you don't even notice how far to the right the dialogue has been pushed.

4. Fair enough! This is certainly an agree to disagree issue for me.

5. All of the data we have disagrees with that, in fact. Sanders is the most electable candidate from all survey data we have. I'm afraid that this has just been one of the Clinton platform's planks for so long that people buy that hype more than what the data indicates.",t1_d1n0v1f,1,0,t3_4d1hdr,d1n6rvd,t5_2cneq,

Historical linguistics is the study of how languages change over time, it's what's used to reconstruct things like Proto-Indo-European. It's not the same as knowing the languages, a historical linguist doesn't necessarily actually know the language that he's working on, although for obvious reasons it helps. It's also generally not all that helpful for history, although it can be useful for learning the languages (I don't personally think you can learn Greek without some basic idea of how the Greek language changed from prehistory to Attic, because otherwise you have to memorize the paradigms of literally every verb you encounter like a psycho). Knowing the languages, though, is of great use. I would argue that it's nearly impossible to study ancient history and classics without knowing Greek and Latin (although there are a *very* few number of scholars who actually don't). In more contemporary fields maybe it's not as important, I don't know--as a classicist I deal more or less exclusively with the texts themselves, so I would be forced to work from translation, which is very unsatisfactory for any detail or nuance and is not always possible, as some texts have never been translated.

Instead it was a complete failure across the board.  

Appeasement didn't work with Hitler?  LMAO!  But 80 million dead 'worked'.  It's comical.  That's why it's the biggest load of shit of all-time -- the 'story' of World War 2.

[He has proposed cutting the defence budged too.](http://breakingdefense.com/2016/02/feel-the-bern-what-a-sanders-military-might-look-like/)

Excerpts:
&gt;Switch the Air Force from building fifth generation aircraft like the F-35 (“incredibly wasteful”) to extending the life of its fleet of legacy aircraft like F-16s and F-15s. The Air Force would still have a formidable fifth-generation force in the F-35’s already built and the existing F-22’s, although that force would be much smaller than planned.

&gt;Reduce the active Army to about 250,000 soldiers, down from today’s level of 475,000. To compensate, the reserves might be reduced less, to perhaps 290,000 for the National Guard and the Army Reserve. This would be consistent with Sander’s statements that he wants to decrease America’s overseas presence, particularly in wealthy regions like Europe and Japan. 

&gt;Shrink the Navy to about 160 ships with maybe five carriers (“Cold War weapons”). It would take a long time to get to this level, even by retiring ships early. The Navy could live off its existing inventory for a decade or two. Nevertheless, the smaller fleet would over time mean a much reduced overseas presence.

Porém pela primeira vez eu vejo segundo o data-fuleragem, o pessoal tendo alguma opinião sobre isso, mesmo que ainda repitam um lado ou outro. Historicamente essa faixa da população não estava nem ai pra politica, e se ligava mais em coisas como o futebol, ou entao em se desdobrar pra pagar as contas do mes.

Acho que a consciencia politica esta ainda nascendo, e acho que eles começam a perceber que a politica influencia e muito em sua qualidade de vida.

Até agora, só de forma intuitiva claro, me pareceu que nas manifestações só os vimos como parte do ""recheio"" das entidades organizadas, especialmente de esquerda, o que ainda não vale, no sentido de consciencia politica. 

E uma única vez, e esse sim, acredito que válido, um pouco atras das manifestações de 2013, houveram protestos, depois dos protestos que eclodiram pelo passe livre, um pessoal se manifestando lutando por coisas como por exemplo o ""cade o amarildo"", violencia policial, e uma das coisas que deu pra identificar, foi exatamente as pautas diferentes, descoladas do grosso das manifestações de 2013, mas que de alguma forma se sentiu estimulada por ela.

Interessante também que aquilo que a gente chama de ""coxinha"" hoje, que tem uns pra direita e uns pra esquerda, acho que o pessoal chama agora de ""mortadela"", parece que eclodiram na revolução de 30 com o Vargas, uma nova classe politica baseada numa nova classe média, de então, que conseguiu derrubar a oligarquia então vigente no Brasil.

Então hoje me parece que o governo é feito de uma salada de coxinha com mortadela, e ainda com oligarcas do café-com-leite, mesmo que em menor grau, mas ainda vemos alguns herdeiros dessa cultura politica.

Portanto não sei como vai ser, quando houver esse tipo de ""revolução"", quando a classe mais pobre realmente estiver politizada o suficiente, pra exigir a parte que lhe cabe nesse latifundio chamado Brasil.

(E também ainda não vi o movimento diferente de 2013, que ninguem entendeu direito por ser algo novo, estar representado em algum esforço politico de longo prazo)

I refuse to believe that Fnatic as an Organization has a playoff buff, that just stupid and here is why.

**First**, Fnatic had a solid permanent roster thought 3 years (Xpeke\Soaz\YS\Rekkless\Cyanide) with some little changes (Nrated) here and there so assuming this roster is gonna perform at playoff was always a thing because they performed in every single regular split other than the one they lost to alliance which they weren't aweful, just not amazing as previous splits. 

**Second**, Fnatic was the second best team in EU after the first overhaul roster in last 2015 spring split so to deduce that they will do poorly at playoffs was an ignorance once again. 

**Third**, summer split 2015 Fnatic was the best western team that was ever put together, so again deducing that this team will do poorly in playoffs was considered ignorance and stupidity. 

And we have this split, Fnatic was looking shaky most of the split up till the slopes of the playoffs, with changing to a **rookie challenger support** half way into the split as well, so believing in an X factor where there isn't any proof that one exists is equivalent to believing  in Voodoo Doctors or NA doing well at Worlds.

It should be removed because:
1. It has absolutely nothing to do with Sikhi and I suspect the only reason you have uploaded it is because of the anti-muslim slant
2. This video insults women as being inherently weak and says they cause societal collapse. You insult all of the Shaheeds who faced the mughals. You insult the mother of the Khalsa, Mata Gujri, Mata Bhag Kaur. You say that all of the great women of Sikhi were idiots?

&gt;many women actually disagree with you. for example, most don't believe women should be panj pyare. 

Is that the same thing? Is saying the Panj pyare should be men because the original panj were men the same as saying women destroy society? 

Tell me, if women are so weak and only have as much safety ""as men allow rhem"" then why did your Guru give women Kirpana? Why did your Guru ask women to take Amrit? Why do we say ""jinna Singha SINGHNIA ne dharam het sees ditte, band band katae, khopria lahaia"". Why not remove the word Singhnia? Why should we honour them and recognise their Kurbani in service of the panth if you believe that women destroy us?

&gt;the fact that germany is being invaded by muslim refugees is largely the fault of feminism which has emasculated germany's men after decades of toxic progressivism. 

Firstly, that video says that Muslim men are more violent and so stronger because they treat their women worse. It also then goes on to say that the solution is for westerners to treat women worse, in effect to become more like these ""invaders"" so thst they are strong and csn resist them. These are disgusting views incompatible with Sikhi. If this is what you believe then perhaps you should rejoin the ranks of the Brahmins of Guru Nanaks day.

Secondly, are you going to completely ignore the last ten years? Did our countries not invade Iraq? Has the oil money Saudi Arabia's found not been funding the most violent versions of Islam? Is that all a coincidence? Are women and progressivism to blame for that?

&gt;germany has the --lowest-- birth rate in the world and the modern gay rights movement has its roots in germany.

What absout Russia? They have one of the lowest birthrates in the world and yet they jail and murder gays and immigrants. They're not progressive by any measures. Maybe everyone should be more like these people?

&gt;coincidence? i think not. 

Why not? This entire comment makes literally no sense. None of it is based on any actual evidence or statistics. What's worse you go completely against the message given to you by Maharaj, and somehow manage to simultaneously insult every Sikh woman who has ever lived and denigrate their Kurbani.

Some people are strong. Some people are weak. Progressive or not has nothing to do with any of it, and before you get carried away I'll tell you right now, Germany is not being invaded, and in 10 years time they'll be back at their place as the strongest country in Europe.

It's usually a gravity switch so lean in corners doesn't affect it (because the bike is leant with the cornering force, so local ""down"" is still from head to tyre). Newer cars also have them, of course - it's a very cheap fitment especially in a (relatively size and weight unconstrained) car, and anything that reduces post-crash fire risk is a Very Good Thing indeed. 

The killswitch is there for a couple of reasons: for one, it lets you shut the engine down without taking either hand off the bars, which may be necessary (if, for instance, you get a stuck throttle at speed) or just convenient (clutch in, thumb off, key off, clutch out is arguably the safest way to turn a bike off while leaving it in gear for anti-theft and roll reasons). In the EU (and possibly the US) it's a legal requirement on new bikes, which is why it's always red, always those symbols, and always right thumb. 

On top of that, cars will have an ignition kill when any of their impact sensors are tripped - if the airbags deploy, then the ignition and fuel pump are practically guaranteed to get shut down, and often in mid-speed crashes where the airbags don't go off but the sensors still log a crash, they'll also trip the internal killswitch. Depending on car this might be an ""off and on and it'll start up"" or a one-and-done permanent shutdown until you take it to a mechanic. ",t1_d1n8wuz,2,0,t3_4d12wl,d1nahrp,t5_2qi6d,

I've been working in tire/automobile automation for 5 years. 

From a scheduling standpoint, let's say they're going forward with the current design and won't spend any more time creating new components. (This is always to some extent untrue). 

The next step is figuring out what you need from a factory standpoint. At the start you're looking at what you can buy vs what is already designed, i.e. do I design a machine to wire my motors or do I buy the machines from a machine supplier? The machine supplier is 95% of the time the quickest. At that point you need to examine the market. Does someone sell something that can perform the tasks required? Identification of suppliers would likely take two months to verify that they provide the required components at the required quality and they meet your specifications. 

Next, you would need to bid out the process. You have 10 suppliers, based on your corporate philosophy, this could take another 2-3 months. 

Then, the machines would need to be built. Most industrial machines do not roll off of assembly lines and almost every company tries to run a backlog, similar to how Telsa is always 2-3 months away from delivering a model S at this point. Depending on the company, you could be looking at a 3-6 month wait before the first wrench begins turning on the machine. Even if the machine builder does not have the backlog, there is usually some manufacturer specific requirements (Tesla) that require engineering work to be met, and thus 3-6 months will start before build. Then, you're looking at a build schedule which varies from machine to machine but it is typically 2-4 months and results in a working machine at the machine builder's facility. 

Once the machine is built, it must be checked by both the machine builder and the customer (Tesla). Assuming the machines Tesla is getting are nothing ground breaking, this is likely a month long process. 

Now that you have the machines built, you can tear down and ship the machines. As it turns out, the machines come from many different countries in a plant. Many will be from the US but there will likely be many from Europe (considering the weak value of the Euro) as well as China and Japan. This shipping process (depending on location) could take another 2 months. In theory, this could be expedited but the cost of air freighting an industrial machine is usually in the hundreds of thousands of dollars due to their size and weight. 
Now that the machine has arrived, it must be assembled and tested. In a perfect world this should be a 2-4 week process but it's not uncommon to lack the materials you need to test or configure the machinery until weeks later. Additionally, the staff must be trained to operate and service this machine making my estimate around 2 months. 

Then, after all of that, they could begin squeaking out small batches as they work out the final bugs both on the individual machines as well as their Level 2 software to communicate from machine to machine and deal with component scheduling.

This is made by the fact that the Congo Free State was not owned by a nation. It was the **private property** of the Belgian king. He disguised it as a humanitarian effort, yet it was a machine designed to print money for him.

The brief version of how this was achieved is that King Leopold employed a massive army, which would head out to brutalize the natives and force them to collect rubber and ivory. People who resisted were killed or maimed. Each soldier that used a bullet had to bring back the chopped-off hand of the native they killed, to justify the **expense of the bullets**.

Yet almost nobody knows about it. People associate the Belgians with chocolate and the EU, while they should be associating them with piles of chopped-off hands and a colonial industry that consumes human lives to produce ivory and raw rubber. 

Even after the end of the colonial days, the echos of these days were still felt in the Congo. The region endured decades of civil war as a direct result of its colonial infrastructure, which simply was not designed to sustain a stable nation. ",t3_4d1tk8,236,0,t3_4d1tk8,d1nba6q,t5_2qh53,

That's what bothers me the most about American politics.  I supported Rand from the very beginning.  Voters seem to only be interested in rhetoric and too damn lazy to think about the specifics.  In that sense, I can't blame Trump entirely for campaign strategy.  

Also, let me clarify that top part.  I'm aware of his position on E-Verify.  I just wished he emphasized it in his speeches+debates more so than the wall.  I suppose the wall idea attracts more attention and support, which I'm sure is his intention.

The ""temporary"" approach is a political way of saying ""Islam is wrong but if I say that loudly I will get hammered completely, so I'm gonna make it look nicer by saying temporarily until.. and that until criteria will never materialize because Islam is an evil death cult that will never change.""

I will say that tactically this has been a good approach, as once dialogue starts in the country, once censorship is lifted and people start reading Koran and getting news from Europe (which is currently censored as well) - they will see Islam for what it is. And then less and less people will be supporting Islam. The only reason why so many Americans are tolerant of islam is because they know nothing about it, and it doesn't yet affect their lives.

The Saudis and OPEC increased oil production last year at an incredible rate. The excuse was that they were trying to drive fracking competitors out of business. This is THE biggest load of poppycock. US domestic oil is not even close to matching OPEC output. 

HOWEVER, decreasing oil prices did hurt the Russian economy. While people were distracted by the decreasing price of the Ruble, they were ignoring the fact that all of the world's oil storage facilities were reaching maximum capacity (this probably won't happen until 2018). 

So why is this important? The powers to be are planning on Russia cutting off all oil supply to Europe. When that happens, oil prices will SKYROCKET. But, OPEC will have reserves to supply EU/NATO countries with. Not only will they make their money back, but they will make a monstrous profit after Russia cuts supplies to Europe. 

Now, lets look at some other signs. All branches of the military are being forced to integrate. This is not a PC move, it's strategic preparation for WWIII. When the shit hits the fan, women will be available for the draft. They may not be as physically strong as their male counterparts, but they will still be able to bolster the ranks of our own armed forces. This will give us an advantage in the war to come. 

Other signs include the recent inspections of our Nuke missiles and operators to ensure readiness, the Army's recent switch from counter-insurgency training to re-training for conventional warfare, and our increasingly warm relations with Iran. 

Putin's involvement in Syria was nothing more than a very realistic training exercise to ""blood"" his troops. Troops that have seen combat before always outperform 'green' soldiers. This is not emphasized with US forces, but it is a very important part of the USSR's military culture.  ",t1_d1n1gdu,1,0,t3_4d0wwx,d1ncn4c,t5_2qh13,

&gt;Do you find that you as a person are consciously attentive to nonverbal behavior/body language?

Nope

&gt;How big do you consider your personal space bubble?

I am bad at estimating, I suppose one meter in front of me (or one arm length). Besides me anything goes as long as it doesn't touch me. If the train or bus is overcrowded, non-existant. The more people that don't have to wait for the next bus, the better. If there are two free seats next to each other, I'll take one of them, if not I'll take one with a person nearby. I appreciate when others do the same. (I mentioned that last point explicitly, because I read somewhere that this behaviour is considered strange somewhere).

&gt;Who are you comfortable with casually touching you?

Depends on the place ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). No, seriously it would weird me totally out if a stranger did that. If it wasn't a stranger, it would still depend on the kind of touch. Like a punch on the shoulder or a smash on the back of the head is completely normal. Randomly stroking someone without being *absolutely* clear that it's just a joke is a big no. Greetings are something different, handshakes for men, handshakes or hugs for women.

&gt;Do you feel the need to have your own room?

Yup, though it might change if I have a family one day

&gt;How about your own house or car?

Nope, though it might change if I have a family one day

&gt;What kinds of things make someone unapproachable in appearance?

Ehhh, I don't know. Maybe people that talk loud or bigger groups of people? If you mean looks, attention-grabbing looks make someone unapproachable for me

&gt;In what situations do you think eye contact is important?

Intimate situations with your significant other. Also done when raising your beer (hope that is a correct translation for ""zuprosten""...), otherwise you'll have seven years of bad sex. Can't think of any other situation.

&gt;How comfortable are you with eye contact?

Can change from case to case, except with the SO of course.

&gt;In what situations do you think it is appropriate to smile?

When a joke is funny, when you are holding up the door for someone or vice versa, as a greeting, I don't know. As long as you have a reason to smile just do it. Just don't smile the good damn day or you'll look like a nutjob.

&gt;How do you interact with your friends nonverbally?

Punching, hinted punches, hugs (last one nearly exclusively for women).

&gt;How is it different than with aquaintances?

Well... With aquaintances I don't do any of these ""playful"" things, so except for greetings there is no nonverbal communication I can think of.

&gt;Does it vary with males and females?

With most of my friends being men, yes. Also hugs for women (you should get the idea)

&gt;How important is hygiene/odor in your culture?

You don't need to shower everyday. When I am not doing anything physical I don't shower for a day or even two. Before I am going out with friends I always shower. Greasy hair and stinking like a bag of rotten corpes are looked down upon.

&gt;How do people in your culture show their power or dominance nonverbally (eye contact, clothing, tone of voice, etc)?

I haven't really seen ""alpha males"" yet... Maybe being physically imposing and talking loudly?

&gt;Are there any notable gender differences in the way people behave nonverbally in your culture?

Can't think of one. Maybe, maybe not. I am not sure

&gt;How about some interesting things you’ve noticed about American nonverbal behavior that you’ve noticed?

False,0,1459630820,43/M 'shipped,1463175785,OkCupid,kteague,,False,2,"Having only experience dating in Ukraine my thoughts on Eastern European women:

They are lovely! I appreciate women from many cultures but in Ukrainian women I appreciate their manners. They say, ""thank you"" and ""bon appetite"" and are generally quite curteous and conscientious.

On the whole, while there are stereotypes in their culture, it's true that there are greater differences between each person than similarities that can be painted with sweeping generalities.

Feminism took a different path in Eastern Europe. I believe it is much less common for women in Ukraine to want to ""smash the patriarchy"" or to insist on splitting the bill during a date. But there is the Femen movement in Eastern Europe and I've met Ukrainian women who fit purely into the more Western feminist styles. And while many Ukrainian women embrace their feminine aspects, they also tend to the independent and strong side. The divorce rate and single mother rate in that country is very high, so it means that many women there have to be able to be the sole provider for their children.

I asked my Ukrainian girlfriend if she liked to cook on our second date. She bluntly said, ""no"". Later she explained that she believes men are better cooks and that they are more suited to that role. But for a woman who professes a dislike for cooking, she is a great cook and she does cook a lot. This is a truism for Ukraine, their economic situation means that cooking is a normal part of their life. They take pride in their cooking! Every house party I attended in Ukraine layed out lavish home-cooked dishes. I took great pleasure in these events, they had so many different dishes and all prepared with great care and effort. It was a marked difference from western house parties where the host simply purchases a bunch of pre-cooked foods.

My girlfriend is fairly traditionally Ukrainian. She love, love, loves to get flowers. She expects me to hold her hand when getting on and off the bus and to open doors. She encourages me to be decisive and assertive when making major decisions, as she will say, ""You are the man, you should decide."". She loves a clean house and she always puts on make-up and fine clothing before leaving the house. She takes a long time to get ready and she says to me with a laugh, ""this is woman!"".

I've heard one Ukrainian woman say, ""a woman needs to be beautiful, a man doesn't need to look any better than a monkey."". Of course, being a slob is attractive in no culture, I don't think it's necessary to impress your average Ukrainian women with fine dress and appearance.

I think the most marked difference between dating in Ukraine and in western Canada was the woman's stated goals and values. And I'm not sure how much this is a cultural truism or just an artifact of dating only within the subset of those women who considered international marriage. But almost always on first or second dates a Ukrainian women would ask me, ""What are your values? What values do you seek in a woman?"". Then the women would always say they valued a man who had some set of values such as honesty, devotion, caring, compassion, empathy or kindness. This is also true for online dating profiles, it's far, far more common for Eastern European women to state that they have these values and seek similar than for western women.

In contrast, my dating experiences in the west, the woman tended more towards valuing aspects such as creativity, wit, conversational capability and ambition.

For me personally, I found dating Ukrainian women to not need any guide. It was mostly really easy. I could be myself and I had a lot of reciprocated interest. But I share those same values of a stereotypical Ukrainian woman, so mutual connections progressed naturally. So often dating in the west the script felt so confusing or wrong. When do I pay for a meal? I can't buy her flowers on the third date? What do I do to impress her? Am I really supposed to try and have sex on the second or third date? I came from a background of traditional values and often felt out-of-sync on dates in the west - with the modern, successful woman what is it that she values, what does she seek? I asked this of one of my female friends and she laughed and said her and her friends didn't really know what they wanted. Ukraine is a far more homogeneous culture than international Vancouver, so it is easier to have basic expectations of how to behave and how to read the signs when dating there.

You mean PKK who attacked PDKI for no reason? No, I remember that. Or how they attacked our crude export pipe, twice? Haha! https://goo.gl/0xgvW7 I swear you will claim it's fabricated, as you people always do, but when it's KDP it's ALWAYS 150% true.

&gt;Or who constantly has brought our enemies to fight these ""fellow"" Kurds?

Yeah like PKK when they begged for help from Hafez al Assad?

&gt;You hate the Turkish government for what they do today in Bakur and the same time praise the man who sold his people to that exact government. He has literally turned KRG into a market for Turkish billionaires. Then saying that this is a result of desperation for bashur. Your people and culture is getting brutalized and massacred yet you still refuse to see how corrupt and disgusting the KDP actually is.

Care to explain how because I'm tired of hearing this useless crap every time.

Don't forget, PKK started the war. I would let the PKK sort out its mistakes, if they wish to wage war against Turkey then the PKK should not expect from the KRG shelter in South Kurdistan. The PKK does not have much to lose, South Kurdistan does, and we will not endanger what we have achieved, because they did not listen to our advice. Do you think PKK would help KRG if we attacked Shia militias for no reason? Of course not. Don't be foolish. I condemn the attacks on any Kurd anywhere, but I also condemn the killing of innocent people anywhere.

&gt;On top of this, the KDP are so goddamn incompetent, ranging from economy of KRG to social institutions. Everything is literally just shit. You have students who know they'll be nothing in the future when you put your own son as president of universities even if they are dumber than my right ball. What kind of leadership is this?

Apart from the notion that that is bullshit (Masrour Barzani is a honorary man for a PRIVATE university) The double standard really shows itself here.

When something good is done, all parties say they were involved and you schmucks here applaud it, but when something goes wrong, it's all the KDP's fault. :) You know it's real.

&gt;You're somehow trying to find excuses to what happened in Shingal and at the same time criticize what Ezidis say when they got fucking massacred? Turn and twist it however you want, the situation is the same, especially for the Ezidis.

You got a source that *is not* Ezidipress? Otherwise it's bullshit and I don't want to hear about it.

&gt;This is a party who sees ONE family higher than the entire Kurdish people.

No they don't.

&gt;If an outsider saw how the KDP works, they would fucking laugh. 

No, they wouldn't. President Barzani is an democratically elected honest man that doesn't do the bidding of Tehran nor Ankara. Foreigners and westerners are not as stupid as us Kurds.

&gt;You people who live in Europe and defend the Barzani clan are hypocrites

You and I both live in Europe, don't forget that, but the amount of Kurds living in European who support Gorran and shit on KDP every chance they get is far bigger than vice-versa. It's also funny that youth from Suli flee to Europe to get welfare and free money and then they say that KDP and Barzani made them flee. Lol, don't you people have any honesty?

&gt;The fun part is, you guys are the ones who whine about ""unity"" the most, when the PKK fights in all parts of Kurdistan, literally gives lives for the people in all parts, you still refuse to see who actually is the one representing the PEOPLE.

Again, the double morale and hypocrisy shows itself. When KDP wants to help our Kurdish brethren and expand the war effort in Rojava against both Assad and ISIS, PKK fanboys label them as ""power-mongers"", when PKK wants to control the entire political power in all four parts of Kurdistan and ban other parties and expel their members as they have done in Rojava, they're called representing the people, haha. It's so stupid it's not even funny anymore.


&gt;

But I wouldn't expect anything else from you. You would put your shitty red ideology before your people every day of the week.

Even if you wanna be fair and split the difference 1.5 million defensive usages is a huge number of victims that were able to protect themselves. What we can definitely show is that banning firearms will lower gun crime rates, duh, but not actually lower violent crime rates at all. When we look at Australia and the UK we can see that the violence didn't decrease with a ban, it only altered the tool that criminals utilize. What is the point of disarming citizens when crime and victimization will still be happening at the same rate?

You carry a gun to protect yourself and the people you love, no one else. No threat to me, no reaction from me, super simple. In your example a trained CCW person would determine that they were not involved and then get the heck out, let the police do the policing. Your idea of a wild-west shootout is completely ridiculous and has never happened in the US, it's little more than scare tactics. 

The repeated argument that armed civilians lead to armed criminals is absolutely absurd and equates to arguing about whether the chicken or the egg came first. Causation is hard to determine, but we have seen increasing numbers of firearms in the US correlate with falling crime rates, so I'm not ready to decide that correlation DOES NOT equal causation either.  

Finally, I'm going to point your perception of ""wild-west"" America to the media and remind you that the US is one of the safest nations of our size in the world, don't let a forced narrative of violence tell you otherwise. We see about 16k intentional homicides for a population of 300 million across a landmass that is absurdly larger than all of the EU or other economically developed countries; similarly, when we apply the US style of crime statistics to nations like the UK we actually see that the murder rate equals or surpasses that of the US, yielding yet another blow to the 'ban' style of policing. The US, along with most of the globe, is the safest it's ever been, yet the media consistently tells us that the sky is falling. There are many solutions to the problem of security: insane levels of surveillance (UK), social programs to eliminate poverty and crime, or allowing citizens to protect themselves. Our culture in the US is one of self determination, so similar to several other nations we have placed the onus of security onto the citizen and allowed for concealed carry and the like.

The Old Testament and other texts of the Judeo-Christian faiths are very brutal. YHVH in SMT II is also a good representation of the depiction of YHVH in the Old Testament. I care because I find the Judeo-Christian religions always falling in either two extremes. They view the world in black and white, never finding a middle-ground. It's always either Chaos or Law - either you follow YHVH's word or not.
They attribute all power to a singular God, preventing people from finding themselves out on their own. They make it out like you MUST follow this arbitrary God's Law or else you are a doomed for all eternity. The Arabs imposed Islam in Africa and the Europeans imposed Christianity on the Native Americans, and both were heavily oppressed. What good is a religion where you MUST worship a God otherwise you are to suffer for all eternity? Doesn't matter if you had a heart of peace unless you worship YHVH and follow His Law, in their words.
Furthermore, they encourage division and strife over abstractions. The Crusades were fought over words that had no basis in reality, and people became obsessive over dogma to the point they spilled blood. To have the blood of another man on your hands because a book compelled you to? One reason this was the case is because all power and greatness is attributed to one God and his Son. Esoteric Christianity, such as Meister Eckhart, and Sufism tend to be better because at least they encourage people to find peace and balance within themselves, not relying on external dogma, but they still tend to selectively cling to some set of dogma and slyly ostracize those who do not fully accept their beliefs. 
Ultimately, one must let go all -isms, find oneself, and be balanced in daily action in life. No divine word will help you ultimately live your own life and find your own balance. I feel like the SMT games make this clear with their depiction of God. And yes, I got this all from a video game. Before Shin Megami Tensei, I never seriously considered these views. SMT is my personal Nietzsche.

É preciso ter um acompanhamento dos imigrantes nos meses subsequentes.

Acredito que eu possa supor que você é a favor de fechar as fronteiras e azar de quem buscar refúgio. Creio que eu não vou conseguir e nem pretendo mudar a forma como você pensa, mas só para acrescentar ao debate, barrar todos os refugiados não vão impedir o isis de se infiltrar nos países do ocidente, porque as células já nascem dentro deles, elas não migram pra lá. Vide o número de jovens sem ascendência árabe ou que não são de religião islâmica que se voluntaria para o grupo só por querer ver o mundo queimar. Risco de entrar um infiltrado existe simplesmente ao recebermos alguém com o passaporte inglês, como o Jihad John.

We have free everything. Education is NOT free. We also don't have affirmative action or military scolarships or any of the other socialist crap you might assume we embrace up here. You have to bust your ass to get into university up here. England does not have free education... Most of the EU does not have free education so I'm not sure what countries you are talking about.

Have you ever been on a native reservation? Half my family lives on a fucking native reservation. Health care and education are pathetic. They have zero opportunities ""out of town"". Of my seven uncles who live in Kahnawake, only one has a job outside of town. He's a steel worker in New York. You can read about him and how he helped out post 9-11: Chad Snow.

Kahnawake is a very nice reservation with a water treatment plant and a sewer system and all kinds of other amenities. Most reservations don't have any of these things and the people live in second-world conditions inside the US and Canada. It's pathetic. They are economic prisoners living in camps. I am surprised you argue with this. Native lives matter, don't they?

All lives matter. Stating that one group requires special attention and VIOLENTLY ATTACKING random white people because... what, because their great-great grandparents MAY have been slave owners? How many fifth-generation white families do you know? That's making an excuse for racist violence against innocent people. Any group that commits violence to get their point across is a goddamned terrorist organization. Period.

Again, ending with an insult. Republicans are all stupid and impossibly stoneheaded... That very statement in itself is hypocritical. Besides, most of the most successful people in your country are republican. I'd hardly call them a band of morons. 

I don't assume that because you're a Bernie Sanders supporter that you don't have intelligent reasons for doing so. Would you like to retract that shit you said and maybe retract your assumption that I live in your country and that I'm republican, while you're at it, please? 

Frankly, I find both sides impossible to talk to. None of you seem to be capable of holding a frank and decent conversation without reverting to attacks.

I am sorry I upset you with my opinion. I have been spending six hours a day researching the subject from all sides (I co-chair a local political discussion forum. Normally we discuss regional politics but the US election has become like our favorite reality TV show... plus it frankly affects us more than our own elections), but perhaps you have insight that is not available online.

I'd appreciate any calm and rational reply that would add to my understanding of your viewpoint.

I feel as though ever since I first saw Dr. No as a 12 year old my life has been leading up to this moment. I have finally been able to acquire my dream gun, a W. German Walther PP in 7.65mm (.32 ACP). The longer brother of the more famous Walther PPK, the PP was originally designed in 1929 by Carl Walther. It is the original Walther “police pistol” (Polizeipistole) and was issued to police first in Nazi Germany and then later in West Germany. This particular pistol was manufactured in 1966 and features an “NDS” stamp on the slide and frame. This indicates it was issued to a police officer in the Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) region of West Germany. The gentleman I purchased this from acquired it while serving abroad in Germany in the military. He then went into contract security work, traveling around the world with this PP as his back-up weapon. He only offered to sell it to me after he got to know me over a few weeks as he wanted to ensure it would go to caring home. I got an outstanding deal on the pistol and a bunch of ammo and holsters. There is a good chance this will enter my CCW rotation occasionally so I can live out my childhood dream pretending to be a secret agent in the Cold War.  

As for CCW, I am thinking about swapping out the grips just so I don't mess up the wood on these. I also need to do some more research on 7.65mm to find which brands make the hottest loads. I have a couple of boxes of Fiocchi that I will probably carry in it for now as I know the European ammo manufacturers load 7.65 hotter than US manufacturers.",t3_4d3m2k,1,0,t3_4d3m2k,d1ng4zb,t5_2s4mc,

Obviously access to education is something that should be a basic human right too, but it's access to healthcare, *especially* infant and newborn care, and the lowering of infant mortality that will stop things like this.

People always respond to this with ""But if the problem is that babies die, why would someone *abandon* a child?""

The answer is because when you expect somewhere between one third to one half of your liveborn children to die, you have to have at least double the amount you want/can provide for in order to end up with the amount of adult children that you might need in order for your family to sustain itself.  This means that when less of your children die than you expected to die, you have more than you can provide for.

""Why not just have a small amount of children or no children at all?  You don't *have* to have kids.""

Not in an industrialized nation.  But even putting aside the fact that access to sex education, contraceptives, and safe and legal abortions is extremely limited in underdeveloped nations, and that thus family planning is basically impossible...

It's just not viable to not have children.  Children aren't the future, here.  They are a commodity, a work force, just like they were in pre-contemporary Europe and America.  You *have* to have children if you expect to be able to continue producing enough food or sellable resources to survive.

This puts people in the impossible situation of needing children while needing not too-many children.  So long as that situation exists and isn't escapable, you will inevitably end up with over population, child abandonment, and all sorts of other horrible things that aren't borne of intent to cruelty but desperation.

If you want to see stuff like this stop, put your money behind:

1. Aid foundations that actively support mother and infant care.

2. Aid foundations that actively supply family planning access such as sex education, contraceptives and contraceptive use, and safe and legal abortions.

More than general education, more than economy, and more than access to abundant food, even, these two criteria have greater effects on improving quality of life in developing nations.

And when the Russians fought the Japanese in 1904, that was considered a major war which even led to a revolution in Russia. And there was fighting in the Balkan, and European imperialism across the globe. I think it's pretty unlikely that war felt like something of the past.

Your outright denial that people who are circumcised can have discomfort when masturbating perplexes me. It's not like it can be argued that they don't have tighter skin than people who are uncut, unless a penis magically grows more skin when erect.

Here, one of the first hits of ""lotion"" and ""masturbation"" on Reddit. Some people are fine without lotion, some are quite clearly not. Are you going to deny these people's experiences?

https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hf2y6/lotion_and_masturbation_just_for_circumcised_guys/

&gt; Cut here, tightly so. No lube, no getting off. I'll get friction burns and or my head will go numb. 

-

&gt; What?? I'm cut and think I've done it without the use of a lubricant maybe once or twice. There's a lot more pain than pleasure for me personally if I wouldn't use lube. How do you do it without? 

-

&gt; I think it's because the doctors don't always remove the same amount of skin during a circumcision. It's not hard to believe that if they cut too much (or however they remove it now-a-days), it would be difficult to masturbate without discomfort.

-

&gt; I am a cut guy and HAVE to use lube or it chafes the hell out of me. Very painful. Fuck circumcision.

-

&gt; It's a cultural thing. Most guys born in North American is circumcised (but this rate is in decline) and lubrication is oftentimes considered a requirement if you are cut. ",t1_d1na1hw,1,0,t3_4ct9kt,d1ngt8m,t5_33726,

Eu acho o contrário. Não acho razoável colocar em risco pessoas da sua nação para ajudar estrangeiros sendo que existem inúmeras pessoas dentro do seu próprio país que precisam de ajuda. Também não acho razoável destinar recursos inexistentes a estrangeiros quando nossa educação está em frangalhos, nossos hospitais caindo aos pedaços, temos muitas pessoas passando fome, morando nas ruas etc. Também não entendo a lógica de trazer gente pra competir no mercado de escassos empregos com as classes baixas que mais sofrem com a situação atual do país.

Islam IS inherently violent.  Mohammad was literally a warlord.  The Hadith instruct people to throw gays from buildings!  Why do you defend this mindset?  Imagine one minute if the Pope still held most of Italy as his personal kingdom and regularly beheaded homosexuals, atheists and ""witches"" on St Peter's square on sundays. If he financed this brand of ultra-integrist pro-Inquisition Catholicism all around the world with the explicit aim of ruling all countries as theocracy. And if there was a 'Crusader State' roaming around in Eastern Europe, trying to conquer all its neighbours, sponsoring attacks all around the world and genociding Orthodoxes, Jews, Tatars and Atheists.

I bet you and the rest of the uneducated left wouldn't be simply saying #NotAllCatholics, you would fight instead.

You're defending Islam by mentioning the Crusades?  Is that he depth of your grade 9 historical education?  The Crusades were defensive wars.  Ask an actual academic.  Within 200 years Islam had spread by the sword from Saudi Arabia to the doorsteps of fucking Paris.  You think Egypt was always Islamic?  Alexandria was the center of Christian learning.  If I call you fucking clueless and state the sky is blue in the same sentence, it doesn't mean the sky is not blue simply because you link to a page on ad-hominems.

And 300 trucks is your basis for what for a big number that will impress me? 300 truckloads of arms isn't impressive. Multiply it by a factor of ten and it's still a drop in the bucket. 

I don't know what you're on about with that millions of rounds which will mean no new weapons will be needed. The Turkish Army itself has shortages of some itmes because you mentioned MIT and you're looking at the groups capturing a weapons and ammo cache next to the front and saying that's not needed or has no impact.

That was like a comercial for a procurement department...

And to put your millions of rounds coming into perspective:

Trust me if that ammount of weaponry ( that is accompanying replacement rifles, machine guns, vests to carry stuff, new mags, rpgs and hmgs) and the assortment of small arms ammo and military supplies  with it was flowing we wouldn't be talking 300 or 3000 truckloads....",t1_d1nere1,2,0,t3_4d1tc9,d1ni5wd,t5_2x5s1,

Instead E.U. countries did a stealth bailout where they took over Greek debt, thus absolving the people foolish enough to lend Greece that money from any kind of lender's responsibility, and thus made it inevitable that they'd have to bear that responsibility themselves. But they don't want to admit that since it's politically inconvenient, so instead they just keep kicking the ball forwards (secretly hoping they can kick it forward enough for some new economic boom to make the debt go away, which sadly for them isn't working).

This.

The thing with forgiving Greek debt is

-It'd piss off other countries that have debts, some of which had to borrow money to lend to Greece as per EU commitments.

-It'd piss off a lot of taxpayers in the lender countries.

-Greece would have no incentive to pursue further reforms as is currently being done conditional to bailouts. They'd just return with the begging bowl and borrow more money, rinse and repeat",t1_d1ni0vw,5,0,t3_4d27p7,d1nj0od,t5_2qh13,

I'd wager, as we saw in some places OTL, that free black people would purchase slaves like their white and native American countrymen.  

Many of these children would be intelligent and/or hardworking, and many of those would get rich.

And, as was the culture of the time, wealthy people would purchase slaves.   (probably often starting with their parents and elder friends)

I could see slavery being more of a class divide, wealthy Americans of European/Asian/African/native heritage would own slaves.

While their poor(er) American brothers (and sisters) would be left out in the cold.
