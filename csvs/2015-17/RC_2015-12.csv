"Well, for one, there is in fact a historical record here. There is a bit of wrangling on how exactly to match up the Egyptian calendar to the one we use, but we can place the construction into a reasonably tight set of dates from historical sources alone. It is not as though they were ""discovered"" by Europeans: the Egyptians talk about them, the Greeks talk about them, the Romans talk about them, the Arabs talk about them. It would be rather remarkable if the subject of the giant artificial mountains near consistently one of the most densely populated areas of the world was never discussed.

Beyond that, there are certain pieces of stylistic evidence: the Great Pyramids did not appear *ex nihilo*, there was a period of development from the even more ancient [mastaba](http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2cb2e40bb8f5d5f2d5741f2f36e7fed73672b803.jpg) to Giza, to the [Step Pyramid of Djoser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djoser#/media/File:Saqqara_BW_5.jpg) to the various pyramids of Sneferu, and finally to the pyramids of Giza. And funnily enough there aren't really great stonking big pyramids after Khufu and his descendants, they are fairly characteristic of the third and fourth dynasty. There are certainly [big pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Neferirkare#/media/File:Abousir_Neferirkare_02.jpg) built after but not on the same titanic scale. So on this stylistic grounds we can be pretty clear on this.

But if you want something really concrete, there are the [carbon dates](http://www.aeraweb.org/projects/how-old-are-the-pyramids/) of material from the pyramids. Carbon dates are a bit more fickle than is usually appreciated, but the dates at least confirm that they were constructed within the commonly considered ""historical period"" of Egypt, and once that is conceded it requires a lot of mental gymnastics to disregard the traditional dates.",,1448930139,10,0,10,0,AskHistorians,cxijpym,t3_3uw95d,Roman Archaeology,Tiako,archaeology,t3_3uw95d,t5_2ssp3,False,1450552690,False

"I have to disagree with you on that last part. Germanic peoples did not see mass Christianization until Medieval times, and that was often through sword and flame. Norse mythology is a form of Germanic paganism, as is Anglo-Saxon paganism. That's why you find gods like Wuotan/Woden/Odin, Donar/Thunor/Thor, and Ziu/Tiw/Tyr. The Norse were simply North Germanic tribes.

The Germanic peoples covered a large expanse of Northern and Western Europe and included the Norse, Anglo-Saxons, and the Goths. Germanic paganism came about during the European Iron Age which started about 1200 BC. Before that were the Indo-Europeans. All Germanic tribes were pretty much Christianized between the 6th and 11th centuries, hundreds of years after the supposed life of Jesus of Nazareth.

Often if you are that person (with the puny ego), you've connected with a partner whose subconscious senses that, and in turn creates a relationship where they take advantage of that... because they have a substantial and strong ego and feel they are deserving.

It's catastrophic.  Believe me.

"I'm not going to say no one would argue that a part of the US on the other side of the date line is actually ""east"" of the rest of it, but I'm saying that it makes far more logical sense and is just as unofficial to say the westernmost point is the furthest point from the center where it's still closer to get there by going west than east from the center. There is no legal or scientific absolute definition of what is ""wester"" or ""easter"" than anything else on earth, any interpretation is no more official than any other.

Wikipedia has a specific section on it's [page of US exteremes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States#Interpretation_of_easternmost_and_westernmost) dedicated to the three possible definitions that could be used (date line, antimeridian [180 degrees longitude], or the geographic center). I would note that the former two have ""citation needed"" while there is at least one cite for the latter which is what people here are arguing makes the most sense.

I don't think you understand what semantics means. Semantics means arguing over the definition or technical meaning of something instead of its substance. So while I'm saying that it only makes sense to define the westernmost point as the further point where that you can go west to get somewhere that it isn't closer to go east. Or, if you were to draw a picture of the USA, would you really draw the entire world so you could put those two island son the other side of europe, africa and asia? Or would you just add them to Alaska on the west edge of the map?

Your *semantic* argument is ""west is defined by a line, so I am bound by the definition because it's the technical definition"". That's semantics.

In any event, I think you're wrong because we don't define the concepts of ""west"" and east"" by the date line. Flying from California to Japan is not considered flying ""east"". It's still west. West is a direction that is not affected by the date line. The only thing the date line defines (and arguably the antimeridian defines this more) are the definitions of certain geographical regions like ""the western world"" and the ""eastern world"" (or hemispheres). That doesn't mean that actual compass directions change at those lines.

Again, it's obviously arguable, but the most logical response in my view is that ""the most western point in a country is the most western point of it that is within the smallest circle you can draw around the entire country.""",,1448935054,1,0,1,0,AskReddit,cximoyh,t3_3uudrc,,TheHYPO,,t1_cxiicqs,t5_2qh1i,False,1450554091,False
"A lot of this isn't even remotely accurate. How is this a best of? Have you people never read a history book or travelled?

/u/pagiras says that Latvia was a shit hole until about 2-5 years ago, but I travelled through the Baltic states in 2008 after visiting Russia and those three tiny countries were awash in EU money at the time. It might have had a lot to do with the EU setting them up to get onto the Euro, but it's been a long time since I've thought about it. 

Anyways, I had just come from Russia and I was convinced that the Baltics were going to be tiny shit holes of their own, like mini versions of the Russia I'd just left, but they were the furthest thing. They were clean, had good roads, good infrastructure and very friendly people. I hitchhiked through all three because they were so nice. 

Maybe there are parts of these countries that are absolute shit holes, but those parts exist in nearly every country. To describe these countries as ""more fucked up versions of Florida"", as /u/mogifax has isn't even remotely accurate. I've also been to Florida and that place was scarier and weirder than the Baltics, which were really calm and peaceful. 

You can argue about places like Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, and Serbia being messes (especially since Ukraine has a war going on in its Eastern regions), but the Baltic states are not the same thing as these other parts of the former USSR. I find it frustrating when people conflate their Eastern European countries and histories. These countries aren't all the same. They have different people with different cultures and have all been on separate trajectories since the collapse of the USSR, and to treat all of the countries of this vast and different geography as the same does them all a disservice. You can't sum them all up by talking about them as the same thing. If you're going to give credit to anybody, read /u/martinszeme.

"You're right. 

Going without clothes is incredibly impractical. Illegal in a lot of places even. 

But you know what's not impractical? Getting clothes made in places in which the conditions aren't ridiculous. You can very easily get clothing made in the US or Western Europe. But it's more expensive and often difficult, and in the end it's just a shirt. 

So you can also get meat at a local farmers market from a local farm in which the animals are treated humanely. Or you can go completely vegan. But both of those are also expensive and often difficult, and in the end it's meat from an animal we rarely think about.

"Lot's of questions... but here we go. (Warning... you didn't say I had to self censor. Some swearing below)

1. I was always in to electronics. I did some time as a car stereo installer as well as doing car alarms. I realized it wasn't going to pay the bills for the rest of my life (or at least not provide the kind of income I wanted) so... I decided to step it up a bit. A couple years doing basic computer work, software installs etc and I decided to go back to school (very late at almost 30).

2. Basically the ladder - helpdesk, junior admin, tech 3, worked at a couple MSPs and got to my recent employer as lone sys admin.

3. I'm a manager of a small IT team so for me the hardest has been picking up people skills when I haven't needed them for years. Let's be honest here most of us don't go into IT because we want to be people persons. Other than that - organize. [Read Time Management for Sysadmins](http://www.amazon.com/Management-System-Administrators-Thomas-Limoncelli/dp/0596007833). But the biggest thing you can learn along the way is when to admit you're over your head on something. Don't screw it up because you're afraid of looking stupid. Admit you don't know, then research the hell out of whatever it is. 

4. Everything is a learning experience. Basic electrical I learned in car audio. Organizational skills, planning etc I learned in a job doing logistics. I don't care if you're working at Starbucks... there's something to be learned wether it's inventory management or marketing.

5. I went to one of those over priced, spend the rest of your life paying for it technical colleges. Why? Well I needed to take classes at night. Also, the major universities offered CS courses. I want to actually learn systems administration and networking and I didn't have 4 years for theory. I needed to hit the ground running as I was already employed in the field. Most important class? Cisco CCNA. Network fundamentals are something you will use every day.

6. RHCSA (Red Hat), MCP SharePoint. Maybe another but I can't remember. They haven't been overly huge in my career. They have been work related in one way shape or form and paid for by the company.

7. These days being a manager... becoming a people person. Playing the politics. Keeping people happy (customer and staff). Working with high expectations on a minuscule budget. Being in the K-12 space we're broke and expected to make miracles happen. Think enterprise support on a small company budget.

8. Technology Manager. I report to a director but I'm more technical so basically I drive the bus. 

9. Roughly 95k. I could be making more in the private sector, but I agreed to it, so I'm ok with it.  

10. No. Yes. Maybe. It all depends on the day. I'm not going to bullshit you and say IT is all roses. It's stressful day in and day out, night in and night out when you reach a certain level. When the infrastructure is your responsibility and the buck stops with you it weighs on you every day all day. It's the first thing you think about when you wake up and the last thing you think about when you go to bed. So, no it's soul crushing. BUT... when it's humming along and the train is rolling it's the best job in the world. When shit is crashing down around you, everything is broken and you're the one in the fire, there's nothing like it. And if you manage to get it all back ... well you'll remember it for years to come. 

11. See #10. But ultimately management sucks. I want to be technical. I don't really want to be a people person. I want to work with the systems, the network... I could give a shit that you can't come to work today because your kid has the sniffles or you ate some bad sushi. We've got shit to do and you're holding up the bus.  :)

12. Solving problems. By far the best part of working in IT is solving weird shit. 

13. Like any other job that works in an office building. I have an office, a desk, a chair, a computer and phone that never stops ringing. And email... the emails never stop. 

14. Yes. My wife supported me going back to school, my folks were always helpful and have always been my rock. I speak to my mother at least a couple times a week and she's always my sounding board. Monetarily... no. My wife and I paid and are still paying the bills.

15. Trick question. I would change everything. I'd be a pro hockey player. Or something badass like that. In IT... I may have changed some stuff, but so far it is working out. I'm not as far along as some of my peers from school, but I'm worlds ahead of others.

16. The world doesn't owe you shit. You're NOT entitled to anything. I don't care who your parents are, I don't care that you've grown up with computers. Yes, work life balance is a thing. Yes, some people have it. NO, you're not going to have it in the majority of small IT shops especially if you're the sysadmin or network admin. Someone will call you at 2am to say something is broken and you damned well better be in the car 10 minutes later. *Sorry, that was harsh!* But, the reality of IT work beyond the help desk and desktop tech roles is the business doesn't run without you. If you want to get ahead and get promoted, start making better money, you have to commit. It means being on the verge of burnout, It means being willing to come to work at 2am because some putz in Europe can't get to the mail server. That's the job. If you don't think you can do it... go in to accounting. 

17. Systems admins are a dying breed - the really good ones will stay working, but Cloud services, MSPs and the like are making that look like a closing door. Network admins, programmers, DBAs, security... I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon. Even if you don't become a programmer - learn the basics. Powershell, etc... HTML/CSS/SQL and the like are all good skills to have and stuff you will use regularly in a lot of roles. 

Hope that helps. I'll PM you my basic info shortly. ",,1448942311,3,0,3,0,sysadmin,cxir6bq,t3_3uxvrv,,iTguy22,,t3_3uxvrv,t5_2qnp7,1448942850,1451362252,False

"Yeah, it's a bit difficult but it's essentially what most countries do. They only let in a small amount of migrants because people get pissed off if there are too many foreigners in the country. Notice how in the EU you can only get in if you have a very fancy degree, otherwise they won't let you stay in the country.

Is that racist? I think that is certainly part of it. I'm in the Netherlands and people bitch about foreigners all the time, and often they include Dutch citizens with a migrant background. Most countries try to keep out foreigners because otherwise their population goes apeshit.

I think most people are fine with small minorities of other people, but not so much as to change the culture or language of their homeland. Look at Belgium, people are butthurt that some regions turned from Flemish to French.

1999, and it's everything you need to know about what happened in Iraq.  

Americans have DEEPLY internalized the equality narrative in a way that makes us think not just that everyone is equally smart or capable, but that everyone is the same, deep down. 

And yes- obviously Arabs love their kids and laugh and love and all that.   But we're really, really bad at acknowledging that different cultures lead you to think and value in different ways. 

This isn't good, or bad, or anything.  It's actually the real benefit of diversity that everyone tiptoes around- someone from the 4,000 year old continuous chinese culture is going to have a different mindset than someone from the 3,000 year old disparate European culture.  Not necessarily better or worse or anything- but different. 

Which brings me to-

&gt;Of course, this implies an actualized intent of nation building and participating in broad-spectrum social and institutional reinvestment that was much deeper than what the neocons ever intended for Iraq.

I think this is....a bit unfair.  There was a genuine effort, at all levels (not by all PEOPLE, but at all levels) to build the nation.  

First- I think a lot of what might be construed as malice is almost more an issue of SCALE.  We were trying to do the Marshall plan.  But Eisenhower had an army that had spent 4 years in the real shit- which makes armies efficient and lean and very effective at large scale endeavors.  You have an experienced chain of command AND low level commanders that can improvise and act semi-independently with confidence in their tested leaders. 

We had an army that hadn't had a real fight in 40 years. Our essential MO was 1.  Drop a shitton of stuff. 2.  Win.  3.  Champagne and medals all around!

So thats' what we did.  Pallets of cash! Shock and awe!  Hundreds of thousands of guys with every magical high tech resource anyone could want! 

Except we had no idea how to handle it in the long term.  Like a toddler driving a semi. We had no real regional experts, we had little to no institutional experience with hostile populations- and those we had never learned the lessons of Vietnam. We failed to realize the nature of the conflict, and we sent cornfed Iowa boys in.  Hard as nails, god bless them.   Tell them to go take Omaha beach and they'd do their grandfathers proud. But not public relations experts. 

And all of this is underpinned by 2. not. understanding. the. culture. 

Germans were Westerners.  Hell, you had Lutherans invading Germany.  At a very basic level, the taboos and shibboleths were the same. Not understanding that is what fucked us in Vietnam, and again in Iraq. 

Someone who comes from a history of tribal warfare and brutally complex internecine struggles is going to have a different view of the world than someone coming from a Eurocentric background of nationalist loyalty.  They aren't cowards, but they'll see fighting for Iraq the same way you or I would see ""Going to war for the New England Patriots.""  Not only do I not care that much, but they're not even MY TEAM, man!

We tried to go ""Hey!  Fight for Iraqi, you Iraqis!  Woo!  Iraq!""  To which most of them presumably thought ""who the fuck is an ""Iraqi""?

You could be a ba'athist, or a sunni or a shiite, or a Kurd or a Christian, but there was no such thing as an ""Iraqi"".  We failed to account for that.  And we failed to account for the idea that you can't build a school for ""Iraqis"" or a water system for ""Iraqis"" or put Iraqi security forces in charge of Iraqi security.  

It's like if we invaded Ulster, and set a bunch of guys named Pat and Mick and Sean to patrol the Shankhill Road because, hey, they're all IRISH, right? And then we build schools in West Belfast and tell everyone we're building Schools for the Irish.  

The funny part is when you put it that way, everyone gets it right away- but we can't figure that out in Iraq.

"***lolwut?***

What are the hell are you talking about? 

We were barely effected by this, loosing a little more than a fraction of a point while the others lost entire points. We basically  flinched *a little*, while currencies like the Euro &amp; Pound got hit hard, with the Yen taking a nice little hit as well. 

**Overall Share Loss/Individual Share Loss (*Portion of Basket*)**

* **Euro:** -6.47%/-17.2% *(30.93% of Basket)*

* **Pound Sterling:**  -3.21%/-28.4% *(8.09% of Basket)*

* **Japanese Yen:** -1.07%/-11.38% *(8.33% of Basket)*

* **United States Dollar:** -0.17%/-0.4% *(41.73% of Basket)*

Not to mention we're still the most internationally-held &amp; traded currency by like a mile compared to *everybody* else. lol

Also, about 30% of American debt is owned by government agencies, another 35.6% by American citizens and only 34.4% by foreign countries/citizens.

And out of that 34.4%, China only owns about 7% of it, and is neck-and-neck with Japan, a close American ally, who also owns around 7% of it. In fact, American allies &amp; neutral countries own *most* of American debt, with *""unfriendly""* countries, including China, only owning around 10% of American debt altogether. 

Plus, you're ignoring the fact that America has just become the largest producer of oil, has the largest financial market, the largest commodity market, the most arable land, the largest gold reserves, the most expansive infrastructure network, the largest output of scientific papers, the largest space agency, the 2nd largest industrial base &amp; is the third largest gold producer. 

And in context of the global economy, where Japan, Russia &amp; Brazil are in recession, where the European Union, Canada, Australia &amp; South Africa have stagnant growth, where Chinese growth is slowing, the United States &amp; United Kingdom are like the two brightest global economic spots right now, with the United States basically almost acting like the lone engine of international growth at the moment. 

The same idiots that believe that bullshit you sprout are also the same that think that fucking *Gaddafi* was going to be able to unilaterally unite the entire African continent into a economic union more integrated than the Eurozone and turn the entire international system on it's head by bringing back the gold standard, once again, single-handily *(lol)*. You know, which would of *totally* crippled the United States, which, as I mentioned above, is also now the largest producer of oil in the world, has the largest gold reserves &amp; is the third largest producer of gold. And he would've gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for those damned Brits &amp; Frenchies, who champion their respective Pound &amp; Euro respectfully, championing the initial intervention, which the United States was reluctant to get involved with really.

"&gt; I don't get how the other EU teams can outbid fnatic. 

What is happening now is that its getting popular to own a League team, there is a lot of new money flowing into LCS. These new organizations know that their best change is to throw a lot of money around and get a really strong lineup so they can quickly develop a fanbase. Organizations like C9, for instance, did this by dominating for 3 splits in a row, and performing well at 2 world championships. 

Fnatic, however, knows this is incredibly risky. For instance, if they gave Huni and RO the money the requested, but somehow don't win the spring split this year, it might have been a pretty big waste. Its better, its safer, to just hire some average players instead. 

Remember: the vast majority of sponorship money comes from attending LCS and getting into playoffs. Fnatic is the kind of team that can probably at least say 5th/6th place. They just had a very successful year and instead of doubling down, spending all their money retaining talent and trying to maintain something nobody though would even exist, they've decided to cut their loses, and try to conserve their money, go for the long haul. 

This team won't go anywhere, but in 2-3 years, Fnatic will have some good opportunities. Meanwhile, they will maintain their already rather large brand and enjoy the benefits of being in the LCS.

"""BasicIncome"" would clearly violate TISA, GATS and just about every FTA I can think of.

lets start here, its achange that occurs after the 1998 standstill, thats not towrds privatization and deregulation, so its forbidden by standstill, rollback, Banks would have to be compensated for all their **lost future profits** from loans, in advance..(Both TISA and GATS) If it has an adverse effect on profits, they will have to be compensated. (ISDS or ""indirect expropriation"" clauses are in all FTAs, basically) Its a step away from *""[progressive liberalisation](https://www.google.com/search?q=""progressive+liberalisation"")""* so it would be barred by the Standstill"" clause. (of GATS)

In their own words:

""In all of the relevant (WTO, EU, US) trade agreements there is an important carve-out for *services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority*. Following the GATS model, this is 
typically achieved through the definition of ‘services’: the agreement is said to apply to all 
measures affecting trade in ‘services’, but ‘services’ are defined as ‘any service in any sector *except services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority’*.  

Importantly, services provided by public entities only benefit from this carve-out to the extent that they supply ""services""  ***""neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers""***  (Thats crucially important)  So, the existence of banks means there cannot be services that replace them, just like the existence of private schools because of FTAs, prevents any new establishments of public education, similar issues limit the establishment of any new public healthcare. Its all countries like Canada can do to hold on tho their grandfathered system. If they charge any money for it at all, its done for. the process is designed to tear it apart.

So it goes without saying that given that it would have the effect of being a forbidden [bank size limit](https://www.citizen.org/documents/memo-gats-conflict-with-bank-size-limits-may-10-2011.pdf).

"Apart from the ticket prices that's a very narrow-minded view of the Premier League, it's almost become trendy to speak about the Premier League like this for some reason as is shown by the up-votes on what is a pretty ignorant comment. Like *you're* the connoisseur of European football. 

Were you watching as Harry Kane did a lap of honour with tears in his eyes as a full White Hart Lane stayed behind to cheer his name after scoring two against Arsenal to seal the win in his first North London derby?

How about a couple of weeks ago as a fully packed Stamford Bridge brought an emotional moment out of Jose Mourinho as they collectively sung his name in support despite being right down near the bottom of the Premier League in one of their worst starts to a season ever?

Calciopoli and the subsequent shittifying of Serie A killed a lot of the interest in Italian teams, unfortunately, but I'm sure that's true everywhere though. After that, the big EPL deals kicked in AND the MLS grew a lot. 

That might be the biggest factor I guess - the sport got more popular right when the EPL became super available to watch, finally.

"It's not that I have a problem with Jews having some sort of feeling of belonging to their group, but if Jewish is an ethnicity, then I suppose Christian or Indu is also an ethnicity, otherwise it doesn't make much sense. Jews don't all share ancestry, in fact less than 5% of them can claim ancestry from ancient Israel. They have no shared history since they have been living in different countries all over the world for centuries. The Jews of Germany certainly didn't go trhough the same historical events than American Jews who came before WWII. They don't share a homeland. Israel was created only a few decades ago and before that it was mostly Muslim. Most Jews come from Eastern Europe and not from Israel anyway. Also even for those who do have roots in Israel, their ancestors haven't lived there for millenias, except for a very small minority. They don't all speak Hebrew. In fact most don't. Only Israelite do but even then Arabs living in Israel also can speak Hebrew quite often so I'd say Israelite is more of an ethnicity than Jewish... Share rituals and religion... Meh ok... But that's not enough to call them an ethnic group. Are Buddhist an ethnic group because they share a religion? I don't think so. 

If other religious groups aren't considered ethnicities, I see no reason to make an exception for Jews. I know they claim to be an ethnic group and a lot of people buy into that... I just find it a little weird that it's the only religious group that is considered an ethnic group. Why do they always have to be different? In the end it's just a label. Are they a religious group or an ethnicity... It doesn't really matter... But realistically speaking, they don't fit the definition that well. While you say there are plenty of ethnic groups based on less, I'd say there are plenty of groups with much more common traits than Jews that aren't even considered ethnic groups.

"Just a minor point that people often miss; before La Grande Armee was drawn into a campaign in Russia,  Napoleon's forces captured virtually the whole of Europe.
Bonaparte is often seen as a villain, and I can't disagree, but one must take the politics of the time into consideration. 
At the time he seized power, the first republic was clawing its way out of the terror, and everyone feared that they would be a victim of a political mistake, men and women were sent to the public square for execution at an alarming rate for the smallest of treasons, and along comes Napoleon, he rides into the council chamber, fresh off of his victories in the Italian campaign, and in the Alps, A revered figure, and seizes power. 
So, First Consul Bonaparte creates a Republican expansionist agenda, one can hardly blame him, he's stopped the terror, freed the people of the nightmare of Robespierre, and instituted a new Republic, one of exciting new expansion and riches and glory for the common man. 
Bonaparte saved the revolution, and destroyed it in the same breath, but it should be noted that the largest part of the people of France were with him, no matter what. ",,1448949112,1,0,1,0,history,cxiurm3,t3_3uufsd,,old-fat-baboon,,t3_3uufsd,t5_2qh53,False,1451363945,False

"**WHAT IS THE CIV HYBRID GAME?!**

To put it simply, the CHG is a Civ AI game with humans in it! We're finally starting and you can check it out [here](http://imgur.com/a/CfC82/layout/horizontal#0)

**That seems like a Civ Human Game.**

It wouldn't be because IGE can only get us so far. We can't force the AI to commit units. We can force the AI into war, though. 

**So how does that work?**

The CivHybridGame will be played by the AI for some amount of turns. After that, an imgur album will be released and based on what happens, each coalition can then decide on some things to change about their civ. Each region has a team of humans that vote/dictate the actions they will do.
We had a trial run and made these [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/CivHybridGames/comments/3tw14n/coalition_choices_guide)

We will also have a Model World Congress similar to the CivModelWorldCongress. Representatives from each coalition can vote on global proposals that will affect everyone.

**Fine, what are the civs?**

They are 

* North America
* Central America
* Sou...

**Wait, why are they continents?**

First of all, these aren't continents. They are regions. And secondly, we did it this way to better represent everyone. We have a [city list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TgqyrRWSi5aIQ5MJ3GCRiACFIrD828_SSrh3MWkTB78/edit?usp=docslist_api) that encompasses the region. 

We also have a [list of leaders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snUdFS1XF_oUuSEbBaEvzjNZ6Ek2uYe6C_VV2iI_O5k) representing the region...

#LOL

**All of the North American leaders are U.S leaders! MURICA HAHAHAHA!**

Could you just stop interrupting me? Anyways, we had a [list of several leaders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snUdFS1XF_oUuSEbBaEvzjNZ6Ek2uYe6C_VV2iI_O5k) where we tried to represent every country in the region and then put it to vote. 

#HEY!

**Germany isn't Eastern Europe....!**

It's Central Europe. But that wasn't a viable region so we put it in East Europe to balance the content because we put Russia in North Asia. If you want to argue about the regions, we've already had plenty or discussions and arguments not just on /r/civHybridGames but also in previous announcemets. *Please just remember that the borders of these regions differ from person to person.*

**So, what are the regions?**

* [North America](https://www.reddit.com/r/OneTrueAmerica)
* [Central America](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlowerWar)
* [South America](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nazca_Lines)
* [Western Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/UEandtea)
* [Eastern Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oldfritz)
* [Middle East](https://www.reddit.com/r/theCradle)
* [North Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/PyramidPower)
* [Southern Africa](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeiaSafari)
* [Central Asia and India](https://www.reddit.com/r/Turban_Renewal)
* [Northern Asia](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteppeingStones)
* [Eastern Asia](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaiwanROCs)
* [Oceania](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ocehameha)

**Hey, idiot, you forgot North North America, Northern Europe, Central Europe, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, Oz and the Moon!**

We had ~~all~~ most of them in a poll where you guys voted and we can't put all these regions in. We tried to balance them out of the map.

**What is the map?**

Please look at Part 0 or at Part 1. We've tried to fix some issues with the geography, but it's not perfect. 

**There are city-states?**

Yes. They were put to balance things out. Hopefully, you understand why not every region got a CS. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivHybridGames/comments/3r13vo/the_map/cwk2jhf) a list

**Where can I get less sassy answers?**

Hey, you're being sassy. Um.. Let me see. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivHybridGames/comments/3mwsaf/heres_what_up_read_this_if_youre_new/) you go.

**Okay! where can I join?**

But we certainly don't have xtian government officials beheading people for apostasy and other imaginary offenses such as that do we. Yes, there are retards like Cruz and Huckabee, and Fiorina who act like they think there is some religious test for public office, but there is a big difference between Saudi Arabia and the United States and pretending there is any similarity in the ""religious governance"" realm is a joke. European countries are closer to Saudi Arabia than the U.S. simply by some of them having ""official"" state recognized religions. Yet, they are nowhere near Saudi Arabia either.

"&gt;No, I'm not on crack and I keenly follow this issue as this will be my contract from August.

Samesies

&gt;While I absolutely abhor Jeremy Hunt and his profound incompetence on this issue, I am merely saying that I am not at all convinced that my job outlook would be any better under Corbyn. Sure the contract fiasco would not happen, but if the NHS is chronically underfunded and the trust is doing everything it can to stay afloat my job will be profoundly miserable and unsafe under the current contract as well.

The trusts are underfunded. However I'm a big fan of preferring incompetence to malice. Hunt has admitted he wants to break down the NHS in writing whilst Osborne just tends to make up his economics on the go. I'm sure Balls and Burnham whilst both capable of cock ups wouldn't go into it as dishonestly if Milliband has snuck a win. God knows how Corbyn would do, he needs a year to iron everything out before we see how his party would work as at the minute labour is a shit show.

&gt;Anyway, this is just my anonymous and super frank opinion. I am in the mid-term very much making sure that my career can move to a different country if I want it to. I am not entirely convinced that the NHS is likely to be funded to at least EU levels of GDP spending, either in the short-, mid- or even long-term.

Every young doctor is. The truth is Britain is currently in idealogically driven austerity and that means the NHS is not going to be funded. I can't feel that under Corbyn we'd see ideological austerity but again, his government has been that much of a shit show its hard to say

&gt;Finally, I also think the public is largely unaware of how much Blair transformed the country and enabled them to access amazing healthcare. He really doesn't get the credit he deserves on this issue.

He deserves credit for some things but he created a lot of short sighted policies that have done more harm than good (A/E targets, PFI)

All in all its ridiculous to take this back to labour. This country voted in a party that would sell their grandmothers if it got them in bed with a nice cushty job after parliament and are going to reap what they've sown.

All constitutional rights are a constant compromise between interests, and different societies place different value on each of the effects of these rights. Having more freedom TO does not automatically that it is measurably better than having freedom FROM something.

Put another way: Imagine religious groups were starting to sit down in classrooms and started interrupting the educational process. Imagine fundamental Christians along with Jihadists were free to enter the classroom and indoctrinate whoever they had in front of them. Surely having this right is something positive, after all it prevents the government from regulating speech, right? Surely the freedom of the children to have an education that is free from these forms of indoctrination is of secondary importance. 

Is the right of a multi billion dollar company to pump as much money into the political process more important than my right to be represented fairly by that process and have them NOT interfere? 

All of these questions are subjective, and different societies find different answers to those questions. I personally do believe that Europeans should grow a thicker skin when it comes to many things, but that does not mean I buy into the American interpretation of positive freedom all the way. It's subjective, an opinion, a compromise. ",,1448959941,4,0,4,0,news,cxiy9t6,t3_3uxvk1,,leckertuetensuppe,,t1_cxiwcdn,t5_2qh3l,False,1451365608,False

North America was part of Laurasia aswell, while Europe was part of Godswana. As a result Scotland also has very different fossiles than the rest of Europe.

"You're saying ""prohibited from diversification of economics"" as if it's something that can be done with a click of your fingers, and only personal preference of the leaders stops it from becoming true.

Russian tech base for consumer goods was in the shitter and cost a ton. Just look at AvtoVAZ, it took 20 years of government subsidies and foreign investments (and licenses) for them to start making cars that at least look decent - there's no way in hell our car industry are competitive with German, Japanese or even Korean industry. And the same is true with other industrial bases.

In an open economy, you have to keep the competitive edge, and it takes time, huge investments, and lack of opportunities in other fields. Service was almost non-existent in USSR, so that was a place for a huge margin of profit; it's way easier, cheaper, more profitable  and faster to open a dozen of restaurants or barbers' shops than a small plant. Same is true on the country level - why pour billions of cash in the failed industrial sector when you can funnel it into other areas that will give more bang for its buck?

Corruption didn't help, of course. But it's not like eliminating corruption is a requirement for the prosperous economy. While Europe does it to a certain degree, both USA and China (top 2 economies in the world) are corrupt as fk - USA has the corruption on the high level, while China has it on all levels, so even different styles of corruption don't prohibit from having a huge economy.

"&gt; 'Hey niggerfaggot, whoops, called you a niggerfaggot, oh well, you can't fire me for some alleged shit-talking in this country, ahahahaha!""

Work place law covers just that, the work place. If you were to say this in the workplace you absolutely can get repercussed, which in this case would most likely be documented through formal warning. To fire someone legitimately the reasons need to be provable if contested. For instance, lets say I fire an employee for poor performance, I'd need to back this up. These are usually done though annual/monthly/sometimes spontaneous performance reviews. Or if we use your case and someone was using racial slurs, this also needs to be legally proven (this is why formal warnings are adopted in a lot of places). Lets take it one step further and I claim a receptionist position is redundant just to get rid of them, as a company I cannot employ another receptionist until a certain time period has passed as the company has claimed the position was redundant.

Now, if I was to act generally stupid outside of work this has no legal ground for termination because it has nothing to do with the work place or company (aside from some extreme circumstances, like being a fugitive or something).

There is one exception to this here and that is casual contracts. Here you don't get the law designated sick leave and annual leave (full time employees in general are entitled to 8 paid sick days a year and 4 weeks paid annual leave a year), but you earn a higher hourly rate than full/part time to make up for it (An example of this, a call centre employee may make 24/25ish an hour, where as the casual equivalent could be somewhere around the 28/29 an hour) The downside (goodside to some?) to this that both the employee or employer can end the work contract whenever they want. There is also no set hours for casual work, usually.

This is at least how it works in my country, and I'm pretty sure it's similar in parts of Europe.",,1448967120,1,0,1,0,news,cxizw9b,t3_3uxvk1,,[deleted],,t1_cxizqk8,t5_2qh3l,1448967897,1451366373,False

"&gt; lol...no you haven't. If you have its the extreme exception. Please. Ive been to hundreds and hundreds of sporting events and have yet to see anyone cry at the anthem. Its a formality at this point. You're just spouting ridiculous BS but don't worry...this is reddit and ppl here eat stupid shit about America up like its apple pie.

I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. The whole ""thank you for your service"" line is something I have observed on multiple occasions, in person, online and in the media. It is absolutely a thing and a cloying one at that.

American exceptionalism likewise exists at various levels and is particuarly rife within United States media and the political system. And given that many of those politicians formulate the nation's policy I don't think it's unreasonable to call that out. 

With regards to crying during the national anthem as I said in my previous comment, it's not something I've seen personally, but if you look downthread there was someone who lived in the south who said it was not uncommon. I've seen media coverage of it happening at various international events that didn't involve the US, football for certain. This was athletes mind, not the crowd.

&gt;  I just came back from DC, and one thing I will say that **many** Americans are guilty of is being overly patriotic. Obnoxious levels of patriotic. Things like weeping at national anthems, the grating ""thank you for your service"", the genuine belief in American exceptionalism, the misplaced trust in the American dream etc.

&gt; Still, though, **most** of you are super nice, warm, culturally sensitive and aware, welcoming, hard working and talented.

As I said, many only means a large number, not a majority. Most does, which was how CHE broke it down. The most recent poll I could find was done by Pew, and it has the breakdown [here.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/02/most-americans-think-the-u-s-is-great-but-fewer-say-its-the-greatest/) 28% was the number given in 2014, which I think would be fair to consider many, but not most.

"&gt;Pardon me, the term racism was heavily popularised and utilised by Trotsky in his Russian and French writings, but indeed, you're correct; Trotsky didn't invent the term, as some other communist already beat him to it in 1902.

Racism comes from Racialism which borrows from ethnic nationalism as well as the older class race definitions (which indeed are the base for Marxism/Communism).

&gt;Either way, the term 'racism' is a politically loaded leftist ideologue term that has no place in proper nor polite discussion.

bullshit. The term racism describes the political ideology of the existence of distince race bound characteristics in a political context.

&gt;Who is the one defining this as thinking ""races are somehow worth less""? That sounds like a pejorative made by someone in political opposition to the sort of people who'd have these kind of ideas.

Seriously?

e.g. Kipling 
*Take up the White Man's burden And reap his old reward:
  The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard—
The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah, slowly!) toward the light:—
  ""Why brought he us from bondage, Our loved Egyptian night?""*

or as an easy example: The ""kleine Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes"" (German but well, some sort of standard for racism in the third reich)

&gt;I promise you, not since the mid 1960s has anyone actually cared if anyone else is a Communist; It shows a sign of immaturity and naivety I think, but it won't get you ""named and shamed"", and the Communist Control Act is almost a Blue Law at this point.

You cared, just now because you argued against the usage of the term 'racism' only on the base that Trotsky was a communist..

"&gt; 800000 is the lowest estimate, as mentioned in your source.

&gt; As for the third source, obviously it's not going to be a million, as you mention it yourself that figure is for the first time applicants in that three months.

Sure, but it's about *dozens* per country. Even times four that still doesn't adds up to anything remarkable.

&gt;Also keep in mind that only a fraction take advantage of the refugee system, most of them integrate and seek employment as soon as they can, unlike the Syrians. That's the advantage when you don't ""flee"" half a continent away through several safe countries, and instead take refuge in geographically and culturally close nations.

Data please, properly corrected for education level, job experience etc.

&gt;And again, you are doing us no favors by taking in masses of immigrants from half a world away.

The distance between Syria and the EU is about 100 km. Estland is as far from Syria as from Portugal or Ireland.

&gt; In fact, thanks to this insane policy the transit countries are completely overwhelmed. Instead of support, what we got is demonisation for trying to protect our and Schengen's borders.

I completely support a joint EU policy on border management, including border protection and lower and upper limit on the number of people to accept. Right now it's everyone for themselves and that just results, predictably, in trying to shove off problems to each other - which, just as predictably, ends with everyone just having more problems than necessary.

&gt;As for Russia, it seems like the EU ""helps"" us whether we like it or not.

I guess now you can ""help"" us more selling your gas and electricity instead.

Ask Ukraine what it's like to be exclusively dependent on Russia for energy. No matter how you slice it, being part of a union gives you more bargaining power.

"Eu não sou nenhum especialista em segurança e nem sei o que seria mais recomendado.  
  
Mas, se eu estivesse no seu caso tentaria me mudar mesmo. Infelizmente. Até que isso aconteça, é uma excelente ideia conversar com os outros moradores e falar com a imobiliária ou proprietário para tomarem medidas de segurança (equipamentos, reforçar fechaduras, contratar vigia). Você fazer isso por conta própria (tipo instalar fechaduras extras ou alarmes) pode ser que a imobiliária questione quando você for devolver as chaves. Além do mais, fazer esse tipo de instalação é responsabilidade deles.  
  
Você pode também alertar as casas e prédios vizinhos. De repente,eles mesmos ficam mais alertas e tem mais chances de ligarem pra polícia se virem algo suspeito acontecendo na rua ou mesmo nas kitnets aí.  
  
Com relação à PM, quando achar que tem gente te perseguindo ou aparecer esse pessoal com perguntas suspeitas liga pro 190! Mesmo que os caras falem que ""não tem muito o que fazer"", melhor você ligar e contar tudo (o roubo anterior, os caras perguntando, etc) do que depois ficar se perguntando ""e se eu tivesse avisado a polícia antes?""
*Teoricamente*, eles tem o policiamento ostensivo que atua na prevenção de crimes, então deveriam enviar viaturas e fazer patrulha lá se essas coisas estão acontecendo...    
  
E toma cuidado com esse pensamento de dar tiro pela porta e sair com tesoura na cintura. Muitas vezes os caras não estão muito lúcidos ou não tem nada a perder mesmo. Concordo com o que o /u/zorksays disse: sua vida vale mais que vídeo game, TV e dinheiro. É uma merda ter seus pertences roubados, mas entrar numa briga com faca contra quem pode estar com um revólver e fora de si é muito arriscado e você coloca muita coisa a perder aí.  
  
E pior de tudo, esse tipo de roubo e invasão é relativamente comum em locais e bairros que tem concentração de estudantes. Eu já morei em vários bairros que tinha muito estudante de faculdade morando em kitnets e repúblicas e em todos esses bairros os roubos, furtos e invasões eram cada vez mais frequentes...

"This seems like a very fair complaint. I don't know what the SNP's agenda is here. Are they just desperate to prove to EU leaders that they will follow the rules and be a class pet? Or is there a real legal problem which they aren't being articulate in explaining? 

The ferry service I rely upon used to be run by p&amp;o, but was put to tender in 1999, and was won by Northlink Ferries, which was a joint venture by Calmac and RBS, so it was part publicly owned. But that company defaulted on its contract in 2005, and the new tender was won by Calmac alone, but maintained the same Northlink branding and ships. It was then put to tender again around 2011, and it was won by Serco, who are a private company, but who also retained the Northlink brand. 

In my experience, the ferry was at its best when it was publicly owned. Since privatisation of the route, we have, for example, seen the number of crossings reduced. But of course those which are favourable to hauliers are maintained, since they are more profitable, meaning that, for half the year, if you want to get off the island before noon, you have to be in the ferry queue by 5:30am... We have also seen the quality of the food and canteen service go down significantly. We have seen the introduction of a first class lounge, which you pay an extra £10 for, so that you don't have to sit with the plebs. Every decision has been, unsurprisingly, short sighted and driven by profit motive alone. The service has suffered.

Meanwhile, we are subsidising this company to the tune of millions of pounds, and the Scottish govt increased the subsidy to sweaten the deal for Serco, because a private competitor is running a cheaper ferry, with more sailings and a quicker crossing time..",,1448971728,10,0,10,0,Scotland,cxj10ps,t3_3uzehs,Professor Buttocks,JohnnyButtocks,,t3_3uzehs,t5_2qkli,False,1451366903,False

"Um... lets count how many imports have gone to Worlds through NALCS and EULCS since Season 3 (when the imports started).

Season 3:

1st Cloud 9 (All NA)

2nd TSM (All NA)

3rd Vulcan (All NA)

Season 4:

1st TSM (2/5 NA, 2/5 EU, 1/5 KR)

2nd C9 (All NA)

3rd LMQ (All CN)

Season 5:

1st CLG (All NA)

2nd TSM (2/5 NA, 2/5 EU, 1/5 KR)

3rd C9 (4/5 NA)

So in total we have 33 NA, 5 EU, 2 KR.

Yes, NA gets a lot of imports, but most of them never amount to anything unless they are on a team that is already winning regardless (C9, TSM) any others just end up being forgotten and lost, all like 20 of them.

So 1 KR player, and 4 EU players out of 20 imports isn't really that great, so, imports in NA have a 20% chance of actually doing anything.

For EU, they've had 3 imports, and all 3 have gone to worlds. 3 imports vs 5 imports actually going to worlds.

"Det er jo et valg mellem pest og kolera og det fundamentale problem ligger i at EU parlamentet ikke har beføjelser nok (og at det desuden mangler legitimitet og har lidt under en slem lobbyistisk kultur i alt for længe (selv DF kunne ikke afsige sig fristelserne).

Hvis vi ligger det til side mener jeg at valget der står tilbage er mellem opgivelse af suverænitet eller medindflydelse i EU. Der vil jeg klart vælge den sidste, da jeg som man kunne gætte mener at de nationale parlamenter kan indfases og gravist integreres i EU-parlamentet, hvis altså de nødvendige reformer bliver vedtaget. 

Og hvordan sker det? Ved at nogen der har noget at skulle have sagt råber op omkring problemerne og presser på for at finde en løsning sammen med de andre aktører. Det kan kun gøres hvis vi er en samarbejdende del af EU, og ikke bare et tilskuende æresmedlem.

Europol? Det er vel en fin forordning, men ærligt talt ikke et så centralt punkt som nogle politikeres retorik prøver at gøre det til.

At some point they did get more efficient but the marketing kept large displacements desirable. 

In Europe and Asia the imperative was on small efficient cars and the smaller displacement higher efficiency engine was the way to go.

So here we are 70ish years later and we're finally seeing things normalize out. High horsepower roughly 2 to 3 liter (litre) turbo engines are being made by most manufactures to satisfy most needs.

&gt; From the long-term perspective of social history, we know that economic prosperity and lasting economic growth is a very recent achievement for humanity.

&gt; Until the year 1000, everyone was equally poor but we learn that as early as the year 1500 Western Europe had achieved some very limited economic prosperity; until the early 19th century the region could slowly increase the economic wealth.

&gt; Data on economic growth is now routinely published by statistical offices, but researchers have had to reconstruct accounts of the economic productivity for the past.

You clearly did not present evidence, as you didn't provide any links. You may have posted links elsewhere on this page, but not in our conversation. You edited one of your earlier posts to include two links, so that brings us to a total of 3 links. I'll address those one by one. 

&gt;Global Colorism in Bio-Ethics

Colorism isn't exactly racism; it's a form of discriminatory behaviour between people within the same race. No, it's not 'blamed on the victims' the article is merely suggesting that people who may the the victim of racism or colorism may also be racists or colorists themselves. There's no victim blaming in that. If say, a black person has been discriminated against by a racist white person, and then that black person goes on to say ""All white people are racists"" that still makes the black person a racist. Victimhood is irrelevant as two wrongs don't make a right. 

&gt;Pre-European Contact Colorism and Post-colonial Racism in Asia and North Africa

This article doesn't prove anything. All it does, is make assertions based on 3 sources. All these sources prove, is that the idea of 'beauty' has evolved through the ages. There's no doubt Europeans have likely had some influence, as a couple of centuries of occupation will do that, but it doesn't prove Europeans are solely responsible and it certainly doesn't prove racism today. 

&gt;Black Britons face a double whammy – failed race relations law, now budget cuts 

Budget cuts hurt the poor, unfortunately, minorities are overrepresented amongst the poor, but budget cuts themselves aren't racist. Now I'm not going to deny racism exists, and this article seems to be relatively well sourced. However, there's a big distinction to make here: the fact that racist people exist, and will likely continue to exist, doesn't mean there is a European White Supremacy. That's a huge leap to make, and frankly, I just don't see the evidence for that. In addition, this article concerns Great Britain only, and British problems cannot simply be extrapolated to Europe in its entirety. In many ways, Great Britain is very, very different from the rest of Europe, and even countries on the mainland all have different problems and challenges to face. 

I'm not apologizing for racism. Racism is bad, since it doesn't help anyone and is usually counterproductive. However, I still have to see solid evidence of institutional racism throughout Europe, let alone a prevailing notion of white supremacy in Europe.

&gt; Jerusalem - A Russian warplane recently entered Israeli-controlled airspace from Syria but the intrusion was resolved without incident, Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said on Sunday.

&gt; &amp;quot;There was a slight intrusion a mile deep by a Russian plane from Syria into our airspace, but it was immediately resolved and the Russian plane returned towards Syria,&amp;quot; Yaalon told public radio.

&gt; Israel has reportedly launched more than a dozen air strikes in Syria since 2013, mainly targeting alleged arms transfers to Hezbollah, and Israeli officials were believed to have feared that Russia&amp;#039;s intervention could limit their room for manoeuvre.

&gt; His wish for the UK to join the expanded coalition in Syria looks set to be granted after Jeremy Corbyn was forced to give Labour MPs a free vote in the face of a threatened revolt during a stormy meeting of the shadow cabinet.

&gt; Labour sources suggested that 43 per cent of Labour MPs - almost 100 out of the party&amp;#039;s tally of 231 - supported air strikes in Syria, although it was unclear how many will vote with the Government.

&gt; The vote is scheduled to take place at 10pm, when it is expected that Tories opposing intervention will not outweigh dozens of Labour MPs who could use their free vote to support the Government.

"Generally it is believed (especially by British historians) that one of the major reasons that the League of Nations failed was that it did not have its own army, like the United Nations does today. It is believed that without this there was no true negative impacts for countries that broke international laws and treaties. When it comes to achievements and failures this is very dependant on who is asked. Many feel that Abyssinia was the major failure (http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/italy-1900-to-1939/abyssinia/), however others argue that this was an attempt to keep the peace, and not throw the world back into another world war. There was another failure in the form of the Manchurian crises (http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/ir1/manchuriarev1.shtml) which was largely ignored by Western countries, due to its distance and lack of links to the area. There were no sanctions the League of nations could put into effect except for trade sanctions, however if these were ignored there was little they could do. The achievements included Aaland Islands dispute between Finland and Sweden also the Greek attack on Bulgaria in 1925, unfortunately I do not know about this in detail. There was also a lack of countries involved in the league of nations, most pronounced of these was the US who although it was one of Woodrow Wilsons 14 points, did not join, and without the power bought in by the US at the time it always seemed deemed to fail as Europe was in a very poor position after the first world war.

"&gt;The recovery was in full swing before these factors came into play, they've certainly helped keep it going but they're not the only factors.

"&gt; doing us a favor

Well for one, your electricity could be lower for a while - although not in the longer term. The investments + their ""nuclear tax"" they stated there would otherwise have gone straight to your bill. It's not them paying the taxes - it's YOU - using the nuclear energy they produce.

They should have been investing in actual real solutions to our energy problem all along. Placing a few wind-mills here and there is not going to solve that - you'd need a good amount of those to cover a fraction of our power consumption, and it's not a reliable 24/7 source. Instead they're just silently burning more and more coal, which spews out a lot more radioactivity than a nuclear generator ever would - also contributing to our CO2 emissions.

The problem imho is the entire 'anti-nuclear' sentiment that has plagued the energy market for the last 30 years since Chernobyl and was enforced by the more recent Fukushima disaster. I'm all for ""alternative energy"", but the problem is exactly what it's name implies: alternative. It's not (yet) feasible to rely on it completely, and most likely we'll never be able to. Sure, use solar where it's efficient (read: not in Belgium, but Spain has a few interesting projects going on), and wind is possible on small scale, but don't act as if that has no impact at all on the environment.

Development of nuclear energy however has grinded to a halt, and talking about possibly opening new reactors is a big taboo here in Europe. We still use reactors that run on expensive by-products of producing nuclear weapons, of which only 5% is burned on a good day, and where all safety mechanisms are active (meaning they need active intervention - if nothing happens: everything fails). In the people's perception, this seems to be the only option when it comes to nuclear energy, with all it's preconceptions and prejudices. There are however other ways of doing nuclear energy, like thorium, which is suitable for energy production but not for creating weapons (the US built a working reactor in the 70's), can have passive safety (if something fails, everything stops automatically), and burn almost all it's fuel and you can burn waste that was produced until now by 'conventional' reactors. The Chinese are building some at the moment - but even proposing that here? A big no go... Although the US military had a working thorium reactor in the 70's - the technology still in it's infancy - but funding ""nuclear research"" or building test reactors? Oh no!. But even if we had this technology ready right now and a design to build a nuclear reactor - this would still take 15 to 20 years to build - so that's no short term solution, even if it was considered.

In short: we're screwed. It all goes back to the the late 80's and '90's when investments that should have been done in nuclear energy were scrapped, with no alternatives - and right now, we're paying the price. Yes we have old reactors, but nobody ever thought of actually replacing them with something feasible - and as a result, energy prices are going to go up and up, and there's little you'll be able to do.",,1448980142,7,0,7,0,belgium,cxj43lu,t3_3uzd29,Flanders,koffiezet,011,t1_cxj0jhs,t5_2qhe6,False,1451368354,False

"How I did it:

Per the images you are able to get a general idea of how i did it. The start is very important as the longer it takes to snowball the more time it takes in the end. I restarted till I had a level 1 theologian, siak desired pagayungs provinces and bahmanis had a shitty political sitch.

Stab up to 1, enact the decision. Vassalize siak and I'm meaty dow pagarayung so siak can't revolt. Feed siak the sunni province and take the 2 therevada provinces. Convert to therevada, ally ayutaya. Claim up pasai and take the western coast (make sure you take lamurai) while giving siak the eastern coast. Stab up to +1 before peacing out pasai. Humiliate pasai for pp. If ayutaya didn't join against pasai use them against Malacca with your troops already in ayutaya. Humilate and feed siak up to 99 dev. Start annexing him whenever you can.

Lamurai should give you coring rang e for ceylon, take his lands.

Take enough Hindu provinces to convert to Hindu, should be 4-5. If jafna is still up you can take jafna and defend the straight in the jungle. The hindu minors should give you enough provinces to convert. Once you are hindu you should be able to get an ally or two to help you out, depending on the political situation in India this will be different. It should be about 1470 as a hindu nation with 

Make your way up the west coast of India, towards sind's starting location.  If hormuz happens to be take by Oman you won't need exploration to continue, otherwise rush that. Go through Oman, Yemen, hejaz, and medri Bahri. This will allow you to core mamlukian land, get a port on the medeteranian. Easiest done with there western land. With quest for the new world and a core on the Mediterranean you can explore all the way around Africa with no attrition. Explore as much waters as you can in the medeteranian. As you expand to sunni land try to concert to sunni, it's very nice and stable for westernizing.

Now you need to find who to westernize off of. Most times it was the papal states, but they could have god tier alliance structures. Look for a weak nation that is 7 techs ahead and try to westernize, with your size it'll take 3200 points to westernize and 15 points per month. So it'll take about 18 years at max monarch point usage.

Once you have finished your exploring (don't worry about the new world) drop exploration and take admin ideas, the cringy reduction will help out a bunch, you should also have a 2nd idea group so take influence to help with vassals in India/Asia (note once you are western you can't take new bad tech vassals, so get 3-4 small ones)

Now begins the hard part. The invasion of Europe, try to open three fronts, through Russia, Iberia and Italy. I took the baleris from Tunis,  Rome from the papacy, and most of Crimea.

Once I took the baleris I declared on Spain and took as much as I could without incurring a coalition (ae is very important here). I took land from slain/portugal and once they were small I took their colonial nations. On the other side I was plowing through Russia, Scandinavia and Lithuania. Creating a pinser on te hre. With common sense enabled you want to take out as many hre minors before there provinces hit 50 dev. So start dismantling the hre, sieging Austria is a pain in the half. For now leave the rest of Asia alone and solely focus on europe, except feeding kazan.

Once dip 23 is hit, drop religious and take humanist. You can now client state Asia,  and keep coring europe, try to stay at 90+oe. 

Remember colonies don't cost oe, so I've a country has bee  exiled, just let it grow you can take them out in the end.

"&gt;1. It was a historic resolution that expressed the then-prevailing view of most of the major states of the United Nations, which voted in favor of it. 

&gt;2. It established the principle of two states for two peoples. 

&gt;3. It recognized the uniqueness of Jerusalem and the Jewish people’s bond to the city. 

&gt;4. Had the Arabs agreed to live with the resolution as the Israelis did, despite its drawbacks from the standpoint of both sides, we would be in a different situation today with far fewer bereaved families on both sides. 

&gt;5. Because of the Arabs’ rejection of it and in light of their decision to fight its implementation, the resolution has not assumed any validity except for the historical symbolism of its basic content.

&gt;6. The significance of its nonimplementation is that all the previously existing historical and legal rights as recognized by the Balfour Declaration, the Palestine Mandate, and the San Remo Resolution have remained in force. 

&gt;7. From that time to the present, negotiation mechanisms prescribed by Resolution 242 (1967), the Camp David accords (1979), and the Oslo agreements (1993-1999) have not been completed and no solution has been agreed upon. 

&gt;8. Therefore, all the claims about Israel’s rights (and also, of course, about the Arabs’ rights) are still valid and remain unchanged until agreement on a permanent settlement is reached.

"As a player I would find the difference between 'chief' and 'chieftain' very confusing, since they are essentially the same word. Are you perhaps referencing the Highland [chief/chieftain](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chieftain&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) difference? For example, if two Chieftains were discussing their father's death and who would inherit they might have the following conversation: 

Son 1: ""Who will inherit the Chieftaincy?"" (meaning the title of Chief) 

Son 2: ""Well Dave is the most powerful Chieftain, so probably him"" (meaning ducal Chieftaincy) 

Son 1: ""I hear his wife will inherit the River Valley Chieftaincy. That would make them a powerful coupl"" (meaning ducal Chieftancy)

So I would say first off, change the highest title to something more glorious. Chief-of-Chiefs (a la [Khagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khagan)), or even just High Chief. 

For lower titles you're right. Knight, baron et al don't sound right, because we don't associate the noble culture of Europe with Orcs. The etymology of those words, though, is useful. [""Knight""](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=knight&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) means military follower. [""Baron""](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=baron&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) means free man. [""Count""](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=count&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) means attendant, and was the term for a Roman provincial governor. [""Earl""](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earl&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) means a brave man, or military leader.

I would do one of three things. Either bastardize the titles that the local, conquered population would have used into more Orcish sound words, i.e. Baron becomes Bern, Count becomes Cown or Cowt (that's a dangerous one though!). Or I would translate Orcish words based on the definition of the title. Using this website http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earl&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 (or anyone you like better) you could say a baron-level Orc is an ""Ofl."" Or find a real language that you think is Orcish sounding and use their titles or translated words. So if I think Esperanto is the Orciest language I've ever heard, and think that a Baron-level title should be translated as ""freeman"" than Orc Baron Tim would be call Liberulo Tim.

"Right off the bat, I think a couple mass graves and people starving in settlements and forced into slavery is plenty close enough to your ""manner similar to a drug cartel.""  

The brutal flaw in your logic is you think there's something special about Islam that its extremists turn into violent murderers.  It's putting the cart before the horse.  You want Christian brutality?  Look at what Liberians got up to ten years ago.  You want Hindu brutality?  Look at some of the institutional barbarism that exists within the caste system.  

What's going on in the Middle East is far more divorced from religion than your comment would suggest, and it's kind of easily proven.  How many times would Muslims have to bomb the US before our fundamentalist Christian population became more accepting of even greater violence to stop them, up to and including torture?  How many times would they have to attack us before 250,000 civilian deaths would become acceptable collateral damage?  

The answer is once, and we went after a country that had nothing to do with bombing us.  

Now, we've carved up their countries into nonsensical little portions, set up juntas and dictators without any concern to long-term politics, and for the past 15 years we've made one country a wasteland and, with Russia and China's help, supported numerous rebellions that have led to a region destabilized and, here's the important point, virtually void of sane people.  In Iraq, if you have any kind of skill, you've been gone for years.  Most of the Syrian engineers and doctors left a long time ago and already quietly set up shop in Europe and even in the U.S.    

Here's my basic point:  If the people were all Christian before this, the level of violence would be identical to what it is now, and they'd just be using all the fun passages of the bible that permit senseless murder instead of the Quran, because that's what people do.  

As a result, your point is trite and meaningless, accomplishes nothing towards understanding long-term solutions, and, at best, is a misguided, if not xenophobic and racist, world view.  At worst, that view is going to lead to a lot more dead parents with a lot more pissed-off kids hating the West, and that's just going to make things so much worse.

"This is kind of a fallacy when you actually look at the prior games. The main problem with your theory is just flat numbers, ie - the games sold better in the West, which is true, no doubt about that. 

HOWEVER, they were XBox/XBox 360 exclusives. The numbers, I hate to say it, kind of lie when you factor in just how absolutely unpopular those systems were in Japan. I think you would see a drastic difference in units sold if the game had been on a Playstation 2 or 3.

Even so, the last entry only sold 250,000 copies. That's not very impressive, and consider that the entire DOA franchise, as a whole, has been steadily less popular as time goes on. I dare say that they might be looking at the numbers of the last official fighting game entry, DOA 5, and seriously considering whether some niche off-shoot product is actually worth their time and effort to bring to the US and Europe.

I've been diamond for the past 2 seasons, in season 4 I went from gold to diamond within a few months, in the previous season I took it chill because I had real life obligations and a job I wanted to take seriously and just wanted a little break from the game.

- Chicks dig elo (the biggest lie ever told unless you're NA)
- Want to be a streamer (Was fun for a while but I don't want people watching me just because I'm high skill because then it puts you under pressure to perform well)

"Let’s look at the economy of the region of the Uzege, in Gard in the South of France in about the 13th century. 

This region had about 30 villages, each supporting a castle and a knight (*Seigneur*), with an average population of about 400 people. 
At the center of the region was the small city of Uzes. The city has 8,000 people today. Perhaps 5,000 in Medieval times? (6,150 in 1793).  So, the total population of the Uzege was about 17,000.

The country people were mostly farmers.  The agriculture of the area, then as now, was vines, olives, fruit, vegetables, grain, sheep and goats.  The villages produced both primary products, but also secondary products, such as wine, olive oil, cheese, charcoal, spun yarn, woven cloth.

The village economy might have supported a baker and a blacksmith, a few carpenters and masons, perhaps a potter (making Roman tiles for roofs, as well as pots), if there was good clay nearby, and a priest.

Not all villages had a mill, but many did.  The village might also have a wine press and olive press.

If there was a mill, the Seigneur generally owned it, and a Miller ran it.  The miller took a percentage of the flour as his fee, and paid a share to the owner as ‘rent’.  The Seigneur might also own the wine and olive press, and charge a portion of the production for the use.  (The villagers could press their own grapes by foot, but it was advantageous to use a basket press and pay, because the basket press will produce 15-20% more juice than foot pressing.)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_wine_press


The Seigneur, probably received a labor levy from the villagers (40 days was a traditional Medieval levy – but no record if this was the levy in the Uzege), and some portion of the villagers produce (the church traditionally got some portion as well).


In some places in Medieval Europe, feudal landowners had the right to run a court (and collect a percentage of court decreed fines).  Don’t know if Seigneurs in the Uzege had village courts.  There was a court in the city of Uzes.

There would have been a market in the city of Uzes, and villagers would have come in to the market to buy and sell and trade once a week. The market was probably run from booths or stalls or carts or wagons in the Place aux Herbes, much like it still is.

We know that the bishops of Uzes had the right to coin money, so there was probably some form of money economy, not just feudal barter, even as early as the 12th century.

The city was surrounded by a defensive wall (now gone and replaced by a road). Inside the city were three great defensive towers (still there), The Tour Bermonde (the keep of the Seigneurs de Uzes - first recorded in 1080 AD, who later became Lords, titled ""Viscounts"", ""Counts"" and then ""Dukes""), The Tour du Roi (built by the town guilds as a counter power to the Lords and the Bishop - later taken over by the Kings of France), and the Tour de l'Eveche (The tower of the bishop's palace).

There was a bishop of Uzes since at least 442 AD. There was a cathedral there in the 12th century. There are also several other churches.

In the center of town is the ""Place aux Herbes"" which is where the market was (and still is) held.

Buildings in the villages and the city were of stone, with Roman tiled roofs. 

The stone, lumber, and clay to build houses, barns, castles and churches was all to be found on the lands of most villages.

Domestic buildings in the villages were generally two stories.  In the city, most were typically three or four stories high. They frequently had a vaulted ground floor, used for workshops or storage or shops, with living quarters on the two or three upper floors. There were a mixture of apartment buildings, single family homes, and the city mansions of rich merchants or feudal knights from the surrounding countryside.

The main industry in the city, probably since the 12th century, was the manufacture of cloth. (People in the villages might weave rough homespun cloth, but finer cloth was produced by dedicated weavers in Uzes).  The city of Uzes was also a center of government, church, law courts and commerce for the surrounding area. The bishops had the right to mint coins in the 12th century, so there was a mint.

On the outskirts of the town were several large monasteries. The town was surrounded by the hunting preserve of the Lords of Uzes, and by farmlands and small villages, each with its own small castle.

Textiles was the largest industry, so many of the vaulted ground floors would have housed hand looms, or warehoused yarn or cloth. There were undoubtedly other workshops in the city as well. (Carpenters, Masons, Blacksmiths, Coopers, Dyers, Fullers, Tailors, Tanners, Leatherworkers, Cobblers, Cabinetmakers, etc.) There were also wine and produce merchants (Wine, flour, olive oil, were produced in the country villages - or the grain mills on suitable rivers. Lumber, quarried stone and clay tiles would also have been produced in the countryside but consumed in the city. One of the local villages, San Quentin de la Poterie, specialized in making pottery ware, which also would have been sold in Uzes), butchers and bakers.

These sorts of establishments would be run by a master craftsman, perhaps with some journeymen and apprentices, plus, of course, a large contingent of unskilled laborers, who moved things and carried things and worked for the merchants and skilled craftsmen.  

As an administrative center, there would have been clerks (who could read and write) and some lawyers. The Seigneurs of Uzes would have had a small group of men at arms. There would be a number of monks and nuns in the monasteries on the outskirts of the city. Also, the richer inhabitants would have supported a fair number of domestic servants. The very rich, such as the Lords of Uzes, or the Bishop, would have had some specialist retainers, huntsmen, falconers, grooms, chefs, perhaps some landless knights who served the lord.

There were metal workers, both working in the mint, but also casting or forging metal implements and weapons.

In short, in the 1200s in the Uzege, one would find an economy based on the countryside producing primary products and some secondary products, and the city producing finer secondary products and services.

"They often cover slightly different things. Additionally, companies knows that most people aren't aware of their rights. While technically you might be entitled to a certain thing, they are not going to go out of their way to advertise that if it is not in their interest.

First of all, what is covered by consumer law - In the EU, consumers are entitled to two years of consumer protection at minimum. Each country is then allowed to adjust that period, if it is in benefit to the customer. In practise, this means a country can extend the period of consumer protection, but not shorten it. In Belgium, for example, you are only granted the minimum term as set by the EU. In the Netherlands, on the other hand, the term is not limited by a certain number of years (but naturally, the chance you are going to be able to make a successful claim four years on is minimal)

Additionally, for the first six month period, all you need to do to claim consumer law, is prove to the seller that your device is not functioning properly. After six months, however, you must not only prove that it is no longer functioning properly, but also that this defect already existed upon receipt of the goods. (which often involves proving the materials used were not adequate)

Now warranties offered can also include additional services not covered the consumer law. For example, the company I worked for included additional software support in the warranty (software is never covered by consumer law, only hardware), as well additional pick-up services / swap services for people who purchased extended warranties. With warranties, depending on the seller, you often don't have to prove that the device was not working properly when received.

"One of the reasons socialism gets such a bad reputation is that wealth is redistributed by the government with the assumption that individuals and corporations won't do as good of a job as the government. Government does some stuff great and other stuff really badly.... Lets go into that later. Examples that we have in the United States where we have public and private options are public schools and public fire departments. Public schools are not great.. at all.. but they are extremely cheap and pretty effective considering private schools are usually far too expensive for most people (especially the poor) leaving the only other option: no education. In the united states we have public fire departments who serve everyone but it hasn't always been like that. In the not so distant past fire departments were really just a perk from your insurance company. Your house was served by a specific fire service and if you didn't pay, they didn't put out the fire. Or they did and they sent you an enormous bill. (That sounds like the American health insurance system, doesn't it?)

Now, to look at the European dictators. I think most of the big names in European dictators are actually fascist autocracies (Hitler, Mussolini). Russia, China, and all the ""RED"" countries were socialist on paper (ie, by title only) but were operated as dictatorships and/or autocracies. (ie, one super powerful person and a small cadre of powerful friends--Does that sound familiar at all?...).

Now, looking at Bernie's politics and proposed plans: Increase taxes on the rich to off-set education costs. Cap student loan interest at a more reasonable rate.. maybe something below the rate of buying a car! (PS, my student loan is 7%, my car loan is 1%... that seems backwards). Bernie is also for a strong separation of church and state, and an equitable society where the wealthiest, most successful help the poorest and least successful. Those ARE socialist programs and beliefs... but they aren't new to American society. He also promotes sex education, public health programs for women, and a smaller military. This is really the bit that pisses off ""conservative"" politics. In America ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"" mean many things to many people. Bernie is ""liberal"" in the social and economic senses. He promotes social causes like family leave for families with newborn children, and economic issues like increased taxes for the wealthy. Hillary Clinton is socially liberal but economically conservative because she promotes big businesses and nothing that could hurt current wealth distribution in America. Donald Trump is socially and economically conservative, to the point of being regressive. His social stances are against most social reforms since the early 1900s (birth control, women's rights, immigration) and his economic policies are about the same. He promotes the same [top-down trickle-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics) economics by Regan in the 1980s. Those policies are very pro-big-business which saw American economic growth in the 1980s but at the cost of the American middle class. While trickle down economics from the 1980s did increase GDP it also widened the wealth gap because the poor and middle class didn't see an increase in real earnings but they did see an increase in cost of living.",,1448989994,1,0,1,0,AskReddit,cxja1n7,t3_3v04s0,,EatMyBaconAndLikeIt,,t1_cxj6knw,t5_2qh1i,1448993911,1451371226,False

&gt;The ME was becoming increasingly European in the 1950s and 1960s.

Well, Syria is actually quite secular as compared to the other nations in the middle east. And yes, a lot of countries interfered then for the sole reason of ensuring access to oil deposits. Well, look where that has brought us. Does that mean we should meddle again now by supporting the rebels? No.

You mentioned that:
&gt;They'd like our help to eliminate both and then have elections for their own government... without our influence."" 

What exactly are you suggesting? That we let the war continue while we support the ""moderate"" (the term moderate is questionable by the way) rebels who'll probably push for a non-secular government once in power? Let more people die in the process?

My suggestion has been that we act as mediator between the Assad-led government and the rebels. Cooperate with them and build a mindset of political compromise in order to transition to a more democratic government. The Kurds seem on board as mentioned earlier in the article. Isn't that what democracy is about? We can't alienate the current government just for the sake of maintaining a high moral ground. We need to be practical.

Anyway, since it seems that we both won't budge on our opinions. Let's agree to disagree then. All the best in your endeavours. ",,1448990410,2,0,2,0,news,cxjac1s,t3_3uzmdy,,32622751,,t1_cxj7as8,t5_2qh3l,False,1451371362,False

"&gt; This statement , given the number of baseless ISDS cases suggest your head is now completely absorbed by the anal cavity it is stuck in

Heh. Baseless cases lose - admittedly, probably not from your perspective, since I think it's pretty clear you regard 100% of ISDS cases as baseless. 

Also, I seem to have annoyed you somehow. Or possibly you're just rude.

&gt;Because in this case they are irrelevant. If you write a law, but only apply it to foreign companies that is clearly discrimination. If you write a law and it applies to everyone it is not discrimination.

Again, I'd say this shows pretty clearly how the distinction between law and its application is not something you get (or, more ironically, get but aren't applying). A law does not have to be discriminatory in itself to be applied in a discriminatory way, and the distinction is both obvious and important.

Say a country made a law that said some minority couldn't sing in public. That's clearly a case where the law itself is discriminatory.

Now, say a country made a law that said nobody could sing in public. Clearly the law itself is not discriminatory. But let's say they only *apply* it to a particular minority - they don't prosecute anyone under the law except people from that minority.

That's a case where although the law itself is not discriminatory - on paper, it applies to everyone - its *application* is discriminatory.

In the Vattenfall Moorburg case, the requirements to comply with EU Directives were not properly applied either when Hamburg made the original deal with Vattenfall, nor when the Greens changed the deal, nor when Hamburg agreed to change them back. The issue in question was never the regulations themselves, but the application of them by Hamburg to the Moorburg plant. Vattenfall won their case because the regulations weren't properly applied - the decision taken by the Greens to change the conditions for Moorburg was a politically prompted one, not a legally required or proper one.

If the EU now win their case against Germany, the appropriate regulations will have to be properly applied to the Moorburg plant. If that makes Moorburg no longer viable, that's just tough for Vattenfall - there will be no ISDS case if the law is properly applied, and there would have been no case in the first place if it had been, either.",,1448991799,0,0,0,0,europe,cxjbay8,t3_3uz9ny,Ireland/EU,Bowgentle,IREL,t1_cxjaqgm,t5_2qh4j,1448994176,1451371819,False

"Hey,

Testimonialism is Curt Doolittle's system, and his Propertarianism is built off of it. Unfortunately, we're still waiting on his treatise, so for now his site must do. 

He writes using an Operationalist language akin to a computer programming language, so when you're confused about an unfamiliar or specific term, think of it like how a program might call on an object and follow links back. He's also a bit autistic, so think of his grammatical errors like missing semicolons.

http://www.propertarianism.com/2015/08/06/dear-newbies-welcome-to-the-revolution/

Some points, in my words:

* It is a continuation of the Right's historical arc. Assume the Left separated from the old order with the Enlightenment, followed Proudhon and the individualist anarchists (Tucker, Spooner). The modern left kept course into Progressivism and Marxism, and then into the New Left. The other branch (present AnCaps) split and followed the individualist anarchists. Classical liberalism followed, culminating in Mises, the Last Knight of Liberalism. From there we got Rothbard, who reincorporated some of the right and fallaciously created his deontological ethic rather than recognizing it as a malformed hybrid. Hoppe came next, moving right. Then Moldbug's neoreaction. Now Propertarianism, which completes the arc, reforming with the old order. 

* The alt-right is the political wing, and we're winning. We're either going fascist (unfortunately) or adopting Curt's system (perhaps modified). In my opinion, these are the only choices we have. The left will get crushed, along with AnCap. The European New Right (ENR) might be moving into basic nationalism, but the American (ANR) has potential to break in a more fruitful direction. Our main base for recruitment is the Middle American Radicals (MARs).

* Operationalism means speaking truthfully.

* Testimonialism is demanding operational truthfulness (testimony). /u/darchdolla is offering what I believe are strong criticisms on the ability of the system to be gamed, so watch when he discusses this with /u/of_ice_and_rock.

* Property-en-toto is anything people make investments in, to simplify. This includes things like reputation, goodwill, and even IP (which needs to be rethought as a subset).

* Commons (his quote) - Originally, meaning Land or resources belonging to or affecting the whole of a community. More articulately: any form of property to which members of a group share an interests, but where that interest is obtained by an unspecified membership in the group rather than by explicit possession of title. I use this term to refer to both physical property and normative commons. The problem with commons is that without shares, even un-tradable shares, the ownership of the commons cannot be protected from confiscation by various means including immigration, or political confiscation.

* Propertarianism is incorporating these concepts and an goal of suppressing free-riding and parasitism against property-en-toto. From there, we can create a high-trust society, a market for the social commons, and eliminate the state. This fulfills Rothbardianism, and I really wish he were around today to comment on it.

We see AnCap as part of our heritage, and the only way to preserve its legacy is by envisioning it as a ""theoretical construct."" So am I ""AnCap?"" I don't know. But I do know I'm working to fulfill it. Try searching my comments for some of these terms for more.

"I totally understand where you are coming from and for the most part i agree (having more historical accuracy and attention to detail), assuming that a large chunk of the Total War fanbase are history nerds, having a bigger scope and focus on portraying different factions properly and more historically accurate would be a a very welcome addition, regardless of the setting, not that they should focus on certain parts as Arabia only but all what the campaign map covers, wouldn't be easy of a task and would definitly require more resources.. but personally I would love to see this in future title and think it's a worthwhile investment, esspecially having it in a medieval setting even if I have to buy the game much more expensive or have it broken into multiple parts like the upcoming Warhammer. 

All in all what have been released as dlc in Attila could've been in the base game but would've required more time and money, therefore they follow this strategy to allow them more money to invest (from what i understood from their explanation) but honestly having celts with germanic or roman units is immerssion breaking, same goes for the Arab factions with Sassanid units or even saxons and viking forefathers.. so wouldn't mind at all if at least they cut some regions that are not rellevent to the Huns invasion and gave them more time to put them out properly then released them as expansions to the grand compaign a la Warhammer, which would result most likely in a more fleshed up content (to be released, even more than the empire of sand dlc) and have Europe in base game as it will be detailed in Age of Charlemagne or even better, plus all what matters most for that era.

Edit: not talking units fleshing up only, talking about revolutionasing the whole game, more into cultures, building and so on.. I really like how they are doing it for Warhammer and think the upcoming historical titles diserve that treatment too.

Edit 2: Also if you look at how well received the empire of sand dlc was only for bringing a couple of factions, some units and slightly modified mechanics and being a way more content rich then the weak dlc's received before it and sold at the same price as it you would realise what that whole penninsula would do with more detail, settlements and factions and units and how much the fanbase is startving for more quality content.. and money wise it would be more financialy beneficial as it will sell more expansive but deservingly.",,1448993438,2,0,2,0,totalwar,cxjcgg7,t3_3v0ijq,amurai,Mumei1,shogung,t3_3v0ijq,t5_2rq9c,1448995688,1451372362,False

&gt;The history of the United States of America can never be and will never be separated from the fact that the country was built on the backs of black slaves brought over against their will.

Interesting. Because history tells a different story, that the primary form of manual labor prior to the revolutionary war were indentured servants...and white.

&gt;The argument is that European settlers, overwhelmingly white, committed the original sins of racism in the United States. 

Horsecrap. The slave trade from africa BY LARGE went to other african nations and Caribbean islands. 

&gt;They instituted race-based slavery as the primary economic driver

For agricultural purposes primarily in southern states only. The industrial revolution occurring in the northern states was fueled by immigrant labor, not slave. 

&gt;and on the other hand engaged in systematic genocide of indigenous peoples. 

Would you like to blame whites for killing off the Japanese Shogunate system as well? Stick to one topic.

&gt;Given that, for the majority of this country's existence, White Christians of European descent (non-Italian/non-Irish) instituted systematic racism against everyone that wasn't them, it's not unfair to say that in the context of America, this racism is in reverse of what is typical. Hence the term Reverse Racism. 

No. You don't call a female manager refusing to hire male employees ""reverse sexist"". It's racism, plain and simple.

"The US hate is pretty recent and results from America's more recent involvement in the Middle East compared to the likes of Russia, England, or France. America actually had a fairly positive image in the Middle East after Woodrow Wilson and the Americans led the charge for national self-determination following World War I. As the British and French pulled out of the Middle East following World War II, the US took up their mantle and began to meddle much more, both for oil politics and for Cold War proxy reasons.

Other powers had a more dubious reputation. Ottoman citizens and policy makers were very much aware of British, French, Italian, and Russian designs on their territory. Those countries granted citizenship to people born in the Ottoman Empire that would otherwise have been Ottoman nationals. These people received many privileges on account of their European passports. All four of those countries repeatedly chipped away at Ottoman borders (France: Algeria and Tunisia, Britain: Cyprus, Russia: Balkans and Caucasus, Italy: Libya). Despite this, your average Middle East Citizen was probably not particularly ""Anti-Western."" 

European powers were extremely brutal to colonized Middle Eastern peoples. Before WWI, the Ottoman Empire could protect many Middle Eastern people within and outside of its borders. European powers would often be wary of mistreating people in former Ottoman territories, as the Ottomans could and did apply diplomatic pressure. The Europeans did not take this pressure lightly. In fact, one of the great fears of the British and French in 1914 was that their Muslim colonial peoples in Algeria and India would rise up to support the Ottomans after the Ottomans threw in with the Germans. After WWI, there was no ""Muslim European power"" like the Ottomans to try and protect Middle Eastern and North African peoples. the Turkish Republic turned inwards and became extremely disinterested in the fates of its former imperial holdings.

After WWI, the French, British, and Italians were free to pacify their new holdings, which were, in the Arab East, classified as ""mandates"" and not colonies. This designation supposedly meant they were more ""civilized"" peoples that were close to full membership in the world order than most colonized peoples, but the British and French ended up treating them like colonies. 

After WWI, those three powers tried to subdue insurgencies on the cheap. Combined with new technologies developed in WWI, this meant lots of bombings and sometimes chemical gassings of rebels. The French brutally put down the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925, indiscriminately shelling Damascus. In the 1930s the Italians ""pacified"" eastern Libya by bombing and gassing nomadic rebels, and eventually began putting them in concentration camps. The British decided Iraq was too far away from supply lines to rule with a full army of occupation, so they decided to run the mandate by ruthlessly bombing restive tribes and populations that wouldn't submit to the British authorities in Baghdad. Bombs were cheaper and resulted in far less British casualties than a full occupational army. 

In the end, European colonial rule in the Middle East was extremely brutal. This period (1920s-30s) is when the ""crusade"" discourse emerged. No one on either side (Christian or Muslim) particularly remembered the Crusades from the time they happened until European conquerors began showing up in the Levant. Europeans, particularly the French, partly saw themselves as renewing the Crusades' goal of bringing Enlightenment to the Holy Land. Muslim populations saw that rhetoric, and intellectuals started reminding Middle Eastern populations how awful the Crusades had been for Muslims. This rhetoric, combined with the brutality of the colonial regimes, created a lot of anger and what we now would call anti-Western sentiment. As mentioned earlier in my post, the US inherited a lot of this animus after they began being more active in the Middle East following the Anglo-French withdrawal following WW2. All of this is independent of the anger generated by the Israel/Palestine situation and the US's unconditional support for Israel.

So: The hate is older than US support for Israel, but not that much older. It most certainly does not go all the way back to the Crusades, even though those have become a popular topic since the 1920s. A lot of it is inherited from the anti-western sentiment generated by European colonial powers. Some good books are Makdisi's ""Faith Misplaced"" on US-Arab relations, Provence's ""Great Syrian Revolt"" on the French in Syria, and Lindqvist's ""Bomb the Savages"" is a great, quick read on the brutality of European powers in the Middle East post WW 1.",,1448995810,12,0,12,0,AskHistorians,cxje6oh,t3_3uz6yn,19th &amp; 20th c.

"Here's the strange part:

&gt;  Another inmate was stabbed after he refused to leave when it was discovered that he had a prior conviction for statutory rape -- he was 18 and the woman 16 -- and the victim later became his wife of 20 years.  There is little sympathy extended to such offenders by other inmates.

Assuming there are no other details being hidden: the ages being correct, no inappropriate pictures being taken of the 16 year old, no Mann Act violations (transporting a minor across state lines for sexual purposes), no money/cash payments/remuneration/etc...

I will say that this kind of relationship is not only not inherently problematic (two year age difference, younger person being 16), but it's *flat out legal* in most U.S. states! Same with Canada and almost all of Europe. **This should not be a problem!** Why on earth is this being made into an issue?
 
I think somebody should write a letter criticizing this prisoner. The prisoners should be sent letters saying that such statutory rape violations (which only occur in certain states anyway) should NOT be ""chomo"" shit.

Also this is a case for making prosecutions of 18 year olds who are with 16 year olds (with no other circumstances like what I mentioned) *untenable* and *unenforcable*, meaning digging up dirt on state prosecutors who pursue these cases to force them to lose their jobs. Having prosecutors mass-exposed as being corrupt/criminal themselves (even adultery is a crime in many U.S. states!) can provide the impetus to force ""Romeo and Juliet"" laws which make these relationships (younger being 16, older being 18) inherently legal. That way ""moral panic"" cannot be used to prevent reasonable reform, because the ""moral panickers"" are exposed as being dirty.",,1448996153,1,0,1,0,ageofconsent,cxjefts,t3_3v16xb,,lumloon,,t3_3v16xb,t5_2vi5m,1448998091,1451373366,False

"What's a racist? 
Let me tell you something. I'm in my mid twenties and for the past year I have been thinking more and more, and deeper and deeper, of the kind of world I want to live in. The kind of world I want to have a family in. And everything that goes against that not something I will tolerate or condone. Everything I do in my life is driven by that sentiment. 

Multiple races in an area have shown to decrease trust, increase crime, decrease community cohesion, etc. That sort of thing goes against what sort of society I want to live in. Add terrorism, mass pedophilia and rape gangs and that's all a big no no. 

Surely, there are some arabs and blacks that are decent, but that's not the point. They're decent despite the fact that they are arabs and blacks not because they are arabs and blacks. What the majority of arabs and black stand for is shit, this is why their countries are shit. What the majority of blacks and arabs think is good is shit, this is why their societies are shit. 

There is that meme that says that arabs are unhappy in all arab countries but they are happy in european countries so ofc the answer is to turn the european countries into their shit countries. It may be funny, but it is true. A country is not the dirt, it's the people. And when the people change, the country changes too. 

This isn't to say that white people are these wonderful angelic fairy people. But we can survive our less than stellar people in the proportions that they come in, but we can't survive the less than stellar people of other races too. 

So drive it home, if having the society I want to live in, a good, progressive (not in the SJW sense), developed , peaceful and truly tolerant and truly diverse (where it matters) society means that non-whites have to get out of my space, than that's that. 

To end on another note. If there were a race of blue people whom would be a considerable bonus to having in our society, I would have nothing against them.

That's a worse system and doesn't make much sense because how would a normal person with no devious intents be able to buy a weapon they want if they're spending is limited?

Yes those guns were illegally purchased, however the illegal arms trade will never end, making arms that are normally illegal much more easier to buy would just lead to similar if not worse situations than the Paris attacks.

"Well that's fair, but OP clearly picked the definition of Fascism that most closely related to the US. Not only that, the link says
&gt;Umberto Eco wrote from a modern-day standpoint about Fascism; He did not study the Fascism of Spain, Italy or Germany where this style of governing evolved in the 1930s prior to World War II: Those involved were Francisco Franco, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and more can be learned about fascism by reading on these people.

The very next definition has almost nothing in common with the current state of the US. Written in 1944, an era well-known for Fascism, John T. Flynn wrote the characteristics of Fascism were:

1) Anti-capitalist, but with capitalist features;

2) Economic demand management...

3) ...through budget deficits

4) Direct economic planning, reconciled with partial economic autonomy through corporatism;

5)Militarism and imperialism;

6) Suspension of rule of law.

TLDR: a guy who DID NOT LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF FASCISM finds a lot of parallels between Fascism and US culture, while people who lived through the actual rise of European Fascism found very little.

That to me is suspect.

"The idea that Soviet forces lacked initiative and were tactically rigid  falls over when compared with their actual performance verses the German's lauded focus on JNCO flexibility and training during WWII.
The viewpoint that the ""western armies"" are all about individual initiative and flexibility should result in cognitive dissonance when a lot of the flexibility is based on what is known as formalised Battle drills or IA (immediate actions), there are fixed forms to reacting to fire, to prosecuting a section/squad attack. fixed harbour setups, ban on using machine-guns in harbour until cleared by the platoon officer etc etc. It might be a good idea to read up US War Departments TM 30 – 430. that synthesised the understand of Soviet armies conduct in 44/45, this is the doctrine that would be used in a cold war got hot.

The Idea of fixed battle drills is based on the Prussian idea of everyone acting the same so you can as a officer or a NCO have less decisions to make during the stressful occurrence of actually being shot at, and as a officer you have a general idea of how units will react to external stimuli. It's why Prussian marching in parades and having german words like Halt even in english speaking armies occur.

Actual Soviet practice during their deep battle butcherings of German units in 44 and 45 tend to occur as thus for armoured units:  the standard formation is a kind of staggered column with the second element just right or left of the leading one, and the third off to the same side as far again.  The individual tank brigade will use this approach with its component tank companies or pairs of companies, and the whole corps will use it again with its brigades.

 

The first element of such an echelon attack heads for whatever looks like the weakest part of the enemy position - in antitank terms - and hits it as hard as it can, rapidly, no pausing for field recon.  The next in is reacting to whatever that first one experiences, but expects to wrap around one flank of whatever holds up the prior element and hit hard, again, from a slightly changing direction.  This combined hit, in rapid succession, is expected to destroy that blockage or shove it aside.  The third element following is expected to hit air, a hole made by the previous, and push straight into the interior of the enemy position and keep going.  If the others are checked, it is expected to drive clear around the enemy of the harder enemy position - it does not run onto the same enemy hit by the previous elements.  If the enemy line is long enough and strong enough to be neither flanked nor broken through by this process, well tough then.  Some other formation higher in the chain or two grids over is expected to have had better luck in the meantime.

 

There are of course minor adaptations possible in this formula.  If the lead element breaks clean through, the others shift slightly into its wake and just exploit - they don't hit any new portion of the enemy's line.  If the first hit a position that is clearly strong as well as reasonably wide, the other two elements may pivot outward looking for an open flank instead of the second hitting right where the first did, just from a different angle.  The leading element can pull up short and just screen the frontage if they encounter strong enemy armor.  Then the second still tries to find an open flank, but the third might slide into reserve between and behind the first and second.

 

The point of the whole approach is to have some adaptability and flexibility, to be designed around reinforcing success and hitting weaker flanks not just frontal slogging - all of which exploit the speed and maneuver power of the tanks within the enemy's defensive zone.  But they are also dead simple, formulas that can be learned by rote and applied mechanically.  They are fast because there is no waiting for recon pull to bring back info on where to hit.  The substance that needs to be grasped by the leader of a 2nd or 3rd element is very limited, and either he can see it himself or the previous element manages to convey it to him, or gets it up to the commander of all three and he issues the appropriate order downward.  They are all mechanically applying the same doctrine and thinking on the same page, even if out of contact at times or having different amounts of information.  The whole idea is get the power of maneuver adaptation without the delays or the confusion that can set in when you try to ask 3 or more bullheaded linemen to solve advanced calculus problems.

 The only time the Germans were able to sort of stop this sort of Soviet operation was during 1942 with operation mars. Operation Uranus conducted in the south resulted in the destruction of the Italian army, the Romanian army and the destruction of the German  6th armee. The Soviet kept getting better at this sort of battle resulting in red flags over the Riechtag verses a Military system that had a wider High school system and More university graduates, that mentally masturbated over the idea of flexibility and getting inside the enemies decision making process and then surrounding and creating ""cauldrons"" that could be dismembered. 


The idea that Conscript armies are ""better quality"" than Volunteer armies falls over when actually examining WWI where Conscript British armies conducted much more intricate integrated attack plans involving artillery plans, creeping barrages, armour support, use of specialised weaponry such as sub machine guns with section level fire and support versus the original Volunteer BEF's years of drill resulting in the ability to fire a bolt action rifle really really fast. Note the latter's years of prewar ""professional"" training in reloading a lee enfield and shooting various ""natives"" in colonial wars did not result in victory in 1914. 

Volunteer armies or ""private"" east india armies in the British ideal of colonial policing actually do very badly in industrialised warfare which resulted (note how badly British indian volunteer regt did in Africa and at places such as Kut) in them switching to levy en mass when forced to partake and win in mainland european warfare. The real reason you want ""volunteer"" professional armies is the ability to side step home front criticism as exhibited/reaction to Vietnam or to cut costs as an Island nation more focused on supporting a world spanning Navy without the population basis of any of the major european powers.",,1449000176,31,1,31,0,wargame,cxjhdnv,t3_3v0xq3,,Bastables,,t3_3v0xq3,t5_2tlh1,1449196624,1451374752,False

#1 The right to bear arms is an inalienable right, that cannot be given nor taken away by any government. It is a right given by the laws of nature onto our birth, the right to defend oneself does not need consent from the government.

#2. The 2nd amendment of the US constitution was put in place to protect and secure the people of the United States against the government of the United States. ----""Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.""

""As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.""

It has big downsides as I need to grind with same class and same deck for such a long time. I had cards to start building paladin only 5days ago.

I'm asking what cards I should be going towards to. If playing only Warlock and Paladin for now, is there some more must have cards in the other adventures for these classes.

Here are my current deck lists for both classes. (Naxx cards added just now, but only to Paladin (+ Voidcaller) : http://i.imgur.com/brQ81FW.png


Big craftable cards missing from:
 
**Paladin** (class):  
&gt;Competitive Spirit, Equality, Eye for an eye, Aldor Peacekeeper, Quartermaster, Tirion Fordring.
&gt;+ All the rest not seen on the decklist besides 2 commons and Divine Favor.

**Warlock** (class): 
&gt;Darkbomb, Demonfire, Shadowflame, Dreadsteed, Twisting Neather, Lord Jaraxxus, Mal'Ganis 
&gt;(+ Img Gang Boss)

I don't own any other minions from adventures than what you get from Naxxramas. 
*My only legendary is: Dr. Boom

Big **neutrals** would probably be: 
&gt;Sylvanas, Big Game Hunter, Harrison Jones.
&gt;(+ adventure ones, like Emperor Thaurissan etc.)


I would like to hear peoples opinions on:

* what their strategies with these decks would be

* maybe little about mulligans

* what card/adventure should go for next (guess BGH) 

* if they would change something (play Tirion Kappa)

* is it bad that I never play arena but I need cards ?
+ not only that, would you guys hit me if I would tell you that I discard every class quest not for Paladin/Warlock...

And overall when you were starting out, had your foot already between the door so that you understood something and realized that you are missing vanilla + 3 expansions worth of cards.

For me what interests me is eventually creating my own decks and brainstorm, even though my decks are quite obviously just copied I do that to have a working deck and maybe one day in the future I have enough cards to innovate something my own with these classes.

tl;dr Thanks for the help..

"Wisła had a spell of dominance. The other teams had like 2 years when they were the best, which is not my definition of ""dominance"".

Legia is consistent, they are always in top 3, rarely lower, but still, as I say - 4 titles in last 20 years, 6 titles in last 35 years. Compare it to some others countries in Europe and it's not that much really.

"It contains a critique of capital, but not the same critique that either Marxism or non-Marxist socialism advances. 

More or less, as Western philosophy chugged along through the 18th and 19th centuries, philosophers began to struggle with the question of ""political economy,"" or how the way we structure societies and economies impact other areas of life (politics being the most obvious one). You had thinkers like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, describing things like capital accumulation, wage-based labor, private property ownership, etc., and asking how that shaped society and vice-versa.

As these philosophies matured, so did criticism of them. ""Capitalism isn't very nice"" is a good way of breaking down some of the basic critiques people had. ""It leads to a sort of dysfunction in society.""

Socialism and Marxism had one way of responding to this critique, which was ""we can restructure society to obviate or eliminate some of the problems with the capitalist mode of production!""

Fascism came later, after the First World War and after seeing how political philosophies like socialism and Marxism were influencing the direction of political economy in Europe at the time. It arose out of precursor *nationalist* ideas (largely in Italy, Spain, and France). One of the defining features of nationalism and fascism is the insistence on loyalty and respect to a nation or people, as opposed to socialism (which tended to be international and utopian) and Marxism (which is explicitly international, Stalinism be damned). 

So while fascism says, ""capitalism is bad, you guys, we can restructure society!"" socialism/Marxism generally say that ""we should structure society to be fair and open and return power to collectives!"" whereas nationalism/fascism say ""we should structure society to respect the family unit, traditional values, loyalty to the nation and its leaders, and change the structure of society to benefit our country over everything else!""

In that way, fascism *is* revolutionary, and so shouldn't be placed along the traditional right/left axis, because it is critical of the status quo... it's just that fascism usually wants to replace the status quo with something more authoritarian than capitalism and holds as virtues conformity, subservience, and loyalty, whereas we would say socialism/Marxism values democracy, concerted effort, and collective expression of political will.",,1449003102,7,0,7,0,badpolitics,cxjjkvr,t3_3uufhl,,ccmulligan,,t1_cxhz2gw,t5_2sifg,False,1451375790,False

"[Russia was getting food and raw materials from the US](http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/pearl/www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6315/lend.html).

For example, the trucks -- while we think of World War II German infantry as being motorized, [most of Germany's military was still hauling supplies and soldiers via horse when the USSR was invaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_in_World_War_II#Logistics) and had serious logistics problems.  The Soviets, on the other hand enjoyed a substantial flow of trucks:

&gt; In total, the US deliveries [to the USSR] through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[31] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[32] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[33] and 1.75 million tons of food.[34]
&gt;
&gt; Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.[35][36]
&gt;
&gt; The United States gave to the Soviet Union from October 1, 1941 to May 31, 1945 the following: 427,284 trucks, 13,303 combat vehicles, 35,170 motorcycles, 2,328 ordnance service vehicles, 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products (gasoline and oil), 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs (canned meats, sugar, flour, salt, etc.), 1,900 steam locomotives, 66 Diesel locomotives, 9,920 flat cars, 1,000 dump cars, 120 tank cars, and 35 heavy machinery cars. One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR. The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about eleven billion dollars.[37]

"Well, to be honest: I am not that "" Esports EU Pride "" seriuos. I just used to be a Yellowstar Fanboy, a Froggenfanboy, somebody who loved to see Huni in "" live of legends "" and so on, and they are all getting bought. Yea, it will open some space up for new players, but thats about it. Meanwhile, NA LCS becomes like a "" EU A Tier Players vs KR C Tier Players "" leageu, without many actual americans or canadians in there. I know that your country has a long history of migration etc, but this does still feel bad, cuz..its built up with money, and not with "" we wanna be the best "" spirits.

Anyway, im happy that there is so much Cash in Esports now, and im sure in the next 2 years EU will get some of this cash aswell.

Anyway, to answer your question:
I am German, which makes things different. We dont have any national Pride at all, the only time in the year when you will see German Flags on the street is if we won a soccer tournament, and nowhere else. Even on our national holiday, nobody is raising the german flag or "" celebrating it "", cause we dont have any national feelings. On the other hand, i love the Conecpt of the European Union, and i have the dream that i will see an "" United States of Europe "" super-state still somewhen in my life(probably not gonna happen, but i can dream). I do love the european common culture and diversity, and i have been in almost any european country already(im 17), cuz open borders and so on. Im gonna visit sweden this Saturday :D .

Bjerg, Rush, Huni would be in my top 5 for sure, but I still put Huni on top. He was a monster last split. He drew every single ban for his team and still dumpstered most top laners. 

I don't know what you base some of this tilting off. MSI for instance, out of all top laners he did the most % of teams damage, highest Damage per minute, 2nd highest CS differential, His KDA was 2.4 compared to Marin's 2.7  None of that seems like tilt to me.

Same thing true in EU Summer playoffs, Most damage % of team, most damage per minute by a lot (531 over werlyb at second place with 453) , 2nd highest CS per minute, 2nd in KDA.

So 2 of your 3 examples he was 1st or 2nd at almost every stat for his position, so if that was tilting than he must have been wayyyyyy better than all those other players.


Worlds is where he had a bad tourny.  And still he was just average not at the bottom or anything. 5th/18 for % team damage, 3rd in damage per minute (only behind Marin and Smeb), 2nd in CS per min behind Marin, 3rd in gold differential, 6/18 in CS differential, 9/18 in KDA.

"&gt; And? 

You were intrigued why Serb minorities expect such strong rights in Kosovo, in a land which was historically theirs.

&gt; Actually, the language was banned from school and they weren't allowed seats in parliament despite being a vast majority.

Source?

&gt; So so far you've told me how much you value the rights of dead Serbs over living Albanians

I value the right of the living Serbs, not the dead ones. I do not understand how you were able to even understand it in a way simillar to this. Maybe English isn't so well taught in Albania.

&gt; Congrats a super state consisting of multiple nations had higher living standards than that era's version of North Korea. The fact that the living standards were so much higher yet everyone left the union should tell you enough about how little rights ""minorities"" had.

Yet those minorities had a better living standard than in their own homeland, at a time. Interesting.

&gt; *Hypothetical

Yep, hypotetical. You made a hypotetical situation about Germans, Englishmen and Frenchmen.

&gt; I think the parallel was along the fact that when you try to ethnically cleanse entire groups of people don't expect any sympathy or start demanding rights. The fact that you guys are still allowed in Kosova is a privilege not a right, don't take it for granted.

Yep, we and Gypsies and any other who are not Albanians. Such rights in Kosovo.

In the end, it doesn't matter. You government will have to obey the international deals it made or your semistate will suffer in terms of accession to the EU.

Putting aside that that is in itself an argument for putting a border guard on the border which the EU has taken off, the main problem with human trafficking in the EU actually lies outside the EU.  Romania and Bulgaria have citizenship laws with Moldova and Macedonia respectfully.  It's very easy for people from these countries to become Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.  That's the entry point and criminals are using illegally acquired documentation in Moldova and Macedonia to acquire official and genuine EU citizenship (and there's no real way of the EU checking).  EU passports are being bought by non-EU citizens and are being issued by EU countries.  From there they can travel with impunity and legally so it's not so much a question of policing (which is what INTERPOL is for and it expands beyond the EU), more you've lost control of who can acquire EU citizenship from outside.  Moldova is ranked 15th worst in the world when it comes to slavery and it's almost one of the most corrupt.  The EU has opened up a new market place for them.    What do you plan to do to fix it?""

"So I have had my T4i DSLR for a while now, and I am looking to get a new lens. I got it with the 18-135mm STM lens. 

I want to get more into photography, specifically landscape shots, a lot of cool night scenes, and some timelaspes. I am also going to Europe for several months and am looking for something a bit smaller than the 18-135 that will be more comfortable to carry around. 

Two lenses I have came up with are the [Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-24mm-2-8-Lens/dp/B00NI3BZ5K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449013569&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=canon+24mm&amp;psc=1) and the [Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449013617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=canon+10-18).

Now in terms of price I am definitely more comfortable with the 24mm as I am just getting into photography more.

One thing I am worried about with the 10-18 lens is it being too wide for a lens that will act as my primary one. While it may be nice for those landscape shots, would it work photographing places in European Cities like London? Also, I have read the 10-18mm takes sharper photos, is this true?

"So there's a reason for that.

[Good article explaining the subject](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/08/economist-explains-18)

The short of it?

1) We have domestic flights which do the bulk of the work. 

2) The airlines lobby against train systems because the competition would hurt them.

3) European countries are smaller so the investment in a train system is more reasonable as a public undertaking. In the United States we would literally need to connect states which all have sizes that dwarf European countries.

A train in a Scandinavian country doesn't travel anywhere near what would be required of a U.S. train system. This makes the idea of an interstate train system an extreme undertaking in both cost and upkeep. 

There is also an issue which the article doesn't mention. Why doesn't a state like California have a subway system like New York City?

The fact is they almost did before the car lobby got involved. California actually had their car lobby get involved and prevent the construction of a subway system like New York has. 

So New York tends to be the only state with the level of train transport as some European countries. It is on par with the London Underground in its transport abilities (not as nice looking but functional)

We met volunteering in Alaska. For those of you who've never been to that part of the world, put it on your bucket list. Now. (I don't care if you don't do cold places, go in the summer and bring a gallon of bug dope and a decent raincoat)


Once we got to know each other a bit we just clicked. As tends to happen when you spend a lot of time with someone with whom you have a lot of chemistry, a mutual attraction soon developed.
Here's where things get complicated, at the time we were both dating other people back in our respective homes. Although we never discussed it, I'm pleased to say that we didn't act on it and settled on just being good friends (and decent human beings). Regardless, it was a very confusing time for both of us.


When camp was over and we both went home we stayed in contact, messaging each other almost every day, despite the 8 hour time difference. I rather quickly ended things with the girl I was dating, although for reasons independent of what had happened in Alaska. (She was about to move back to another country and we had only been casually dating for a few weeks before I left. Ironically, that came to an end because a LDR was the exact thing I wanted to avoid at the time)


As the months went by we got to know each other well our friendship strengthened. Both of us had varying success in fighting the feelings we'd developed, but by the time winter rolled into town we both had it under wraps. Then, just before Christmas, her boyfriend broke up with her. I was a little surprised to find old feelings coming back, but shoved them back down again and focussed on being the best friend I could be, doing what little I could to make her feel better.


Come the spring and she'd been accepted for a semester abroad program in the autumn, touring Europe as part of her general studies. Over the course of the spring we planned to fit a visit in over the week before she was due to start at the end of August. It made sense, after all the program was starting in Edinburgh.


There was one minor hiccup. A few weeks before she was due to arrive it turned that she would be arriving a few days to late to make the trip we'd planned. So we decided that instead of her taking a train up from London we'd make a road trip of it, crisscrossing the country in shorter legs rather than just sticking to the usual route.
And I'm sure that I don't need to tell you that by this point in time we were both failing spectacularly when it came to ignoring how we felt about each other.


So after over a year we saw each other again. It was very melodramatic, I embraced her and proclaimed my undying love, and we promptly engaged in sloppy PDA all the way to the car where we made mad, passionate love on the bonnet.
I'm just kidding, my life isn't a badly written smutfic.
We carried on as usual because:

A) I am a massive coward.

B) how do you even go about telling your best friend that you're in love with her?

C) in the event you get shot down, spending 24 hours a day within a few feet of each other is the exact opposite of an ideal way to spend the better part of a week. (This feeds into point a).


We made our way up the country, stopping in some of my favourite spots that I'd wanted to show her. The whole time we were both internally debating whether to say anything about ""us"", but fear of losing each other's friendship always won.


Almost.


On the final night before I was due to drop her off in Edinburgh, we camped on the Scottish border. And it was there, with the rain pounding down and the howling wind threatening to collapse the tent, that she worked up the courage to tell me how she felt and I did likewise.


In the morning we decided the good times would be worth the bad, and that we had to at least give it a shot.

Plus for the median disposable income:

http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking

http://www.movehub.com/blog/disposable-income-world-map

The reason why the US is even in the top 5 in these kind of rankings is because it has a large number of super-rich people, skewing the average a lot upwards. When we look at the median wealth, it looks a lot different:

2013: https://i.imgur.com/1TzF6eN.png

It became even worse this year: Americans' median wealth is a mere $44,900 per adult -- half have more, half have less. That's only good enough for 27th place, below Japan, Canada, Australia and most of Europe (Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Italy, UK, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, Austria, Greece, Sweden, Germany and Slovenia have more median wealth per adult) in 2015.

There are many reasons why middle class incomes are suffering, including the decline of unions' power, the shift of jobs overseas and the increasing use of technology in the workplace, but Americans still tend to think of their middle class as being the richest in the world. It turns out, in terms of wealth, they rank fairly low among major industrialized countries. Super rich Americans skew average wealth upwards. The U.S. has 42% of the world's millionaires, and 49% of those with more than $50 million in assets. Home ownership rates are higher in many European countries than in the U.S., giving Joe European more assets to his name than his American counterpart. Plus, it's easier for Americans to borrow money, which eats away at their net worth.

Plus, the tax in other countries is also higher because of the free healthcare and development aid paid, as you can see [here](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0930884.html) or [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_by_development_aid#Official_development_assistance_by_country_as_a_percentage_of_Gross_National_Income_in_2013).

Israeli Special forces (Sayeret Matkal) were actually present during siege but their advice wasn't listened to and the Germans wouldn't allow them to intervene.

"10 Biggest Wall St. Banks Now Facing Legal Action for Price Fixing $320 Trillion Derivative Market

By Jay Syrmopoulos on December 1, 2015

New York, NY – A class action lawsuit, filed last week, accuses two trading platforms and ten of Wall Street’s largest megabanks of conspiring to stifle competition in the $320 trillion dollar derivatives market for interest rate swaps.

The lawsuit claims the banks “have been able to extract billions of dollars in monopoly rents, year after year, from the class members in this case.”

[http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/26/us-interestrateswaps-lawsuit-idUSKBN0TE2YQ20151126#w8ceoMoiIt6Mpz4v.97]

According to a report by Reuters:

The class action lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accuses: 

Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), 

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), 

JPMorgan Chase(JPM.N), 

Citigroup(C.N), 

Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.VX), 

Barclays Plc (BARC.L), 

BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA), 

UBS (UBSG.VX), 

Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), and the 

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) 

of colluding to prevent the trading of interest rate swaps on electronic exchanges, like the ones on which stocks are traded.

As a result, the lawsuit alleges, banks have successfully prevented new competition from non-banks in the lucrative market for dealing interest rate swaps, the world’s most commonly traded derivative.

The Public School Teachers’ Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago brought the suit against the elite global financial powerhouses, after purchasing interest rate swaps from numerous banks as a means of assisting the fund in hedging against interest rate risk on debt. 

Those purchases led to the Chicago Teachers’ Pension and Retirement Fund vastly overpaying for those swaps, according to the suit.

The suit alleged that the banks “have jointly threatened, boycotted, coerced, and otherwise eliminated any entity or practice that had the potential to bring exchange trading to buyside investors,” since at least 2007.

“Defendants did this for one simple reason: to preserve an extraordinary profit center,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit goes on to claim that the banks masked their collusion by using code-names for joint projects such as “Lily, Fusion, and Valkyrie.”

Out of the ten banks named in the lawsuit, nine of the banks own equity stakes in Tradeweb and hold positions on the company’s board and governance committees. 

The banking consortium used those positions to effectively control Tradeweb and collectively blocked the development of more investor-friendly swaps exchanges by firms such as the CME Group, TrueEX, Javelin Capital Markets, and TeraExchange, according to the suit.

According to the lawsuit:

“During the time period relevant here, Tradeweb board and governance committees… were organized specifically for the purpose of protecting the ‘dealer community’ from the growth of exchange trading.”

Similar allegations of bank collusion in the market for another type of derivative, known as credit default swaps, have been the subject of investigations by the United States Department of Justice and the European Commission, as well as a separate class-action lawsuit brought by investors, according to Reuters.

In September, twelve banks and two industry groups settled that lawsuit by agreeing to pay $1.87 billion, making it one of the largest antitrust class action lawsuits in U.S. history, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The scale of alleged theft is almost unimaginable. 

If you want to understand who/what controls governments, you have found the industry that stands above all others in its ability to bend the will of states and from which all other industries bow at the alter of; the true ‘Masters of the Universe.’
