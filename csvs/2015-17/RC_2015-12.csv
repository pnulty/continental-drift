,"Polygamy was very common throughout the world (either in the form of multiple wives, or the form of one wife and multiple concubines), but it was basically unheard of in ancient European cultures.  (It wasn’t uncommon for men to have extramarital romantic liaisons, but with women who were more like mistresses or prostitutes than concubines.) It’s not clear exactly why, but it seems part of it is the more egalitarian culture these societies had in their early days, such that every man had a plot of land, served in the army, and married a girl when he was secure.  You can’t have men with many wives without having many men with *no* wives, and this is best suited to an economic situation where some people are wealthy and most are servants.  In Old-Testament-style herding cultures, for example, a big chief might have enough sheep, cattle, and camels to support four wives and thirteen children, whereas men at the bottom of the totempole with zero sheep, zero cows, and zero camels can support zero wives and zero children.

As Greek and Roman culture became more unequal an aristocracy did develop, but they still were only allowed one wife (now with the additional restriction that they could only have marry an *aristocratic* woman).  With monogamy so deeply ingrained, emperors who went to unheard-of excesses of personal self-indulgence still tended to marry one woman at a time.  Christianity had a hostility towards sex even from early days and there was no way Christians, once they became a large presence in the Greco-Roman world, were going to attract the contempt of their neighbors by defending Biblical polygamy.  In the early 1500s, when the early Protestant reformers were revisiting *all* Christian rules/practices which lacked Biblical sanction, the reformers did *consider* permitting polygamy (on exactly the grounds you suggest, that it is praised frequently in the Bible and never banned), and at a certain point they were pro-polygamy while they were still very anti-divorce, and one Protestant prince *did* take a second wife.  However, the backlash to this was so severe that the reformers recognized the unpopularity of polygamy and stopped suggesting it be brought back (although it has recurred in heretical sects, most famously Mormonism).",3,0,1448928031,,simpleclear,3,0,t3_3ux5ft,cxiigy9,explainlikeimfive,t3_3ux5ft,,1450552101,False,False,t5_2sokd

Post challenges on the Saturday night to be started on Sunday morning, or at least let the captains know who can update the spreadsheet before they go to bed!

,"Before I start, since you live in the US (and are considered a resident for tax purposes), you are required to file a yearly FBAR report because you have assets of more than $10k outside the US.

Filing an FBAR has no tax consequences.

You on your regular US taxes need to declare any income due to interest or capital gains or dividends that you had because of those investments in the UK.

One complication now with investing in the UK is that whenever you purchase a stock, ETF or whatever, you need to keep track of the base price not only in GBP, but also in USD and again when selling it - because it is the USD gain/loss that counts for the US tax return.

In regards as to whether it is a good idea to invest in the UK - I would say, if you don't have to, i wouldn't. One thing I am doing in Europe still even though I am living in the US is making private retirement account contributions, but that is the only ""investing"" that I am doing. Since I can only access the money when I'm retired, it has no tax implication now anyway.

If you want to invest in UK assets (currency or UK equities), I would do so with a US stock broker.

One thing I am not so sure how to handle myself which I just ignored last tax return (as it wasn't all that much money) was how to handle the massive currency depreciation.

&gt; SECRET Labour plans for an open-door immigration policy are exposed today in an explosive Whitehall report.

&gt; The bombshell document reveals ministers believed there were clear “social” benefits to creating a multicultural Britain.

&gt; And it warns that strict border controls clash with “policy objectives”.

&gt; But the controversial document — written in 2000 by senior Home Office officials — was heavily censored.

It's no surprise that people get the impression that Labour stand for open-door immigration, given that it's also common enough knowledge that they opened up immigration from new eastern European EU members far more than other EU nations did: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24924219
&gt; Having no restrictions on eastern European migrants in 2004 was a ""spectacular mistake"", former Labour home secretary Jack Straw has said.

&gt; The Labour MP said handing immediate working rights to Poles and others when they joined the EU nine years ago was a ""well-intentioned policy we messed up"".

&gt; ""Other existing EU members, notably France and Germany, decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011.

,"Wittgenstein would say that the misunderstanding is rooted in our language: 

&gt;Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.

and elsewhere in *Philosophical Investigations*

&gt;A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.


Since language serves a critical role in the formation of our mental constructs of the world, our Indo-European subject-verb-predicate structure casts the veil of maya.  Through proper nouns we impart subject-hood to things as independent from nature; things as isolated entities, often with fixed identities. In the natural world of our everyday-lived-experience, nothing is truly independent from anything. 

&gt;Space is not empty. It is full, a plenum as opposed to a vacuum, and is the ground for the existence of everything, including ourselves. The universe is not separate from this cosmic sea of energy.

-David Bohm


As a result of this nounification of people, we conceptualize ourselves and others as entities separate or independent from the world of our naturally lived experience. We are an object in a vacuum. And therefore we are eternal...pure concept. However ""we"" aren't concepts; we're real people, part of this world of eternal flux, this transforming-relational-activity-continuum.

The reality is that Islamic fascism dates back to the inception of Islam, because the prophet was a warlord.  There's no way around it.  The scriptures in the Quran and hadiths are often violent and totalitarian, so there's a huge reservoir of hatred with which to pull from.  It's not surprising that so many Muslims do.

Having said that, I'm glad that there are Muslim reformers like Maajid Nawaz who are courageously working to combat Islamism and Jihad from inside the faith.  However, I don't think liberalism is to blame for the woes of the world, and I don't think the US hegemony ""ruined the middle east...and europe as well.""

,"Truth be told, the real ""tyranny of political correctness"" is at its worst when it prevents us from coming to terms with the fact that terrorism really isn't a big problem for Australia, or the U.S., or European countries, or the vast majority of other countries. The tyranny of political correctness wielded by media and governments alike would have us believe that ISIS poses a greater threat than cancer, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, malaria, alzheimer's, diabetes, famine, drought, abject poverty, and all of humanity's worst enemies. It's politically correct for news outlets to be plastered with news about terrorism and present it as the great problem of our times, meanwhile it's generally politically incorrect to consider out loud how many lives could've been saved with, for example, the $2-6 trillion spent destroying Iraq and occupying Afghanistan, had those resources been spent addressing the much more serious dangers we face.

Absolutely **yes**. One of the first things the USA did after 9/11 was withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia. 

&gt; Their explicit goal is the creation of a global caliphate. ISIS do not yet have a global caliphate

,"Good reasons not to torture combatants:

-We will torture innocent people too

-Intelligence extracted under torture has zero or negative value

-Use of torture radicalizes population

-Use of torture is still internationally recognized as a war crime

-Complicates international diplomacy and intelligence-gathering

-Our POWs and embedded or at risk personnel will not be well treated by the enemy and will not be aided by the local population

-We are not a medieval european monarchy and/or fascist dictatorship

-This is not 800 AD

-There is no Spanish Inquisition 

Torture is literally a kneejerk, pointless response with no point other than being broadly punitive.  It produces no actionable intelligence - to the contrary, it makes intelligence gathering more difficult.  It doesn't save lives.

It does, however, really have a way of making people want to kill you.  Torture ferments radical Islam, every bit as much as our long-standing support of autocratic regimes in the Middle East and Israel.  The use of more torture equates to a more radicalized population, and translates into more numerous and violent extremism.  This leads to more terror attacks, and more dead westerners and service members.

Is that racist? I think that is certainly part of it. I'm in the Netherlands and people bitch about foreigners all the time, and often they include Dutch citizens with a migrant background. Most countries try to keep out foreigners because otherwise their population goes apeshit.

I think most people are fine with small minorities of other people, but not so much as to change the culture or language of their homeland. Look at Belgium, people are butthurt that some regions turned from Flemish to French. That's not racism but there is an element of changing ethnicity (or linguistic background?) that makes people feel buggered.

They have nothing to worry about, like most small European countries. As long as more powerful countries keep their security for them.

And no they have no responsibilities. They hold no sway over any countries, and no one is worried about what they think. They are free to pursue whatever programs they wish because their actions carry little weight except to their own citizens.

The US responsibility is not only too its people. We have other countries and economies to answer for, our actions cause ripples everywhere. Many, many countries free up their budgets by not having to bother with a real standing army/navy/airforce because they have treaties with us. They have no worries of their neighbor actually trying to take theirs over, like in days not that long ago, as long as the US stays in power. Real warfare has not happened since the US took power.

Calciopoli and the subsequent shittifying of Serie A killed a lot of the interest in Italian teams, unfortunately, but I'm sure that's true everywhere though. After that, the big EPL deals kicked in AND the MLS grew a lot. 

That might be the biggest factor I guess - the sport got more popular right when the EPL became super available to watch, finally.

Irrelevant, online all that matters is your argument.

&gt; biggest bang for the buck are health and education. ~ Governments must raise tax revenue for that.

This sounds like you're advocating that faux humanitarian model we've seen so much of in post colonial Africa. A dumping ground for used clothes, pharmaceutical recalls and ""civilize"" the native schools, so they can pay taxes and vote. And now you want governments to continue this model? Those honest and virtuous men Africa is so well known for having at their positions of power. 

Do you think any government funded schools anywhere let alone Africa are going to instill the classical liberal mindset in young and potential entrepreneurs that lifted Europe/America out of feudal 3rd world type obscurity? Which could threaten their current percentage of ""take"" (tax/bribe)

diabetes has a strong genetic component. 

&gt;Immigrants to Canada, most of who now originate from non-European countries, are known to have higher rates of diabetes. Results from an Ontario population-based study showed that, after controlling for age, immigration category, education, income and time since arrival, immigrants from South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa had an increased risk of diabetes compared to immigrants from Western Europe and North America.65 In addition to genetic susceptibility, there is evidence that recent immigrants tend to have lower incomes and poorer access to health services than the general Canadian population.

,"I'm a European, so regarding breeders; can't tell you much. But u/lovechip wrote an excellent post on the matter:

&gt; Are you in the UK or US or elsewhere? In the UK, breeders need to be on a register. This is the UK one: http://www.gccfcats.org/
A reputable breeder will be able to tell you what they have available and if it's a blue. The lilacs look very similar and have beautiful colouring and usually golden eyes. I have a Lilac and a Red Colourpoint with big blue eyes.
When you go to visit a breeder, make sure you check that the living conditions for the kittens are clean, free from smells. Ask them about the health of the kittens. Also speak to other people who have had kittens from them and find out if there are any health concerns.
We got our cats from a couple, who had bought them from a registered breeder. When we researched the breeder we found he had been prosecuted by the RSPCA for animal cruelty. He had been a poor breeder and as a result our two boys are quite nervous and have issues with their bite, which has resulted in quite a lot of inflammation and pain in their gums and removal of quite a few teeth. Better breeding would have avoided this issue.
In the UK, you should receive proper documentation of the cat's lineage (which is quite fun to read through).
British Shorthairs come in all kinds of colours. The Silver/Chinchillas are probably the rarest. Haven't come across many Lilacs or Creams. The Colourpoints are really pretty too. But remember it's not just the look of the cat that matters. They're a living thing that needs love, play, food, shelter, safety and a responsible owner.
If you've not owned a cat before, the RSPCA has some good info: http://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/cats The breeder will also be able to tell you what is needed. British Shorthairs don't need any particular things doing that other cats don't. It also depends on the individual cats. Our colourpoint has very dribbly eyes, ears and nose so I clean his face up on a daily basis to keep him clean and comfortable. He also has a thicker coat and grooms himself less than the other one so he needs brushing more often. He also tends to get a bit fat quite easily so we have to carefully monitor how much he's eating.
British Shorthairs when they're well cared for can live for 14-20 years, so think very carefully about whether your lifestyle will be stable enough for you to make this commitment. They're very sweet, quiet and loving cats so they deserve a devoted owner. :)
There's too much to put in one post, but this should get you started. I also have a great book called The Cat Expert. It should be available on Amazon and has given me some good general information, particularly with regards to looking out for common ailments.

The last french in Marseille would probably rather welcome Hitler than letting things deteriorate any further, the progressives in Paris on the other hand ... well, you have seen after the attacks how they blame themselves, how they have flowers, champagne and love while the enemy has AKs.

The problem is that the published opinion comes from Paris and paints everything in shining colors.

They are afraid that Germany, if left alone, causes problems for the European integration. This is the holy cow for the globalists. The EU is their brainchild, their sun god. They will do anything to keep it going.

The FN on the other hand couldnt care less, which is why they have a lot more options. They dont need to care about the German migrant problem, in fact they want out of the EU.

This is unfortunately not the stance of the general public which sees the EU integration as something positive, a result of the relentless propaganda.

Culture is also a factor. Eastern Europeans for example often see ""disciplinary physical punishments"" as vital in a child's development. The child from the young age first hand sees and experiences that if you do something bad, you will be punished. Similar to when he grows up if he does something illegal (wrong) then he will be punished by the law enforcement.

,"I am sorry. But you guys don't preach the culture that has existed in the Indian subcontinent(pak,india,bangladesh) from 5000BC and that includes the indigenous religious practices. Please do me a favour and read ""Being Different by Rajiv Malhotra"". Understand what he is saying. Write a critique on it and please share it. 

Culture includes a lot stuff from Smritis, Srutis, Upanishads, vedas, jatakas, the granth sahib, buddhist text, things like dance and songs and bhajans and other things.

You suddenly come and talk like you know everything. Please read and then comment. Every religion that has come in contact with the culture of this subcontinent has been accepted/absorbed. But then after islamic conquest and british colonization followed by missionary activities still continuing till now has created new fault lines.

Due to the amazing demographic change, partition happened in 1947. It would not have happened if this subcontinent had ppl was mainly from indic faith. For though we are a diverse group when you look from outside, there is a underlying unity that has always been suppressed and used as a political tool to divide us.

The conversion project continues. It would not if Christians respected Indic faiths as another legitimate way of knowing/reaching god. They will not, They cannot because then their very foundation will be questioned. 

For those interested in missionary activities:

,"&gt; No you're not getting it, I'm making a joke.

Jokes based on a false premise = bad jokes. 

&gt; Here is the reality of the situation, the entire history of mankind has been one group of people doing something terrible to another group. We're animals - that's what we do.

Dissecting this is a multi-parter:

a. You would be correct that the history of mankind includes lots of ""doing something terrible.""

b. You would be incorrect to posit the ""entire history"" of mankind can be summarized by doing ""something terrible"" to one another.

c. Given B, I will assume the best of you and take A to be your intended statement. In short, you're not saying anything that contributes productively to the conversation.

d. You still finish your thought on a false premise. Cruelty and war are largely (though not exclusively) unique to humans (ie this is not among our ""animalistic"" traits). In contrast, altruism is also uniquely human so while it remains true that humans are uniquely cruel, we are also uniquely altruistic, and your generalized statement once again does not advance your argument.

&gt; If the natives had boats and guns they'd have landed in Europe and maybe someone would be whining about ""Chief Eats-Whitey day"".

I'm not sure what point you're making other than confirming the notion of history being recorded by the victors, and therefore the necessity for revisionist history (ie the problem you describe is resolved by an objective recounting of history)

&gt; They didn't though, so we got Columbus day.

First, this line belongs with the previous paragraph. Second, that is not at all why we have Columbus Day. Since you're unaware, I'll offer that most countries celebrate Founders Day, whereas the US celebrates Columbus Day due to the nationalistic pride of Italian-Americans.

&gt;If people really cared they'd be working to improve the lot their fellow humans on the reservations. That's too much like hard-work though. Instead they whine about the names of holidays, since that's almost like caring and almost effortless.

1. I think if people cared about celebrating a man that promoted genocide they'd ask their government institutions, including medical schools, to stop celebrating a man that promoted genocide...

2. I'm not sure you understand who is pushing for this change. This change originated at an international conference in Geneva, 1990, by indigenous groups from across the Americas. The first change to Colombus Day observed in the United States was by the Bay Area Indian Alliance in Berkeley, 1992.

&gt;Unless someone has actually done something to help their fellow man I don't give a horse's cock about their opinions on the names of sports teams, or holidays, or if Woodrow Wilson was a racist. It's time to start telling these lazy shits to STFU.

You're really going off your rocker here, bud. Nobody's asking you to give a ""horse's cock"" for anything. Perhaps you're basing your opinions on the posts you see limited to your group of friends on Facebook? Your broad, baseless statement makes me concerned that you're presumably someone that will be responsible for somebody's medical care one day.

&gt; Just one man's theory of course - not a white man if that matters, it shouldn't though.

&gt;Anti-Semitism is hatred against Jews, this is in the dictionary. While you are correct that the definition is pretty misatributed (Yes, Arabs are semitic too), the team ""Anti-Semitism"" is accepted throughout almost every dictionary as irrational hatred of the Jewish people.

But Jews are not the only Semitic people. Why does Anti-Semitism only refer to Jews? Palestinians are Semitic people.

,"&gt;eu also took a game from the best team in the world, how does it matter more if it was in the groups instead of the quarters?

Consistency is important. Both Cloud9 and TSM showed they could play at that level throughout the tournament. That was Europe's major problem in Season 4. I have no doubt that Alliance and Fnatic were capable of playing at the same level of the top NA sides, but they were also capable of being beaten by teams that I don't think either of the top 2 NA squads would have struggled against.

The point of the double round robin -&gt; BoX groups is to be able to showcase explosiveness, flexibility, and consistency. This year Cloud9 was missing flexibility and consistency. CLG was lacking explosiveness. Every team outside of SKT and, to a lesser extent, Koo, was lacking all three relative to those two teams.

Hopefully Origen can improve; they're the only proven world class western team right now, with Huni and Reignover leaving Fnatic. I think there are a lot of rosters that show potential, NRG, TSM, C9, CLG, and Liquid in NA, ROCCAT, Fnatic, Origen, and H2K in Europe.

,"Combat is great, but the combat is also really carrying this game.

Stuff that bothers me:

* I get the impression that translation has been improved since earlier beta weekends, but there's a LOT of work left. Tooltips are a huge offender, but there's also quite a lot of side quest text / player responses (which keeps switching between first and third person) that feels like it was either machine translated or translated by someone who just isn't very good at English. That's not including the stuff that's just flat out incorrect spelling / grammar wise.
* Voice acting is largely poor to mediocre. If I understood it correctly they've re-recorded a bunch of stuff (Soha f.e.) but some VAs are just bad. Having heard a bunch of dialogue from other languages I feel like they put too much emphasis on finding VAs with similar voices for each character over finding someone who can actually pull off the character well. 
* Story (as in, the main quest) isn't particularly interesting, and many major characters are frustratingly one-dimensional (and / or parodical). Maybe it gets better, I didn't finish all currently available story (highest char at 42). I feel like the story gets sidetracked and dragged out far too much. ~Halfway through Act (chapter?) 3 I still mostly have no idea why I'm doing what I'm doing, who many of the major characters (antagonists in particular) are or why pretty much anything is important.
* Side quests are pretty standard MMO fare but I think they went overboard with (western) cultural references / memes and other silliness. Doesn't really bother me but a bunch of stuff feels out of place because it's so much / over the top.
* Both the main storyline and a lot of side quests makes the player character look like the most gullible idiot to ever learn martial arts. We pretty much do whatever people tells us to one minute (""hey, go smash these pots!"") and then suddenly go ahead and start schizophrenically switching between trying to be Lawful Good (and lecturing people about it while in that mode) and having barely any self-control and just slaughtering your way through any problems.

Good stuff:

* Combat. Already said it, but worth saying multiple times. I was playing on the EU server and it feels mostly really responsive and ""crisp"" for me. Shouldn't be satisfied with anything less, but really, too many MMOs have messed this up.
* Visuals. I'm sure people have opinions on the art style and the ""sexy"" costumes and whatnot, but regardless the quality is really good. Combat animations are stellar. Game world is beautiful.
* Gearing. Personal opinion here, but really like it. Yes there's some rng involved in getting the right evolution items which could be adjusted but overall I really like the system they have in BnS (aesthetic only costumes and the whole upgrading / evolving your actual gear).
* Classes all have a really solid class fantasy that is well expressed in theme / abilities / visuals etc.

TL;DR: I enjoyed playing a lot, but the game also still needs a lot of polish. The core systems of the game are solid.

For the record I liked both dungeons and PvP (the latter mostly duelling with friends), but I feel like I neither did enough or know about about either to really have a verdict on them.",17,0,1448956177,,izichial,17,0,t3_3uyru0,cxix9qc,bladeandsoul,t3_3uyru0,,1451365125,False,1448957153,t5_2skd6

,"ENB helps setting the feel of the shots. VIC IMHO is very 'smooth', The tone is very pleasing to look at and to play with. The game looks vanilla without it, which is neither good or bad... just meh.

,"Regarding the main quest. There is a lot of ""lost in translation"" incidents that can be found in the story because the publishers want to bring this story to the west and make it decent for the west players.

The problem however is not from the publishers but from the west standards that find many of the cultural influenced themes in the game to be offensive/sensitive and if published would lead to big and major problems. Again it is not the publishers fault but the west society's fault.

However, if you try to read and follow up the story as you play, you would see how everything ""clicks"" together and how in the end it makes sense. Also, don't forget that that game is more than just 3 Acts and that there is more than that in the east and new Acts are added with new patches. Its like a continuing story and once you progress further into it you will understand and see new ""dimensions"" to the characters that are introduced in the story.

It is just how a storybook is built, you built up many mysteries and one-dimensional characters at the start and make it reach its peak and then reveal big plot twists that completely change your initial understanding of the story and the whole reason behind it and you see new multiple layers of characters.

&gt; I don't know anything about the history of islam

neither do many arabic muslims. (the region where most heinous crimes are commited and by whom they are commited, if not for delusional europeans but thats another story)

The main idea is wahabism. In the early 20. Century this ideology was founded to ""reform"" Islam, but instead of founding this Reformation on some kind of cultural basis within arab culture they started from the very beginning of Islam. All cultural aspects of arab and thus muslim culture were forgotten. No music, no poetry no art, no science.

It wasnt allowed to interpret the Qu'ran as what it really is: a poetic text that HAS to be interpreted to be understood, much more than the bible. It talks in pictures that are sometimes disturbing and thus has to be interpreted to make real sense of it. 

Additionally to the Qu'ran the culture of suffism (the poetic culture of islam, like liturgy and culutal music in christianity) was forgotten of disapproved of. The new set of rules. All very strict and very radical- as a reform of islam- made a radical Islam viable for the masses. People thought of the new approach as better.

,"&gt;*...since it will be far easy to integrate there. Anyway, that was not my point.*

Well, it kind of is, an important point.  Because, it seems, to me, your argument's premised in it.  So, for the sake of argument, what makes you think Saudi Arabia would necessarily be easier for just any Syrian refugee to *integrate* into?

I mean, yeah, it could be, for some.  No shortage of migrant workers, from all over the world, have already taken this route voluntarily.  So, frankly, relative to the already out-sized foreign workforce, there's just not as much room for growth.  Particularly for those without the type of skills &amp; professional experience (STEM) that puts them in demand just about anywhere else in the world.

&gt; for 200 new mosques, even thousands of mosques in Germany?

Well, 200 is certainly a lot less than *thousands*, so maybe this is really a case of agenda-driven numbers inflation on the part of alarmist naysayers.  1 per 100 people, however, is not so extravagant, depending on the scale or how situated.  As in, if they're spread out relatively evenly across the country, then it might mean to better support similar such dispersement of the refugees themselves, thereby making it practically easier for all of them to take fuller advantage of more opportunities to better assimilate into both the job-market and national culture.

Like, as opposed to dumping so many of them off into a particular city or town, in larger *ghettos*.  More segregated from the rest of the country.  

&gt;*A single hospital is ten times more useful*...

A hospital costs 100's of millions of dollars to build.  And there's no real shortage of hospitals either in Germany or throughout most of Western Europe.  Germany, actually, is only second to the US (of course) in featuring some of the world's best, most prestigious hospitals.  

A ""mosque"" or prayer room on the other hand, could be as basic as a formerly disused store-front in an economically depressed neighborhood.  Therefore, it's a much more *cost-effective* way to for them to both make a meaningful contribution and one that necessarily puts their own a distinctly Islamic cultural footprint on it.  (*i.e.*, Saudi's see themselves as custodians of both of their holy cities contained therein, Mecca &amp; Medina, if not the Islamic religion on the whole.)

,"Actually, *you're* the revisionist. You're trying to revise Hitler's *actual* documented ancestry.

* Footnote: Stop being obsessed with Jews. Hitler's embarrassment about his modest origins had nothing to do with Jews. He was embarrassed because, as he pontificated about ""master races"" and superior genes, he actually came from a poor, inbred region of Austria, and he came from a family that had high rates of mental retardation. (Beethoven did too, apparently.) It wasn't uncommon in these isolated regions to have cousin-marriages and high rates of birth defects and mental retardation. Hitler's father married his own niece, for God's sake. Hitler's parents were relatives. You have to stop obsessing on Jews, and assuming that there could be one--and only one--reason for his shame regarding his family. The reality is: It had zero to do with Jews or Jewishness [since his region didn't even have many Jews in his lifetime, and had almost none in his parents and grandparents' lifetime due to bans on them. Go read European history. Jews were forbidden to own land in almost all European countries. As a result of this ban, Jews couldn't own farms. They gravitated toward the cities and became an urban population. Hence the ghettos. (Hitler's family, by contrast, were in rural FARM-OWNING Austria. That means historically: No Jews.) Study the demographics of the time-period. What you're doing is like using 2015 Boston and saying, ""Somalis and other African groups live there,"" therefore in 1620 during the Salem Witch trials, New England must have been bursting at the seams with Africans. Um . . . nope. History brings with it demographic changes. Groups that are now common might not have been if you travel a century back in time. The same was true of rural Austria. Very few Jews lived there at all in Hitler's lifetime; and a mere generation or two back, none lived there at all. Like in the example of the city of Graz, where, in the Middle Ages, they kicked out all Jews and maintained the ban for centuries. You want rural 19th Century Austria to be this cosmopolitan place with Jamaicans, Jews, Australian aborigines, jet-setting Pakistanis, etc. The fact is: It was just white people. And in-bred hillbilly white people. The fact that you're overlooking this aspect of Hitler's demographic milieu is to pass over in silence his insecurity regarding all the inbreeding in his family and his father's illegitimacy (at a time-period when that was considered low-class). Not everything is about Jews. You sound vaguely obsessed: ""No, only Jews can be the reason! A Jew under every bed! A Jew behind every shadow!

,"A comment on how the MRM is perceived that I made a while back; at the risk of repeating myself, I'll post it again here:

Whenever I hear somebody say, ""Feminism is concerned with men's rights too"", I realize that the speaker is speaking with a different set of assumptions than I have. Namely, the assumption that feminism is a necessary prerequisite for gender equality, and that feminism is a necessary prerequisite for male equality. In fact, I would go so far as to say that they suffer from a poverty of imagination, and are constrained by their world view.

It reminds me that there was once a time in European history when the Catholic church claimed a monopoly on the definition of a person's relationship to God. The Catholic church decided what a good Christian was, what a good Christian amounted to, and that anyone claiming to having a relationship with God outside the definitions prescribed by the Catholic church - Jews, Muslims, Protestants - was a heretic. The Catholic hierarchy was psychologically constrained by their worldview. They literally could not understand how someone could believe in God, or profess to be a good Christian, and not follow the dictates of the Catholic church.
Contrary to what many people believe, the idea of rights for men is not based on the idea that men are superior to women. Not at all. It's based on the idea that men have their own concerns, their own worldviews, their goals and ways of breaking out of gender stereotypes and roles assigned to men, their own take on equality and human rights. It also advances the idea that one can be both in favor of human rights for women as well as for men.

A lot of feminists (not all) have difficulty fitting this into their worldview. Somehow along the way they've mentally translated the assertion ""Feminism is about equality between men and women"" into ""feminism and ONLY feminism is about equality between men and women"". That somehow feminism has some kind of intellectual monopoly over deciding how gender equality is achieved. A lot of feminists, male and female, have this assumption that if men want to pursue their own issues, their own aspects of freedom from gender restrictions and more personal opportunity, it has to be done through a feminist theoretical framework. It's a lot like the medieval catholic church faced with the intellectual and doctrinal challenge of the Protestant Reformation. They don't know how to fit it into their worldview. And demand that everybody adapt their worldview to conform with an assumed necessity for feminism. Their response to the men's rights movement is pretty much along the line of, ""feminism is about equal rights for men too, so if you want equal rights for men, it has to be pursued through a feminist framework"".

In doing so, they come at men's issues with a SERIOUS attitude problem. 'If you want to achieve better rights and conditions for males, you must do it through a feminist worldview and by working with feminists.' It's like the Catholic Church saying to Luther, 'If you want to have a closer relationship with God, you must only do it through the Church.'

Not to put too fine a point on it, but SCREW that. It's lip service, for one. And also, why should there should be only one avenue for addressing male issues and men's concerns. And why, for goodness' sake, should the only avenue open to thinking about men be one constructed by people who have been exclusively concerned with women's issues for the past 50 years.",33,0,1448962450,,CMOS222,33,0,t3_3uz6xt,cxiyv46,MensRights,t3_3uz6xt,,1451365887,False,False,t5_2qhk3

,"**Paywall:**

There are two basic conditions necessary for public brainwashing. The first is the continued feeding of the public with baseless information, a well-known method that was developed into an art by dark regimes, in which repeating a lie enough times turns it into the truth. The second is the blocking of credible alternative information. If the public runs into the same information time after time and there is no one to undermine it, the chance to succeed in engineering public consciousness is high.


These two conditions clearly exist in the way Europe’s relations with Israel are been presented here, as a result of the decision on labeling products of the settlements. The great majority of the Israeli media have taken a stand alongside the government to carry out this mission. A unified chorus has sounded the hysterical cry, free of all doubt, which none can challenge. European anti-Semitism has once again arisen. Once again the Europeans have isolated Israel, and once again acted according to their familiar double standard.


On Channel 1’s Mabat news program, shoppers in a Jerusalem grocery store were asked if, in response to the “boycott,” they are planning on boycotting European Union products – even though there is no European Union boycott of Israel, not even of the settlements. Northern Cyprus and Western Sahara rolled off people’s tongues on every street corner, even off the tongues of those who a minute earlier did not know that Nicosia, too, was divided by a Green Line and afterwards they were to find Western Sahara on a map. The flock of commentators enlisted to present the hypocrisy of Europe, which does not label products from these occupied territories, which remains silent in the face of regimes that violate human rights such as China and Iran, and it is only Israel they “boycott.”


These lies were showered on the public with such intensity, until between the huge headlines about the poor, mistreated prima donna, there was no room left for the basic facts that would have refuted them. Citizens who were nonetheless interested in formulating their own opinions on the basis of facts were forced to conduct an independent investigation on the Internet.


What can we discover through such an inquiry? For example, that the Europeans (those anti-Semites) gave nearly 2 billion shekels (almost a half-billion euros) in support to projects in Israeli industry and academia just in the last year.
We could learn that to the credit of the free trade agreement with the Europe Union, which very few countries outside the continent enjoy, trade with Israel will reach 200 billion shekels a year – a third of Israel’s foreign trade. The European Union donates millions of shekels a year toward making Israeli government ministries more professional in their fields.
Yes, the government of the State of Israel is also EU-funded.


Whoever bothered to check certainly found that the reason why the Europeans do not label the products of occupied Northern Cyprus is that they are simply boycotting it completely, and do not buy its goods, labeled or not. At a time when Maccabi Tel Aviv competes in the Champions League, athletes from Northern Cyprus are unable to participate at all in international competitions under the flag of their “country.”


A simple investigation would also have shown that a few European nations have made it clear that the free trade agreement between the European Union and Morocco does not apply to Western Sahara, similarly to the way it doesn’t to Judea and Samaria. And this is without considering the enormous difference in the scope of human rights violations against people in Western Sahara and Northern Cyprus, compared to those against Palestinians in the West Bank: In the occupied territories in Cyprus and Morocco, local residents enjoy citizenship and nearly equal rights.


Whoever has managed to break through the information walls that the government maintains, aided by the media and obedient commentators, discovered that there are no less than 36 countries, including China, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon and Russia, that are under various types of economic sanctions by the European Union.

It's basically little differences, but in EVERYTHING. Guys I thought seemed super down to earth would suddenly come out with stuff that was really shocking (to me) e.g. a guy who owned a load of assault rifles. Your serving sizes are on another level. The car culture is very different. Also, your cars are louder. It's kinda weird. I'm sure even the same models are just louder over there, someone told me it was to do with EU regulations so Americans don't have to use as much sound insulation but I reckon its an American preference.

And some really out there encounters, e.g. a lady from new York who was genuinely shocked police in the UK aren't armed and asked ""aren't you worried about ISIS?"".

It's just a collection of little things that gradually make you realise you really do have a different culture. I personally quite liked how over the top everything was, how overly friendly the service was etc. Also stuff seemed a lot cheaper, again especially your cars.

,"You're saying ""prohibited from diversification of economics"" as if it's something that can be done with a click of your fingers, and only personal preference of the leaders stops it from becoming true.

Russian tech base for consumer goods was in the shitter and cost a ton. Just look at AvtoVAZ, it took 20 years of government subsidies and foreign investments (and licenses) for them to start making cars that at least look decent - there's no way in hell our car industry are competitive with German, Japanese or even Korean industry. And the same is true with other industrial bases.

In an open economy, you have to keep the competitive edge, and it takes time, huge investments, and lack of opportunities in other fields. Service was almost non-existent in USSR, so that was a place for a huge margin of profit; it's way easier, cheaper, more profitable  and faster to open a dozen of restaurants or barbers' shops than a small plant. Same is true on the country level - why pour billions of cash in the failed industrial sector when you can funnel it into other areas that will give more bang for its buck?

Corruption didn't help, of course. But it's not like eliminating corruption is a requirement for the prosperous economy. While Europe does it to a certain degree, both USA and China (top 2 economies in the world) are corrupt as fk - USA has the corruption on the high level, while China has it on all levels, so even different styles of corruption don't prohibit from having a huge economy.

That's exactly what Darth Maul was. At the time of Maul's big reveal to the Jedi, Sidious' master, Darth Plagueis, was still alive. Sidious and Plagueis we're still following the rule of two. Plagueis allowed Sidious to train Maul (against the rule of two) under the agreement that Maul not be taught any of the deeper Sith teachings, skills, or philosophy, that he be strictly used as an assassin, and that he not be enlightened about the true purpose of the Sith, or the existence of Plagueis. 

All Sith during the rule of two era had minions, some force sensitive, some not, this is because they cannot reveal themselves to the galaxy, they need people to do their dirtiest work for them.

But just like Sidious' Inquisitors, these force sensitive minions are kept weak, weak enough that they aren't a threat to the Master or the Apprentice, but strong enough to take care of business.

You are completely right. Cuba should probably let some capitalist dogs inside their country so they can investigate the numbers themselves :facepalm.

&gt;Thank you for noticing that it was meaning it is no longer, therefore you should ask why they suddenly earn more than 3x the average wage.

Because they maanged to save a lot of money from the healthcare system itself so they pushed it back to the people working in the industry. You can find that in the article..Again, what are you trying to imply, that wages play an important factor in high education professions? I thought we were already past that.

&gt;That's nice for your professor, fact is people who study need a place to live, food and the farmer doesn't provide that. Either they live and get supported by their parents, go into debt or have to work a normal ass job besides studying like most students actually do. It's nice that people in Greece don't have to do that, I personally haven't checked on that claim, but the rest of Europe has to and no 4 hours a day won't pay for that unless you get paid far above average or live for far below average.

&gt;No, I am not - you won't get a decent job without at least acquiring a qualification after 'school' unless you are lucky. You won't be able to acquire a qualification which involves a full-time job schedule while being taught the ropes over usually about two years AND studying on top of that unless you do almost nothing else. Jobs without qualifications like fast food shops have no actual chance of promotions or any of the things I listed and that's how it works in Europe.

Not only are you contradicting yourself, but if you read carefully you will see you are only repeating after my words.

In your previous post you claimed ""People take a risk when going to college since they lose promotions/jobs etc"". I claimed that ""You cant actually get a decent job unless you got a degree so there is no real risk in studying unless ofc you get a loan to do it which happens in the USA and not in Europe"". Now you say that there is no real promotion chance unless you actually have a degree...hmmm

As for the working part, im pretty sure, since i have a lot of friends studying abroad most european families have to support their childs one way or another while they are studying. Sure you can find a job but most of the times it doesnt pay enough to cover rent/expenses.

Not only is it better if college students could actually study instead of working unless on their field of experties but the society is largely responsible for their education.

&gt;Please, again show me where I said that pay is important for the person. I said there are huge risks involved by potentially running yourself into debts and/or throwing away 12 years for nothing and that's a reason why doctors and other highly skilled and/or educated people should be paid more than someone whose only skill consists of serving you fries from a machine with 0 qualifications necessary.

If pay is not important then people would study anyways because they want to. Even if the wage was the same..You are seriously contradicting yourself with every sentence.

,"&gt;Pardon me, the term racism was heavily popularised and utilised by Trotsky in his Russian and French writings, but indeed, you're correct; Trotsky didn't invent the term, as some other communist already beat him to it in 1902.

Racism comes from Racialism which borrows from ethnic nationalism as well as the older class race definitions (which indeed are the base for Marxism/Communism).

&gt;Either way, the term 'racism' is a politically loaded leftist ideologue term that has no place in proper nor polite discussion.

bullshit. The term racism describes the political ideology of the existence of distince race bound characteristics in a political context.

&gt;Who is the one defining this as thinking ""races are somehow worth less""? That sounds like a pejorative made by someone in political opposition to the sort of people who'd have these kind of ideas.

Seriously?

e.g. Kipling 
*Take up the White Man's burden And reap his old reward:
  The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard—
The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah, slowly!) toward the light:—
  ""Why brought he us from bondage, Our loved Egyptian night?""*

or as an easy example: The ""kleine Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes"" (German but well, some sort of standard for racism in the third reich)

&gt;I promise you, not since the mid 1960s has anyone actually cared if anyone else is a Communist; It shows a sign of immaturity and naivety I think, but it won't get you ""named and shamed"", and the Communist Control Act is almost a Blue Law at this point.

You cared, just now because you argued against the usage of the term 'racism' only on the base that Trotsky was a communist..

And by the way: There are very few examples of people jailed due to hate speech in Europe (now, thanks to radical islam a few more..)  - at least less than have been imprisoned in the USA during the communist scare..

&gt; In fact, thanks to this insane policy the transit countries are completely overwhelmed. Instead of support, what we got is demonisation for trying to protect our and Schengen's borders.

I completely support a joint EU policy on border management, including border protection and lower and upper limit on the number of people to accept. Right now it's everyone for themselves and that just results, predictably, in trying to shove off problems to each other - which, just as predictably, ends with everyone just having more problems than necessary.

&gt;As for Russia, it seems like the EU ""helps"" us whether we like it or not. Torpedoing the South Stream plans, and just last week the Paks II NPS deal, that is meant to replace our old nuclear power station, Paks I, which provides over 40% of our electricity. I guess now you can ""help"" us more selling your gas and electricity instead.

The thing people don't get about the USA is that it is still a place where we respect and live within the boundaries of the reality of human nature and don't try to fantasize away reality. Reality is that there are people who are not good people to have in society and they need to be kept away from those who desire to live a civil and peaceful life.

,"Guys, Working hours in the EU are greatly curtailed. Even if you wanted to earn extra cash by doing decent overtime you can't.  This has led to people not reporting their hours or getting paid for them also by the employer.  It got so bad that Vehicle operators now have to use a user ID smart card that electronically records the amount of time operating/driving, and if you are over your max hours the machine/vehicle will not start.

I think there is merrit in allowing staff to get a good work life balance, but terrible if you need extra cash for Xmas presents !.  

From the employer point of view, high stress situations and long hours burn out excellent employees quickly.  This causes their performance to drop, work quality drops as well as the employee making mistakes.  A mistake operating a power drill may not just cost you a finger, but may cost the lives of 5 Astronauts in the Space field.  SpaceX's recent RUD shows a simple mistake in metalurgy and quality control cost millions of dollars.

It costs so much more to train a person and the associated costs of hiring &amp; potentially legal costs of firing staff and the all the associated issues of changes to team dynamics, that it would be more economic for SpaceX to adopt a more cuddly attitude to Employees &amp; Interns and retain good staff for longer periods of time.  

I have noted that some companies have employee work life management teams that just make sure that the staff do not have issues.  For example, if you have to work late, there is a team that collects kids from Creches/school etc or collects groceries, dry cleaning etc.

Even some places have after school facilities to let your kids study, play, eat and socialise with friends while you work, all in a safe environment.  It also means that your kids are been monitored and are not latch door kids.  This is especially important for women in work, where most of the child rearing often falls on to, even if they are working.

The first and foremost non work problem for staff that causes issues are family and their health.  The mental health is an important part of it.  Many studies have shown that children that have a parent and a structured environment after school perform better in life as adults, let alone stay in school and make it to adulthood.  Work practices need to start taking in to account the family unit, especially now that it is the norm for both parents to work.

Coming from someone who lives in Europe, (which is where I'm assuming you've been contemplating considering the languages you listed) it is $50 a day PER PERSON at the absolute cheapest. Assuming the $1000-1500 is not including your flight and you went the true backpacker way (hostels and all, no flashpacking) than a single person could stay about 3 weeks. In the summer, even less time due to inflated prices. You could make that longer if you focused mainly on Eastern Europe.

If that budget IS including your flight AND is the total for both of you than you are looking at a far shorter trip. Maybe a weekend or at the most a week if you find a fantastic flight.
One tip for Europe is that once you are in Europe itself it can be potentially VERY cheap to travel between countries. Budget airlines (which is something that simply does not exist in the states) offer flights between countries for as low as $15 if you book them at least a month in advance. I caught a flight from Austria to London for $15, but the average is maybe $30-50 for most budget flights.

,"/u/kalnaren's standard ""Need HOTAS Advice"" post:

*A quick note on prices: This stuff is very subject to regional pricing, some of it extremely so. Don't be surprised if you go on amazon or whatever and see different prices listed than what I have down here. For the most part I've used CAD regional pricing as a guide.*

**Under $100 Bracket**

* Mad Catz/Saitek AV8R: I would consider this the bottom-of-the-barrel entry. MSRP is around $30 so you're not going to find anything cheaper. Poor design, throttles in very awkward position. Cheaply made, few buttons. Ambidextrous. I believe this was originally made as a PS3 controller. No longer in production. Probably best to avoid.

* Mad Catz/Saitek FLY V1: Saitek's new bottom-of-the-barrel entry. Very new stick, not much info available. Allows alt/shifted functions, which is a nice feature to see on a cheap stick. 

* Mad Catz/Saitek FLY 5: Better than the above. Much more customizable. IMO expensive stick for what you get, especially if you're in Europe and can get VKB stuff. Better throttle placement than the AV8R. Might be worth looking into if you find most sticks uncomfortable.

* T16000m: Oddball stick for the simple fact that, despite the cost and ""meh"" plastic plastic build, it's got a lot going for it. Uses magnetic HALL sensors instead of cheap pots, very accurate, ambidextrous. Compatible with TM's TARGET software (big, BIG plus).

* Logitec Extreme 3D: Cheap stick. Poor quality pots. I've had calibration issues with them. Can develop spiking. Won't last near as long as better sticks.. you get what you pay for.

* Thrustmaster HOTAS X: Personally not a fan, as it has all the problems of a cheap joystick crammed into a HOTAS form-factor. Maybe only useful to see if you like the HOTAS setup.. but keep in mind it's a $30-$50 HOTAS when ""proper"" HOTAS systems start at $160. **Is not** compatible with TM's TARGET software, which IMO totally kills it.

**$100 - $200 Bracket**


* T16000m + CH Pro Throttle: IMO best budget HOTAS solution. The good-for-the-money T16000m combined with the best throttle unit on the market. Makes use of TM's TARGET (for the stick) and CH Control Manager (for the throttle). Gives you twist on the stick + a fully analogue thumbstick on the throttle. 


* Saitek x52 Pro: Old design. Generally requires magnet mod to make it a decent stick. Known for throttle quadrant failures. On the plus side, old design improved over the original x52 means that a lot of Saitek's QC issues don't apply to this stick. Personally I found them *very* sloppy, poor centering requiring a large deadzone, and poor calibration. This was all on an unmodded stick though.

* Saitek x55: Good stick on par with the money if you get one that works. Saitek's quality control is complete shite though. Issues range from button ghosting, buttons not working, sticks DOA, throttle issues, and other problems. Some people have had to RMA 3 times before they got one that worked. Others got one that worked out of the box. Very large stick with sub-optimal button layout. Throttle unit is better in this regard. Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest components in the system starts to fail around 600-700 hours of use.


**$300 - &lt; $500 Bracket**

* CH HOTAS: Must be bought in pieces (throttle, stick, pedals). IMO best quality HOTAS on the market. Yea, it's ""plastic"".. that plastic is fibre-reinforced nylon polymer. CH builds stuff for industrial, agriculture, and military use. Their shit lasts forever (20+ years, no joke). Only throttle that has an analogue thumbstick. Best control software on the market. All components have some odd ergonomics some users don't like. No twist (not a liability, IMO). Uses pots, so still requires re-calibration every now and then, but they're excellent quality pots, so you won't run into the spiking and drift issues common to cheaper sticks. Modeled after the stick and throttle in the F-16 fighter. Unfortunately, very subject to regional pricing and difficult to find outside of North America. Large stick; roughly same size as the X55 but with better button layout.

**&gt;$500 Bracket**

* Thrustmaster Warthog: Stick licensed copy of the one in the A-10C Thunderbolt II aeroplane. Very sturdy exterior build on the stick, though still uses plastic internal parts. Very heavy throw weight. IMO best looking of all the sticks. Compatible with TM TARGET software. No twist. Better suited to jet/DCS/BMS sims than space sims or WWII sims, but still a good stick. Various reports of stick suffering from stiction issues.


**Others**

* VKB: Please see **had a link in here to more info but stupid f--king autobot deletes posts with subbreddit links**.


**My Personal Recommendations**

* Best Budget Stick: T16000m.

* Best Budget HOTAS: CH Pro Throttle + T16000m (or two T16000m sticks if all you play is SC/ED)

* Best HOTAS: Full CH setup. Unless you're playing a shitton of jet sims, then probably the warthog.


**What about pedals?**


If you don't have a twist stick they're pretty much required. Even if you have a twist stick I can't recommend pedals enough. They give you far more control and feel much more natural, not to mention you don't end up killing your wrist over longer gaming sessions.

* Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals: Honestly, I don't know a lot about them. Better suited to Saitek's civvie flight sim line. Retail for around $150. Same internals as the PRO Flight Combat Pedals, but different layout.

* Saitek PRO Flight Combat Rudder Pedals: Probably the best piece of 'combat oriented' gear Saitek makes. I haven't heard many complaints about them. Nice and large, sturdy. Retail around $200

*  CH Pro Pedals: Good quality pedals, like all of CH's stuff. Smooth but stiff motion with very abrupt centering. Nicknamed ""nutcracker"" because of how close together the pedals are (8""). If you're think in the thighs this could be a problem. Otherwise on-par with the rest of CH's gear. Come with stops so you can use them as gas/break in car or tank sims or something. Compatible with CH's software. Retail for around $160.

* VKB T-rudder MkII pedals: Responsive pedals with a simple push down action (adjustable), but with no toe pedals. All metal, well constructed and not insanely priced. A mid-tier step between Saitek/CH Pedals and MFG or Slaw device.

* MFG Crosswind: Very high quality pedals.  Second only to Slaw Device pedals. Retail around $500-$600.

* Slaw Device Pedals: Best pedals on the market. Very expensive, but hand-made, all metal. Extremely high quality. Around $700 IIRC.


**Twist vs. No Twist**

This is largely an issue of personal preference, and there's valid points of view for it either way. I'll outline a couple based on my own experience:

Pros of Twist:

* Saves real-estate.

* Twist sticks are widely available by comparison.

* Don't need to invest in pedals.

* Arguably easier to use.

Cons of Twist:

* Axis bleed is a real issue.

* Torqueing motion is unnatural for the wrist, and it can start to ache after longer gaming sessions.

* Not as accurate as pedals.

* Generally leads to weaker stick.

* Can exasperate calibration issues.


After switching to a non-twist stick and getting pedals I'll never go back, but again, personal preference.

Also, /r/hotas

--------------------

,"I spotted the Alfine wheel late summer on a UK site and priced at £50.  The standard Alfine dynamo hub was also £50 so I had a choice of hub or wheel.  As my priority was/is all year, all weather commuting, I opted for the hub and rebuilt the wheel 32 (or is it 34?) by 3 cross as I wanted robust, weight doesn't matter, reliable winter wheels and easy to replace spokes.  I guessed that should I want a second dynamo wheel, I could pick up one of the £50 complete wheels in the near future. The Alfine wheel although tempting I thought was too light and low spoke'd for everyday use and with straight pull spoke, harder to replace spokes when they do go.

When I went back to the site recently, they have all gone.  I can't find them on anyone else's website.  The Shimano tech spec is there, but the internet has few results on reviews, users, sales, images etc.

As I had seen it on SJS cycles, I gave them a ring.  Their tech support told me that Shimano had built these wheels for an OEM - Cannondale he thought plus a couple of other smaller brands.  The wheel set was only sold through the OEMs, not released to the general public.  Once the OEM's had finished the production run of complete bikes, the Shimano surplus was released through a distribution channel for LBS's to buy and resell.  SJS got ~30 front dynamo wheels from the EU for sale in the UK - once gone, they are gone.  The retail cost was supposed to be around £150 per wheel, although they sold them for £50 each.  The hubs won't be released as a stand alone item - wheelsets only - and he was under the impression that unless there is another bulk demand call, the wheelsets won't be re-issued.

&gt; The problem with that logic is that no one believes our European partners, who crave renewed access to Iran&amp;#039;s markets, will reinstate sanctions unless Iran cheats flagrantly and egregiously on the deal, to the point where it would humiliate the EU internationally to look the other way.

&gt; Iran&amp;#039;s emboldened leaders would like to remind the world that they remain fully committed loathers of the United States:A video reportedly produced by the office of Iran&amp;#039;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and posted to social media Tuesday blames the United States and its allies for the Paris terror attacks.

&gt; The video, posted to a Facebook page affiliated with Iran&amp;#039;s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and first reported by the Middle East Media Research Institute, explains that the U.S. created the Islamic State to advance its own agenda...The narrator further alleges that the U.S. trained moderate Syrian rebels to &amp;quot;Join&amp;quot; the Islamic State in the Middle East and purposefully dropped weapons into the hands of IS terrorists there.

,"This is why you will live in your liberal media circlejerk.  I used to be just like you and gave conservative media no credit.  Once I started reading it though I was surprised how they actually look at issues from a serious point of view.  

Salon and Washington  are some of the worst sites to ever exist.  They just follow the SJW's tidal wave.  Conservative media will often look at an issue, such as the migrants in Europe, and from the  START will be saying this is bad and they explain the ramifications of why it will be harmful.  Meanwhile the liberal media calls everyone racists and says that they are all fleeing bombs so we HAVE to let them in cause ""muh refugees"".  They wont change their stance until the last minute when it is too late and they  are losing their liberal base.  Then they will just pretend they never said what they did for months and move onto the next issue. They have no principles whatsoever. 

Heres a great example. Liberals will tell Trump he shouldnt keep bringing up the muslim issue because ""he might cause more hate or violence"" and stigmatize all muslims.  Yet, they are the ones asking the questions and poking and prodding him trying to get him to say something racist.  He is the one saying ""its not all muslims but we have  an issue with radical islam"" and they respond with ""dont you think you are painting all muslims in a bad way"".  They are the racists.  

Its ridiculous because they think republican politicians are racist when they really aren't. Sure, lots of republican voters are, but can you blame someone for being racist if they grow up in a state where black people commit 80-90% of the crime and they see their taxes being paid to fund the welfare checks of the same people committing those crimes?  They might be wrong for turning into a racist but I dont blame them.  

White Liberals will constantly make excuses for blacks who hate cops and white people.  But when a white person who grew up with all that shit around them hates black people there are no excuses for them?

,"Nice explanation.

Another aspect of it is the reparation payments that Germany was expected to make after WWII. There was a plan to [prevent Germany from having any industries that could support military production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_plans_for_German_industry_after_World_War_II). However this was done in a way that meant West Germany couldn't support itself, let alone make reparation payments. Eventually a new plan was put in place where reparation payments were tied to exports so West Germany was actually required to focus on manufacturing.

You could argue that Germany has a strong industry because the Allies were greedy after WWII and were more concerned with extracting money from Germany than keeping Europe safe, and it was just by accident that they produced a rich and therefore stable Germany. The same solution can't be used for everyone since not all economies can be based on manufacturing and net exports, since there would be no one to sell to, but it's interesting that no one has really learned from this and Germany is still supporting austerity measures for Greece.",1,0,1448978553,,pirround,1,0,t3_3uznw6,cxj3cv5,explainlikeimfive,t1_cxj2428,,1451368005,False,False,t5_2sokd

,"Provide logistical, medical, strategic and air support for military forces directly fighting Daesh. provide food, clothing and shelters for refugees within the country in safe zones in non-daesh controlled areas way behind the frontlines. Pretty much as we've done in Iraq

don't provide them with advanced weaponry, give them FAC training and equipment maintenance training, they have more than enough weapons of all types to deal with what Daesh can throw at them but lack professional standards. Keeping them from fighting is based on reaching an acceptable middle ground, for the rebels that means representation of views and the rule of law without the threat of violence for political dissidence, for Assad it means letting him keep his little slice of Syria under his control and protection of minorities and a secular state.

Turkey is in a very tentative position, by attacking Russia they've opened them up to being kicked out of Nato and not being allowed into the EU... we have to strongarm them, Erdogan's mental but he's not an idiot, he knows he won't last long if they get chucked out of Nato. That honestly though is for diplomats far more capable than you or I, Turkey never accepts that they fuck over minorities constantly.

Fuck all in Syria, Daesh is pulling off it's spread only because everyone they can reach is currently fighting someone else, the easiest way to stop any advances they make right now is to stop fighting each other. In Iraq we can easily push them over the border, maybe even with some western or Iranian ground presence since both those are the most favoured in Iraq right now who can actually do it. in Syria they're unlikely to make much more headway now anyway unless one of the three major groups (Kurds, Assad or Rebel) give out, which'll only happen because of attacks by Turkey, Russia and Assad anyway so again a negotiated end of the civil war is the best way to hold them at bay. They won't gain any more ground because franky they're in a shit strategic position, in the center of a bigass desert surrounded by enemies on all sides and with fickle at best allies.

The Kurds are now semi-autonomous in Northern Iraq thanks to the United States and the majority of Iraqis, who are Shia, elect their own leaders via democracy now. They are the ones who ultimately won the Iraq war. 

""The point is that there have been places around the world with more brutal and wide spread genocides where the U.S. didnt even bother.""

President Bill Clinton said one of his greatest failures as a U.S. president was not stepping in to stop the Rwanda genocide in 1994. Saddam killed 200,000 of his own people in 1991 alone. President Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 which was only 36 months before 9/11. The act specifically called for the removal of Saddam Hussein and Clinton proceeded to bomb the fuck out of Iraq. Also remember President Clinton authorized the bombing of Eastern Europe to prevent the ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia.  

So yes the United States did use its military force to stop widespread slaughter and still does so today in regards to groups like ISIS and Assad. 

""But you think they went to Iraq to save the kurds and shia?""

Yes in addition to securing the worlds strategic energy reserves in Saudi Arabia. The United States was opening the world wide multi decade war on terror and you can bet your ass the generals deep in the halls of the still smoldering Pentagon wanted to secure that oil before deploying U.S. divisions to Asia.

Not arguing for it but arguing what actually happened.  

Saddam kills 200,000 of his own people in 1991 as the U.S. establishes No Fly Zones to protect them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_no-fly_zones

In Rwanda 500,00- 1,000,000 people are killed as Clinton regrets not intervening. ""According to the US's former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: ""The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again.""[230] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying ""I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.""[231]""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide

Clinton bombs Eastern Europe to prevent ethnic cleansing with UN approval. The bombing lasts until 1999.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia

36 months before 9/11 President Bill Clinton signs the Iraq Liberation Act that is passed with 100% Senate approval. The act expresses support to groups overthrowing Saddam but proceeds to bomb Iraq. Hundreds of cruise missiles and other ordinance specifically target command structure. Saddams personal palaces are also targeted. The Iraq Liberation Act specifically cites WMDs and is later invoked by congress when the grant President Bush war powers.

,"&gt; doing us a favor

Well for one, your electricity could be lower for a while - although not in the longer term. The investments + their ""nuclear tax"" they stated there would otherwise have gone straight to your bill. It's not them paying the taxes - it's YOU - using the nuclear energy they produce.

They should have been investing in actual real solutions to our energy problem all along. Placing a few wind-mills here and there is not going to solve that - you'd need a good amount of those to cover a fraction of our power consumption, and it's not a reliable 24/7 source. Instead they're just silently burning more and more coal, which spews out a lot more radioactivity than a nuclear generator ever would - also contributing to our CO2 emissions.

The problem imho is the entire 'anti-nuclear' sentiment that has plagued the energy market for the last 30 years since Chernobyl and was enforced by the more recent Fukushima disaster. I'm all for ""alternative energy"", but the problem is exactly what it's name implies: alternative. It's not (yet) feasible to rely on it completely, and most likely we'll never be able to. Sure, use solar where it's efficient (read: not in Belgium, but Spain has a few interesting projects going on), and wind is possible on small scale, but don't act as if that has no impact at all on the environment.

Development of nuclear energy however has grinded to a halt, and talking about possibly opening new reactors is a big taboo here in Europe. We still use reactors that run on expensive by-products of producing nuclear weapons, of which only 5% is burned on a good day, and where all safety mechanisms are active (meaning they need active intervention - if nothing happens: everything fails). In the people's perception, this seems to be the only option when it comes to nuclear energy, with all it's preconceptions and prejudices. There are however other ways of doing nuclear energy, like thorium, which is suitable for energy production but not for creating weapons (the US built a working reactor in the 70's), can have passive safety (if something fails, everything stops automatically), and burn almost all it's fuel and you can burn waste that was produced until now by 'conventional' reactors. The Chinese are building some at the moment - but even proposing that here? A big no go... Although the US military had a working thorium reactor in the 70's - the technology still in it's infancy - but funding ""nuclear research"" or building test reactors? Oh no!. But even if we had this technology ready right now and a design to build a nuclear reactor - this would still take 15 to 20 years to build - so that's no short term solution, even if it was considered.

In short: we're screwed. It all goes back to the the late 80's and '90's when investments that should have been done in nuclear energy were scrapped, with no alternatives - and right now, we're paying the price. Yes we have old reactors, but nobody ever thought of actually replacing them with something feasible - and as a result, energy prices are going to go up and up, and there's little you'll be able to do.",7,0,1448980142,Flanders,koffiezet,7,0,t3_3uzd29,cxj43lu,belgium,t1_cxj0jhs,011,1451368354,False,False,t5_2qhe6

,"Here is an excerpt about eggs from ""150 Healthiest Foods on Earth"" by Jonny Bowden :

Why Egg Yolks Are Actually Good for You

So what’s so great about eggs? Well, besides the abovementioned fact that they’re a perfect source of protein, containing all nine essential amino acids, they’re also loaded with vitamins and nutrients that help your eyes, your brain, and your heart. They’re one of the best sources of choline, which, though it’s not a vitamin, is an essential nutrient that must be consumed in the diet to maintain good health. Choline is essential for cardiovascular and brain function and for the health of your cell membranes. It’s an essential part of a phospholipid called phosphatidylcholine (the popular supplement lecithin is about 10 to 20 percent phosphatidylcholine). Without adequate phosphatidylcholine, both fat and cholesterol accumulate in the liver. Have you picked up on the paradox yet? People avoid egg yolks because they’re afraid of the cholesterol, but the choline in the egg yolk actually helps prevent the accumulation of cholesterol and fat in the liver! Egg yolks (and beef liver) are two of the richest dietary sources of phosphatidylcholine. One large egg provides 300 mcg of choline (all in the yolk), and also contains 315 mg of phosphatidylcholine.

There’s more to the choline story. Choline forms a metabolite in the body called betaine, which helps lower homocysteine, a risk factor for heart disease. And phosphatidylcholine is one of the most liver-friendly nutrients on the planet. In Europe, phosphatidylcholine is used to treat liver disease, and many nutritionists recommend it as part of a liver support program. Most liver metabolism occurs on cell membranes, and phosphatidylcholine is the universal building block for cell membranes. Phosphatidylcholine helps protect the liver from a wide range of toxic influences. And choline is also needed for the synthesis of acetylcholine, one of the major neurotransmitters in the body. Acetylcholine is critical for memory and thought; according to the Physicians’Desk Reference, adequate acetylcholine levels in the brain are believed to be protective against certain types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. So eggs—like fish—are truly brain food!",2,0,1448983455,,gnimoCsIretniW,2,0,t3_3uyj4b,cxj5v4o,nutrition,t3_3uyj4b,,1451369256,False,1448990890,t5_2qoox

,"When they arrive, they are free to live wherever they'd like. Many end up in the Greater DC area, in and around Houston, Dallas, and the Bay Area in San Francisco. Many end up getting jobs delivering pizzas, working at Walmart, Target, car dealerships. 

But, the sad reality is, many end up homeless and chronically unemployed. The deck is truly stacked against them - they arrive without any credit history, their education is basically considered worthless (because it wasn't completed here, Canada, or Western Europe), and they have no verifiable previous tax employment history in the US (all Giant red flags when one applies for a lease, financing for a car, a job, etc...). 

Many companies now employ HR software solutions that simply parse out their applications before a human being even looks at them. We have a guy in the DC area. He asked me to help him get a job at a local grocery store - Harris Teeter. We went to apply in person. He was told to go home and apply online. Many people, including him, come without a computer or even a concept of what it means to apply for a job online (it just doesn't happen in Afghanistan or Iraq). Nevertheless, we made him a resume and helped him fill out the application. He never even got an interview. We figured the software used to parse applications deemed his ""too expensive to verify"" (no credit history, no tax employment history, education claimed from some school in Afghanistan = very expensive to investigate). The HR software dropped his application from consideration before it was seen by a human being. 

The irony - he was once nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and has 25,000+ people who follow him on twitter: https://twitter.com/shafiqhamdam

People want to blame Israel and the Jews because they don't want to admit that all the historical and current evidence points unerringly to a conspiracy consisting mostly of WASPS to dominate and control the world; these people certainly aren't doing it in the best interests of other white anglo-saxon protestants either so don't try and pretend just because they look like you they think you're like them, they seem themselves as world ruling superhumans and you as a subhuman worker drone, but it's not the people that's really the problem it's the system - we need to change the system and make a fair world or things will keep getting worse at an increasing pace.

,"This is actually a regulation I support. Maybe I'm older than you? I remember prior to the EU mandate that all phones use the same charger.  Every single phone had a different charging port. None were compatible with each other. Every time you got a new phone, it usually came with one wall charger. But you'd have to go buy a new car charger. If you wanted a charger at work, go buy another. I had drawers full of old chargers. Multiply that by how many new phones are sold every year, and it adds up to millions of tons of perfectly good chargers being disposed of each year.

If you were at a friend's place, or in friends car, or at a hotel, and you needed a charge... Nope. They probably did not have a charger that would fit your phone. Your phone would be dead until you got back home. 

The standardization changed that. It worked pretty well. One loophole that I don't think the regulators foresaw was that even though the port is standard, manufacturers keep increasing the wattage. So my micro USB charger from 5 years ago is useless in today's phones.  But still the, the standard port size has saved me a lot of money. And it has gotten me out of a jam many times when my battery was dead/dying. There's always someone nearby with a charger I can borrow.

PS. I live in USA, not EU. I don't know if USA followed EU and mandated micro USB, or if manufacturers just adopted that in USA because it was easier to just build the same parts for USA and EU.

tl;dr: I'm glad that most phones now use the same charger.",6,0,1448985091,,zestypurplecatalyst,6,0,t3_3uztif,cxj6usu,explainlikeimfive,t1_cxj63rs,,1451369723,False,False,t5_2sokd

&gt; White Denim is a bluesy, jazzy, garage-rock trio, hailing from Austin, Texas USA. According to vocalist/guitarist James Petralli, White Denim’s songs are the musical manifestations of abstract paintings or philosophical tracts. He explained to UK music magazine the NME: ""The things that I like to read are generally abstract. I like patterns, I like reading poetry and avant-garde prose and I'm more interested in musical patterns in literature than I am in long-form narratives. I look at paintings and try to visualise an object or image, then assimilate how that makes me feel into a series of phrases and try to make it musical.""

&gt; In March 2005, the two bands Parque Touch (Josh Block, James Petralli, Lucas Anderson) and Peach Train (Steve Terebecki) played a show together at Beerland in Austin, Texas. After the show Steve was asked to play bass for Parque Touch and the band became four, playing under the pseudonyms Byshop Massive (Lucas), Bop English (James), Nicholas Mallard (Josh), and Terry Beckins (Steve); however, in February 2006, Lucas moved to Russia and the resulting power trio changed its name to White Denim. The new line-up began playing the local Austin circuit while recording punk-infused, psychedelic blues-rock in Block's 1940s Spartan trailer.

&gt; In 2007, the band self-released its first EP entitled Let's Talk About It on 7"" only, but later these tracks became available on iTunes. While on tour in 2007, the band recorded its second album and sold copies as a nine-song ""tour EP"" entitled Workout Holiday, which was only sold at shows. Workout Holiday caught the ear of new record label RCRD LBL (an online record label releasing exclusive and completely free music from emerging and established artists), and the band signed on to re-record three of the songs from Workout Holiday. These songs were exclusively released as the RCRD LBL EP, one Mp3 track at a time over the course of the first few months of 2008.

&gt; Since these releases, the band has toured extensively, playing shows including SXSW and CMJ Music Marathon, and also received the award of ""Best New Band"" at the 2008 Austin Music Awards. In order to reach European listeners, the band signed to U.K. record label Full Time Hobby (home to The Hold Steady and Viva Voce) for an overseas release.[8] The first release on Full Time Hobby was the single ""Let’s Talk About It"" b/w ""Darksided Computer Mouth"". One June 23, 2008, the band released its debut album, the Workout Holiday LP, which consists of re-recorded songs from the band's first two self-released EPs along with some new tracks.

&gt; White Denim have also finished recording their debut U.S. full-length LP, which will be entitled Exposion. Originally sold during their Spring 2008 tour as a CDR with the title 11 Songs, the album is planned to be released by the summer of 2008. The new album will be self-released much like the Let's Talk About EP (on vinyl and digital format only), reporting that ""CDs seem pretty worthless to us"".

,"I don't think it would be problematic. Unless you think the last 1000+ years of Christian history has been ""problematic.""

&gt;“Whoever does not embrace the Catholic Christian faith is lost, like your false prophet Muhammad.”

-St. Peter Mavimenus (d. 8th century), martyr from Gaza. Response reported in the Martyriologum Romanum when he was asked to convert to Islam by a group of Muslims.

&gt;“There is also the superstition of the Ishmaelites which to this day prevails and keeps people in error, being a forerunner of the Antichrist…. From that time to the present a false prophet named Mohammed has appeared in their midst. This man, after having chanced upon the Old and New Testaments and likewise, it seems, having conversed with an Arian monk, devised his own heresy. Then, having insinuated himself into the good graces of the people by a show of seeming piety, he gave out that a certain book had been sent down to him from heaven. He had set down some ridiculous compositions in this book of his and he gave it to them as an object of veneration.”

-St. John Damascene (d. 749), Syrian Arab Catholic monk and scholar. Quoted from his book On Heresies under the section On the Heresy of the Ishmaelites (in The Fathers of the Church. Vol. 37. Translated by the Catholic University of America. CUA Press. 1958. Pages 153-160.)

&gt;“We profess Christ to be truly God and your prophet to be a precursor of the Antichrist and other profane doctrine.”

-Sts. Habenitus, Jeremiah, Peter, Sabinian, Walabonsus, and Wistremundus (d. 851), martyrs of Cordoba, Spain. Reported in the Memoriale Sanctorum in response to Spanish Umayyad Caliph ‘Abd Ar-Rahman II’s ministers that they convert to Islam on pain of death.

&gt;“Any cult which denies the divinity of Christ, does not profess the existence of the Holy Trinity, refutes baptism, defames Christians, and derogates the priesthood, we consider to be damned.”

-Sts. Aurelius, Felix, George, Liliosa, and Natalia (d. 852), martyrs of Cordoba, Spain. Reported in the Memoriale Sanctorum in response to Spanish Umayyad Caliph ‘Abd Ar-Rahman II’s ministers that they convert to Islam on pain of death.

&gt;“On the other hand, those who founded sects committed to erroneous doctrines proceeded in a way that is opposite to this, the point is clear in the case of Muhammad. He seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity. He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his arms—which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants.”

-St. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274), Theologian and Doctor of the Church. Quoted from his De Rationibus Fidei Contra Saracenos, Graecos, et Armenos and translated from Fr. Damian Fehlner’s Aquinas on Reasons for the Faith: Against the Muslims, Greeks, and Armenians (Franciscans of the Immaculate. 2002.).

 &gt;“As we have seen, Muhammed had neither supernatural miracles nor natural motives of reason to persuade those of his sect. As he lacked in everything, he took to bestial and barbaric means, which is the force of arms. Thus he introduced and promulgated his message with robberies, murders, and bloodshedding, destroying those who did not want to receive it, and with the same means his ministers conserve this today, until God placates his anger and destroys this pestilence from the earth.

&gt;[…]

&gt;(Muhammad) can also be figured for the dragon in the same Apocalypse which says that the dragon swept up a third of the stars and hurled down a third to earth. Although this line is more appropriately understood concerning the Antichrist, Mohammed was his precursor – the prophet of Satan, father of the sons of haughtiness.

&gt;[…]

&gt;Even if all the things contained in his law were fables in philosophy and errors in theology, even for those who do not possess the light of reason, the very manners (Islam) teaches are from a school of vicious bestialities. (Muhammad) did not prove his new sect with any motive, having neither supernatural miracles nor natural reasons, but solely the force of arms, violence, fictions, lies, and carnal license. It remains an impious, blasphemous, vicious cult, an innovention of the devil, and the direct way into the fires of hell. It does not even merit the name of being called a religion.”

-St. Juan de Ribera (d.1611), Archbishop of Valencia, missionary to Spanish Muslims, and organizer of the Muslim expulsions of 1609 from Spain. Quoted in several locations from his 1599 Catechismo para la Instruccion de los Nuevos Convertidos de los Moros (my translation).

 
&gt;“The Mahometan paradise, however, is only fit for beasts; for filthy sensual pleasure is all the believer has to expect there.”

St. Alfonsus Liguori (d. 1787). Quoted from his book, The History of Heresies and their Refutation.

""What is obvious from these statements is that represent a very different view of Islam than we’ve heard from the Vatican in recent years. The recent dormancy of Islam has led many in this generation to believe precisely as Pope Francis does: that it is only Muslim extremists who pose a threat, and that the religion itself is more or less praiseworthy. The experiences of most of the saints throughout Church history, however, taught them the opposite — namely, that Islam and its practices are antithetical to the Catholic faith and those who seek to live it.""

Hilaire Belloc, the great 20th century Catholic historian and poet, warned in 1929 that Islam would make a return to the world stage:

&gt;We shall almost certainly have to reckon with Islam in the near future. Perhaps, if we lose our Faith, it will rise. For after this subjugation of the Islamic culture by the nominally Christian had already been achieved, the political conquerors of that culture began to notice two disquieting features about it. The first was that its spiritual foundation proved immovable; the second that its area of occupation did not recede, but on the contrary slowly expanded.

&gt;[…]

&gt;In my own youth the decaying power of Islam (for it was still decaying) in the Near East was a strong menace to the peace of Europe. Those old people of whom I speak had grandparents in whose times Islam was still able to menace the West. The Turks besieged Vienna and nearly took it, less than a century before the American Declaration of Independence. Islam was then our superior, especially in military art. There is no reason why its recent inferiority in mechanical construction, whether military or civilian, should continue indefinitely. Even a slight accession of material power would make the further control of Islam by an alien culture difficult. A little more and there will cease that which our time has taken for granted, the physical domination of Islam by the disintegrated Christendom we know.

And then, of course, the history of popes acting and speaking against Islam.",6,0,1448985190,,Hurrah_for_Karamazov,6,0,t3_3uw8c4,cxj6wxk,Catholicism,t1_cxj6rhm,,1451369751,False,1448985548,t5_2qi4f

It's not removed by a power-tripping mod or because it hurts people's feelings.

&gt;if ISIS wanted to launch an attack in Canada, trying to manipulate the refugee process would be a highly ineffective way of doing it. Most candidates for resettlement from refugee camps are referred to Canada by the United Nations refugee agency, which identifies legitimate refugees with the greatest needs. These typically include vulnerable groups such as women and children, those with medical needs, and survivors of violence and torture. Those who qualify are then considered by Canadian immigration officials, who conduct additional screening on security, medical and other grounds. It would be a lengthy and onerous process for any prospective terrorist, especially compared to jumping on a migrant boat to Europe.

&gt;Testifying before a Congressional Homeland Security Committee hearing this summer, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a security analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that for these reasons, exploiting the refugee system would not be a “primary concern” for ISIS and other terrorist groups. Instead, he said they would be more likely to use online radicalization to inspire someone already in the U.S. or Canada to launch an attack.

There is a bit more gray area in this than your absurd depiction, and these are substantive non semantic issues. Yes there are problems in many (but not all) of these Muslim high concentration zones. These problems are very concerning. From what I can tell there are no such problems for the other religions in these westernized countries.

Another nuance which has been troubling me about the vast number of Syrian refugees in Europe is that the refugee population is being targetted by ISIS for recruiting. So even when you have people who arrive with no terrorist sympathies, organizations like ISIS regard them as a fertile recruiting ground. What makes organizations like ISIS a real security risk is that not only do they have global reach, but they have resilience. When you kill them off as we and others have done, they refill their ranks at a rate faster than they die off. How do you actually make progress then? Kill recruitment. What is it about these communities that makes them such great recruiting prospects? Is it the alienation and isolation in a foreign land?

HOWEVER, they were XBox/XBox 360 exclusives. The numbers, I hate to say it, kind of lie when you factor in just how absolutely unpopular those systems were in Japan. I think you would see a drastic difference in units sold if the game had been on a Playstation 2 or 3.

Even so, the last entry only sold 250,000 copies. That's not very impressive, and consider that the entire DOA franchise, as a whole, has been steadily less popular as time goes on. I dare say that they might be looking at the numbers of the last official fighting game entry, DOA 5, and seriously considering whether some niche off-shoot product is actually worth their time and effort to bring to the US and Europe.

,"As others have said, the toilet is too close to the wall. Normally the minimum clearance for an adult is 12"" from the finished wall to the center line of the toilet (residential). You will end up hating it so much you tear it out in the future if you don't get close to this minimum, I promise. 18"" is used in public spaces that are ADA compliant.

To get both the sink and the toilet usable (it will still look a little odd, but it's a small 1/2 bath, there's no way around that), I would switch the toilet to the opposite side of that wall if possible (makes the door much easier to use), offset it at least 12"", and then center the sink in the area that is left on the opposite side, midway between the *edge* of the toilet and the South wall in Picture #3. Opening to predominantly the mirror/sink will be more aesthetically appealing than opening to the toilet as well.

If the toilet has to stay close to where it is, get your 12"" clearance, and center the sink in the leftover space, instead of trying to center it in the room.

Another alternative is could the toilet be on the North wall of Picture #3?

I like your idea here, most half baths have no thought put into them whatsoever, and it shows. You are doing a lot here with almost no space, which is great. A 3/4 bath in a 1/2 space normally isn't this attractive.

You will have to put a few inch tall shower edge around the whole thing, especially at the door, which normally means either stepping over it to get into the bathroom (tripping hazard), or down into a sunken floor. There may be a way to do that with more finesse, but I'm not sure what it is.

Don't give up on the idea for the shower/bathroom combo, it is much more prevalent in Asia/Europe than it is in America, and a lot of them are done very well. I would look for instances in other countries to see how they solve the toilet paper problem (nook in wall with a sealed door/cover?).

Completely false, how do you explain Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia etc etc etc?

How are products cheaper if you don't import?  Protectionism results in INCREASED prices.

,"It ""works"" in that you have a lower risk of losing. You can always catch up as long as you don't run out of funds completely. But when you win after a streak of losses, you only effectively change the outcome of your original bet, since all the subsequent bets are only chasing that loss.

For instance, if you make a starting bet of $10 and you have $10240 of funds, you'd be bankrupted by a streak of ten losses. In European roulette (betting on red, say) the probability of such a streak is 0.129%. So far from cheating the casino, you're really just betting $10240 on 99.871% odds of winning $10.

That's not better or worse than any other strategy, it's just a different risk profile. In the end you still get an average 97.2 cents back for every dollar you bet.

Also of course games like roulette will have a maximum bet, and that interferes with the doubling strategy (called the Martingale System, for what it's worth).

,"You could take the hard science route (matriarchal-egeliterian culture based in/around ancient Minos and Crete), or the completely fantasy/scifi route. I wouldn't mind either way. But there should be a sense that you are struggling against decay, against entropy, against time itself somehow. 

That being said, you'll have a few things to decide. Firstly, if you go the scifi/fantasy route, you'll have to decide where to put it (large island west of Europe?) or if your going for the 'isolated survivors' route, the latter of which isn't any MORE historical, but you can at least make it -feel- historical. Again, you'd have to find where to put them, and you'd still want some mechanics to support that this is a culture thats long past the point of...if Byzantium was a decayed Rome, anything you have from Atlantis has to be even worse off at this point, to be so completely erased by history, and it should probably be a challenge to reverse that.

The historical route would be harder, because ancient Minoan culture is 2k years gone by this point in the game.

why is it singled out incidents for hindus but not muslims? 

that is my point exactly. 

and this incident is no different. 

it doesn't take more than a few seconds to find hindus demonstrating like this with a few google search. 

you don't label all hindus with those incidents. you call them isolated incidents. 

why not judge muslims with the same ruler? 

&gt;2002 riots should not have happened. There is no one who doesn't agree with this.

but it did, and it is a part of hindu history. 

you can't say hindu incidents are isolated and muslims incidents are epidemic of a problem with muslims. 

judge with the same standard both. 

&gt;Hindu's are any day more tolerant than any nation especially islamic nation. 

Are they? Or is it just a case of a lack of opportunity till now? 

As hindus didn't exist as an entity till independence. 


And since then there has been plenty of violence, i know of indian history and how they burned trains full of muslims. 

And i know of the caste system and the rape, abuse, and oppressing of the lower castes. 

We are seeing that with power, hindus are no different. 

&gt;Is there any other non-muslim majority nation which had a head of state as Muslim(and other minorities too)? Various billionaires and superstars who are loved throughout the country and are Muslims? They will any day choose to stay in India ( and stay around Hindu's) than go to any western country or any Islamic nation!

i do not label hindus all the same. 

But i do see the beginnings of fascism and intolerance creeping into India and Hindus. Ghandhis teachings are dying. 

Soon all of this you have said will no longer be true. 

&gt;I compared with Non-Muslim majority states, because when a nation is Muslim majority, there isn't a minority to talk about. Forget about having non-Muslim head of states, billionaires, Superstars in that country.

You ignore turkey, and most of eastern European Muslim nations like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan etc. 

But Muslims don't have even muslims as their heads of state. So hardly a fair comparison. 

People like saudi royal family, are called muslims. But if they were representing muslims why do muslims want them out? 

why did the whole arab spring happen.

""[T]he expansion of the peoples of white, or European, blood during the past four centuries . . . has been fraught with lasting benefit to most of the peoples already dwelling in the lands over which the expansion took place.""  That's despite what the remnants of Native Americans or Blacks or Filipinos or others might mistakenly believe.  Actually, genocide denial has been a leading and highly valued feature of the intellectual and moral culture in the United States and remains so right until the present. . . .  With regard to the conquest of a half of Mexico, Roosevelt explained that it was ""inevitable,"" and ""in the highest degree desirable for the good of humanity at large, that the American people should ultimately crowd out the Mexicans.""

,"&gt;Sarcasm, yes? Well, okay, if thats what suits you.

Would you preferred if I had just plainly listed all these examples of how economists look to the future? I could have written all these into a musical, it doesn't really matter. The point is your claim that economists don't think about the future and only care about the past is just flat wrong. I think the reason you keep butting heads with badecon is not because you are an investor but because you make absurd statements like that!

&gt;Many more economists are wrong, then right... otherwise we would be able to avoid all these crashes? Otherwise, they would all be millionaires... Right? Otherwise, the EU wouldnt be having all of these economic issues.

Oh because were all not millionaires and the business cycle exist all economics is wrong? There's never any factors that cause crashes other than ""economists are wrong and don't understand the future?"" The EU only has problems because economic thinking is incorrect? I'd suggest actually looking deeply into the causes for the financial crisis (which a major factor was, guess what, bad investors!) and the subsequent eruo debt crisis to understand how they occur other than just ""economist ignorance. There are more factors than just economics at play and governments do not end up solely running the economy on economic principles. Again, absurd claims like these are probably why you run into trouble around here.

&gt;Most investors are shitty, hardly ""all powerful seer,"" just divergent interests. Investors also come up in trade against each other, so there has to be a loser. There is no perfect trade, and looking for one will only damage your results.

I didn't say there werent shit investors. Just making fun of the fact that you felt all superior because you were an investor, so only you knew about the future, not us dumb economists. Also, there doesn't have to be a loser in investment. That's not how it works.

&gt;I dont know, I feel like these type of nasty sarcastic comments doenst really contribute much.

It wasn't particularly nasty. It just pointed out many examples that proved your claim false. I would posit that your type of ""ridiculous, unbacked, patently false"" comments don't really contribute much.

&gt;So, how many of you economists are wealthy millionaire investors also? I'm pretty results driven.

,"&gt; This statement , given the number of baseless ISDS cases suggest your head is now completely absorbed by the anal cavity it is stuck in

Heh. Baseless cases lose - admittedly, probably not from your perspective, since I think it's pretty clear you regard 100% of ISDS cases as baseless. 

Also, I seem to have annoyed you somehow. Or possibly you're just rude.

&gt;Because in this case they are irrelevant. If you write a law, but only apply it to foreign companies that is clearly discrimination. If you write a law and it applies to everyone it is not discrimination.

Again, I'd say this shows pretty clearly how the distinction between law and its application is not something you get (or, more ironically, get but aren't applying). A law does not have to be discriminatory in itself to be applied in a discriminatory way, and the distinction is both obvious and important.

Say a country made a law that said some minority couldn't sing in public. That's clearly a case where the law itself is discriminatory.

Now, say a country made a law that said nobody could sing in public. Clearly the law itself is not discriminatory. But let's say they only *apply* it to a particular minority - they don't prosecute anyone under the law except people from that minority.

That's a case where although the law itself is not discriminatory - on paper, it applies to everyone - its *application* is discriminatory.

In the Vattenfall Moorburg case, the requirements to comply with EU Directives were not properly applied either when Hamburg made the original deal with Vattenfall, nor when the Greens changed the deal, nor when Hamburg agreed to change them back. The issue in question was never the regulations themselves, but the application of them by Hamburg to the Moorburg plant. Vattenfall won their case because the regulations weren't properly applied - the decision taken by the Greens to change the conditions for Moorburg was a politically prompted one, not a legally required or proper one.

If the EU now win their case against Germany, the appropriate regulations will have to be properly applied to the Moorburg plant. If that makes Moorburg no longer viable, that's just tough for Vattenfall - there will be no ISDS case if the law is properly applied, and there would have been no case in the first place if it had been, either.",0,0,1448991799,Ireland/EU,Bowgentle,0,0,t3_3uz9ny,cxjbay8,europe,t1_cxjaqgm,IREL,1451371819,False,1448994176,t5_2qh4j

,"I read your first couple of posts and it was really interesting, since I'm currently one season into a Palace career. I identified the same weaknesses as you, but I chose to spend less on the main CB (I got the other Pogba brother from a French club for about 5m) and go for a more expensive backup RW/RM in Redmond and attacking mid (Gauld)

At striker I went for Alassane Plea from Nice, he cost about 6.5m. He's fast, an excellent finisher, good dribbling, seemed to have good potential and was fun to use. I can't recommend him enough.  Nice were mid table last season so presumably not in Europe, so it'd be a realistic signing for Palace. For backup LB I went for Jordan Obita from Reading and again, I can't recommend him enough. He cost 1.8m and is 70 rated but felt better than that, one of the best attacking full backs I've used. Again, pretty realistic for Palace too.

,"The US hate is pretty recent and results from America's more recent involvement in the Middle East compared to the likes of Russia, England, or France. America actually had a fairly positive image in the Middle East after Woodrow Wilson and the Americans led the charge for national self-determination following World War I. As the British and French pulled out of the Middle East following World War II, the US took up their mantle and began to meddle much more, both for oil politics and for Cold War proxy reasons.

Other powers had a more dubious reputation. Ottoman citizens and policy makers were very much aware of British, French, Italian, and Russian designs on their territory. Those countries granted citizenship to people born in the Ottoman Empire that would otherwise have been Ottoman nationals. These people received many privileges on account of their European passports. All four of those countries repeatedly chipped away at Ottoman borders (France: Algeria and Tunisia, Britain: Cyprus, Russia: Balkans and Caucasus, Italy: Libya). Despite this, your average Middle East Citizen was probably not particularly ""Anti-Western."" 

European powers were extremely brutal to colonized Middle Eastern peoples. Before WWI, the Ottoman Empire could protect many Middle Eastern people within and outside of its borders. European powers would often be wary of mistreating people in former Ottoman territories, as the Ottomans could and did apply diplomatic pressure. The Europeans did not take this pressure lightly. In fact, one of the great fears of the British and French in 1914 was that their Muslim colonial peoples in Algeria and India would rise up to support the Ottomans after the Ottomans threw in with the Germans. After WWI, there was no ""Muslim European power"" like the Ottomans to try and protect Middle Eastern and North African peoples. the Turkish Republic turned inwards and became extremely disinterested in the fates of its former imperial holdings.

After WWI, the French, British, and Italians were free to pacify their new holdings, which were, in the Arab East, classified as ""mandates"" and not colonies. This designation supposedly meant they were more ""civilized"" peoples that were close to full membership in the world order than most colonized peoples, but the British and French ended up treating them like colonies. 

After WWI, those three powers tried to subdue insurgencies on the cheap. Combined with new technologies developed in WWI, this meant lots of bombings and sometimes chemical gassings of rebels. The French brutally put down the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925, indiscriminately shelling Damascus. In the 1930s the Italians ""pacified"" eastern Libya by bombing and gassing nomadic rebels, and eventually began putting them in concentration camps. The British decided Iraq was too far away from supply lines to rule with a full army of occupation, so they decided to run the mandate by ruthlessly bombing restive tribes and populations that wouldn't submit to the British authorities in Baghdad. Bombs were cheaper and resulted in far less British casualties than a full occupational army. 

In the end, European colonial rule in the Middle East was extremely brutal. This period (1920s-30s) is when the ""crusade"" discourse emerged. No one on either side (Christian or Muslim) particularly remembered the Crusades from the time they happened until European conquerors began showing up in the Levant. Europeans, particularly the French, partly saw themselves as renewing the Crusades' goal of bringing Enlightenment to the Holy Land. Muslim populations saw that rhetoric, and intellectuals started reminding Middle Eastern populations how awful the Crusades had been for Muslims. This rhetoric, combined with the brutality of the colonial regimes, created a lot of anger and what we now would call anti-Western sentiment. As mentioned earlier in my post, the US inherited a lot of this animus after they began being more active in the Middle East following the Anglo-French withdrawal following WW2. All of this is independent of the anger generated by the Israel/Palestine situation and the US's unconditional support for Israel.

So: The hate is older than US support for Israel, but not that much older. It most certainly does not go all the way back to the Crusades, even though those have become a popular topic since the 1920s. A lot of it is inherited from the anti-western sentiment generated by European colonial powers. Some good books are Makdisi's ""Faith Misplaced"" on US-Arab relations, Provence's ""Great Syrian Revolt"" on the French in Syria, and Lindqvist's ""Bomb the Savages"" is a great, quick read on the brutality of European powers in the Middle East post WW 1.",12,0,1448995810,19th &amp; 20th c.

,"Here's the strange part:

&gt;  Another inmate was stabbed after he refused to leave when it was discovered that he had a prior conviction for statutory rape -- he was 18 and the woman 16 -- and the victim later became his wife of 20 years.  There is little sympathy extended to such offenders by other inmates.

Assuming there are no other details being hidden: the ages being correct, no inappropriate pictures being taken of the 16 year old, no Mann Act violations (transporting a minor across state lines for sexual purposes), no money/cash payments/remuneration/etc...

I will say that this kind of relationship is not only not inherently problematic (two year age difference, younger person being 16), but it's *flat out legal* in most U.S. states! Same with Canada and almost all of Europe. **This should not be a problem!** Why on earth is this being made into an issue?
 
I think somebody should write a letter criticizing this prisoner. The prisoners should be sent letters saying that such statutory rape violations (which only occur in certain states anyway) should NOT be ""chomo"" shit.

Also this is a case for making prosecutions of 18 year olds who are with 16 year olds (with no other circumstances like what I mentioned) *untenable* and *unenforcable*, meaning digging up dirt on state prosecutors who pursue these cases to force them to lose their jobs. Having prosecutors mass-exposed as being corrupt/criminal themselves (even adultery is a crime in many U.S. states!) can provide the impetus to force ""Romeo and Juliet"" laws which make these relationships (younger being 16, older being 18) inherently legal. That way ""moral panic"" cannot be used to prevent reasonable reform, because the ""moral panickers"" are exposed as being dirty.",1,0,1448996153,,lumloon,1,0,t3_3v16xb,cxjefts,ageofconsent,t3_3v16xb,,1451373366,False,1448998091,t5_2vi5m

,"What's a racist? 
Let me tell you something. I'm in my mid twenties and for the past year I have been thinking more and more, and deeper and deeper, of the kind of world I want to live in. The kind of world I want to have a family in. And everything that goes against that not something I will tolerate or condone. Everything I do in my life is driven by that sentiment. 

Multiple races in an area have shown to decrease trust, increase crime, decrease community cohesion, etc. That sort of thing goes against what sort of society I want to live in. Add terrorism, mass pedophilia and rape gangs and that's all a big no no. 

Surely, there are some arabs and blacks that are decent, but that's not the point. They're decent despite the fact that they are arabs and blacks not because they are arabs and blacks. What the majority of arabs and black stand for is shit, this is why their countries are shit. What the majority of blacks and arabs think is good is shit, this is why their societies are shit. 

There is that meme that says that arabs are unhappy in all arab countries but they are happy in european countries so ofc the answer is to turn the european countries into their shit countries. It may be funny, but it is true. A country is not the dirt, it's the people. And when the people change, the country changes too. 

This isn't to say that white people are these wonderful angelic fairy people. But we can survive our less than stellar people in the proportions that they come in, but we can't survive the less than stellar people of other races too. 

So drive it home, if having the society I want to live in, a good, progressive (not in the SJW sense), developed , peaceful and truly tolerant and truly diverse (where it matters) society means that non-whites have to get out of my space, than that's that. 

To end on another note. If there were a race of blue people whom would be a considerable bonus to having in our society, I would have nothing against them. But having blacks and arabs into our society is clearly not a considerable bonus, in fact, it's a considerable mallus.

,"&gt; Babies are born not believing in any gods or following any religious traditions

False. While it's true babies aren't born into the tenets of established organized religion, babies are in fact born religious. *Everyone is*. Did you even glance at the link?

&gt;Also religion isn't about seeking answers and the truth, historically it's about dogma and control

That's your religion's definition of other religions. 

&gt;Almost every major scientific discovery has been met with hostility by religious communities from the heliocentric model of the solar system to evolution

No, many major scientific discoveries were met with hostility by the *predominant scientific community at the time*, which happened to usually also be the dominant religion. Until the whole ""science vs religion"" fallacy that atheists like to propagate, science and the church were essentially the same institution. In Europe especially, the church made the first universities, preserved and advanced scientific knowledge from the fall of Rome onwards, and were largely responsible for the west retaining any scientific knowledge at all. 

The reason many new discoveries (even today) are met with hostility or sharp criticism, even when right, is because the scientific authorities (and humans in general) *hate being wrong*. That's it. Simple truth. It's not because ""religion hates science!!!11!!1"" or anything silly like that; history proves otherwise. It's because one scientist thought himself pretty hot stuff and didn't like another scientist telling him what he'd been teaching for decades was all backwards. It's still like this today, and anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves. 

And for the record, the most heat the heliocentric model faced was back in the day when most heliocentric models were horribly flawed (as science just wasn't capable of explaining certain phenomena such as stellar parallax in a heliocentric model, while geocentric models had an apparent (though incorrect) answer). Once the models presented got stronger, opposition did fade. 

&gt;There's a reason why the mostly secular societies have had more progress

No source on this. 

&gt; because religion boggs it down

Again, history proves otherwise; it practically screams ""Science! Brought to you by religion."" Religion is one tool for understanding the world around us. Science is another. Each has their appropriate spheres; back before the most recent atheism fad (the last being in the ancient Greek era unless I missed one somewhere), the men of learning of the age studied both, and the Church and the Universities were synonymous.

,"As a Scot and a libertarian I don't think ""independence"" is the best idea. I think its massively counter productive in fact. For a few reasons:

1. Hitching libertarianism to independence is a bad idea, since we already had a referendum on that and it failed. Campaigning for another one will result in people dismissing the whole thing, libertarianism along with it. There's already a slang term for it its called ""the neverendum"".

2. The EU. The EU is the biggest socialist super-state on Earth. So far the UK, as a whole, has managed to hold it back. I don't think Scotland could do that on its own. We would end up the EU's bitch. So much for independence. I have no love for Westminster, but I at least know who David Cameron is (even if I think he's a bawbag).

3. Scotland is very leftist. Hate to say it, but it is. As a whole, it is very left leaning. A UK libertarian party would probably have more success because of the larger concentration of conservative/libertarian leaning populations in the south (i.e. London). If it was an exclusively Scottish libertarian party, its actually increased as a percentage the number of left leaning voters.

As the League of Legends off-season progresses, we've taken stock of what's been an amazingly successful year for Fnatic. For some, it’s been a time of reflection on many years of Fnatic achievements. After five years of playing in Europe, and many triumphant years at the heart of our League of Legends team, Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim has decided he needs a change of scenery in order to start a new adventure. As a result, we’ve some further news to share regarding our League of Legends team.

YellOwStaR’s spent five years playing in the European League of Legends scene and the majority of his career flying our flag. He’s now chosen to experience a new environment and culture outside of the EU LCS in Berlin and his homeland of France, where he’s lived and gamed for many years, even before his League career.

As the in-game corner stone of the 2015 team, and Fnatic brand ambassador at large, we were looking at the prospect to have YellOwStaR within our organisation for many more years, not just as a player but as core member of the Fnatic organization. As our discussions continued, it became apparent that desires for different experiences and new challenges were very high on his list of priorities. Even though our offer remained higher than others and included more long term ways to be rewarded, YellOwStaR valued challenging himself and experiencing new things above all else, and we understand and respect his decision to head abroad.

YellOwStaR will make an announcement on his future plans in the coming weeks. We’d like to take this opportunity to thank him for all his hard work, commitment, success and comedy pentakill denials he’s brought to Fnatic and you, our fans.

As YellOwStaR  departs, we want to give you a quick update on how our plans for 2016 are progressing.

Firstly, we have a core line up of Febiven, Rekkles and our tireless Coach in Deilor who are at the moment busy holding tryouts, and looking forward to announcing our new lineup in the next few weeks. Secondly, as part of our commitment to our team and drive to increase the support around our players, we’re recruiting two analysts to be a part of the core infrastructure that will work with our new line-up for more success - you can read more about that here.

Finally, we’re tripling our investment into LoL to ensure that we’re a competitive force in League of Legends for many more years to come - look out for further announcements soon.  For our fans, we appreciate your support and understand this may be a tough time… we apologise! However we’ve built World Championship teams before - and with a world-class core to build around, we’ll be working hard to do the same again. Roll on the new season!





If we had to describe YellOwStaR in three words, they’d be leadership, dedication and resilience. It’s been 3 years since Bora “YellOwStaR” Kim first started wearing Black and Orange. When he first joined in 2013, he was already known for his ADC exploits, including epic Ashe arrows, and he already had a few major tournaments under his belt, but we could see he was thirsty for more. Putting in a lot of individual training time with his trademark focus and dedication, Bora made a successful transition to Support from ADC in the 2013 Summer Split. It paid off when he helped bring Fnatic all the way to 3rd/4th place in the Season 3 World Championship alongside sOAZ, Cyanide, xPeke and Puszu with Bora's patented Leona supporting and shotcalling.




With time, YellOwStaR grew not only into the best Support in Europe, but also into a captain and leader – his composure during games enabled him to build a tight bond between his teammates. Bora’s leadership and determination were put in the spotlight this year when four new players joined the 2015 Fnatic roster. Even though it seemed like a Herculean task to start from scratch, Bora’s leadership came together with our organisational support and management to forge a winning team that achieved a perfect Summer Split, as well as a run to the semi-finals of the Season 5 World Championship.




Bora’s leadership skills and in-game coordination, combined with his persistent hard work, game sense and understanding, have always helped his teammates grow and achieve their potential. We think that’s what a true leader does - motivate his teammates, and push them to their limits! He’s also shown immense ability to adapt, and help others adapt with him. With admirable self-criticism and evaluation, he’s always been able to recognise his own areas for improvement, and backs that awareness up with the work ethic to push himself further.

Sometimes, leaders have to make serious decisions. Ninja'ing a penta kill at Worlds is definitely one of those moments you can't let your team have it their own way all the time ;) You'll see what we mean in the video below.

Thank you for all your efforts Bora! We wish you all the best in your future endeavors as you explore a new land.


Patrik “cArn” Sättermon - Chief Gaming Officer, Fnatic:

On behalf of everyone in Fnatic, I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Bora for his phenomenal performance and achievements over these past three years. Bora joined our ranks in 2013 and he soon established himself in a role as the team’s glue and leader, known and appreciated for his consistency and ability to adapt.

When we understood that Yellowstar had sincere interest in pursuing a new journey and chapter of his already successful career, we did everything in our power to provide him with an offer and path within our organisation that would make him reconsider. However, we soon realized what we probably already knew: that someone as determined and curious like Bora thrives from trying new things - the very same traits that made him to the player and person he is today.

Although our team’s foundation is shaken from the recent player changes, we have full faith in our team management’s ability to rebuild solid team structures, and we will communicate our 2016 line-up as soon as our internal tryouts are over.

Finally, I would once again like to thank Yellowstar for his awesome and loyal service the past years and best of luck with your future endeavours!

Martin ""Rekkles"" Larsson - Fnatic ADC

After playing together for about 1-2 years, it's saddening to see Bora seek his future elsewhere. The time together has been both inspirational &amp; instructive and it has helped me become the person &amp; player I am today. Therefore, Bora has in many ways always been some sort of ""safe card"" for not only me, but everyone involved. However, what he has done for the team &amp; organisation shall continue regardless of his presence. I wish him all the best moving forward and once again I'm grateful for all the things he's done. A tough road lies ahead, but I'm excited to see what the future has to offer and together we shall see it become a cheerful one!

Bora ""Yellowstar"" Kim -

Starting today, I will no longer be part of Fnatic.
My Esports journey as a real professional player all started in 2013. It was a tough choice, a huge turn in my life to finally decide to quit university to take a lifetime opportunity to experience this amazing path and get to work with awesome people. In the first place, I want to thank the 2013 League of Legends' roster for choosing me over other players. I was joining the biggest European team and with such players, it is hard to show that you are the missing piece of the puzzle, to gain the trust from your teammates, staff and the fans. It was with a lot of pressure that I accepted to face this challenge.

Three years passed by, and i can tell you that we tried our very best every day, every minute of the time we had in front of us to train and play. I’m incredibly proud of this 5 EU LCS titles we grabbed out of 6 possible, without missing these both Top 3/4 at Worlds 2013 &amp; 2015 !
To speak out the truth, I had a bit of a shaky year earlier this season. Being left alone in the team was not an easy task to handle, either for me of the Fnatic management, and i had a lot of thoughts about whether retiring or not. I almost gave up, i have to admit. Imagine yourself in front of the Everest mountains that you have to climb in a very short period of time, with a huge storm approaching, and you get an image of what was ahead of us. The fact is that in my inner self, i couldn’t accept to jump out from a tough situation. Fnatic gave me so much, you guys gave me so much with your support, that I had to get this team back on track.

Being grateful and loyal is a part of me, and that was the least I could do.

Here we are today: Huni &amp; ReignOver left the team, leaving me again in a difficult position : either building a new team or considering other options. It’s never a good thing to hear, but after careful overall reflection, I had the opportunity to join a team being at my best level inNorth America and get the chance to experience a new lifestyle and environment.

After a careful overall reflection, i took the decision to join the North American LCS for the 2016 season.

Finally, I honestly want to thank everyone that I met and got to work with, from teammates to people involved in the Fnatic organization and all the fans that supported me throughout the years.

I hope that you will understand my decision and will continue to support me in my career!

Sincerely yours,

Bora “YellowStar” Kim

That's naive. Only because one doesn't have any clear enemies today, doesn't mean there won't be any tomorrow. 

The view that Russia is an ally is also not accurate. Yes, Germany is partnered with Russia on some stuff, especially trade and Germany's current dependence on Russian gas, but that won't be a vital thing anymore in the not so distant future (The abundance of Gas/Oil from the US due to fracking, oil prices going down, huge shift to greener energy sources, etc), which is also one of the main reasons why Russia is currently acting the way it is, it's trying to stay relevant as a superpower, which can be a very dangerous thing in the future.

,"The only thing I know about FIFA or the World Cup is what I read on reddit. I've Googled the basics and I'm left with the following questions (this is long, but maybe others have the same questions?):  

1. What does the distribution of power/responsibility (between the host country and FIFA) look like? Is the division of oversight and accountability dependent on the existing laws of the host country? Or does FIFA operate under their own laws within the country somehow, like an international embassy? Qatar has never been known for its stellar workers' rights (not that this gives FIFA a pass). But, for instance, what if it were held in Germany? German workers wouldn't put up with that shit, right? (and the arena would be awesome)  

2. Follow up to the above, does FIFA deliberately accept bids from countries with low worker standards (in order to cut costs)? Doesn't this piss off the other countries that can't bid as low because they insist on feeding their workers and whatnot? 

3. Do representatives from countries within the organization have any influence? Is there some sort of multi-national Jedi High Council or Fellowship of the Football to put pressure on FIFA?   

4. What about game day attendance? Everyone in Qatar can't afford to go, right? Are people from Western Europe and South America (that's their biggest fan bases, right?) going to travel to a place like Qatar? Or, could the World Cup sell out a stadium in the eight circle of hell or central Alabama? Is physical location even relevant? Or do they make most of their money from television sponsorships, online merchandise sales, etc? 

5. Has there ever been an organized boycott effort? Is it like the Olympics where fans aren't always happy, but don't want to punish the participants who have earned their place there? Also, because football? 

Serious question: Without an organized boycott effort, can anything really be changed? 

Thanks in advance for any help! 

Edit: Thanks for all responses! I see now that the biggest hole in my understanding was that the host country foots the bill for the whole event. Also, fans would attend if it were held during a nuclear winter in North Korea, Germany doesn't participate, and FIFA is more powerful than the U.S. senate and possibly God.

The Soviets, on the other hand enjoyed a substantial flow of trucks:

&gt; In total, the US deliveries [to the USSR] through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[31] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[32] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[33] and 1.75 million tons of food.[34]
&gt;
&gt; Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.[35][36]

One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR.

This is just not true! Borders are open, Schengen visa holders can enter, anyone can apply for asylum at any border crossing. We just stopped uncontrolled migration! Shall we tear down the fence and tell all migrants Germany's that way btw ?

Again, any country can defend their borders by choosing whom to allow in. This is written basically in all international treaties related to the borders of a country!

,"[I came across this video today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15IxF53AZfE&amp;app=desktop), detailing the discovery and reconstruction of a Norwegian Iron Age tunic (c. 300 AD). It's a great video, especially because it discusses the way in which wool was gathered, spun, and woven, using technology that was common across N.W. Europe up until the 10th century. If you want to know how early medieval clothing was made, this video is a very good place to start.

One of the most shocking, but accurate, things in the video is the amount of hours it took to make a reconstruction of the garment (760!). Think about that. Now look at your shirt. 760 hours.

Making clothing was a full-time job. In the book *Spindle Whorls in Archaeology* (Raymond 1984), a similarly high figure is given for the time investment required of professional spinners in Peru to make a poncho (about 500 hours, I think, using essentially the same technology that was used in early medieval Europe). In such a society, 1 full time textile worker is required for every two non textile workers to keep everyone from going naked. That means that spinning and weaving were massively important parts of early medieval life (and also helps explain the early medieval slave market for female textile workers, whose ability to carry some of the textile production load would have been very important).

You can distribute the labor, to an extent. Children can learn to spin when they're really young, which would free up older women to do other things (weave, manage food stores, etc). And you can stretch the materials in a single garment a long way - most clothing we find is patched and repaired (including the tunic in the video), or made from recycled cloth.

,"Hey there, sorry Im late but I only found this now. 
Wooden shoes have been developed from a sort of wooden sandals, the oldest full clog I know of was found in Rotterdam in the 13th century. However, it is not only the dutch that used wooden clogs, in fact, they were popular all over europe (spain, france, germany, denmark,...). Their popularity can be attributed to the advantages they have: They are cheap and fairly easy to manufacture, they keep your feet dry, clean and safe, they insulate your feet and air ventilation and the loose fit guarantee healthy feet. It is interesting to note however, that nowadays, wooden clogs play little to no role in other countries than the Netherlands. 
Personally I have two theories why this is the case. I havent found sources on this, just my own observations. 

Due to massive material shortages, wooden clog (klompen in dutch) production reached a peak in both world wars. E.g. in 1942, when the population was around 9 million, the klompen output was around 5.5 million. You can imagine how many people were wearing clogs back then. To this day, the importance of the clog as a peoples shoe is implemented in the collective memory. 

The klomp had a revival as a tourist item. To gain popularity, it was presented as the traditional shoe of the country, similar to what happened to bavarian leather pants in the 1970s.

The fact that klompen are very uncomfortable at the heel if you walk up a hill may also play a role. If you look at the regions where wooden shoes were worn, you will realize they are all very flat.

,"I totally agree with this, but the biggest problem I see is that we are just very few. Even if the entirety of the population of this reddit stops summoning, how much would that represent? 28.5k subscribers in a world of 100k's and 100k's of players. It would defintively have an impact but I am afraid much lower than what we think :-(

The good thing, imho, is that seems that it will fall by its own weight. I didn't even need an special reason to not summon at all during this event because the only reason I need is that this (read as the majority) of rate up / sumon event sucks.

And judging by the amount of comments in the last megathreads, there seems to be an evidence: people summon way more during the good events, and practically stop summoning in the shitty ones. It's as simple as that. People spent way more in a Divine Summon than a SRS.

And what makes it worse, imho, is that the same game itself lends to a model where  every 2-3 months every single unit has been outclassed, so would it really be that bad if the lastest units are a bit more widespread? People will need to summon constantly anyway.

I mean, I'm far from an expert in echonomics but which person do you think will be more willing to summon the next tier of powercreep? The one who spent 400 gems to not get anything or the one that bought the summon ticket bundle and got 3 of the newest meta units plus some other goodie in the middle? 

And in between, the population would be way more happy, the game more promoted / recommended, etc.

I don't really know, but Europe and JPBF both have more ""generous"" politics and it seems things, both in economic and image-related fields go way better than in GLBF... but then again, I don't run a company, so I may (probably) be totally wrong :-/",0,0,1449005226,,Alxion_BF,0,0,t3_3v1lgc,cxjl6em,bravefrontier,t3_3v1lgc,zx63,1451376613,False,1449006118,t5_2zich

,"Capitalism is profit-based but you don't seem to realize that profit doesn't have to be linked in any way to consumption of natural resources or pollution or whatever. Most profit comes from the specialization of labor and not from massive base resource extraction. The only thing most free-market economists agree on that will pose a problem to capitalism is when we run out of ""poor"" / third world countries to move production to. It was Europe, then the USA, then Japan and China, and now India, and South-East Asia. But, as shown especially in the tech industry, Asian manufacturers are fast approaching western levels of quality and are moving into R&amp;D as well rather than pure production. This means that soon, production will move to Africa, but after that, well that's where we'll have to see what comes next for gross manufacturing.

I fail to see an example of some irreplacable natural resource that will be depleted any time soon. The only energy source I can think of as irreplacable right now is uranium, but we still have around 2000 years of that yet at today's rate and by then I expect fusion to be the nuclear power of choice. Which runs off'f lighter, more common elements.

Also, more progress has been made in culling pollution and recycling technology in the last 10 years than in any other period since the industrial revolution. Plus, instead of massive uncontrolled population, most sociologists are forecasting a peak human population of less than 10 000 000 000, to be hit some time this century.

I'm leaving the greenhouse effect out of this because while I agree that anthropomorphic global warming exists, I have yet to see a believable model which will profoundly impact the human race.

,"4: game day attendances will be alright. The stadiums will certainly go full. Qatar is probably cheap for people coming from europe and north america. If the countries dont boycott the world cup, rest assured the fans will turn up. If not, the king will probably just let the qatari citizens to show up for matches. I mean they promised to control weather and install air conditioning for the world cup, he could certainly call up crowd for matches IMO. And yes, FIFA does make a lot from its sponsors but fans are always integral.

5: There has been no boycott internationally i think. But the reasons were different. The world cup had immense appeal and charm and it still does but it surely is dwindling. I personally feel the world cup lost all its special feeling once they switched to the having a world cup in all continents rule. I mean just stick to the countries who already have the infrastructure. I agree that football needs to expand and all that but expansion can  be done by helping at the grassroots level of the sport and once that country starts performing better in world cups, popularity in the country grows, infrastructure improves and then they should get to host the world cup. Building new stadiums just for a months use of its full capacity is pretty stupid. Since england, italy, france, spain, germany, usa, portugal maybe, netherlands have the infrastructure. Let them keep hosting it till new football powers dont emerge.

Reignover was known to be **bad** mechanically. ""Gameover"" meaning any game he's in he loses.

Yellowstar wasn't always known to be the best support in EU. He was just good until Spring last year. He's had an upswing this last year but that's gonna fall off eventually, unless he ever long improves.

,"&gt; The Nepalese are neither born nor forced into slavery

See the following articles: 
http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/modern-day-slavery-in-focus+world/qatar
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/opinion/qatars-showcase-of-shame.html?_r=0

I consider The Guardian and NY times to be credible sources - do you? If not, please provide me with some credible sources that support your side of the argument. 

&gt;across all construction projects is much more understandable than the imprisonment of 2million people, an increase of 700% over the last 40 years and the largest amount of federally imprisoned persons in the history of mankind, and most of those due to non violent drug related offenses.

You're comparing apples to oranges. Let's compare apples to apples instead.  There is religious freedom in the US - In Qatar apostasy can be punishable by [death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar#Capital_punishment). The US imprisons people for non-violent (often drug related) crimes - in Qatar drug offences can be punishable by [death](http://www.onlineqatar.com/living/laws-regulations.aspx).

As I've stated before, I am not denying that the US justice system has its flaws, including major ones, but it is undoubtedly light years ahead of Qatar's and the faults of the system in the US certainly does not absolve Qatar of the atrocities that go in the country.

&gt;Completely. History reflects that the U.S. is responsible for the following:
The genocide of the Native Americans
The enslavement and mistreatment of Africans
An Apartheid State up until the mid 60's with elements that remain to this day.
The unprovoked conflict of Vietnam
The illegal invasion of Iraq that lead to the deaths of 1.3 Iraqi citizens, the displacement of 4 million more, and the creation of Isis.
Prison camps for Japanese citizens
Etc.

While these facts are not entirely true(The genocide of Native Americans and enslavement of Africans was largely carried out by European states before the establishment of the US, for example) I have never claimed that the US hasn't been responsible for abhorrent things in the past. And you are comparing a list of the major atrocities committed before and during the republic of the United States under a period of 600 years to an isolated issue within a time span of a few years - that is hardly fair, is it? Also, the violations of human rights, morality and ethics in Qatar is taking place as we speak!!! 

&gt;I read your comment, it was stupid. You suggested that dissent isn't allowed in Qatar when there's millions of people that live in the country that are neither Muslim, nor subscribe to Islamic law or doctrine.

Yes, I did suggest that, and it is [true!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar#Freedom_of_expression) If you want to refute this, please provide me with some credible sources.

I value the right of the living Serbs, not the dead ones. I do not understand how you were able to even understand it in a way simillar to this. Maybe English isn't so well taught in Albania.

&gt; Congrats a super state consisting of multiple nations had higher living standards than that era's version of North Korea. The fact that the living standards were so much higher yet everyone left the union should tell you enough about how little rights ""minorities"" had.

Yet those minorities had a better living standard than in their own homeland, at a time. Interesting.

Yep, hypotetical. You made a hypotetical situation about Germans, Englishmen and Frenchmen.

&gt; I think the parallel was along the fact that when you try to ethnically cleanse entire groups of people don't expect any sympathy or start demanding rights. The fact that you guys are still allowed in Kosova is a privilege not a right, don't take it for granted.

,"The Born Broke report came out during the Patrick administration, part of those reports the eventually became the D'Alessandro ""The Outlook is Dire"" report. It's sales taxes, fwiw, not an income tax - but remember that sales taxes fund operations not capital investment. The legislature knew that, they knew that the MBTA could *never* afford the capital costs with solely a sales tax transfer, but they clearly hoped the MBTA could stall the big-ticket, low political value projects out of existence, thus never requiring a true, dedicated capital funding source. They obviously failed to squirm the MBTA out of its obligations and that's why the fuel tax increase became necessary. **All I'm saying is that GLX cost overruns are a MassDOT/MBTA project management issue, and are only marginally related to the MBTA operations deficit.**

&gt; The $140 million deficit that the T has this year isn't just an operational deficit. It includes service on that previously mentioned debt that they were saddled with in 2000

Debt service *is* an an ops expenses. That's how major American transit agencies operate along with most European and Asian ones. Every agency has the ability to issue revenue bonds for basic upkeep; major capital investment like the current 10-year $6billion transit investment portfolio (red/orange, GXL, SCR, SSX, pretty much every SGR and expansion project on the books) is not backed in any significant way by MBTA revenue bonds (they make up a small, small portion), it's backed by MassDOT/State funds - it's not a substantial increase to the MBTA's ops deficit as it only marginally increases the debt service payments (which aren't going anywhere anyways). If the State says ""thanks, but no thanks"" to GLX (they can't, but hypothetically) - the MBTA would not be entitled to the capital funds. 

The MBTA ops budget is fucked by the high cost of ""purchased transportation"", poor fare recovery and high, per-pax ops costs on busses and CR - *that's* the ops deficit right there. There's always going to be debt service and some amount of public assistance, debt relief would help, but it'd be a temporary relief at best - the real issues are the ones I just pointed too. 

&gt; If the study does not take into account the fact that, of the 30% expected ridership, only, say, 6% of that is new ridership, the numbers associated with this study are essentially useless.

Its the [GLX Environmental Assessment, Chapter 4](http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/ev_Assess/Volume_1_Text.pdf) about the alternatives analyzed. Again, the CTPS is not trying to scam you or the MBTA - they're just the ones tasked with analyzing it and their methodology is easy to access if you want to parse through it. They'll likely alter the bus routes, consolidate where possible, ramp up service through places nearby (think Med Center), probably not a major cost saver, but the efficiency gains from GLX will ripple through the bus network - a 5 min trip from Medford to College Ave, attracts more riders than a 20 min to Sullivan or Davis.

&gt; This project will add debt to an already debt ridden agency, and will increase the yearly operating deficit significantly.

GLX does not add to the ops deficit of the MBTA as the ops deficit derives from operator wages, procurement of electricity, and the issuance of revenue bonds to cover basic maintenance. It will not increase the ops deficit significantly, because the ops deficit has nothing to do with construction cost overruns - that's MassDOT's issue, not the MBTA's. The ops deficit will increase, because our rolling stock and systems have deteriorated, but with a cut or two and with State-funded SGR projects, the decay is getting slightly better.

,"&gt; How can you quantify that Christianity is a leader in all of these things?

Christian nations carried out the actions. 

&gt; The only reason that the crusades, one of the most prolonged religious conflicts in the history of mankind, happened was because of Muslim invaders moving from the Middle East to Africa and then invading Spain, a Christian country!

""On November 27, 1095, in Clermont, France, Pope Urban II called for a crusade to help the Byzantines and to free the city of Jerusalem. The official start date was set as August 15, 1096."" 

http://www.umich.edu/~eng415/timeline/summaries/First_Crusade.htm

You'll note that Jerusalem is not in Europe. 

&gt; The difference between Christianity and Islam is that Christianity USED to do those things, Muslims still do.

Since the turn of the century, the Christian nation of America is responsible for: 

- The illegal invasion of Iraq, leading to the deaths of killing 1.3million citizens, displacing 4 million more, and ultimately leading to the creation of Isis. 

- Completed the largest arms deal in the history of the globe with Saudi Arabia, the primary financier of Wahhabism or radical Islam across the globe. It was reported that 60billion dollars worth of military arms will be delivered to the Saudi's by the end of the decade. 

- Created a socio-economic environment that has lead to the imprisonment of 2 million of its citizens, creating the largest population of prisoners in the history of man. 

- Police and State sanctioned violence against black and brown persons. In fact, more people have died at the hands of police in the U.S. this year than migrant workers in Qatar. 

""The number of people killed by law enforcement in the US this year has reached 1,000 after officers in Oakland, California, shot dead a man who allegedly pointed a replica gun at them.""

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/16/the-counted-killed-by-police-1000

&gt; Muslims would literally just love to wipe the Jewish people, and most likely Christians, off the face of the Earth; what other religion wants to completely eradicate all other people's?

Christians. See: Indigenous Americans. 

""The issue of genocide and American Indian history has been contentious. Many writers see the massive depopulation of the indigenous population of the Americas after 1492 as a clear-cut case of the genocide. Other writers, however, contend that European and U.S. actions toward Indians were deplorable but were rarely if ever genocidal. To a significant extent, disagreements about the pervasiveness of genocide in the history of the post-Columbian Western Hemisphere, in general, and U.S. history, in particular, pivot on definitions of genocide. Conservative definitions emphasize intentional actions and policies of governments that result in very large population losses, usually from direct killing.""

&gt; But your logic is ass backwards and I honestly think you're brainwashed by Islam to think it has done no evil. All the violence and evil going on in the world at this very moment is perpetrated by Islam.

I'm not religious, but the vast majority of the globes violence is waged by Europeans. This is a fact:

,"Assédio sexual tem em qualquer lugar, deve ser reprimido obviamente, mas é de uma gigantesca inocência achar que isso é uma cultura do Itamaraty em específico. Da mesma forma tem condutas citadas na matéria que de fato são gravíssimas, como as apalpadas, assédio moral, assédio sexual e outras coisas bem menos gravosas misturadas como a questão da pergunta no psicotécnico, que inclusive eu tive que responder em outro orgão e a do '' cafézinho '' que já vi acontecer a rodo também com homens então creio ser outro tipo de abuso ( exigir prerrogativa alheia a função, que é inclusive uma infração administrativa ).

Dito isso, tem várias ignorâncias nessa matéria e no tópico, vamos lá:

A) Aprovação nesse concurso não é '' nepotismo '' e '' teste do sofá '' rofl, é um dos concursos mais difíceis do país e o cursinho CLIO tem 100% das aprovações já faz quase uma década. Será que o CLIO treina apenas alunos parentes de diplomatas e tem curso de técnicas sexuais? Faz me rir.

B) Promoção do diplomata é feita única e exclusivamente com base no tempo em que serviu fora. Ele tem que servir em países de nível A,B,C e D para ir progredindo, podendo parar em uma locação sem promoção ou mesmo escolher nem ir pra fora, não recebendo o benefício salarial da saída. Existe um certo nível de indicação política mas esse processo é bem rígido, sendo as indicações determinantes nos cargos de nível mais alto com poder político e não acessoria e o resto determinado por notas, com um critério político em embaixadas concorridas de um mesmo nível.
Existe também um tempo mínimo para promoções e os cargos seguem uma ordem não existe promoção que pule níveis.

C) Eu entendo de verdade que a faixa etária desse sub não é alta e que a quantidade de pessoas em carreiras análogas ou mesmo dentro da diplomacia é mínimo, mas falar o tipo de ignorância que as pessoas falam aqui casualmente, espalhando informações erradas me deu nojo. Menos irresponsabilidade, não comente em algo falando como se conhece algo que não tem a mínima noção.
Eu duvido que tenha assédio no itamaraty? Claro que não, novamente afirmo que existe em qualquer lugar, mas é um dos lugares mais fantásticos que tive oportunidade de trabalhar e esse comportamento é amplamente combatido lá dentro, muito mais que na maioria dos ambientes em que trabalhei.

Considerando a dificuldade que é entrar nesse cargo e que existem pessoas interessadas que podem se sentir desestimuladas ao ler esse tipo de comentário, me senti obrigado a esclarecer os fatos.

,"Alright, maybe I am a bit self-hating. But let me explain to you why.

So, I'm an ABCD (american born confused desi). I live in an area that has a very large, well-off Indian population.

When I got my first real job in the software industry, there was a good mix of the usual suspects: Chinese, Europeans, and Indians.

My Polish friend and I got hired the same day. As soon as we found our offices, a Russian dev walked up to him and started talking to him in a non-English language. Within 10 minutes he took him away and began introducing him to fellow Europeans. My Polish friend came back later that day and told me that the Russian guy had told him ""us Europeans have to stick together"" before introducing him to a bunch of other Europeans.

I also noticed that a lot of the Chinese tend to stick together - everyone from the IT department to the financial office will hang out together, coming to the office on weekends to play ping pong.

The Indian from India, though? Completely don't give a fuck about me. Actually, straight up ignore me. My parents and uncle, all in the same area as well, noted this lack of acknowledgment and said it felt like they considered them their competition.

Whatever. OK, so I don't get any advantages based off of my ethnicity like the Europeans and Chinese do. That would be all fine and dandy, except they ACTIVELY bring me disadvantages!

Indian guys get the rep as being creepy, misogynistic, and treating women badly. I had no idea this was even a stereotype until I started growing older and noticing it, subtly and sometimes not so subtly. I suppose I can see the creepy part, but I don't get the latter. In addition, Indians from India tend to keep to themselves and don't really try to interact with non-Indians. People got used to it and don't try to approach Indians anymore.

Anyway. So I get zero advantages based off of my race, and a ton of disadvantages. It really is pretty shitty to be born Indian here. I seriously do wish I was born as a white dude, you get tons and tons of benefits and no disadvantages. Everyone loves  a white dude.",0,0,1449011134,,zitandspit99,0,1,t3_3uzje0,cxjpcez,pics,t1_cxjngdv,,1451378576,False,False,t5_2qh0u

Yet no one foresaw China imploding during the Great Quake of 2203 nor the total destruction that the European Famine of 2254 brought with it. So it was the United States and their efforts that created the United Globe and thus the turn of the planet.

Most residents remember how Australia came to be. The British needed to get rid of a few people of less desirable nature and so they placed them on ships to the desert continent as means of incarceration. With colonization now designated to to star-ships and a nation obsessed with law and order in power, all those who could left the only home they knew to become citizens of other planets. For unless one wanted to be shot by an ancient firearm or worry about a stint in the Antarctica Maximum Security Hold, people generally avoid Earth. The Prison Planet of the Universe.

They then bring over this talent and all the fans that these players have built up. Also, this has more EU fans watching the NA LCS as they want to see their past greats playing again, even OP is an example. This, along with streaming, sponsorships (TSM is sponsored by GEICO for christ fuckin sake), and merch. is going to make NA teams so fuckin rich no one is really gonna care as they keep bringing in fresh talent and making money off them.

,"To be honest, this lines up very well with Yellowstar's statement.

Out of all the NA teams needing a support, only TSM has a publicly established roster. Now the teams taking GV/TIP spot could very well have some neat roster moves to reveal, but I highly doubt that they will be as strong on paper as TSM's already signed 4.

So with YS confirming the move to NA, I just can't see any roster other than TSM being good enough to entice him to leave Europe. 

He gets a veteran team that he can mold. He's familiar with Bjerg and Sven from Europe, both have been playing since Season 3 (I think?), his bot partner is someone who has also been around since Season 1, only really Hauntzer is super young talent. Add on top of that working with Jarge last year, and it's almost too good of a fit for YS.

On the side note, I have seen all over reddit people concerned about if Doublelift's ego can be contained. First off, this is Regi's team/brand foremost he won't be passive like Hotshot. Secondly Bjerg is higher in the food chain as well from being the established foundation, and finally if it is Yellowstar there isn't a Western support with more pedigree. 

If you look at how he has spoken in interviews, he's calm, composed, and a natural born leader. He is classy and I have no doubt that it won't take long for Hauntzer, Sven, Bjerg, and DL to bond with and willingly follow him into battle. He's precisely the perfect personality to lead this team in-game.

Edit: I also believe Doublelift in that he views this as a fresh start, same with Sven. Whatever drama they caused or were a part of on their old teams, stays there until proven otherwise. Sometimes a change of scenery is just what players need, and I expect both of them to excel mightily next season for TSM.",21,0,1449011394,,Tyrandis,21,0,t3_3v28u2,cxjpilu,TeamSolomid,t3_3v28u2,TSM,1451378658,False,1449012444,t5_2t8co

,"/u/neophage answered correctly, but I'll expound a little bit more.

Bombers were huge, and could carry the required fuel, to get from the base to the target and back home.  Escort fighters at the time (mostly the P-47) simply couldn't keep up.  The Thunderbolts would escort the B-17s and B-24s right up to the front lines, but have to turn away and go back to refuel, leaving the bombers unprotected over enemy skies.  Since adding more and more fuel to fighters would simply add weight, it would be counter-intuitive.  Aircraft designers had to approach this from a different angle: efficiency.  

[This is the profile of a P-47's wing.](http://i.imgur.com/yokO8uw.png)  The thickest part of the wing is in the fore-most third of the wing.  It was a large wing to support the heavy aircraft, and it had a rather large profile as it moved through the air.  While this makes the wing very strong (most, if not all bombers had this style of wing.  [Look how thick the leading edge of a B-17's wing is compared to it's trailing edge.](http://i.imgur.com/fz05vhP.jpg), its not the most efficient design.

What the designers at North American came up with was something called a 'laminar flow wing' which they put in the P-51's design.  [This is the profile of a P-15's wing.](http://i.imgur.com/XjLz8FT.png)  Note that it's thickest in the middle of the wing, rather than the leading edge.  [Here's a side shot of a Mustang showing the laminar design](http://www.aresgames.eu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/700xP51_Mustang4.jpg).

What this design meant was that the Mustang didn't have a large, blunt leading edge that it had to push through the air.  It was very thin and could almost 'slip through' the air, rather than have to force it out of the way.  This meant the plane was much more efficient when flying and didn't need tremendous horsepower just to get out of it's own way.  Think of it like your hand when you're swimming;  if you cup your hand and paddle, there's lots of water resistance from your entire palm.  If you turn your hand knife-edge however, you can slip your hand through the water much faster and with less effort.  Same thing with the airfoils moving through the air.

With a new, highly efficient airfoil, the P-51 was able to use much less fuel, yet hold the same amount, allowing it to fly much further than a P-47 could.",5,0,1449011530,load the six pounder,wrel_,5,0,t3_3uzdye,cxjplr5,Warthunder,t1_cxjnpea,uk,1451378699,False,False,t5_2uc6j

#BabyMetal Win Three Honors in the 5th Annual Loudwire Music Awards

^^BMD ^^Fox  

BabyMetal were the big winners of the 5th Annual Loudwire Music Awards, triumphing in three categories in the fan-voted polls.  

First off, BabyMetal’s “Road of Resistance” was voted Best Metal Song of 2015 by an overwhelming margin. There were 20 nominees in total, and “Road of Resistance” managed to acquire more votes than all the other nominees combined. Featuring DragonForce members Herman Li and Sam Totman, “Road of Resistance” came through with over 78 percent of the popular vote.  

BabyMetal’s dominance continued into our Best Live Act of 2015 category, beating all fellow nominees combined once again. BabyMetal toured the world in 2015, hitting Japan, North America and plenty of European countries, further securing their ever-expanding fan base. No band came close to beating BabyMetal in the vote, with the act racking up over 75 percent of the vote.  

Japan’s newest metal sensation also seized the vast majority of votes in our Most Devoted Fans category. In the most heavily voted category of the 5th Annual Loudwire Music Awards, BabyMetal came out on top, gaining over 58 percent of the total ballots.  

Congratulations to BabyMetal and their legions of hardcore fans for all three Loudwire Music Awards victories!",2,0,1449011846,,jabberwokk,2,0,t3_3v0r4l,cxjptbi,BABYMETAL,t3_3v0r4l,,1451378798,False,False,t5_2xpsy
,"&gt;It's interesting both how Americans seem far more balanced in their assessment of cars - I'm sure it exists but I get the impression that 'badge snobbery' is far less of an issue there than here in the U.K

Badge snobbery is definitely huge in the states, but VW's themselves aren't usually held in high esteem. They're kind of seen as being slightly more 'premium' than, say, a honda or toyota, but there's a huge negative stereotype about VW reliability, so most people tend to stay away.

&gt;Secondly the USA hasn't embraced diesel, at all. On the one hand this makes little sense, you drive much greater distances, and the torquey nature of most turbo diesels, coupled with an automatic box, would seem ideally suited to most American needs. You guys didn't go for it though.

The reason for this is very, very simple. Cost. Gas is really cheap in the US compared to most of Europe. Diesel here usually costs as much if not more than premium gas, and the few diesel models that are available cost thousands of dollars more than their gas-powered equivalents.

Plus the US has much more stringent regulations for particulate emissions than most European countries, so most companies that sell diesels elsewhere in the world often don't offer those for sale in the states due to either being completely unable to meet those regulations, or unable to do so while also meeting target price points, thus the VW cheating scandal.",8,0,1449011910,Do two motorcycles count as one car?,Gregarious_Raconteur,8,0,t3_3v15gu,cxjpuu6,cars,t1_cxjoero,,1451378818,False,False,t5_2qhl2

You're quoted as saying, 'Criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers operate across borders so law enforcement must have tools to cross borders too.'  Putting aside that that is in itself an argument for putting a border guard on the border which the EU has taken off, the main problem with human trafficking in the EU actually lies outside the EU.  Romania and Bulgaria have citizenship laws with Moldova and Macedonia respectfully.  It's very easy for people from these countries to become Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.  That's the entry point and criminals are using illegally acquired documentation in Moldova and Macedonia to acquire official and genuine EU citizenship (and there's no real way of the EU checking).  EU passports are being bought by non-EU citizens and are being issued by EU countries.  From there they can travel with impunity and legally so it's not so much a question of policing (which is what INTERPOL is for and it expands beyond the EU), more you've lost control of who can acquire EU citizenship from outside.  Moldova is ranked 15th worst in the world when it comes to slavery and it's almost one of the most corrupt.  The EU has opened up a new market place for them.    What do you plan to do to fix it?""

I want to get more into photography, specifically landscape shots, a lot of cool night scenes, and some timelaspes. I am also going to Europe for several months and am looking for something a bit smaller than the 18-135 that will be more comfortable to carry around. 

Two lenses I have came up with are the [Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-24mm-2-8-Lens/dp/B00NI3BZ5K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449013569&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=canon+24mm&amp;psc=1) and the [Canon EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6 IS STM Lens](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-10-18mm-4-5-5-6-Lens/dp/B00K899B9Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449013617&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=canon+10-18).

Now in terms of price I am definitely more comfortable with the 24mm as I am just getting into photography more.

One thing I am worried about with the 10-18 lens is it being too wide for a lens that will act as my primary one. While it may be nice for those landscape shots, would it work photographing places in European Cities like London? Also, I have read the 10-18mm takes sharper photos, is this true?

An enormous Arab propaganda machine, support from a world that has gone Third World-crazy and a willingness to sacrifice their childrens' future by sending them to blow themselves up, wind up in prison for throwing rocks to injure Israeli civilians, not attend school, an utter failure to take seriously the need to create an economy that will offer any real future, etc. has amply displayed the Palestinians' penchant for destruction rather than building a workable society that might lead to a viable state.  Nevertheless, Israel has been put into the very unenviable position of taking its future very seriously and to that end, refrain from making concessions since they are far more likely to be disrespected and destructive to her integrity and security than to serve as the basis for ""two States,"" which is after all, the intent of the Olso Accords. By the relentless efforts of the Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and pro-Palestinians (particularly in Europe) to harm Israeli interests and the Israeli economy and to make it appear to the uneducated and naive that Israel is the one that is placing the obstacles to peace the Palestinians create the illusion that they are willing to live side by side with Israel when all along, they are inciting against the Israelis and fail to even begin to educate their People to the requisites of ever living side by side with another nation. Anyone who is willing and inclined to view the history of the matter with any real independent research would conclude that the Palestinians are simply as intent on ""driving the Jews into the sea,"" as they said they would ultimately do from the very declaration of Israel as a State in 1948.

You know why I believe this? Well simple answer. We keep seeing promising, and top players from all over the world go to NA, and they are not succesful anymore. Piglet, Rush for example. Some are succesful as far as NA goes, but by far not everyone, and I haven't even started to talk about internationally. I think NA has to upper their coaching staff and all to even get good.

Also he didn't ""whistle blow"" in the sense that the bankers he reported were doing anything illegal.  What he did was to turn over lists of tax dodgers who were hiding their money in Swiss banks.  But hiding your money in a Swiss bank was 100% legal in Switzerland at the time.  The Swiss bankers broke no domestic laws.  The people who were dodging taxes were largely dealt with in accordance with their own country's laws.

Also he's not some paragon of justice who risked life and limb to bring tax dodgers to justice.  He initially tried to sell the banking information that he took, and it was only when he realized that he couldn't sell it/could potentially face criminal charges outside of Switzerland for selling the data that he suddenly became a ""whistle blower"" and turned everything he had over to European authorities.

edit: and furthermore, the reason he was sentenced to jail in Switzerland is not because he wasn't given a fair trial or the officials involved were corrupt.  By taking the data out of Switzerland he committed very clear violations of Swiss law.  Those laws were not written by ""corrupt politicians"" anymore than the citizens of Switzerland themselves are corrupt, as for a very long time the entire Swiss economy was reliant upon anonymous banking, and the system was/continues to be supported by the Swiss population.",13,0,1449015088,,ughhhhh420,13,0,t3_3v2ene,cxjrvx5,worldnews,t3_3v2ene,,1451379774,False,1449016509,t5_2qh13

Or forget shotcalling.

Ryu team mates were simply individually better, they were reliable, they were making plays, they were creating advantages for the whole team and they were preventing opponents from getting resources.

Froggen's and Peppi's team were feeding, letting towers &amp; dragons fall and giving resources to their opponents.

It's not rare to feel like accusing someone who may be legitimate after losing to an opponent who fell through a combo.



Keep this in mind. Don't be hostile to people based on things they may or may not be doing. If it doesn't cause you any lag, I would suggest streaming ranked pvp matches on twitch, free VOD storage for 30 days and maybe if enough people stream regularly more people will watch.

,"Echinacea: Butterfly stalk leaves, flowers, and roots are used in medicine. It can shorten the duration of respiratory infections, boost the immune system, and guard against infection, specifically urinary tract disease and sexually transmitted diseases. It can also help treat chronic fatigue, rheumatism, migraines, pain, dizziness, and distraction or attention deficit. It can help ease acid indigestion and rattlesnake bites.  Externally, it can treat boils, abscesses, skin wounds, ulcers, burns, eczema, psoriasis, UV radiation skin damage, herpes simplex, bee stings, and hemorrhoids. It can restore strength and sexual desire. The extract can treat hemorrages and a tincture of the root can treat fever. 

Lavender: The parts of lavender used as remedies are the flowers, dried or fresh. Taken internally, tea or oil can be used to relieve stress, anxiety, exhaustion, irritability, headaches, migraines, insomnia, depression, colds, digestion, flatulence, upset stomach, liver and gallbladder problems, nervousness, loss of appetite, and as a breath freshener and mouthwash. Breathing deeply of the flowers or steam of boiling water infused with the oil can induce relaxation and sleep, ease depression, and reduce headaches. 

It can be used externally as well; it can be applied directly for cuts, scrapes, wounds, burns, bee, wasp, and insect stings, rashes, muscle aches, rheumatism, arthritis, cold sores, canker sores, blisters, bruises, athlete's foot, and rubbed directly into the temples in case of headache or migraine. 
Miscellaneous uses of nightcotton include using unsweetened tea as a hair rinse to help reduce hair loss and dandruff, using the dried flowers in sleep and dream pillows, in potpourris, sachets and tucked in drawers to freshen clothing and repel moths.  A few drops of oil dropped into warm bath water is a refreshing and relaxing treat. The stems with the leaves stripped can be burned like an incense stick, and can also be used in crafts such as basket weaving, and making Lavender wands.

---Dosage--- oil: 1 to 3 drops. Tea: 1-2 tsp. of flowers per cup of water.

Cattail: The roots can be ground into a flour and used in food; this flour remedies diarrhea and dysentery when made into a tea. Fresh, the pounded root can be applied directly to infections, blisters, and stings. Mashed, it can be used as a toothpaste. 
The fuzz from the flowers can also be used to treat burns and sores and to prevent chafing in babies. The pollen can be placed directly on a wound to clot blood and constrict the skin. Internally, the pollen can slow internal bleeding, relieve menstrual pain, chest pain, and other forms of blood stagnation. It has mild effects of producing urine and regulating menstrual flow. The young flowers can be eaten for diarrhea. The sticky sap between the leaves is an excellent starch and can be used to thicken soups and broths. The white colored shoots at the base of the leaf clusters can be boiled, steamed, sliced and eaten raw in salads. The sticky starch at the base of the green leaf is antiseptic, coagulant, &amp; even a bit numbing. The boiled leaves can be used for an external skin wash. 

Sorry I don't have dosages for all of them, but I have to make do with what the internet tells me. Those are just a few of the most common ones; there's hundreds out there, and I'm sure everyone will have different opinions on which are the most common, too.

,"I'm sorry but you have no clue about fascist economics. In fascism the corporations serve the nation, rather than the corporations serving themselves. Not only this but fascism is severely anti-materialist and anti-hedonist[1], two philosophies of which are necessary to remain in a capitalist, especially freemarket capitalist as supported by trump, society. Yes they keep elements of productivist capitalism but only that, not the capitalism which is represented today, not even close. Fascism encourages the synchronisation of the coprorate goals with that of the state [2], to quote historian Phillip Morgan: 'Since the Depression was a crisis of laissez-faire capitalism and its political counterpart, parliamentary democracy, fascism could pose as the 'third-way' alternative between capitalism and Bolshevism, the model of a new European 'civilization'. As Mussolini typically put it in early 1934, ""from 1929...fascism has become a universal phenomenon... The dominant forces of the 19th century, democracy, socialism, liberalism have been exhausted...the new political and economic forms of the twentieth-century are fascist'(Mussolini 1935: 32).[134]'

Fascism also promotes social welfare, and is relatively Sorelian syndicalist socialist economically speaking- just not for social reasons.
If you want to look at ""capitalism on crack"" try anarcho-capitalism, or ultra-neoliberalism.

,"I really don't  know why you brought the EU or NA point when the topic was about the west in genreral and mainly how shotcalling can affect your gameplay.

I'm talking about their recent performance and what they bring to the team. Good of you to assume since I'm a c9 fan, but from an analytical standpoint you will probably never understand the burden of shotcalling in a lane where you are closely matched with the other player.

As far as I see it, yes Bjergsen isn't up to the task of shotcalling and he's not gifted in that area and lack of experience in it as well. 

Look at c9 how they tried to give shotcalling to Meteos and how that went. There's a balance between shotcalling and having better mechanics.

,"Absolutely there were, the World War II Era and before are somewhat of a golden period for American Fascism, as in much of Europe, Fascism breached the New World quite heavily. There were several popular Far-Right/Fascist Movements in Mexico, Canada and the United States. From this point on i'll be using the general term ""Fascist"" to denote any Far Right or Nazi Party in the US just for semantics and simplicity's sake. 

Between 1933 and 1945 with the ascension of Hitler to German Chancellor and the fall of Nazi Germany, many groups would be organized to support Hitler and the German Government. Groups with names like ""The American Fascist Party,"" ""The American National Socialist Party,"" ""The Christian Front,"" and ""The Order of '76.""

One of the largest and most powerful was ""German-American Bund"" headed by German Fritz Kuhn. Organizations of this type spread virulent racist, anti-semitic and Isolationist propaganda far and wide in the United States. Including the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* and *The Secret World Government,* publications blaming many of the world's problems on a Judeo-Bolshevik Conspiracy for World Domination.

In 1933, an American of German descent, and paid agent of the Nazis, by the name of Edwin Emerson set up shop in New York, editing the *Amerikas Deutsche Post* a Nazi Propaganda Organ and founding the ""Friends of Germany"" which later merged with a group called the ""Friends of New Germany"" and eventually becoming ""The German-American Bund"" in 1936, one of the largest Pro-German organizations in the United States, with thousands of members and heavy political sway. 
Emerson would be recalled to Germany and derided by the German High Command for his blatant anti-Semitic propaganda, and no, not because Nazis were into Jews at that time (they weren't) but because Emerson was antagonizing the wider American populace at little to no benefit for the German Government. A German National and World War I veteran by the name of Fritz Kuhn would take charge of the German-American Bund. Under the leadership of ""The American Fuhrer"" the Bund expanded and even set up training camps in states across the United States. The Bund, and groups like it would be financed and ideologically supported by the Nazi Government in Berlin.

Many of these Organizations disbanded within weeks of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, most of their popular support was lost, tied with the fact that many of its leaders had been jailed, fined or deported during the course of Federal investigations from 1933-1941 and after. Though many of these groups did collapse several of them went underground as well, forming rifle and sport clubs and seeking to overthrow the American government. 

After the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, there arose a second Generation of Fascist and Neo-Nazi Groups in the United States under leaders like George Lincoln Rockwell and Willis Carto, though this is a largely different story.

,"The medium displacement dual sport market is poorly represented in America, Suzuki's DRZ400S(M) is the highest volume offering by a major manufacture in america and while it sells well enough to keep producing it doesn't sell enough to innovate or improve and certainly not enough for competition to bring anything to the table. (Wire wheels are actually an advantage in supermoto not a disadvantage or a detractor for value) 

KTM makes a few Factory Supermotos that are road legal but they haven't shown any plan to bring them to america.

the nearest competitor to suzuki in the dual sport category is yamaha with their TW, XT, and WR series bikes and even though they have a 450 bike that can be certified for road use they don't see the market value in it. 

Honda's CRF250L is really a disappointing bike but they made a trade off of power and low weight for reliability. the WR250R and 450R series and honda's CRF250X and 450X models make far better supermoto bikes however on the honda side you lose a great deal of reliability and increase service intervals. 

It's a demand issue, without the demand there will be no reason for the market to move on bringing kick ass dual sports and supermoto bikes to the US. 

Another thing to consider is even with supermoto racing being bigger in europe than the US, they're still using the race bikes and that's where their volume and money a MX bike that has 15 hour rebuild cycles (translated into road use that's 3000 miles) It's not something you can easily transplant onto the road with just a few lights and a slight detune.

Their are also some awesome day trips you can make from Prague to places like Kutna Hora with it's famous bone church or Cesky Krumlov which is a little further but a really cool medieval style town. Don't forget to check out the beer gardens there, the Czechs love their beer gardens.

Budapest is an awesome city too. Great nightlife but different from Prague. They have a ton of these ruin bars which are these bars that are made out of old ruined buildings from Budapest's soviet days.

So Li was seen as a pro-Western reformer, and this view was solidified during the Boxer Rebellion when Li led the regional Viceroys in opposing Cixi's edict to go to war with the Europeans. There are some who believe that Li even sabotaged the Boxers to make sure they fail. Before he resigned in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese War, he was in charge of all dealings with Westerners and was a very capable diplomat.

Ito Hirobumi, the great Japanese statesman who was Li Hongzhang's Japanese counterpart, had this to say, ""If you were me, you would do better than me in Japan. If I were you, I might not do better than you in China.""

Many Japanese consider Li Hongzhang to be on par with the reformers of the *bakumatsu* period and the Meiji Restoration and greatly respected him.

Yuan Shikai was Li Hongzhang's protege and basically built his own reputation on Li Hongzhang's legacy. ",3,0,1449022368,,lordtiandao,3,0,t3_3v28db,cxjwhc6,AskHistorians,t3_3v28db,,1451382010,False,False,t5_2ssp3

,"***Grand Principality of Moscow***

**History of the Principality**

The relatively young nation known as the ""Grand Principality of Moscow"" appeared during the aftermath of the Mongolian invasion of the Rus, Moscow, a small outpost deep within a heavily forested area, was able to escape from most of the destruction and chaos the Mongols caused throughout the Rus. the ruler of this new, independent state of Moscow, was no other than Daniel, the youngest son of the great Russian hero Alexander Nevsky, who repelled the Teuton invaders in the ""Battle on the Ice"", fought in the frozen lake Peipus, this battle secured the political and religious independence of Russia, and is still celebrated in Russia nowadays.

Daniel's reign was marked by a relatively long period of peace, with only one battle fought during its entirety, yet during his reign the young Principality consolidated its position in central Russia and obtained complete control over the Moskva river.

Daniel's son, Yuriy, conquered many of the small Russian states that surrounded the Principality, he also gained the favor of the Khan of the Golden Horde by marrying his sister, which allowed him to claim the title of Grand Duke of Vladimir-Suzdal and gave him a reason to intervene in the internal affairs of the Republic of Novgorod.

Yuriy's successor, Ivan I, cooperated with the Mongols and even collected the taxes the other Russian principalities had to pay to the Khan, this increased the wealth of the nation, which Ivan used to build churches and acquire territory from the other Russian principalities. 

However, Moscow's next ruler(Grand Duke Dmitry of Donskoy) got sick of being the tributary of the Muslim Mongol invaders, as he was raised with a deeply religious education, he launched a campaign against the Mongols with the support of the other Russian states and succeeded in destroying an entire Mongol army at Kulikovo, although, that didn't stop the Mongols from pillaging the city of Moscow and Dmitry was forced to once again acknowledge the Khan of the Golden Horde as his superior, however his rebellion still led to the elimination of the stigma Moscow had carried in the past for collaborating with the Mongols.
 
Vasily I and Vasily II continued to expand the nation by incorporating some of the smaller Russian nations, their reigns were also marked by a cultural and religious revival, with lots of religious frescos and paintings being created by Muscovite monks, the rule of Vasily the second however, was deeply affected by a brutal civil war between him and Yuri of Zvenigorod, another claimant to the throne of Moscow, although he was made a prisoner and blinded by the Khan of the Kazan horde, Vasily II still managed to keep control of the nation and allowed his son, our current monarch, Ivan III, to become the new Grand Duke of Moscow. 

**Moscow's Domestic Policy**

Moscow's politics during the reign of Ivan III have been marked by a centralization of the state and the creation of an autocratic government, the Boyars are no longer consulted for government issues or even considered equal with the monarch, many of them have also been deprived of their lands and claims, the state rules supreme over the nobility, which is a rare sight in Eastern Europe.

**Moscow's Foreign Policy**

Some might think Moscow is currently in a precarious position, surrounded by enemies and rivals in 3 sides, the Poles and the Lithuanians in the West, the Tatars in the South and Novgorod in the North, however this couldn't be farther away from the truth.

Novgorod right now is weak, thanks to the beginning of the ""Little Ice Age"" trade in the North has decreased enormously, this has led to an enormous diminishing of the wealth of the Republic, and while its leaders try to run away towards the arms of the Poles and the Lithuanians, this is clearly apostasy against the Orthodox church and it could led to the population of Novgorod turning against their leaders......

Poland and Lithuania to the West are not a direct threat to our state as they're probably more concerned in dealing with the Turkish Mohammedans right now.

While we're still technically a tributary of the Golden Horde, this might change soon, the Horde has become increasingly weaker and its constant disputes with Kazan, Noghay and Crimea could allow us to overthrow the Tatar yoke and establish ourselves as an independent nation, no longer bound by the chains of the Mongolians or forced to pay tribute to them.

***Concept of the Game***

Guide my nation through the turbulent times of the Early Modern era, making sure I don't collapse into a bunch of different small states warring each other, or that I get conquered by another nation.

I am supposed to(as an European power) lead my nation to glory, prosperity and stability, by conquering uncivilized nations and exploiting them; and the resources of the lands they occupy, since I don't have access to a warm water port in Western Europe; I'll release my colonialist urges in the small and poor Siberian tribes instead of the vast and rich Native American empires. 

I must also pay attention to the internal politics of the nation I am playing. in the case of Muscovy I must not ignore the massive sway the Boyars and the Church have over my nation and its inhabitants. I must upkeep the fragile balance of power in my nation and ensure none of the factions get too strong nor too unhappy, or I may have to deal with a rebellion that could threaten the existence of my nation(and the position my head occupies; which should be between my shoulders).

***Prior Experience with xpowers subs***

I've played in most of the larger xpowers subs and I know how these games work.

***A post I would make***

1 million Tatars have been peacefully relocated to a summer resort in the Asian borderlands of our Motherland, because our Grand Prince understands how stressful life in the Steppes is. the Tatars will receive full access to the resort and all of the activities it offers, which include courses in ""how to build roads in the middle of winter"", ""how to survive without food for an entire week"", and a course in ""running away from the Siberian wilderness""!

But we know that their homes can't be left without anyone tending them, so we're going to bring in some good Russian lads from Moscow to take care of the crops and the households of their Tatar owners until they get back, if they ever do....... because they don't want to ever leave our amazing resort; of course!

,"I would argue that this happened in Germany and Italy because we (the Allies) imposed it on them.  Look at the history a bit more closely.

After World War II, between the Russian ground invasion from the East, and constant bombing from the US and UK, everything in Germany was essentially ground into rubble--and oh by the way, foreign powers carved up the country into occupation zones and ruled.  The Western Allies were certainly far more belligerent than the Soviets, but we ruled, nonetheless, and by force of arms.

We split their country in half, rebuilt their economy intentionally to be interdependent on the rest of Europe, forbade them from building any kind of military that could project force, and occupy their country _to this day_.  

What choice besides peace did they have?

In addition, let's consider one other big thing I think you're missing.

What do Europeans spend, GDP wise, on defense?

I don't have specific figures, but I do know that last year, NATO had to beg/remind its European members that they had obligated to spend _at least 2%_.  That's right, Europe spends less than 2% of GDP on defense.  

You might could argue, as some of them do, that they've transcended war or learned better or whatever, but the real reason they spend so little--and thus have so much more to spend than we do on social programs--is because _we've spent it for them._  In the bad old days of the Soviet Union, they essentially lived under what was a primarily US shield.  They developed their elaborate social structures because we bore the cost of defense.  When it came time to deploy to Afghanistan, the armies of Italy and Spain proved generally abysmal, the German effort was hampered and hamstrung by a litany of ""national caveats,"" and even the French and British required a great deal of US support to sustain long term expeditionary operations.

After WWII, we kind of set it up that way to prevent another European War, but now, in an era of cutbacks, it's tough to get the Europeans to shift back to paying more for their own defense.  

When the Balkans erupted into genocidal violence in the 1990s, who had to step with troops to stop it?  Those peace loving, socially concerned Europeans?

Nope, they couldn't even muster the national will and expeditionary forces to do so--it took US intervention and continued occupation to do so.  

Contemporary Europeans are actually worse off than we are in terms of forgetting about War because they haven't been asked to bear even its theoretical costs in some time, and the youth of the Continent is mostly too young to remember even the Soviet threat.  This may change as ISIS and others confront them, and the French have shown an impressive and commendable willingness to act in an expeditionary manner in places like Mali, but we'll see what the rest of Europe does.  

A peace that cannot be defended will be a short peace.

,"Hitler was a terrible military leader. He often prioritized the capture of objectives that held little to no strategic value as a means to boost his ego and thumb his nose at his enemies (like trying to capture Stalingrad as an eff you to Stalin). His refusal to allow his generals to retreat later in the war also whittled down the size and effectiveness of the Wehrmacht in the East and allowed the Soviets to capture and kill hundreds of thousands of German troops who could have been used to better defend against and maybe slow the Soviet offensives. The last major offensive on the Western front (that led to the Battle of the Bulge) was wishful thinking at best and exhausted the army in the west and used up large amounts of already scarce oil and lost them lots of armour and men.

I've also heard theories that it's likely the Germans may have been able to win the war if they had treated the people in the conquered territories humanely. This would be true in eastern Europe where a lot of the areas they ""liberated"" had no love for Stalin and the Soviets. Had Hitler called for embracing these areas he would have had the support of many of the people. Instead he and the senior staff of the SS ordered the Einsatzgruppen to run around committing atrocities turning public opinion against the Germans and created partisan movements and groups who picked at garrison troops and attacked the Wehrmacht's logistics in rear areas.

Lastly, Mussolini was maybe even more so inept than Hitler. The Italians failed in their Balkans campaign after the British sent forces to support the Greeks which led to Hitler redirecting units crucial to the offensive against the Soviets to the area.

,"First off: Get a good travel agent.  Travel agents see information that is not available to the general public, and can snatch up quick deals.  Have a broad idea of where you want to travel and they can make it happen...  
This is what happened for me... I got referenced to a travel agent a couple months before I was planning to leave.  I told her my necessary arrival date and departure date (both flexible within a week), which was 3 months total, and said I was willing to fly into/out of anywhere.  After a few weeks of searching, she got me a roundtrip flight for about $1k.  The cheapest ticket I saw online was $1.3k.  She charged me no more that $50, meaning I saved about $250. (My numbers might be a bit fuzzy).  I know people that paid upwards of $2k for similar trips.


Anyway, to answer your question.  It depends what you want to do.  

Will you be CouchSurfing?  It's probably the best way to travel in Europe/anywhere.  Free lodging, hanging with the locals, making great friends.  The caveat is that you have to spend a good amount of time planning with the hosts weeks in advance.  

Will you be actually camping?  Keep in mind that campgrounds are not as prevalent as in the U.S.  Also, they often charge around 20euros per night.  Now, you could do what I did and camp there without paying for the pass, but that's up to how you feel about rules.  

Hostels?  You should stay in some, at least occasionally.  The cheaper ones not in major cities usually run 20euros or less per night.  One of the best ways to meet fellow travelers.  

Here's a big question...  What gear do you already have?  You will **at the least** need a backpacking backpack.  You will be very lucky (like I was) to get a good one for less than $100.  I suggest signing up for REI's lifetime membership *now* ($20) and then go to their  big annual sale in January.  A backpack, like footwear, is something you have to try on in person.  Also, a good backpack will last you for years and is good for both hiking/camping and traveling.  My brand is Kelty and I really like my pack.

I did a solo backpacking trip in summer 2013 and learned lots of little tips that won't last forever (and some that will), especially about the InterRail.

,"Eugenics (for all the evil committed in its name) is really based on common sense: Unfit parents screw up kids, and cause all sorts of social problems.

Look at all the molestation and rape rates of people who end up in federal prisons as antisocial criminals. What would their lives have looked like without the abuse?

Look at all the kids who join street gangs because they didn't have a father in the home. Looking for father-figures [and families] they join gangs.

Someone sifted through the statistics and found that, if you factor our gang violence, gun-related homicides in the US are about on par with Luxenbourg in Europe.

Gangs account for massive percentages of our homicide rate.

Delete the circumstances that led to those gang-members and you edit out a massive percentage of our nation's crime.

Family matters.

By allowing violent and mentally-unfit people to screw up kids you're basically ensuring crime and pattern-based abusiveness in the next generation.

If we had just one generation without abuse and neglect, we'd see a sharp decrease in crime [and all the money allocated toward fighting and mitigating it]. Imagine lower prison populations. Less tax money spent on halfway houses and work programs. Less funds directed toward abuse-based shelters and hospital visits for the victims of domestic violence, etc.

It's a trillion-dollar problem.

So the eugenicists are right in a sense: There's a massive social cost for allowing shitty people to have kids (whom they proceed to abuse and neglect).

,"I've got one.  I don't like Ann Frank, or rather, I don't like the adulation of Anne Frank.  She's so often the focal point of most Americans' study of the Holocaust.  I appreciate the fact that the US education system, or at least the parts to which I've been exposed, try to educate people about the Holocaust, but using Anne Frank as a microcosm of the typical experience is not accurate:

1) She was a Dutch Jew.  The countries of the West had a vastly different experience from the countries of the East.  Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe in 1939.  Afterwards, it didn't.  Yes, almost the entire Frank family perished in the camps and how can someone 70 years removed assign weight to that tragedy, but to use the Franks as an introduction to the Holocaust does a disservice to its true barbarity.

2) People fawning over her diaries.  This one really sticks in my craw.  People really grasp onto the quote ""In spite of everything I still believe people are basically still good at heart"".  She wrote that before she mad it to the camps, whilst in hiding in the Netherlands.  At the time, it wasn't widely known or believed just how terrible the camps were.  Certainly a 14 year old girl couldn't have appreciated the hell in which so many Jews had perished.  Focusing too much on Anne Frank is an attempt at providing some type of positive message out of which there is none.  If you compare the writings of people who made it out of the camps, like Wiesenthal and Wiesel, you get a very different picture of the experience.  Their writings are totally bleak.  There is no positive message.  I think these writings are a better portrait of just how excruciatingly evil the Holocaust really was.

,"The adultery was very specific.  God called out David for the account of adultery, using Nathan the prophet.  Despite the quotation in 2 Sam 2:18, God did not omit the part where more wives could be included.  As for Deuteronomy 17:16, take a look at Deuteronomy 17:14-15.  The requirement that horses, gold, or wives were not multiplied greatly was applied to kings, not citizens.  It did not say all of Israel is subject to the law, just the king because of his power.  David and Solomon had different ways of dealing with their polygamous leanings.  David added while Solomon multiplied greatly.  Solomon brought about problems when he included outlandish women where David had problems with coveting someone else's wife because of her beauty.  So every man is human to the core, having faults of their own.  However, God did measure every single king by David's standard because David was a man after God's heart.  Adulterous or not, David was the 'measuring stick' by which kings had to add up to.  Jesus's response to the Pharisees had no reference to polygamy, though it is argued that it could be pointing toward polygamous families with hard hearts just as much as monogamous families.  Th question the Pharisees asked did not reference polygamy at any point, just divorce.  You're assuming, out of a wild assumption, that the question of divorce actually covers the entire polygamous families living in Israel when it could have covered both polygamous &amp; monogamous families.  Here's a question I ask of you: ""what is adultery?""  Can a polygamous man commit adultery?  Yes and no.  The real answer lies in you critically thinking, understanding what the concept of adultery really is.  Polygamy isn't equated to adultery; if it were, every single one of the Christians would be denouncing a man of God's heart as an adulterous for taking on more than one wife.  As for Timothy 3 and Titus 1, they were not strict requirements.  They were recommendations in what to look for in a bishop/deacon.  Paul did not command the people to obey these as strict requirements.  Every human is bound to have faults.  if you tried to apply the strict requirements to every single person on earth, imagine what could happen if you had only 300 bishops/deacons?  As for Genesis 2, how do you know that monogamy was the norm?  Granted, it could have been before the Fall as an exemplary example but after the Fall, Adam had no sin, which was imputed onto him.  Incest, having children, breeding with multiple wives is a definite possible scenario.  The more life goes on, the less likely Adam is to continue having more children.  If you examine the ancient times, you'd notice that an explosion of growth was not contributed to by monogamous families.  It was contributed to by polygamous families, who reproduced much faster than the average monogamous family.  After the Catholic Church set a foothold on all of Europe, you'll start to notice a pattern of preaching monogamy.  It was during around the this time the Inquisition was in full force seeking to convert Jews, and others.  It was noted somewhere that in Spain, Sephardic Jews were living there at the time and they were polygamous.  When the Catholic Church decreed that polygamy is an anathema to every Catholic born into the Church, they had one problem: not everyone was Catholic.  Mongamy wasn't the purest example of a marriage because after the Catholic Church sprung up, persecution and the blood of many who died followed because monogamy had to be instituted as the status quo.  Fast forward today, how many people actually believe that monogamy is the correct way to live life?  A lot of people, however, many do not affirm the Catholic Faith.  How so?  It's because of the practices of the hypocritical Romans, who enjoyed debauchery, prostitution, Saturnalia, and other pagan ecumenism that today everyone believes that monogamy is the correct way to live.  It is thanks to the Romans, to the Catholic Church, that everyone is led to believe that it is the only way to live.  How else to explain the severe stigmatization of polygamous families in the United States alone?  You can say that God made Adam ONE wife in the garden but I am led to believe that God did create Eve but never stopped giving Adam more than one wife in order to multiply and reproduce.  In this, Adam had no sin.",1,0,1449026888,,ait_convarion,1,0,t3_3ux5ft,cxjzchr,explainlikeimfive,t1_cxj7yx1,,1451383360,False,False,t5_2sokd

,"He wasn't, you are acting as Norway was the only place. Different countries have different charges for different passports and in many cases they can get quite expensive (over $100).

Additionally, as part of the visa process you often need to prove that you are going to leave the country, which requires you have an onward ticket. Applying for the visa this is often also a requirement to be shown, and you won't have it because you don't intend visiting that country in the first place.

Take an example of you, a Norwegian, trying to fly to Canada on a flight ticket ultimately terminating in the United States.

You won't be eligible for the US visa waiver as you won't have an onward ticket. So you will need to get a visa. This will involve scheduling an interview with the US embassy in Oslo, to which you will have to take time off work to attend (several days and a hotel if you live far outside Oslo). You will have to pay the $160 fee and bring evidence of your finances and that you have ties to Norway. You will also have to explain what exactly you plan to do in the United States, which will be difficult if you don't actually intend to go there, and will probably end up wasting a substantial amount of time and $160 to have your visa refused- and all for what? To save a hundred dollars off your ticket?

Not every country is this difficult but before you start on it being the US in particular it would be similarly difficult in the opposite direction for an American travelling to Europe, most developed countries are very strict with immigration and pay particular attention to people on one way tickets. And many developing countries, like Russia, Iran and until very recently India have also been pretty difficult and full of hassles to get a visa.

At a minimum getting a visa usually requires at least half a day at a consulate and often requires supporting documentation you simply won't have.

Because immingrants from the same country tended to settle in the same neighbourhoods/rural settlements and congregate in the same churches and social groups, their American-born, US-citizen children, still grew up influenced by their parents' culture and stood out from longer-established ""WASP"" Americans, if you will. So they were Americans, yes, but the Norwegian type of Americans, the Greek type of Americans, hence the term. The term became used a lot more during the World Wars when German- and Italian-Americans, two of the biggest ethnic groups in the country, wanted to make it clear that while they had German and Italian names and ate German and Italian food, they were loyal to the United States.

Calling blacks African-Americans started out as a more progresive term that would put blacks on par with these white ethnic groups and also recognise that they were distinguished not just by their skin colour but by their African origins (which a lot of black people tried to become more conscious of during the 70s and 80s).

,"When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J.

,"It went something like this: ""Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Peter Lawson,a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was discovered very late,due to my laxity in carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succour and confort to the less priviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I have with a Security Company in Europe for safe keeping. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations and to the less priviledged.

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this disbursement.

I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.

You can e-mail me at:*****

While I await to hear from you, may God be with you and your entire family.

Remain blessed.

Mr.Peter Lawson""

,"&gt;I don't agree with you that there is an entity called ""the Arab world"" which exists.

The argument is repeatedly used by Israel's supporters to obscure the very different circumstances that led to the Jewish exodus in each particular country.

While there were those where governments did indeed implement discriminatory policies that dispossessed their local Jews and even stripped them of citizenship and expelled them, in many others the causes were clearly economic, or related by the political affinity of Arab Jews to the Zionist project, encouraged by Israeli agencies.

Morocco, where one full third of all MENA Jews lived, never expelled or dispossessed its Jews, and rather tried to unsuccessfully prevent them from emigrating. The process took decades, and didn't pick up pace until the 60s.

In Iraq, in addition to government policies against Jews, underground Israeli cells perpetrated [terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950%E2%80%9351_Baghdad_bombings) against local Jews to hasten their exodus.

In Yemen, Israel coordinated with the Yemeni government to [evacuate en masse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Magic_Carpet_(Yemen\)) all the Jewish population to Israel, mainly to escape the abject poverty they lived in (much like the rest of Yemenis).

Lebanese Jews remained in Lebanon well after 1948 and 1967, and only began emigrating in large numbers during the bloody civil war, which also saw a large number of Lebanese Christians fleeing the carnage.

&gt; YEs I agree, social issues like slavery (beaten by the republicans)

They did do that, but the parties then and now share very little in common

&gt; civil rights (filibustered by the democrats)

Some were, but generally the democrats were more supportive

&gt; and MLK (republican)

King never espoused to adhere to either party's principles

&gt; 'm not sure what the dems did for any social issues except buying the votes of the loser class but whatever you think suits me.

Gay marriage has been an issue they recently took up, Women's rights was one they supported (granted most moderates were slow to do so), disabled rights, etc

&gt; Single payer healthcare?? If the working class (me) has to pay for anyone elses health care that is fucked up. The losers of life support it though, the simple minded sheep are in line with it. The dregs of society are all in for Barry care. Barry the dullard (believed by his simple minded supporters) said and believed that ""if you like you dr you can keep your dr"" ""if you like your plan you can keep your plan"" Your insurance price will decrease!!""

Obamacare is not single payer.  Single Payer would reduce the cost as it would give the government the power to drive down drug prices via negotiation and remove insurance as a middle man.  Most middle class people won't see a change in how much they pay for healthcare.

&gt; The hospital still treats him, paid for by federal income tax, not by insurance, I already pay punitive income tax, my tax isn't raised by this, my tax was absolutely raised by Barry care. I don't expect everyone to understand this, the net loss, loser class, zero liability intellectually dishonest people will argue with me here.

The cost of treatments already factor in the cost of treating people who can't pay.  

&gt; Barry and the dems want to not secure the birder

To be fair Bernie Sanders has come out against open borders, and nobody said they want a wholly open border

&gt; 10-20-30k syrians, where will they work? We have 5% unemployment, why the fuck would anyone with a 70+ IQ be ok with importing any labor?

Well at least in terms of illegal immigrants, they do make our agriculture way cheaper (and very few americans would be willing to deal with the conditions they deal with).  The Syrians has less to do with jobs and more to do with ""being a good global citizen""

&gt; No it isn't. We allow people to be on welfare. We try to get them on it. If the dumbasscrats can get people being dependent on the government they will stay in power. It is intentional. You are enabling shitty policy.

The economy has absolutely improved, but again not as much as it conceivable could have.

&gt;Hell the economy goes up and down all the time. Reagan inherited a much worse situation and improved it exponentially much faster than the Dullard.

[ His economy was marginally worse in terms of unemployment, but he and Obama brought it down by a similar amount] (http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/895073c/2147483647/thumbnail/1304x802/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe8%2F3a%2Fb0504c524212a5c3fbc5c6bac6f9%2F151027-prezgraphic2-editorial.jpg)

&gt; Google

I looked it up and can't find anything.  Can you at least tell me the name of the report it was in?

&gt; I agree with the government very seldom no matter who is in charge. IDGAF about who marries an ox or a same sex person, IDGAF who smokes what, as long as it doesnt cost me anything I don't care. It is different for me though because I have a family and a job and want more than I had yesterday so there is no way I can vote for a democrat.

,"&gt;so it ruins friends as well as foes

Exactly my point. Wikileaks has turned into yet another operator, an intelligence agency. They aren't anymore about freedom of information, they are just pushing their own agenda, not unlike any intelligence agency. 

&gt; it had to swing an election. 

The election still went the way I expected, I'm not bitching about that. Still, they release it mere days after the election. They knew they had it because they partially released it months before the election. They waited until the day after to release the rest. That shows more than just the good old neutral whistle-blower, that shows intent, that's pushing an agenda. 

So, why? [How about this?](http://www.urgente24.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/imagen-nota-622x342/notas/2012/07/23/cristina%20y%20ch[avez%20y%20correa.jpg). The woman is Cristina Kirchner, Argentina's president for two terms, next to her is Chavez (I assume you know him), and next to him is Rafael Correa, Ecuador's president. Need I remind you Assange currently resides in Ecuador's embassy in London? Now, Wikileaks loves to leak documents about how the US plans to destabilize Chavez, then Maduro's dictatorship in Venezuela. Yet, they just forget to leak anything that puts any of them in a bad light. Them or their Allies. In case you don't follow South American politics, on Venezuela's payroll you have mainly Correa, Kirchner and Morales (Ecuador, Argentina and Bolivia). 

But we don't have to theorize, Assange has talked to the press several times talking about ""what amazing things Chavez has achieved"" (Source: https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/view/86853-assange-nuevas-filtraciones-hugo-chavez-logrado-cosas-realmente-impresionantes)

,"The Canadian birthrate sits below the replacement rate at 1.61 births per woman on average. The replacement rate is 2.1 births per woman on average. The Syrian birthrate is approximately 3.0; just below double our own. Other parts of the middle east range from 4-5 births per woman on average.

The difference in birth rates can have enormous consequences on population and culture over an extended period of time. Consider the current state of Britain. Having accepted an abundance of Islamic migrants over the past several generations, the native British population have slowly been out-bred to the point of becoming a minority in their own country. 'Muhammad' is currently the most popular name in the country, and Islam is the fastest growing religion.

Canada has the advantage of being a very large country in comparison to Britain, affording us more room to distribute incoming migrants to help dissuade this effect, but in small communities, the immediate impact of a large influx of immigrants will severely influence that community's development over the next few generations.

The implication that we're willing to provide housing for those outside our country despite the current trend in poor economic and housing prospects for our own citizens should also be alarming in its demonstration of preferential treatment in the pursuit of appearing politically correct.

&gt;And so far the countermeasures have been relatively cheap. However, who can tell there will be some 'unbreakable' system, too far beyond ordinary computers to break? Like Bitcoin, which now needs some expensive equipments to 'mine' a worthwhile amount.

This is implying that you are working within that system, which is both unnecessary and counter intuitive. If someone is attempting to control you or the information coming to you, why would you work within the confines of their realm of control? Every point I've made in regards to communication is that it isn't necessary to play by their rules, either in the sense that you are using their equipment or channels of communication. If suppression of information ever truly became an issue, there would always be workarounds. Additionally if the goal is merely communication then the equipment need not be expensive. Bitcoin mining equipment has become highly specialized and isn't really an adequate comparison when we're talking about communication methods.

&gt;Even after the printing presses were invented, there is still a Pope and there are still monarchs and noblemen in Europe. People don't change their ways too much.

Whether or not the leadership wants to change is irrelevant. We aren't talking about large projects that require the resources of nations to be accomplished. We're talking about table top devices that could be constructed by anyone who can follow instructions and has access to common materials. Granted the development of effective genetic engineering methods would be greatly aided by access to large funds and abundant materials; but the point I've been trying to drive home all along is that once the methods are developed their dissemination becomes inevitable. No one appears to be trying to stop this development, regardless of whether or not they could. Once its been done, game over.

&gt;Bioengineering knowledge might be uncontrollable but materials are not.

What constitutes the human body is as such, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nigtogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, and sulfur, by mass and in that order (plus some trace elements but we're talking infinitesimal quantities) . All of those elements are abundant and readily available. These materials are absolutely uncontrollable, as they are everywhere in both biology and the earth.

&gt;Although there are enough material on the net to make everything if people felt like it, it is not being done. 

We haven't put boots on Mars yet either, but it's beside the point as to whether or not it is possible. None of the materials I've mentioned are even remotely close to being controlled substances. If by some chance someone attempted to control them, it would be utterly futile. The knowledge required to refine any of these substances is readily available and the raw materials are literally embedded into the environment. Control is a pipe dream. Whether or not it's being done is merely a result of the current political climate. If it ever became necessary what's important is that it *could* be done.",2,0,1449043765,,Senious,2,0,t3_3tsck9,cxk6ug2,Futurology,t1_cxk3fj3,,1451386964,False,1449044550,t5_2t7no

,"Adding on to what silverv2 said.

&gt;Toggleshift already isn't allowed and it's not a part of the mod regardless.

And even if it is a part of the mod, like in Togglesprint, it'd be disallowed and anyone caught using it would be banned. They'd even risk being banned wrongly for a hacked client.

&gt;seeing any nametag you choose if they're within your chunk

Don't remember u/imstillalivet98 mentioning this, but I could be wrong. If so, it wouldn't be an allowed part of it, and again, you risk getting banned for playertracers. Yes, atm, we have people who heavily lean for benefit of the doubt, but that can easily change.

&gt;Knowing player's exact ping and the exact saturation being displayed are the only parts of the mod I would consider to be somewhat unfair to players that aren't using them

The saturation, while somewhat negligible if you think about it, I myself wouldn't want allowed. It's too reminiscent of being able to see parts of a player's inventory/having a spec tell you something about a player. If anyone recorded themselves doing this, or exhibited behavior that suggests it(such as the subtle but evident mannerisms of F3+A), they'd get banned for it, like with Toggleshift.

The ping counter is iffy however. Yeah, I've gotten 4 bars on AU servers instead of the usual 3, or D4 can get a 5 bar on a US server when he's EU, but outside of that, hitting tab and looking at the person you're about to fight's connection does mostly the same. Perhaps it can factor into bow fights, and might be disallowed for that, but to me, it seems rather negligible and annoying to ban for(see below for more on this). 

&gt;It would give players a distinct unfair advantage over players who don't know about it

That's not a valid reason at all. My first 8ish months here were void of knowing/using Optifine, fullbright, highlighted ores, etc. If I suggested disallowing those/features of those, I'd be laughed out of here. 

Highlighted ores: you can see ores along lava lakes that are impossible to get with Vanilla, unless you waste time digging around a lava lake to check. It can even get someone falsely banned/accused for xray, because similarly, you efficiently collect said ores in their exact location. It's a massive time saver, but that's considered negligible.

Fullbright: you need 0 torches. That's a hotbar space conserved, all coal can be alloted to cooking, or completely avoided in cutclean. You'd see mobs, playernames, etc. when you otherwise wouldn't, or at distances the average player couldn't distinguish them. With nothing, I've ran past caves that had 2-3 veins of gold hiding in the ceiling unless I use torches or happen to turn and look at that exact spot; with fullbright, nobody needs to worry about that. Again, considered negligible.

Optifine Zoom: My biggest complaint tbh, and something I personally dislike seeing in Recorded Rounds, highlights, etc. You can scan caves, mineshafts, ravines, etc. for ores, mobs, or names without having to move, again, a massive time saver. You can get a clearer view of gear someone has, or the name of the player you're fighting(similar to enlarged name tags, **a disallowed mod**), or see how close your arrows get when you fire, something that I'm used to figuring out by hours of practice over hitting 1 key in the middle of battle. Optifine doesn't work for some people. All of this is ignored, and deemed negligible, when there's little actual rebuttal that disproves how much the zoom feature changes/affects. 

Given all that, tell me how a ping counter should be disallowed when those 3 features are actively used.

- - -

If you're saying something should be disallowed because the few can't have it, get rid of Optifine, or good mice, or good computers that go above 20-30 fps. 

If you're saying I'm stupid for believing Optifine Zoom should be disallowed due to its in game effects, when most if not all of us have access to it, then by that logic, X-ray packs should be allowed. 

Lastly, if you're saying an entire mod should be disallowed based on a few characteristics, same can(and IMO should) go for things like ToggleSprint or Optifine. All texture packs have potential to have see through blocks that replicate X-ray clients as well(I've seen several distinct X-ray packs in various UBL reports), and should never be allowed.

,"&gt; By what measure?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Language is defined by Webster's as ""the system of words or signs that people use to express thoughts and feelings to each other.""

It needs to be able to stand on its own, it can't be just a way to encode other languages. Morse code for example isn't a language. Much of esperanto is defined only relative to other european languages and the only reason people can use it with relative ease is that they all speak a European language.

&gt;Most languages can be translated into each other with relative ease by people who are proficient in both languages.

That isn't true, translating between natural languages isn't easy at all. It often needs heavy rewording and nuances may be lost or changed.

&gt;What ""features"" are you referring to? The bound morphology is extremely well-defined. Esperanto is a fairly regular agglutinative language.

The morphology itself is, what it means isn't. It's been a long time and I don't remember the examples. Why do you need six participles for example? Compound tenses and aspects are two incompatible systems that are both used depending on speaker's language. What intonation should be used in what situations?

And some choices are quite odd when it comes to ease as well. Why do roots default to being nouns or verbs, instead of being universal?

,"The text copied from the forums below:

Hi I would like to offer a job to make it easier to setup full-disk-encryption for hetzner servers.

Problem

Nowadays full-disk-encryption (FDE) is standard even in consumer-grade laptops and computer, and it is very easy to setup. In my latest laptop, setting up full-disk encryption took about 5 minutes when I started using it. In both linux and apple laptops it has been very easy and effortless, and I would guess it is in windows as well. FDE is very useful risk-migitation in case some unknown party accidentally gets access to your computer etc.

For servers, it seems to be much more difficult, and requires some extra tricks. However there are some quite good concepts for having FDE. This blog post describes one way, which I find quite ideal: kiza.eu/journal/entry/697

It is already possible to setup FDE to your server using that guide, but it should be a lot easier.

Solution

Develop a custom script, that allows easily setting up FDE using the method described in the linked blog post (kiza.eu/journal/entry/697)

Initially, the script would be run after the hetzner installimage script. It would ask and confirm for the encryption key, and encrypt all the disks using that. It would do all the other necessary tasks (chroot to the system, install needed additional packages, copy existing system to ramdisk, clear the drives, copy the system to the encrypted drives, chroot to the new system, do additional needed setup etc.)

The other script/command would just be there to ask for the encryption key in the boot phase. (Maybe not required, since it is a one-liner anyway).

I would be willing to pay to get this kind of script, and optimally the resulting script would be provided as open source for the hetzner customer community, so that everyone could use it.

Proposals

If you are interested in doing this script, send me a price quote, short details how you would implement it to me as a private message. Also put a price quote for mainteinance work, since I would very much like to keep the script up-to-date and maintained.

,"While /u/TeaPartySilverbug has explained it eloquently, his/her statements clearly come from a very republican point of view (the username should make that clear, and if it doesn’t google the tea party).

Bernie is far more to the left than American politics is used to, and possibly ready for, but he is hardly promoting communism. He is talking about a more ‘European’ style of government (and possibly beyond in some policies). Which does put more onus on the richer people to pay taxes in order to ensure there are systems in place for people without family, community or church support when they fall on hard times.

Also there is an odd perception that is perpetuated in the US that the rich need to be rich to make jobs. That is not how it works. The rich make jobs as a very last resort. If you have ever worked for a large company, getting a new member of staff authorised is incredibly difficult. They would sooner invest in anything else, because people are expensive and unreliable. 

Job creation (as viewed by the rest of the world) comes from a larger percentage of the population having expendable income. This income is then spent, the more people that can spend, in more shops, in more industries, in more ways; essentially forces companies to hire new people because the money is being spent in so many different places. Whereas having one rich group with money to spend means it only goes into certain industries in a predictable way, which allows for automation etc.

Read, read a lot. Figure out where you sit on the political spectrum and see which candidates are in a similar place. You will probably find you reach ‘general’ agreement with X person but dislike their view on Y issue. That is fairly normal.

,"In the Iranian tradition the Shah rules until he looses his righteousness and is replaced with a new ruler that has righteousness in his side. The Islamic Republic is the new formation of the concept of Shah. From the Israeli point of view Iran will remain an hostile entity until another revolution happens that replaces the current ruling class. The reason I say so is that in the Iranian history ruling establishments have had little to no ability to reform, thus chance of Iran peacefully reforming and transitioning to western democracy is close to zero. The same is true with Islamic establishment ceding exporting of Islam - will never happen.

The only way Iran will cease to be an hostile entity is that there is another revolution. The only way for there to be a new revolution is that the people believe that the ruling establishment has lost their righteousness, this can either happen for multiple reasons happening at the same time: stagnation of economy; military losses; corruption; etc... Essentially what you are looking for are the conditions that ended the Ancient regime in the French revolution. The difference between France and Iran however is that France was a great power before the revolution and even in the midst of the revolution, the combined armies of other European monarchs couldn't match the French military power. To say it straight, the French had the luxury to rebel, Iranians don't have that luxury.

&gt;Union asks Tsipras to act on his promise to permit help from the community

&gt; Greece recently **rejected 400 Frontex staff** that were supposed to patrol the border between Greece and Macedonia. Reasion: the mandate of these workers would have exceeded just registering refugees. Only Greek officials may protect the border. 

&gt; EU wants to apply for a border protection mission **who can act against the will of the border state**

&gt; Another accusation from the EU representatives is that Greece has **rejected 300 Eurodac machines** that are necessary to take the fingerprints of the refugees. Reason by Greece is that their internet is too slow and they have too few officials who are trained to use them. 45 are already in use, 15 more are on the way. 

&gt;Greece did not provide 3 flights that would have transferred refugees to other EU countries which contributed to so few refugees having been redistributed.

,"&gt;Russia wants a presence in the region, that is their primary concern

Yes in general, but more specifically and immediately they want the ability to influence or outright stop the Iranian and Qatari pipelines proposed to deliver natural gas to Europe, with significant geopolitical ramifications for Russia who derive considerable influence and revenue from their own European gas sales. They lose that without Assad, and no one sane imagines they'd trade it away for a Naval base and an air strip.

&gt;Russia boots are already on the ground

Yes, fighting for Assad to further the agenda outlined above. They aren't there for charity.

&gt;Now look at it on the other hand

Why don't you try the same exercise. Russia can effectively forestall NATO (and particularly Turkey) by filling SA territory with S400s, distract most of the world (and again, particularly Turkey) by providing materiel to the Kurds, and hold off the FSA and ISIS without much difficulty.

There are two options from that point:

- They aggressively pursue the ground war against IS and simply expunge them in a way Western powers are unwilling to do thanks to media oversight. Assad remains in power, Russia gradually mops up the various factions, some settlement with the Kurds is reached and Russia maintains a presence to stymie cheap Middle Eastern Gas reaching Europe - Vlad wins!

- Russia makes no serious effort to defeat IS and instead simply holds the pieces together as they are now. No side can actually win, no pipelines can be constructed, Turkey's own ambitions are frustrated, NATO looks ineffectual. Vlad wins again.

,"Guys, we have a dedicated Customer Support team that will take all the issue details of you: http://support.eu.square-enix.com/contacttop.php?id=12481&amp;la=2

I've also set up a thread on our forums but I know that some people find them a bit clumsy so I'm collecting feedback from Steam and here as well: https://forums.justcause.com/categories/report-a-game-issue-bug 

Customer Support is the best place to go though because they can log each instance, get details so we have a better idea of where issues appear, why and if it's platform specific.

On Steam, we also have a thread where we try to put suggestions how to mitigate some issues. So far we have had a success with:

*  the ‘not launching’ issue - some users have changed the screen resolution through windows which helped 
* the ‘not saving’ issue - some guys tried running the game as an admin, which helped
* flickering/stutter - in some cases, it helps to turn off the global  illumination

I know some PSN users have not been able to claim their download links - this is due to the PSN store not getting updated properly (hopefully, will be ok soon)

If any of those fixes won't help, please contact the customer support so they can collate all the feedback. 

I'm really sorry that some of you are experiencing issues.

,"I've competed against track and field athletes from Aspire Academy in Qatar. In general, the talented sprinters, like [Femi Ogunode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femi_Ogunode), all comes from Western Africa and the middle/long distance runners and the high jumpers ([Mutaz Essa Barshim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutaz_Essa_Barshim)) are from Qatar. They currently have one world record holder, [Saif Saaeed Shaheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_Saaeed_Shaheen), who changed his nationality when the Qataris wanted to achieve success in track and field.

Qatar bought players from all over the world and fans from Spain ahead of the handball WC. Each player got $5 million for every victory they got. The referees were shady in their games, but that's not my main point.

Is buying athletes from other countries the right thing to do to achieve success? A player can switch clubs many times during his career but it takes something ""special"" to switch his national team. ""Special"" in European football is usually a dual citizenship held by the player in question. I don't know why Diego Costa opted for Spain instead of Brazil, but I'm guessing winning trophies could have something to do with it. There are other cases, however. Many players who've grown up in France holds a citizenship in an African country. [Frédéric Kanouté](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Kanout%C3%A9) was capped 16 times for the French U21-team, but with players like Henry and Trezeguet up front for the A-squad, he chose to play for Mali instead, for whom he would become a star.

The difference in the ""European way"" and the ""Qatari way"" is the system Qatar has establish to find young talents in poor countries and offer them an education at Aspire Academy, which includes a change of citizenship.

,"I'm not extensively familiar with all the EU books, but in the 90s there started to be an effort to keep things cohesive from book to book and author to author. Before then thing were more all over the place, so they came up with a stratified system of determining what things counted as canon. Top of the pyramid was George Lucas, then the movies, than the novels... and I forget if comics had their own strata, but games were at the bottom. If there was a factual discrepancy, you'd basically go with what the movies said. 

There are various series and standalone books. Obviously read the series in order.  Some series have multiple authors, but generally within series and for any individual author, they did their own thing and made a little world within Star Wars. I think you can read whatever you want and circle back around if it interests you.

In fact, Del Bosque recently said that Spain tried to nationalise Messi, who moved to Barca for footballing reasons at the age of 13. How is that different to what Qatar have done?

That part was about the internet.

In reality though Turkey is really diverse culturally. When the political situation is so tense people tend to react in radical ways, because people feel threatened. Politics are discussed even in ""bedrooms"" per say. This makes people very vigilant and aggressive.

If you are a poor college student how the fuck do you have the kind of money to even entertain this idea?

,"En résumé : c'est l'héritage de notre tradition constitutionnelle.

Le texte de la Constitution de 1958 (c'est volontairement redondant parce qu'il y a une différence entre le texte et son application ; cf infra) prévoit de répartir le pouvoir exécutif entre le Président et le Premier ministre. 
C'est consultable sur légifrance.fr, les articles concernant le Président vont du 5 au 19 (sauf erreur de ma part), et ceux du PM/gouvernement du 20 au 23.

En (très) gros, le président doit s'occuper des affaires internationales (traités, représentation de l'Etat, défense...) et le gouvernement, coordonné par le PM, s'occupe de la politique intérieure.


Diviser le pouvoir exécutif entre deux chefs permet théoriquement d'éviter de confier trop de pouvoir entre les mains d'une seule personne.
On se méfie des excès qu'on a pu voir sous l'Ancien Régime ou durant les deux Empires. Cet exécutif bicéphale ressemble un peu à ce qu'on a en Angleterre (Reine, PM), ou en Allemagne (Chancelier, PM).

Cette division permet aussi d'avoir un représentant de l'Etat, de la France : le Président ; il est censé défendre les intérêts de la France à l'international. Il ne doit normalement pas s'occuper de la politique intérieure. 

Le PM, lui est choisi en fonction des résultats aux législatives (par le biais des mécanismes de l'article 49 de la C° qui le rend responsable devant l'Assemblée Nationale). Il peut donc avoir un mandat assez court, et doit conduire la politique nationale (intérieure).

Evidemment, en pratique c'est pas vraiment aussi bien défini. Sauf en période de cohabitation.

Tout simplement parce que lorsque le Président a la majorité à l'Assemblée, il peut nommer un PM de son parti. Il choisit en général un mec qui lui sera loyal, et acceptera de tenir compte de ses idées. Ce qui aboutit à une moindre différenciation des rôles et à l'intervention de nos présidents (notamment depuis Sarkozy) dans le cadre de la politique intérieure, et donne au PM une posture internationale (alors que normalement l'international c'est PR + ministre de la Défense, ministre des Affaires étrangères...).

,"You have the right of that so let me rephrase myself: they probably have gathered their data from how long the people who have passed certain exams have studied. I know Deutsche Welle arranges courses, so maybe they even have their own data to compare it to. Since most people (in my opinion) use ineffective and outdated methods, the hours they have had to study to reach those levels has (yet again, *I posit*) been inflated. Why do I say this? I have studied with ineffective methods before. I've read books and studies about SLA, and I've adjusted my methods accordingly, and found myself to be a more effective language learner after that.

Even though I'm definitely detecting some snarky undertones I'll humor you, because I don't like to be misunderstood. I guess I shouldn't even expect politeness on the internet but I'll deal with it.

I'm going with the official CEFR levels, I'm not inventing anything myself, as you and I both well know. There are exactly four criteria for being considered B1 (I posted them above, you can easily verify them from the European Council), and I'll post them again here:

&gt;A B1-proficient user can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes and ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.

As you can see, this is relatively vague. There are no absolutes in language acquisition and skills anyway, and the lines are blurry especially on the lower ends of the scale. I agree with you as well that the author of the documentary didn't really demonstrate his capabilities, so I decided to believe him for the sake of the argument.

Now, to go back to the exam bodies, at least on Wikipedia it is quoted that the hours they are quoting are based on ""hours of instruction"" or ""guided learning hours"". Once again I *believe* that an autodidact who knows what they're doing can beat those hours by a great margin.

&gt;You seemed to have a very distorted view of your own history if that is what you take from it.
Incidentally i once had another Finn who couldn't grasp... 

&gt;how countries like India, China have errors in their Census. I spend like half dozen comments trying to explain the concept of Statistical Error to him. You seem to have the same ignorant vibe.

You claim I have a distorted view of my country's own history, but don't have anything to back up your argument with - that's pretty rich! Also, how does the accuracy of the population census in China or India affect what I've said in any major way? Sure, the statistics may be slightly off, but the big picture remains the same.

&gt;Finland was in a region which was progressive for centuries, the Enlightening European movement was real and had already spread to places. Finland is also ridiculously small. Middle East is massive and the socio-cultural structure is different.


Finland had a population roughly the size of Qatar today when the country gained autonomy. It's a fallacy to compare Finland to the entire ME. Finland was the first country in Europe (second in the world) to grant women the right to vote... that can hardly be attributed to the influence of the surrounding countries, can it? Finland was a pioneer in this. 

What you're saying does not refute my point - how does this apply to China and Japan?

&gt;If you don't get it, my view of Finn people is getting dimmer by the months.

I can say the same thing for my view of Indians.

&gt;Actually that is what is happening and will happen. Smaller states/provinces to have better local level administration.
You may not be aware but there is a State/Province in North India, Uttar Pradesh, Its the largest province on the face of the Earth by population. It would be 4th largest country if it was so and that too after it was cut up a decade back. It will be cut even more in coming years.
India is my country and its the worst offender in the world on Slavery and numbers show that. Per-capita is NOT an accurate measure for EVERYTHING. Context is important. Slavery is a human issue, its emotional and about modern morals and ethics, that is why its such a big and serious issue to begin with. Its not a commodity being traded or discussed.

So what?  Splitting the country won't magically decrease the problem of slavery!!  No, you're right! GDP per capita does not work if you you're looking at poverty, because it does not account for income inequality. In the case of slavery it does work, though -  why in the world would the paper you linked to in the beginning use it otherwise? Yes, it is an issue for humanity. That is why I don't support Qatar hosting the WC. Your rambling about human beings not being a commodity makes no sense at all!


&gt;Russia has been killing dissidents in their own country and killing people in foreign countries. Annexing fucking countries in 21st century.

Again with the apples and oranges! The fact that Russia has annexed a country is in no way relevant when discussing the human rights issues in Qatar!

&gt;AND its been like this like for a long while. And they don't even have the excuse of development trajectory.
Middle East is different, its socio-cultural matrix is different, its still in its turbulent phase, it will emerge from it in coming decades as all human societies do over time.

How is that a valid excuse for the atrocities in Qatar?

&gt;UAE and Qatar are the only one who are ahead of others in the region and even they have to tread carefully because they are so small even though rich.
Its a modern miracle that Qatar is even an Independent country to begin with. Its the size of a large Metropolis and has about the same Natural Gas resource as the largest country on the face of the Earth.
This is why its so active globally because of strategic concerns, its a miracle it hasn't been annexed by a neighbor like Iraq tried with Kuwait.

I agree with you that the UAE are ahead of the others in the region - though I disagree in the case Qatar.


&gt;That would be believable if facts post 2010 didn't show otherwise.
FIFA was ALWAYS ALWAYS corrupt, in fact Baltter's FIFA is the least corrupt it has been in its entire history. Fact. You need to look up FIFA and its President Stanley Rous racist attitudes towards Africa, support for Apartheid South Africa, etc. That is the legacy of European led FIFA. And that is what Havalenge and Blatter broke, yet kept the economic corruption plus became more efficient in actually helping spread the game.
There was no long term critique when Germany got the WC, nothing when US got the WC in 1988, a feat which will not happen again in Human History, i.e. a country getting the WC hosting rights without having a Domestic League.
Qatar is a regional footballing heavyweight, at both National Team and Club level. South Africa had it worse in the run up to 2010. They never had any club or National team relevance in Africa. Japan was also given the WC before they had ever qualified for it in history.
These things were moot arguments because the world had changed and FIFA was keeping up with it by taking WC to all places. yet xenophobic idiots latched on the natural concern against Middle Eastern region and formed their attack vectors on it.

Please, provide a credible source when you claim things to be facts.

&gt;Next comes the evidence of ignorant behavior, the climate debate. May-June night temps in Qatar don't go above 30C. All matches would have been at night because of perfect timezone Middle East has for global events.
1994 WC, Ireland v Mexico, played in 105F (42C) mid day heat.
January 2015, A-League, matches played in 39C temps and officials saying everything was fine.
2014 WC, pre match daytime temps in Forteleza were 42C and high humidity. 

http://www.accuweather.com/en/qa/doha/271669/june-weather/271669 .... How about you stop inventing facts?

&gt;
The outrage thus by people from these regions in the West was hypocritical, ignorant of their own history and its perfectly fair to label it xenophobia by many, given the intensity, persistence and other factors.
Then came Human rights, a factor which WAS, IS and NEVER will be relevant for global sporting events. Right from the time of Hitler, to Cold War, to US killing innocent women and children in far off places. NO ONE gives a crap. Yet its an issue for Qatar.
Ne

Again you try to divert the debate away from the actual issue! Yes, it is an issue with Qatar!! Read the sources I provided and you see why!!! Is tiering reading through your tirades on what the West has done wrong during the last centuries - I'm not denying any of it!!! Neither am I trying to whitewash it, like you are clearly doing in the case of Qatar!

&gt;pal gets 25% of its GDP from remittance. What are you and Finland doing to compensate for that. You wear clothes made by desperate people in South Asia, who are the ones who leave their country to go to Middle East because they pay 2-5 times better and in work conditions which are better than at home.
Fucking disgusting the level of ignorance and hypocrisy shown on this debate. Ignorance is no excuse. My countrymen were dying in Middle East for decades, working under Western companies contracted to do the work. No outrage. Nothing. And suddenly Qatar gets the WC, its all hell brakes loose. Pathetic. 

Yes, remittances make up a significant part of many developing economies. We have migrant workers all over Europe, but unlike in Qatar they are not treated like slaves! Do you realize how much better things have gotten in poorer SA countries after they joined the global trade? http://www.reuters.com/middle-class-infographic  Have a look at that!!! 

And my countrymen were dying on the European continent for both the Swedish kings and the Russian tsars, bandits from Eeastern Europe commited raids on our lands and kidnapped women and children who were sold into slavery in the ME- history ain't pretty! The Muslims invaded the Iberian pennisula and engaged in warfare in Europe during the middle ages - it cuts both ways. 

&gt;Middle East had these workers going there, they will continue to go there With or Without the WC. WC is irrelevant. They go because their countries Govt is so useless at providing for them.

How does the failure of the Indian state to provide for its people justify modern day slavery in Qatar? That is preposterous! 

&gt;And without the WC a relatively better off place in Middle East has even less reason, incentive to change, Like fuck you, why should they change, they are the richest people on the planet, so what if they don't have a WC.
They will be directed towards change IF they are globally engaged. This George Bush style, Isolationist Policy doesn't work in the modern world.

The age of oil is coming to an end. The US will be self sufficient within 15-20 years and there is a global shift towards renewable energy - that will hit the Gulf states hard. The isolationist policy does and will work. The problem is that no change is happening, even with the granting of the WC to Qatar. In the UAE change is happening without the granting of a world cup - why should we have to bribe Qatar to cease with its opressive policies?

They are all made in the Northeast.  I literally drive by Hood's facility right outside of Boston all the time, they are across the river in Charlestown.  Stoney Field is in New Hampshire, is that not local enough?  Is that one of those national brands?!?!?!?!

You have literally no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;The US milk is expensive and that competition makes for lowest quality at highest price.

What the fuck?  Do you not understand how stupid that is? That's completely wrong.  US milk is cheap, of high quality BECAUSE of competition you fucking idiot.   

&gt;Meanwhile Germany manages to not have disgusting cows, delicious milk, all of it, still tons of local farms to supply everyone, and it's cheap.

Milk is more expensive in Germany than in the United States.  The US doesn't have disgusting cows?  The US has local farms?  What the fuck dude, have you ever been to the US?

&gt;They must be doing something right with their model.

What makes you think that?  They have milk of a similar quality, and it is more expensive.  How is that better than the US? 

&gt;And America has tons of food subsidies but again they're mainly abused and hijacked and it doesn't really make it to the consumer in the form of lower prices and/or higher quality.

Yes because we literally produce more food than anyone else and we give away over half of it, but let's just ignore that.

,"As someone who works on a lot of different cars with no specific brand loyalty... I find nothing out of the ordinary unreliable in minis. I have not dealt with the new generation, and can only comment on the r56. It is a BMW... Get used to that. Small repairs might be more costly than say a GM, but my previous vehicle was a Saturn ion redline, it has 192k miles and the German built engine is still going strong, and doesn't leak or burn anything. The american made chassis and gm transmission are somewhat different. Simply showing their age. My point is, if you read the redline forums, all you see is complaints about how terrible the car is, early on issues, clutches failing at 50k miles etc etc... 

How you care for your car determines its lifespan. There are exceptions-- I had a 13 scion FRS that went through three motors in a year. First one was just a bad egg, it happens. The latter two were the result of poor and undertrained technicians (Toyota) working on an engine made by Subaru. 

I in good conscience can't recommend anyone buy a new car especially early in a generation. I think its insane.... That being said.

Make your mini last 101
*change your dam oil. Use good oil with high sheer temps, designed for European cars. I recommend amsoil, Joe Gibbs or the like. Depending on how you drive, adjust your interval. I do mine every few months. 4 times a year isn't unreasonable I don't think, could get by fine with 5kmi/3x a year as well. I have a car in my shop that has the same engine as the new mini, that is dead from oil sludge at 30k mi, never changed. BMWs recommended interval is total BS... Never go 15k mi on oil. Short of commercial or highway only vehicles, and even then its a risk in a turbocharged car especially!
*change your transmission fluid, 30k for manuals and 60k for autos is my recommendation. BMW says lifetime fill, that's a lie. I have an r56 (just bought) with a dying trans at 96k because the previous owner probably never changed it, and the bearings are starting to fail. 
*brake fluid, every 30k or so tops. Usually this works out to pads, then again with pads and rotors. But I'm hard on my brakes. 
*if there's something wrong, or its telling you there's something wrong, FIX IT. Sounds like common sense but...
*learn about your car! Probably the most important... If you don't have time that's one thing, but be prepared to have a poor experience with German cars if you don't know at least a little bit and keep up with them. Dealers (any dealer) will happily tack on a massive price for simple fixes you could do or avoid. I encourage you do some of your own maintenance. Sensors, coolant flushes, oil changes, brakes. That sort of thing. It isn't complicated, and will literally save you thousands over the life of a car. Just sold a 535i the dealer quoted $2200 on... I replaced the tensioner, a few idler pulleys, the front main seal, and the belt. Maybe a total of $350 in parts and fluids, some finger bleeding and cursing, and some labor, but nothing near $2200 worth... that's insane. Dealer wanted to drop the pan, put in a new subframe, new P/S pump etc. Heck, simply knowing what needs to be done could save you $1000 here 

So reach out, learn from other peoples' cars and mistakes, take care of your, and it will take care of you. Don't Wait for stuff to fail. If you get to 100k and something that fails on a lot of peoples cars at 100k hasn't failed on yours, replace it. On r56 this is the vacuum pump... It's only $150 or so and if it fails it could result in a new motor. Worth being on the safeside sometimes

Because you're wrong. You portray the case as if Hamburg somehow found out that the original conditions weren't sufficient to satisfy the Directive, and instituted new conditions that did. That is not what happened -  - Hamburg's government did *not* institute the new conditions because they believed they were required to - they instituted them because they felt like it.

Proof of that: Hamburg/Germany is fighting the Commission case. They believed they satisfied the Directive in the conditions they imposed, and they believe the current conditions satisfy the Directive:

&gt;A spokesman for the environment agency of the Hamburg state government said the Commission had signaled its intention last autumn.

&gt;""We see our chances (of winning) as good as we think we have good arguments on our side,"" he said.

If Germany believes that it has complied adequately with the Directive in relation to the existing conditions, which are similar to the original conditions, then the institution of new conditions by the Greens clearly wasn't motivated by Hamburg believing it had not adequately complied.

,"Things used to be so clear. I honestly don't know how it got to be such a mess. It's all... wrong.

I'll make this quick. I don't have a lot of time. 12 minutes and I have to die.

When we first discovered time-travel it was all over the news. My team got a medal and everything. It didn't take long before the big question was asked. ""*What should we do?*"". Of course somebody suggested we go kill Hitler. At first the idea was dismissed, it was ridiculous, of course we couldn't kill Hitler! Could we?

The others dismissed it and went on to consider other plans. We decided never to change the past, as it would be impossible to foresee the consequences. But that thought still churned in the back of my head. That little seed of an idea. Kill Hitler? Why not? 

I became obsessed with the idea, and although the other refused it, I couldn't get it out of my head. So I stole it. It stole the technology and I went back in time. It was the only right thing to do. It *had* to be done.

I arrived before the wars, before art-school. He was just supposed to be a little boy, but back then it's hard finding a nondescript boy like that. There was no internet. No sufficient record-keeping, no way of finding that boy. I was close, but never close enough.

So I waited. I made sure to be there. I kept an eye out at the art-school he was supposed to apply for, but nothing. I couldn't understand it. Every historical record showed he was supposed to be there, but he wasn't.

You'd think my obsession would wane after so many years living in old and primitive Europe, I mean they didn't even have computers! But it didn't. My obsession grew and I found myself searching more and more frantically as the years passed. I knew our paths had to cross eventually. I went into the military, I signed up in the same division as him, I went to the same party-meetings, the same cities, the same events, even lived on the same block as him. Every little nugget of information about his life, I followed. Still. No Adolf Hitler.

*Could history really have been so wrong?* I wondered. I realize now how blind I was. I met every one of his good friends. I met Speer, Keitel, Goebbels, Göring and Himmler, but no Hitler. I even found Eva Braun, a charming lady that one, but still... No Hitler.

Only 4 minutes left.

I had followed in his footsteps so precisely, I should have realized before what was happening! I played the part too well, I tried to get too close to him! I didn't realize that I was becoming the very man I was looking for! I'm a time-traveler, I know all the paradoxes and theories, I should have foreseen this. I should have considered the danger in what I was doing, I should have stopped to think!

The tragic part is that I never believed in what they did. I never believed the pointless words I was spouting, I though they wouldn't have an impact. I played the game, I faked it all until I was in too deep. I should have turned the gun on myself when I first realized what was happening, but by then, it had already started. I had put in motion the very thing I was looking to prevent. Had I killed myself back then, my dear ""friends"" would have stepped in. I knew then I had to be cautious, I had to think. 

At least this way I know how everything plays out. I know what will happen, and although things will be bad, I fear they could have been worse.

And so, I played the part. And now it is time I fulfill my initial intentions. I was such a fool, but the time is right. Now it is time I assassinate Hitler. It is time Hitler assassinate me. I am Hitler, and Hitler is me.

Started development in the 1960s (while boomers were tweens and teens), and the biggest developments came from the 1990s to today from startups and ""dot-coms"" (mostly founded by young, Gen X/Y entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg, Biz Stone, Ev Williams, Larry Page, Sergey Brin; a particularly high concentration in the early 1970s). Boomers were involved in the popularization of PCs, granted (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, kinda Michael Dell) albeit relying on tech built by the previous generation (Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, Andy Grove, Don Estridge, Thomas Watson Jr., etc).

&gt; the economy they own as well

I. The strength of our economy comes from immediately post-WWII dominance. This allowed us to grow beyond Europe, to become a world leader.

II. Our economy's structural issues and inequality have increased with the boomers. Boomers pushed for deregulation, and speculated in the housing market. The weaknesses in our economy are more from our last 30-40 years than from before then.

III. The fact that ""they own"" the economy is part of the problem. For all the whinging and whining about Millennial laziness and the boomerang generation, it's genuinely harder for Millennials to get jobs now. Boomers aren't retiring, and low-wage/entry-level jobs are being lost to technology and globalization. I happen to appreciate those trends, but they happened under Boomers' watch, and they have done little to resolve the resulting systemic issues. Add these issues to the stranglehold on Social Security and Medicare entitlements.

So, in sum, as /u/pilto said so elegantly...

,"Ok, well I would like to reply to both you and Tanstaafl90. No one has yet made complaints about religious overtones. You two are probably the first actually! The removal is being considered because some believe the pieces do not represent the Dakota accurately (some claim they should not be bare breasted), or because they might symbolize manifest destiny. 

Personally I do not see the racism, they are romanticism influenced. The one with Father Hennepin was added because they wanted historical Minnesotan events depicted in that spot, and it was recommended Father Hennepin's travels might be depicted because he was the first European to go in those places. There is no endorsement of religion in the piece (are you going to argue the artist intended to depict Minnesota endorsing Catholicism?) The Indians in the piece are not even responding 

 For the Treaty, I do not see how it can be called racist, there is no negative depictions there either. It may as well have been a photograph (the artist did try hard to be historically accurate, as stated the artist went at great lengths to recreate some of the environmental aspects himself at his home to make it accurate)

For discoverers and civilizers, the natives are shown respectfully, the cross is not even upright in the piece, it is downward in a motion of being offered (as one would offer an item) the central figure is an Indian god /spirit, can't really call that an endorsement of Christianity either 

the rest again, I don't see racism. I feel there is no warrent to cry foul to religious influence, it is simply the history of the state that french missionaries were often the first to really get in contact with the natives of Minnesota. How else would you depict a missionary? 

Would you have objections to having simply some text to explain the piece? I don't understand how removing it will help anything, it would simply allow people to ignore the darker past.

I would like to know why you see these pieces as ""clearly racist"". To me clearly racist would be Indians all bowing to the Europeans in subjugation, or being depicted shorter, or savagely. But I do NOT see that in these pieces.

,"&gt; Either our 'leaders' want the Islamic State to grow, or they're complete and utter morons.

These are not mutually exclusive possibilities. 

Personally I think the people that are running things in the USA are ignorant, narcissistic, and childish.  I don't think that they are either capable or willing to relate to anybody outside their own social circles in their own countries, much less understand the internal struggles and complexities that occurring across the ocean. 

Some history: 

The United States during the Cold war depended on ex-Nazi spy masters to run their intelligence across in Europe.  The USA had absolutely zero intelligence presence in Eastern Europe after WW2 so they drafted the Nazi spy rings in with the same program that they used to draft German scientists into the USA ballistic weapons programs.  

Faced with the prospect of 'Tell us what we want to hear or you get strung up as war criminals' the ex-Nazis spies fed the USA a continuous stream of bullshit about Soviet military strength and operations in that area of the world.  It was a matter of survival. As a result most of the early cold war the USA was panicking about the massive military build up that never actually existed. The reality was that Soviet was a economic basket case all through the cold war and was never capable of performing any significant military action. 

Eventually when the CIA was formed these 'spy masters'... which were either ex-nazis or their replacements were able to gain enough influence via the gullible American leadership that they were able to incorporate themselves into this organization were they have had significant influence over it's activities to this day. 

I think that similar things are happening with the USA today and the middle east.  History has shown that USA intelligence is not very good, is relatively easy to manipulate, and it is possible for foreign influences to infiltrate and have significant influence over the USA's 'shadow government' organizations like the CIA.

The USA heavily sponsored 'Islamic extremists' all through the 60's to the 80's up and until the fall of the Berlin wall.  If you want to understand their motivations first think about how 'Lawrence of Arabia' was able to organize the Arabs to serve the British Empire.   The second thing to realize is that devout Muslims hate socialism and communism.  The Soviets were anti-religion and actively campaigned to destroy everything that the Muslims stand for. 

So any time Soviets started going into any place largely populated by Muslims the USA found it easy to manipulate the 'locals' to make life difficult for the communists. 

Fear of the potential 'Socialist' government in Iran (combined with their oil) was why the secular (and very western-style) democratic government in Iran was overthrown by the CIA in 1953.  Later on when the 'banana republic' that the USA put in place melted down then signs point to CIA actually supporting the Muslim take over if Iran.  The logic was likely 'If we can't have Iran then the Muslims will make sure that the Soviets cannot have it either'.

Then you also notice the long-standing relationship that USA has had with Saudi Arabia. 

I think that it's likely that these covert relationships developed towards the end of the Cold war and following through the various oil crisis and whatnot... has meant that USA intelligence and planning has been heavily influenced by groups like the 'Muslim Brotherhoood', other less public organizations, and the 'Friendly'  Muslim state governments of places like Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Kuwait, etc. 


The evidence of this is how the USA has systematically gone through the middle east and eliminating all forms of secular state government in that region.  Egypt, Libya, Iran, Iraq... these were all secular-ran nations until the USA came along and 'freed' them.  

Turkey is secular, but they have only been able to maintain that through their 'shadow government' that periodically purges the public political system of extremists every few years. This behavior has been actively been discouraged by the Europeans in the name of 'democracy' and as a result Turkey is getting taken over.

The only major secular government left in the region is Syria. Which also happens to be a ally of Russia. 

TLDR:

USA military and political leadership is still fighting a war that ended in the 1980's and have let their lazy, ignorant, and clueless selfs get manipulated by the perverse combination of corporate interests and clever foreigners to help turn the area around the Middle East into one ran by Muslims religious elites.

The EU for instance is a supranational union which means it can overrule nations and their decisions. If the EU decides that cabbages have to be labeled in a certain way and The Netherlands disagrees that is bad luck for The Netherlands.

An intergovernmental union does not have that kind of power. The NATO can advice al it's members to spend 2% of it's GDP on defense, there's no legal way of enforcing that rule. The only thing NATO can do is kick that country out of the club. Which is most of the time a large enough threat. 

Now what if these organizations disagree:

First of all, this doesn't happen that often. Most of these organization have a specified goal and an intern way of governing themselves so conflicts are rare. A famous one is when the US went to war with Iraq in 2003 with no support of the security council of the UN. In cases like that, the age old law of the strongest rules: The coalition of the willing basically said: I don't care I do as I want security council. *[Diplomacy has failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War)*.

Another interesting example is Finland. Finland is not part of NATO, but is part of the EU. If Finland gets attacked by it's big neighbor, the other EU countries should come and help defend Finland as if it was their own country. NATO however can choose if they want to come and help or not. Problem is that 22 countries of the EU are member of NATO and as a result their armies are structured in that way.

,"A huge part of why this is bad science is that it ignores people with ""mixed"" ancestry, and treats every member of a race as belonging to a monolithic group whose ancestors exclusively came from one geographic region. But that's largely untrue for many, many people. In the US, in for instance, far more people identified as black have European ancestry than not.  If there were actually a meaningful biological difference between races, this would be an important determining factor, but it's not. You're clumped into a race based on what you look like, and that's about it.  What race is Barack Obama? You'll get three different answers depending on whether you're in the US (he's black), Kenya (he's white), or South Africa (where mixed race people are a separate category).

In 2007, there was a study that found you could reliably deduce the ancestry of some geographically stable populations by looking at their genes, but that there were many people that this couldn't be determined for, and that these geographically stable groups didn't necessarily map well to traditional races. 

Basically, while ancestry is obviously real, it isn't especially coupled to the idea of a race as a fundamental division, unlike what this video proposes.

Edit: didn't even make it to the second half of the video, where the ""bigger brains"" bit shows up, which is just pure bullshit.

,"Catherine, you're known for doing a lot of work around human trafficking. You're quoted as saying, 

        ""Criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human
         traffickers operate across borders so law
         enforcement must have tools to cross 
         borders too."" 

Putting aside that that is in itself an argument for putting a border guard on the border which the EU has taken off, a significant problem with human trafficking in the EU actually lies at a sourcre outside the EU.  Romania and Bulgaria have citizenship laws with Moldova and Macedonia respectfully. It's very easy for people from these countries to become Romanian and Bulgarian citizens. That's the entry point and criminals are using illegally acquired documentation in Moldova and Macedonia to acquire official and genuine EU citizenship (and there's no real way of the EU checking). EU passports are being bought by non-EU citizens and are being issued by EU countries. From there they can travel with impunity and legally so it's not so much a question of policing (which is what INTERPOL is for and it expands beyond the EU), more you've lost control of who can acquire EU citizenship from outside. Moldova is ranked 15th worst in the world when it comes to slavery and it's almost one of the most corrupt. The EU has opened up a new market place for them. 

**What do you plan to do to fix it?""**

Specifically in the light of the following BBC article (Feb 2014),

          Thousands of people have been trafficked to 
          the UK and kept in conditions of modern 
          slavery in the past year, according to the 
          latest police figures.

          Statistics released by the National Crime
          Agency (NCA) show the number of 
          potential victims of trafficking last year
          increased by 22% on 2012, rising to 
          2,744 people from more than 86 
          countries, of whom 602 were children.

          The report drew a critical response from 
          Andrew Wallis, chief executive of 
          anti-trafficking NGO Unseen, who said it
          demonstrated that the UK still did not
          understand of the scale of the crime.

           But Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-
           Slavery International, said the increase 
           in the number of reported victims could 
           partly be attributed to a better 
           understanding of the issue by the 
           government and authorities.

           Eastern Europe remains a primary source 
           of victims. The highest number of people
           trafficked into the UK came from Romania 
           and most of them were sexually exploited.
           Poland was the most likely country of 
           origin for people facing labour exploitation.

           Of all known victims of labour trafficking, 
           78% were European Economic Area 
           nationals legally working in the UK.

#Not only how would you fix it, but how will you reconcile this with the fact that the ALDE's president has only today in his plenary speech on the Turkish summit conceded,   

           ""We have to fix our external borders.   
            Our European borders and coastguard, 
            and what I see is we are not capable 
            to do so.""

                  Guy Verhofstadt,  Dec 2nd, 2015

It appears our membership of the EU combined with unfettered access with much poorer countries, porous borders, and existing human trafficking problems is actually driving up demand!

,"&gt;He is right that the balance of power was a prevailing concern for the US for pretty much the entirety of the war. 

He's wrong in stating that the ""late"" entry of the United States was only to prevent the Russians from gaining more influence in Europe. That simply isn't correct, as at the time the US actually went to war it was certainly not at the very end of the war, it was *not* clear who would win in the eastern front at the time, it was unclear just how far the Germans would be pushed back by the soviets after losing at Stalingrad, and on top of that, he implies that the United States didn't fight until 1944-45 by saying that the US joined at the end, which isn't by any metric true, as the The US was fighting hard in the pacific the whole time, in Italy and North Africa from '42-43 in Europe.

&gt;The US leadership knew that the USSR would be a problem for them in the future and didn't want them gaining power. 

The USSR had already been a problem for the US for some time.. 

&gt;The invasion of Normandy only came after the war had been won. The war was pretty much won by the USSR back in 1942 in the huge attrition battles over Stalingrad, Leningrad etc. 

The invasions of Italy and North Africa came in 1942. 

&gt;By 1944 the victory was only a matter of time and if the US troops hadn't landed in Normandy it would only have prolonged the war by maybe a year if that. 

This is disgustingly speculative at best. The dubiousness increases when you have Stalin still almost begging the west to open up a second front.

&gt;If the goal of the Normandy landings was to relieve the Soviets, they would have happened 2 years earlier.

You seem to be under the impression that the D-Day landings were something that could have happened at any given time. That is simply bad history, unfortunately, but let's take a look at why this impossible using your own argument: in 1944 the German army was, as you say, on the verge of defeat, and the D-Day landings still were lucky in their success. Americans at Utah especially had bad luck. *Even then*, had the Americans, British, and Canadians invaded in 1942 they would have been crushed because they learned *a lot* about amphibious landings in Operation Torch which allowed them to better deploy their troops in the invasion of Normandy. If they had invaded everywhere all at once like you are suggesting they should have if they really wanted to help the soviets (because overstretched lines aren't important) they would have been destroyed by the Germans. An invasion in 1942 was for all intents and purposes out of the picture in France, which is why the United States and Britain invaded Italy and North Africa instead. Meanwhile the United States fought Japan in the pacific the entire time. On top of this, the suggestion that the D-Day landings were an American endeavor to counter the soviets ignores the role of the British, Canadian, and French troops who took part in the liberation of France. If invading France in 1942 was so easy, surely the Brits would have already done it, right? The fact of the matter is that D-Day was calculated as the best time for the invasion and was executed as such.

&gt;It is not unreasonable to say that the main goal was to quickly take as much land as possible so that they had a better bargaining position in the negotiations.

It's not unreasonable, but it's also not true. In the last dying breaths of the war? Absolutely, but that's post-Battle of the Bulge, not at D-Day. ",1,0,1449072396,,cBlackout,1,0,t3_3v18m6,cxkh410,worldnews,t1_cxkb6y0,,1451392000,False,False,t5_2qh13

,"What about David Yallop's suggestion that communist party leaders were actually very happy with Wojtyla's rise, because he had never pressed hard against them in the way that certain of his Polish peers and colleagues had? Yallop asserts that someone like Stefan Wyszynski actually made the communist party worried but that Wojtyla had largely towed the line and, furthermore, that much of the narrative surrounding Wojtyla as the scourge of communism in this sense was created retrospectively by the Vatican. 


&gt;Cardinal Wojtyla, on the other hand, was much more to the liking of the communists...At no time do the intelligence files on Wojtyla indicate that he represented any more than the occasional pinprick in the body politic of the country. He has been portrayed by the Vatican, by numerous journalists and countless biographers as a man who stood resolute against the communists and fought them tooth and nail in the years leading to his papacy but the facts reveal a man who had successfully survived the Polish Communists as he had survived the Second World War, namely by prudence and a complete absence of any heroics. [Yallop, 2007]


On the question of Liberation Theology, there is a similar accusation that gains were made in spite of the pope and not thanks to him. Wojtyla apparently rejected most of what became popular in the movement and was subsequently re-associated with it in hindsight. The pope is quoted from the Puebla conference in 1979 as stating that the Catholic church's sole mission 'is religious in character, *and not social or political*'. Yallop further asserts that Wojtyla's engagement with Liberation Theology was further undermined because:


&gt;(John Paul II gave) a very clear indication of his ignorance that Communism had more than one face, there were varying forms of Marxism, and that words of socialism had different effects in Europe than in Latin America or South Asia. It was a deficiency that he would never remedy... [Yallop, 2007]

,"Expanded from an [earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3l7lba/how_credible_are_the_claims_that_the_soviets_were/cv5zxoc)

**Part I**

The short answer is that they really did not see this as the brass  in both OKH and OKW were the ones responsible for planning the invasion itself. Although Hitler was decisive in reorientating German military power towards the USSR, many German military thinkers were thinking along those same lines in parallel to the *Fuhrer*. 

For the most part, a lot of German decision makers perceived the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact as a necessary evil, not as a new turn in German foreign policy. Both Göring and Rosenberg thought the Pact represented the baleful influence of von Ribbentrop whose anti-British biases made Hitler sign a deal with the *Feind*. The diary of Staff Colonel Eduard Wagner, OKH's Quartermaster-General, noted that the Pact strengthened the Soviet's strategic position at very little cost to them, and the Pact would only be useful if the Germans could prod the Soviets southwards into India and the Middle East, a move the Soviets were clearly not making. Other members of the German military were alarmed by the scale of Soviet occupation of the Baltics, which denied Germany its traditional strategic route into Russia. Soviet gains and Western intransigence by having the temerity to keep in the war after Poland's fall fostered an increasingly dour and pessimistic attitude about Germany's future in OKH circles. By October 1939, OKH was drawing up plans for an *Ostwall* of fortifications inside the General Government, one in which the SS claimed it would build using Jewish ghetto labor. Soviet insistence on Germany meeting its end of the economic pact also grew increasingly louder, isolating the few German proponents of a Rapallo-style rapprochement from mainstream opinion in these policy circles. 

The Fall of France reversed this pessimism within OKH and the German decision-making establishment as a whole. In a June 1940 meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Reinhard Gehlen, who was tasked with constructing the *Ostwall*, OKH head Franz Halder noted that defensive measures should be minimal and ""Whatever one has must be used for attack."" Halder also tasked Artillery General Georg von Küchler in June to draw up contingency plans for a Soviet invasion. Halder's choice of von Küchler as well as von Küchler's chief of staff, Major-General Erich Marcks, is instructive. Both were quite senior Heer officers who had wartime experience on the Eastern Front during the First World War. In short, Halder entrusted the initial planning for an invasion of the Soviet Union not to the young turk officers promoted by National Socialism, but traditional officers that would make a sound operational plan. Küchler and Marcks's initial plan called for creating a German strike force in Poland that could be used in any contingency while larger preparations continued. 

Thus by the time Hitler convened a meeting of senior military heads on 31 July at the Berghof to discuss a future invasion of the USSR, OKH had already formed solid plans in that direction. Although Hitler had likely conceived of a Soviet invasion independently of OKH, the Berghof meeting unchained the German military to expand its preexisting plans. The disastrous performance of the Red Army in Finland and captured Polish intelligence on the Soviet military led OKH to fatally underestimate the military capabilities of the Soviets. For an army whose operational culture that stressed boldness and offensive encirclement battles, the fact that the Soviets had deployed large parts of their military in their newly-won gains ahead of their lines of supply and lacked fortifications made the Soviets a very tempting target for the Germans in 1941. By August 1940, Marcks had outlined the draft of his plans and they were quite ambitious:

&gt;After we take Kharkiv, Moscow and Leningrad, cohesive Russian armed forces will no longer exist. Complete occupation of this territory is not possible and not necessary. Rapid troops and inf. div. advancing by train will be chiefly responsible for maintaining the pursuit. Time required: 2–4 weeks. Total time required for the campaign until the eventual objective will be between 9 and 17 weeks. If the Soviet regime does not collapse or sue for peace, it could become necessary to continue advancing up to the Urals. Even if Russia is not capable of actively waging war after the destruction of its armed forces and the loss of its most valuable European regions, it could still, supported by Asia, remain in a state of war for an unforeseeable length of time. 

For its part, OKW drew up a set of parallel plans for a Soviet invasion, but after the 31 July meeting and by Lieutenant Colonel Bernhard von Loßberg. The result was Operational Directive No. 21 which meshed somewhat with the plans developed under Küchler and Marcks's aegis, but OKH had misgivings about the main thrust of the attack and the overall strategic orientation of the German advance.

While this disagreement played a part in Barbarossa's failure, there was a general consensus by the summer of 1940 within German military circles that a war on the Soviet Union was necessary either to knock Britain out of the war by depriving her of her last hope of challenging German hegemony (the USSR) or to secure Germany from the Bolshevik threat. The dissension that existed within the German military was mostly about the direction of the attack on the USSR, not the actual attack itself. The polycentric administration of the Third Reich sharpened this dissension as multiple power blocs worked to achieve their own ends and found that ""working towards the Fuhrer"" was a means to achieve victory over their rivals. Because of this murkiness, Halder's selectively edited diaries and postwar memoirs allowed the onus for the genesis of the Barbarossa to be placed directly upon Hitler's shoulders and 31 July meeting, but in reality OKH had been thinking along those lines for quite some time without direct prodding by Hitler. 

The only real power bloc inside OKW that voiced any real apprehension about Barbarossa was the *Kriegsmarine*. Much of the Naval Staff's planning was directed towards defeating Britain and the various war material the Soviets provided severely weakened the British blockade of the continent. *Kriegsmarine* head Erich Raeder expressed ""serious doubts"" about Operational Directive No. 21 given that Germany was undertaking a massive military operation before the British had been defeated. But Raeder's doubts about Barbarossa need to seen within the context of the polycratic *Reich*. The navy had been pushing for its own grand reorientation of the German war effort towards the Mediterranean and the Atlantic and looked with alarm the increasing likelihood that America would join the war. The Naval Staff felt that by destroying Britain's Middle East position, they would be able to knock Britain out of the war and further isolate the US. Naval discouragement of Barbarossa does not equate to doubts about the whole enterprise or its justifications. The Naval Staff's chief of operations Rear-Admiral Kurt Fricke produced a memorandum ""Observations on Russia"" in 28 July 1940 that Soviet expansion in the Baltic was an existential threat to the *Reich*:

&gt;The safety of our homeland, however, also demands in the future the development of
spatial unassailability, i.e. an expansion that would prevent any unchecked surprise
penetration of vital parts of German soil, a deep forefield . . . which would at the same
time provide the necessary living-space for the German nation in the future. . . It
moreover demands the greatest possible economic autarky, especially in commodities
vital in wartime (e.g. oil, foodstuffs). The further development of Germany requires
raw materials and also, to the same extent, markets for her manufactures. For both
these purposes Russia is ideally suited . . . The Baltic must become Germany's ""*Mare
nostrum*"".

Fricke's conflating economic security with national socialist paradigms like *Lebensraum* was emblematic of much military thinking throughout OKW when considering the USSR.  Küchler would claim that the ideological and racial ""abyss"" that separated the USSR and Germany meant it was necessary to invade to bring ""about a long-term pacification of Europe, in which the German people controls a space that will ensure its food supplies and those of the other European states."" For many of these German planners, war with the Soviet Union was both strategically necessary and just according to the racialist precepts espoused by National Socialism. Chief of *Luftflotte* 4, Colonel-General Wolfram von Richthofen's wrote in his diary in January 1943 that he was rereading *Mein Kampf*'s chapters on *Lebensraum* and that they were:

,"Essentially the way that it works is that there's a hierarchy of tournaments. The Elite division is the group we all get to see, of which the two teams in last place are relegated to Division 1A. Between 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3, one team is promoted and relegated every year. Two in 1A. So last year, Hungary (for the first time since I believe 2008) and Kazakhstan handled Division 1A pretty easily, which is nothing to scoff at. Japan, Italy and Ukraine are not the easiest competition. 

I have a friend who does Catalan translation for the Spanish team at their tournaments.  He says it's a pretty awesome level of hockey because it's growing very quickly. This is around 2B-ish. Teams like Iceland, Serbia, Belgium and others. Every tournament he works, he tells me that South Korea is getting very good, very fast. Makes sense for the 2018 Olympics as they HAVE to field a team. The other team to keep an eye out for lately has been France. They are consistently improving their world rank and you're seeing a few more French nationals make it to the NHL. Bellemare and Roussel come to mind. 

Once you get down to Division 3 or so, you get some lopsided scores. Last year, North Korea won scoring 50 goals in 6 games. Turkey had 59 and lost the final game in OT to the DPRK. 

I saw Canada play Latvia in 2009 in Switzerland and it was a totally amazing time. Great atmosphere and European fans are much more... intense at times. Highly recommend checking out some games if you can. 

Once more and more countries become more and more industrialized and modern, and as technologies to maintain ice rinks are cheaper and easier to come by, the game will grow. I was just in Amsterdam and caught a Tijgers game (local team) and the manager of the team and I talked a bit. He said the main hurdle in The Netherlands is that the government doesn't want to fund a commercial rink of a regular size, even though they have had the permit and lot to do so for a decade. The government is very responsible with their money and they find it better to fund individual speedskaters such that they don't need day jobs and can train as much as they need. Then they get to the Olympics and dominate the one sport and the country falls in love with the sport. Daniel Sprong of the Pittsburgh Penguins was a speedskater as a child and started playing hockey around the age of 7, immediately playing against 10 year olds, and soon he was dummying 13 year olds. They essentially told his family to pack up and move to Canada if he wanted to continue, and the rest is history. Obviously they'd like to minimize that in the future, so only time will tell.

,"&gt;Second of all: Playerbase has suprisingly little to do with how competitive a region is

I'm not sure if I agree with how you phrased this. Yes, it has little to do with how *competitive* a region is, but it has a lot to do with the size of the talent pool. China isn't lackluster for a lack of talent, that's for sure. They have top tier talent in every single position, the reason they can't compete with a region like Korea is because they don't have the incredible infrastructure that results from 10+ years of competitive esports on Korean soil, giving them a leg up in terms of coaching, management, etc. Up until not long ago though, they were the second best region in the world by a decent margin, making the finals at worlds in 2 consecutive seasons without relying heavily on importing Koreans.

&gt;Meanwhile taiwan has a very small playerbase but they still put out relatively huge results.

It's tempting to overhype a region like Taiwan and undervalue a region like China because they were good/bad respectively at the last world championship, but it takes a little more than one tournament (or one season) before we can say they're really up there as a region. I don't think the talent in Taiwan is as big as the talent pool in NA/EU, and it's also important to keep in mind that Taiwanese players can play low ping solo queue on the Chinese/Korean servers (with a little bit of effort, admittedly), where they can get high level practice, which partially nullifies the fact that there'd otherwise be a lack of talent in their region. 

&gt;Now what you're saying that NA can't grow if they don't have good players also counts for EU, NA has taken a lot of players from EU and that hurts EU soloq as well

I completely agree - while it helps NA, it hurts EU. I didn't mean to imply that it was a huge benefit for the international LoL scene, just that it shifts the power from EU to NA a little bit. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, although I understand why it could feel that way to someone who really likes watching EU LCS.

&gt;Your own argument agrees that this move by NA reduces the quality of EU right now and in the forseeable future.

This is correct, yes.

*O jovem foi parar na solitária por causa de um protesto de um de seus advogados, Thiago Melo, do Instituto de Defesa dos Direitos Humanos \(IDDH\). Ele havia postado em sua página no Facebook uma foto de Braga em frente a um muro pichado na Casa do Albergado Francisco Spargoli Rocha, em Niterói, onde o rapaz cumpre pena em regime semiaberto. Uma frase acompanhava a imagem: “Você só olha da esquerda p/ direita, o Estado te esmaga de cima p/ baixo” (sic). A diretora do Instituto Penal considerou a postagem uma infração do artigo 59 do regulamento, que considera uma falta “veicular de má-fé, por meio escrito ou oral, crítica infundada à Administração Prisional”. O “crime” custou dez dias no isolamento ao cliente do defensor.*](http://www.cartacapital.com.br/revista/830/o-bode-na-cela-5910.html)

**E depois vieram as acusações do Pinho Sol, onde as autoridades alegavam o ""porte de artefato explosivo"".**

*Apesar de acreditarem no cliente, os advogados de defesa aferram-se nas apelações não à história, mas ao laudo da perícia criminal, bastante esclarecedor. A garrafa com etanol, descreve a análise, possuía “mínima aptidão para funcionar como coquetel Molotov”. Desconsiderado o laudo, e por causa de seus antecedentes por roubo, Braga foi condenado a cinco anos e dez dias em regime fechado. Em outubro, por bom comportamento, migrou para o semiaberto.*

*Para João Henrique Tristão, um dos advogados do IDDH, a prisão de Braga foi “montada para abafar os movimentos sociais”. A polícia, afirma, aproveitou-se da condição de morador de rua e catador do rapaz, “um estigma”. Enquanto os integrantes do instituto e outros ativistas clamam semanalmente pela liberdade do jovem e por menos desigualdade, este tem um sonho mais prosaico: “Só quero ajudar a minha mãe e os meus irmãos”.*

As for ""pay a hefty sum for the privilege"" surely you know that the main LEAVE campaigns have all gravitated so far around a WTO-FTA based model?   


On that note, 

Eszter Zalan quoted you in the EUObserver last month (November 25th) comparing a Brexit to a marriage divorce:
          
          ""You don’t give them the front-door key and 
           tell them to use  the sitting room any time 
           they like.""
 
Yet you also seem to be aware that the UK would have access to the 'sitting room' through the WTO. You spoke to Roberto Azevêdo, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization in February last year at the European Parliament's International Trade Committee. At the time you claimed he had warned the UK over an EU exit. What he actually said was,

           ""I think that’s a call that the UK will have to 
            make for itself.""  

He did go on to say,
             
           ""But of course, the more that a country or 
            a member is in a position to join with others 
            in defending a particular idea or defending a 
            particular agenda, the easier it is to push 
            through its interests.'  

But the Lib Dem perspective alas *isn't* the democratic UK perspective. What you campaign for at the heart of the EU isn't what the UK wants at the ballot. When he talks about pressing a common agenda it's a common agenda you have with the EU not the UK. The EU's agenda is ever closer union. You share that agenda. Support for that in the UK however barely breaks through the teens in polling. Respectfully you've only got one MEP however good she is. The shared interests of the Director-General could just as easily be interpreted as taking back the UK's negotiation seat at the WTO where we could push our interests through with the Anglosphere and Commonwealth.

Having said that,

Are you still of the same mind regarding the WTO, even now though the Foreign Affairs Committee, convened to assess the costs and benefits of leaving the EU, heard just a month ago that outside EU protectionism the UK could enjoy an 8% reduction in the cost of living on day one?""

That is does the progression of the EU agenda at its very heart, ever closer union, even take priority IF it becomes evident it is to our own economic detriment?  Is it really not a case that when people say WE have more influence being in the EU, it's more a case of saying Liberal Democrats aren't particularly well represented in the UK, and that the Director General was actually advising that if the UK has more in common with the larger members of the Commonwealth and the Anglosphere then it'd be better off leaving and retaking its seat.

I think you heard what you wanted to hear - but 8% reduction in the cost of living on day one and on the assumption no FTA deal being struck....


This ""hefty sum"" contribution through a WTO or FTA route?  Zero.  As former IoD economist Ruth Lea points out, the average CET tariff the UK would pay without an FTA deal would be 1-2%.  Easily within the realms of being offset as a net importer and with an 8% reduction in the cost of living.

""Access""?

You don't have to be a member of something to have access to it.

Thirteen of the EU's top 20 trade partners, including all top 3, trade with the EU's single market through the WTO.  If we left the EU tomorrow we'd be number 2 behind the US.  It works for everybody else it seems.

The front door finally opens.

It has been closed to visitors for two months.

After a lot of efforts, the seal was broken.

In the rear of a great luminous room, aligned in front of a white wall, five young men stare at their computer screen, headset on. The ruckus outside - it's Marathon day at Berlin, on this fall September - seems far away. The silence is heavy, almost disturbing. Only keyboards and mice clicks can be heard. The usual melody of pro gamers.

Welcome to the Fnatic gaming house, one of the eight European teams of league of Legends, each of them based in the German capital, where are organized the season tournaments by Riot Games.

The apartment is vast. 250 m², with a terrace view on the city south-west chic neighborhood roofs. Here live together people from the Netherlands, Sweden, two from South Korea and the last one from France. They're between 17 and 23 and are already models for millions of players.

Listed there are the player's nickname, age, nationality, real name, role, and a comment from Yellowstar (Bora Kim).

* Rekkles - « He's a winner. When he doesn't like something, he doesn't say it, but he will explode. »

* Yellowstar - Comment from his manager, Olivier : « Bora is a example for young people. If they were all like him, I would be useless. » *Left for the US in December 2015*

* Huni - « He's a jolly fellow, he likes to joke, he likes to be on the cameras. »

* Febiven - « He doesn't learn from his mistakes alone. He's the least autonomous in the game and in real life, someone must always be behind him. »

* Reignover - « He's lazy, he does very well moreover if it's a domain he likes. » *Left for the US in December 2015*

* Luis Sevilla - « He has never been a pro player at LoL. He's very patient. He tries to educate young people, to teach them to become autonomous. »

On the evening of their departure for Paris, where they will compete in the group stage, they look exhausted. The team has just arrived from Seoul. For three weeks and half, they were bootcamping there.

Cloistered in their bubble, with only one motto : reach the level of South Korean formations. By tirelessly playing directly with them, fifteen hours a day, five times more than the usual rhythm.

Only one evening players disconnect, to gather around a Korean barbecue, and then on a nightclub's dancefloor. That was for Fabian and Martin's birthday, who both turned 19.

« All in all, left the hotel about thrice. », Bora Kim smiles as he comes across to sit on one of the two black sofas of the empty room. The French boy, with unkept brown hair and slippers, is the only one to notice us. At 23, he's the big brother in the middle of this boys band with such an atypical lifestyle. « My gaming house agenda is to wake up, play, practice sports, then play, then eat, then play, then eat, then sleep. » he enumerates.

It's been almost three years since he joined Fnatic. At the time, he had to choose between studies - second year in Chemistry at the Orsay faculty after a bachelor's degree in science - and a professional gamer career. He was proposed with a monthly salary of 5000 dollars, but to the condition of leaving Athis-Manon, in Essonne, to settle in Germany. « When my parents learnt that I could earn a living by playing, they said OK for one year », he remembers. Yellowstar is a son of Cambodian refugees that escaped the barbarian [Khmers Rouges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge) in the early 80s.

Until then, Kunthea and Ren Kim hadn't realized that their youngest son could, one day, turn his passion into a real job. Busy with multiplying small jobs, they had often left Bora alone at home, with Rathana, his elder of three years.

Video games brought the two bros together and kept them occupied. Bora is only 2 when he discovers Sonic. He watches Esport with Starcraft, starts playing it with Warcraft III, then seriously practices on with League of Legends in 2011. It is the time of the first travels. To protect his studies, he skips some competitions when exams near. This doesn't frustrate him much : Bora doesn't need his parents to understand how important studies are.

He already knows that the career of a professional gamer is short.

[Picture : Salary of professional gamers](http://www.lequipe.fr/explore/generation-esport/img/COL/X26-CHAP01-LES-SALAIRES.png)

In League of Legends' unique model, in 2015, each player of the teams represented in the five biggest tournaments earns two salaries each month : that of the editor, around 2000 dollars, and that they receive from their team. The latter varies from 2500 dollars in Europe to several dozens of thousands dollars in China, where some teams are owned by billionaires. Two of the best European LoL players estimated their monthly revenue between 3500 and 4500 dollars. To that may be added additional earnings (from streaming, marketing operations, personal sponsoring) that may grow the total up to 7000 dollars.

Corentin Houssein, Gotaga on Call of Duty, mentions a range of 2000 to 20.000 euros monthly, thanks to his one million subscribers on Youtube. Almost half of the forty players from Millenium, a French structure, earn more than the minimum monthly wages - the most famous breaking the 10.000 euros cap.

,"Personally i think the whole 'they are doing this to shift attention from Ukraine' is almost an insult to both Russia aswell as EU and NATO. Its a very media-centered view of the world where there can only be one headline every day and we have to choose between them. I am confident that both Russia and NATO are capable of keeping 2 things in their head at the same time.

In some ways i think the sanctions on Russia actually may indirectly help them, as it forces Russia to diversify their economy and rely less on imports, which i think every country should. In my opinion every country should have the capability to be completly self-sustaining if needed, and Russia has learnt this the hard way.

The syrian government and SAA were nearing a complete collapse and the beginning signs of a total defeat were starting to show prior to Russian involvement. IIRC atleast the official story is that it was the syrians asking the russians for help and not the other way around, and Russia in need of allies and combat experience for their airforce were eager to help.

Of course Russia isnt helping Syria as some sort of charity, they have their own interests in the region and if you just look at the state of the russian military, they have gotten extensive experience and chances to try tactics and manouvres in a way that they were nowhere close as late as 2012.

Lastly i also view it as a global PR-move which seems to be **very** successful. Even my russophobic old finnish mother told me almost whispering in confidence that she actually views the russians now as a force of good in the world and the US as evil.

,"Hello ^^

For me picking a class is all about enjoying it or not, if you dont enjoy it you wont stick out with it till the endgame. Do you have any idea about tank/dps/healer? Making a decision there might narrow down the option. 

Tanks and healers generally get queued faster into dungeons or instances through instance matching, which is pretty handy during leveling. Whilst tanks are kinda okay to solo level with, healers are a bit harder (maybe not the best to start with as someone new i guess) since their dmg is pretty low. Dps have considerably longer queue times but have a easier time solo leveling and if you get avatar weapon (a good weapon made from relic pieces, you might heard from that since u already played a bit) can solo dungeons. Most classes dont get to their full potention till they hit endgame, soo dont judge too fast! 

Dps wise you can either pick ranged or melee. 
I would say all dps can be strong in their way as long as you play them effectively. 

Gunner still feels so strong because they are a new class in need of more nerfs :p. Class balancing is on their way though.

I heard berserkers are pretty easy to level with but are very slow in the beginning. Ofcourse gunner is a very easy class, because of obvious reasons. 

Hmm in my own experience warrior was pretty okay to level too, its a dps/tank hibrid so u can dps or tank whenever you want (queueing as tank for dungeons gets you in super fast... the dream). Its however not the easiest class to play most efficiently (dps way). Sorcerer was actually okay to level too in my opinion, they do great burst dmg with their avatar weapons soo u can pretty much annihalate anything in your way :p. This too isnt the easiest to play to full potential though (as this is only important for endgame u might wanna overlook this and just have fun) This however is all personal experience so might not be the same for you.  

Reaper is also easy leveling because you start out at a very high level, when you are done doing reaper restricted quest area u end up with lvl 58 (which u can do it under an hour, you gotta have a level 40 char on that same server to unlock reaper though).

As i also play on EU, if you are on the same server (Fraya) i might be able to help you out ^^.

This is kinda all i can think of right now, maybe ill think of some more later.

What is most important in picking a class is that you enjoy it though, soo try some classes till level 20 ish and figure out what you like! It took me a while before i found the class i absolutely love :D.

,"But what does Permanent Revolution really mean beside ""stop building socialism and invade Europe!""

I mean, considering the peace after WW1 so hard bought from the Germans, and that Kerensky's Provisional Government's decision to stay in the war was what led to the people revolting a second time, I can see why Stalin and his homies didn't want to invade Europe so soon after the Great Imperialist War and the Russian Civil War. It makes sense to want to take a defensive posture and focus on getting your society back into a functioning state. War communism was already really hurting the people's attitude towards the Bolsheviks. If they had just invaded the foreign bourgeoisie, there's a good chance they would have just started another world war right then and there, with a sizable fifth column to boot.

I feel like Trotsky was too much of an idealist, and was too sure that the World Revolution was due to happen any day.

,"&gt; in other words its leaving people to die under crazy dictators and jihadists groups because your economy would be damaged and its not even really a big strike.

How would it benefit us though? How would it grow the economy and benefit our infrastructure  


&gt;if a country like turkey can look after 3 million refugees, richer eu countries than turkey easly could do the same.


Turkey is not doing well, and that's their fault for 'biting off more than they can chew'. They made a bad decision and they're paying for it, and that's their government's fault.

By saying we 'could easily do the same' you're putting a moral imperative on what is essentially a race to the bottom. We could easily do lots of things but would they be beneficial to our country and infrastructure? If not then we shouldn't do them.


Emotional appeals are best reserved for interpersonal relations not national policies. You must sometimes do things that aren't very warm and loving for the benefit of the country.

,"I wouldn't say I have a political philosophy, and I don't ignore the past at all.  I just have an acceptance of human nature.  There are people alive today who were born in a time where europeans from different nations were massacring each other by the hundreds of thousands across battlefields of europe.  White people are a violent group.  Same goes for arabs and persians.  Middle Easterners are violent people who love to kill each other.  They follow a violent religion spread by the sword.  Asians are no different.  Chinese, Japanese, any other asian groups - violence and killing is in their blood.  The world is just a violent place.

,"24h depois e não consigo parar de rir desta discussão. Como uma simples pergunta consegue gerar tanto butthurt? Obrigado, reddit! Fizeram meu dia!

Se o livro é tão ruim assim, por que essa legião de gente que criticou não consegue escrever um mísero parágrafo citando os inúmeros erros do livro? Até agora só vi argumento falacioso, ad hominem (*o cara é redator da Veja, Veja mente!!!11*) e apelo à autoridade (*o historiador tal disse que é uma merda, então é verdade*). Nesse último caso é mais engraçado ainda porque estão usando uma crítica de outro livro pra detonar o autor, além de desconsiderar que o Guia Politicamente Incorreto da América Latina foi escrito por mais de uma pessoa. Até agora o mais próximo que se chegou de uma resposta interessante foi o u/zanycomet, mas pelo que eu li na discussão não ficou muito claro se a crítica é realmente válida ou se foi um erro de interpretação de leitura (como não li o livro, prefiro não comentar mais sobre isso).


Enfim, tentam denegrir o Narloch por ser jornalista, como se História fosse ciência exata, ou que historiadores são imparciais, que não estejam passíveis de cometer erros, ou até mesmo que não possam agir de má-fé e deturpar a história também. Me pergunto se esse pessoal todo realmente leu o livro, ou só tá criticando porque o cara tem ideologia contrária aos que criticam.

,"&gt;So as whites learn they a becoming a minority demographic, they are turning to a party who aims slow down and reverse that trend, and cement their status as the majority? 

Yes, a smart strategy. One that most everyone follows save for white liberals who hate themselves it seems. 

&gt;Why are they so afraid of becoming minorities? According to the GOP, being a minority in America is great! They don't face *any* discrimination, *everything* is just handed to them without having to work for it, their whole lives are just cruising down easy street! 

Because they don't want to live in a third world country. Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras are not better countries than the United States. ""Diverse"" cities in America have some of the highest murder rates *in the world*. 

Liberals of course plus their ears and yell THAT'S RACIST anytime someone wants to bring up these facts. They're the only people in the world that could point to small homogenous European countries as being ideal then tell us we're evil for not wanting to become Brazil. 

&gt;So what gives? Are they just afraid of living in a country with a lot of other ethnicities? That almost sounds... dare I say... racist? No, couldn't be. The GOP told me racism ended in the 60's. 

No they're probably afraid of the crime and corruption. They're probably afraid of their tax dollars and labor going towards groups more likely to use public benefits. They're probably afraid of their kids getting demonized and beat up at school. They don't want to live behind gates.  They don't want the media demonization to ramp up worse.

,"A few random thoughts!

All Star Game: Most All Star Games I've seen have pitted EU against NA players (or EU vs. NA casters). I'd love to see mixed teams instead of by region. All Star games exist for the fans, so I think including fan voting makes the most sense. Even though it will be a popularity vote and not necessarily a contest of the highest skill, I think that's OK as the all star game will still serve its purpose. Unsure if time would allow, but I'd love to see a very small bracket play all star game. All stars (as voted in by fans) from Group A vs. Group B, then Group C vs. Group D. Winning teams play in the finals, losing teams are 'punished' (I sure did love the pie-in-the-face punishment for losing at IEM when NA casters played vs EU casters). Separate streams to listen to in-game comms since there are no strats to be protected, unlike a regular team.

Analysis desk: I'm a big fan of 'behind the scenes' content. What's going on in the production room? The VIP Lounge? The player lounge? The line for fans to get autographs (it was madness at IEM, but so amazing to see. Fans formed massive lines after matches to meet with players &amp; get autographs)? What's the conversation like in the crowd? I love to be able to feel like I'm at the event even if I'm not able to attend.

Each one of you need  a list with budgets. 

Where you want to go to, and why? 
Where you want to stay? 
Where and what do you want to eat? 
What activities you want to experience? 
What are you doing for transport,  plane,  public transport, car rental? 
How long will be your vacation? 

Then you can see what points of your plans match,  which ones don't.  You can ask yourself on what points you can compromise. 

For example 4 of you can plan a vacation for 2 weeks and then the boys can stay for an extra 2 and do things that the girls  don't want to do. 

You can also plan a future vacation just for the 2 of you.  Is different when traveling with multiple people and pleasing everyone.

If Europe becomes majority Muslim like Turkey is majority Muslim or Kosovo is majority Muslim, it's probably better than it is now - majority godless and secular.

If Europe becomes some sort of Islamic state, then yeah that's bad.

,"Ukraine even now enjoys trade preferences with Russia compared to say Poland. Mostly in form of lower import taxes. A big chunk of Russian Ukraine trade is metal/ and products from metal. That metal can't compete on quality with European steel but can compete in price with metal produced inside Russia. But if Russia will revoke said trade preferences, then Russian producers will just increase production and slightly increase prices, while Ukrainian producers wouldn't be able to compete in Russian market due to high import taxes, and they will not be able to compete in EU market because of prices and quality ( EU production is much more effective).

Russia can't leave those preferences in place because EU - Ukraine free trade agreement will make EU goods have same trade preferences as Ukrainian goods, and they will outcompete Russian goods.

Situation didn't change since before Maidan. Yanukovich made U-turn, when it became apparent that Russia will revoke said preferences in case of implementing agreement. And Russia can't let them stay. If Ukraine want to be part of EU trade space it should be ready to accept same Russian border taxes as other members such as Poland, Estonia, Finland.

But cosequences of that decision would be quite hard in near term. And probably in long term too. Ukraine is quite different from Poland 25 years ago in demography and other ways. And Poland have handouts from EU amounting to 10% GDP, while Ukraine's EU membership not even on table.

They will have to work hard for decade, or more just to go back to Yanukovich levels of prosperity, which even back then were half of Russia/Poland. Loosing trade preferences with Russia will not help them achieve that faster. 

That's why EU tries to organize such talks. But they will not lead to anything. As situation didn't change and Russia really can't accept that deal.

Yes it would to a certain extent. The idea being that when the EU is in a position to put in place 'supra-national' anything, and members are happy with it, that is the time to do it. The current approach of trying to force through EU wide structures on the back of one crisis or another, before there is a proper structure to support them just leaves to a greater chance of those structures failing.

Reading the actual statitics betrays how skewed and non-factual the current debate on the migration crisis. 25% of minors among the migrants means that we are asking many of the wrong questions and not asking many of the right ones. For example:

- how will we provide education to a disparate age distribution of minors, having so far been educated to different levels in different languages?

- how will we ensure that they have the social experiences necessary to a child during their infancy?

- how will we make sure that these children can have a stable, secure family life?

These questions go far beyond the immediate matters of housing and provision that have monopolized the debate, and they are not questions that can be simply postponed ""until afterwards"".
