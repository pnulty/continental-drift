For example, there are several Western European nations that have had homosexual Prime Ministers already, like Luxembourg, Iceland, etc. There are western European countries where the people are probably even more immoral than Americans are, according to those Pew surveys of what people find acceptable in various parts of the world, which we all read about once or twice a year. However, no one can accuse Luxembourg and Iceland of aggressively promoting the acceptance of immorality in other parts of the world or regionally. 

A lot of EU nations have homosexual marriage, and the US was a lot slower in adopting this than many other countries. But even so, America is the only country, or at least the main country, aggressively promoting unbiblical ""human rights"" all over the world, including homosexual rights. America even has a ""global envoy for homosexual rights"", an office created in 2015 http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/02/237772.htm. 

American values, such as free speech and  freedom of the press, are not actually biblical values, and are in fact directly contradicted in scripture, for example Ecclesiastes 10:20, Provebrs 24:21, and others. And yet America has taken an opposite position on these things, and literally twists the arms of other countries into adopting American norms as gospel. And we can see how all this does is spread immorality and unbiblical norms of governance into other countries. 

This is something which sets America apart from the rest of the world, and it is not a good thing. Biblically, it would be far better for America to have a President who himself may not have morals which agree with the Bible, but who would also scale back America's aggressive diplomatic behavior in some of these regards. This is probably the #1 thing to focus on for America from a Biblical perspective, in my opinion. 

From that perspective, a lot of Trump's, let's just say, ""less than democratic"" statements, for example his admiration for Putin, etc... might be viewed in a much more positive light than you would first think. 

It is a sad thing for America that they have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Trump, but from a Biblical perspective the discernment issues surrounding Trump are a lot more complex than simply what HE does with HIS mouth and what HE does in HIS OWN life. If he were indeed to scale back America's involvement in foreign affairs, as he has made pretty clear he would do, this would only be a boost for America from a Biblical perspective.

Although one always needs to note that terrorism is an almost completely negligible problem in the West and that being affected by terrorism is about as likely as being hit by lightning.

We have FAR worse problems that one should vote left wing extremist for. For example environmental pollution. Air pollution alone kills more people every year than all wars, terrorism and violent crime combined. If only right wing nutjobs would care about human life instead of emotions and being xenophobic racists, we would live in a much better world. 

But minor problems that kill a few hundred people at maximum require drastic and completely over-the-top measures, destroying our freedoms and human rights and condemning countless of brown people to suffering... because Muslims are scary.   

In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of Europeans die preventable deaths every single year due to the use of fossil fuels and lack of investments in renewables but the right wingers don't give a shit.

In the meantime, the meat industry is overusing antibiotics leading to the spread of super-resistant microbes that are projected to kill millions of people every year in the future and the right wingers don't give a shit. 

No. Right wingers care about brown people coming to their country with their different culture. That's scary. Not the hundreds of thousands of deaths due to air pollution and multi-resistant bacteria. Those aren't scary. No. Islam is scary.

When it comes to the economic cost and cost to human life, every fucking flu season should cause more outrage than terrorism. Hell, the war on terrorism and the violation of our human rights as a consequence should be more outrageous to them than terrorism itself. But nope, they don't give a shit. They are scare of foreigners with weird accents and different religions. THAT'S important to these nutjobs.

&gt; http://akarlin.com/2010/03/transition-reckoning/
&gt; Nothing has cardinally changed since.

OK.

&gt; Of course. There's even economic research that indicates if all else is equal businesses marginally prefer authoritarian over democratic polities. I think I came across that in Hanson's The Age of Em.

OK. Indeed, I would certainly like to take a look at this research if you will ever find it! :)

Of course, I would like to point out that this certainly *doesn't* reduce my own general (maybe countries such as Egypt should be exceptions, though) support for democracy; however, it would still be interesting research to take a look at.

&gt; That is a legitimate viewpoint.

Yeah--I mean, reintegrating with an extremely poor country where many pro-Russian voters continuously die and get replaced by pro-European voters (more and more of whom reach the voting age over time) doesn't appear to be a very good idea.

&gt; I happen to believe that Ukraine's Westwards tilt is an artificial phenomenon that has been carried out at the cultural level (most of all, schoolbooks). Therefore it might still be reversible, though not so much if the Ukrainian state survives the next decade still more or less in its present form.

Frankly, I am not going to comment on whether or not Ukraine's Westward tilt is ""artificial""; indeed, I simply don't think that it matters very much.

However, what I will say is this: I think that you are forgetting one extremely crucial factor here: Money.

Indeed, I suspect that money (specifically the fact that Western Europe is wealthy and can help poorer countries develop and become wealthier through things such as loans) is the main reason that most Eastern European countries either have already joined or want to join the European Union (EU). While the older generation of Ukrainians (well, with some exceptions) generally appears to be (or appeared to have been before 2014) more pro-Russian (perhaps due to them spending most of their lives in the Soviet Union), the younger generation of Ukrainians wasn't influenced by Sovok propaganda and thus concluded that Western money is more important than historical, linguistic, and/or cultural affinity towards Russia (*not* that such a view/belief is a bad thing, though). Indeed, I think that you previously posted a poll (back in 2013) which showed that the Eurasian Economic Union only leads the European Union by a 38% to 29% among young voters in the Donbass (which is certainly one of the most pro-Russian areas of Ukraine).

Also, for the record, I don't think that large-scale *political* integration between Russia and *any* ex-Soviet countries other than *maybe* Belarus (and the frozen conflict areas other than Nagorno-Karabakh, of course) is realistically possible. Indeed, my suspicion is that the increase of nationalism throughout the former USSR (including in countries such as Kazakhstan) along with fear of Russia after the events in Ukraine over the last three years is going to ensure that almost all of the countries throughout the former USSR will refuse to agree to large-scale political integration between themselves and Russia. (Yes, economic integration is certainly possible in some cases, and economic integration *can* result in *a degree of* political integration; however, leaders (of post-Soviet states) such as Nursultan Nazarbayev appear to want to minimize the degree of political integration in the Eurasian Economic Union.)

Frankly, I think that Russia should accept its post-1991 status as a post-imperial power and try making the best of its current situation. Also, if Russia wants more people and more industry, then it can try doing a better job of encouraging its citizens to have more babies (indeed, Israel certainly appears to excel in regards to this), allow more immigration (at least from countries which tend to produce decent, law-abiding immigrants), and develop and build more industry.

(Also, if you are curious, Yes, I certainly likewise think that Austrians should get over their loss of territories such as Czechia and Slovenia, that Hungarians should get over their loss of territories such as Slovakia and Croatia, that the French should get over their loss of territories such as Algeria, that the British should get over the loss of their colonies of their various colonies, that the Turks should get over the loss of various Arab-majority territories (Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, etc.), et cetera. Indeed, trying to resurrect an empire which has already collapsed/broken-up appears to be a recipe for disaster!)

&gt; I will say one thing - Russian soft power diplomacy towards Ukraine during the Soviet period has been completely, one daresays criminally, incompetent. $200 billion worth of gas discounts on the assumption that those handouts would somehow dispose Ukrainians favorably - typical stupid sovok thinking.

The thing is, though, that these gas discounts were sometimes--if not often--followed by offers of reintegration with Russia and with economic coercion if Ukraine refused. Indeed, a better Russian move might have been to refuse to offer *any* gas discounts to Ukraine unless Ukraine agreed to return Crimea to Russia (after which point Ukraine can get large-scale gas discounts for decades, if not longer). After all, Crimea is the one part (well, *maybe* along with parts of the Donbass) of Ukraine which Russia actually has a legitimate claim to in terms of (national) self-determination. Indeed, Russia ultimately ended up getting Crimea and parts of the Donbass after 2014; however, the way that Russia did it appears to have been a public relations (and, to some extent, economic) disaster for Russia.

(Also, Yes, I am generally pretty pro-Ukraine; however, due to my support of self-determination, I certainly think that parts of Ukraine--such as Crimea--where the majority of the population genuinely wants to join Russia (if evidenced by a completely free and fair referendum, of course) should be (and should have been) able to secede from Ukraine and to join Russia afterwards.)

&gt; The $5 billion the Americans spent was orders of magnitude more effective.

*Maybe* in terms of making the Ukrainians more talented at launching revolutions; however, probably *not* in terms of making integration with the European Union (EU)  more appealing to Ukraine. Rather, my suspicion is that the wealth of the European Union (especially of its founding Western European countries) is the main thing that made integration with the European Union (EU) more appealing to Ukrainians--especially to the younger generation of Ukrainians who weren't exposed much, if at all, to Sovok propaganda.",t1_d86n3g1,1478225735,1475280975,False,russia,t3_53onyo,t5_2qh75,,1,0

I just checked the online aggregator that finds the lowest local prices, and it lists Push 2 at 1,152,700 South Korean Won, which equals 805.92640 British Pounds. I think you're still getting a better deal than me. Yes, I could order from abroad, but customs check things, and anything with a declared value of over KRW 150,000 (£105) gets the shit taxed out of it, in order to replace the lost value from local manufacturing. The only way for me to buy a Push 2 here without that issue is to have it sent as a gift, or buy via parallel importing. Yes, it's doable, as it is for you in the UK, but a hassle, as it is for you. So you're not doing too badly, in the scheme of things.

Assuming you don't want those, I have seen bees around here land on tulips, and irises early before much else is out.  They also seem to like our chives, we have the plain not garlic. Phlox and aster family members seem to do alright here. Cultivated violets might be as popular with the bees as our weed violets, and would most likely tolerate shade. They seem to love our service berry brush(early and shade tolerant but be sure not to get one that turns into a full tree, get a smaller bush version) which blooms before anything else in my yard plus you get fruit, if the birds don't get it first.  Forsythia and spicebush (shade tolerant) both bloom early and seem to tolerate Madison Wisconsin's soggy clay soil.  From what I have seen certain bushes seem to bloom before annuals.  Also creeping strawberry(for sunny area) and a few other low growers won't have as conspicuous flowers, but bloom early.  You may want to consider columbine, but be prepared for it to pull a mint on you and seed everywhere so get a native version for you.  Our bumblebees seem to like our honey berry bush which is native to eurasia, and blooms very early.  It is easily damaged by too much sun and would probably enjoy a shaded area, you won't get much fruit but the bees like it and a shaded plant probably won't sun burn every summer like ours does.  Those flowers are pretty inconspicuous though.  This falls into the flowers for the bees rather than showy people blossoms.  Be careful about my suggestions though I mentioned items that are not invasive here, I am not to familiar with what might be a danger in the UK.  If you want something for show and habitat but wouldn't really flower for bees consider you native fern variant, or some huechera come in some pretty spectacular coloring and are perennial as well.  invasive around here that might not be in the UK,( I don't know where the are from) include members of the mustard family like Dame's rocket and European lupine.  I believe you call our devil plant garlic mustard ""jack by the hedge"" and it is native or naturalized by you.

Due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to vote in the referendum. I wasn't too concerned by this as I would've voted remain and was convinced that remain would win by a landslide. I was devastated upon hearing the result.

On reflection, the result is probably positive for our country - we can gain some autonomy back and can set our own laws and policies rather than having them dictated by foreign politicians. With any luck, other European countries will see that they are loosing their sense of identity and follow suit in leaving the EU. If they do, hopefully Europe can retain its diverse, rich, cultural identities.

My ancestors helped build this country. They have fought and died for this country and its people. Not for an island, or a tectonic plate, or a planet, but a country and all that represents. To ignore their sacrifices and the best interests of my friends and families would be disgusting and inhumane.

The average number of deaths a year due to terrorist attacks is definitely lower during the years following the establishment of the EU than the years preceding it. However, correlation does not imply causation, and to state that this decrease is due to the EU is a fallacy. I'm not saying the EU didn't necessarily contribute to the reduction, but it is possible that the decrease would have occurred even without the EU.

Because there are plenty of people who claim 'refugee' status who **keep going** after they reach safe countries, who seem to want to go to countries which have generous welfare policies (Sweden, Germany) or easier illegal work opportunities (exhibit A: all the ""Syrians"" in Calais who want to go to the UK, and won't ask for asylum in France)

Yes, I do. Just look at those places. Putrid, diseased wet jungles filled with toxic insects and bloated, muddied rivers. And the people of those countries reflect that.

&gt;Muslims valued sciences and technology long before Europe was even established. 

Well, ""Europe"" was established, I'd say, with the Roman empire, which was undoubtedly the greatest empire of all time (not by territory, but by every aspect of society, including science, culture and economy). Everything we have today is due to ancient Greeks and Romans - Aristotle himself is at the basis of most modern sciences. And that's all hundreds of years before Muhammed. However, I'll give praise where it's due; Muslims achieved great successes in philosophy, medicine, and other sciences before they succumbed to religious dictatorship and primitive barbarism we see today. It's a pity, to be honest. As it was before, Muslims and the White man were on equal footing as brave explorers and scientific pioneers. But today, the Muslim has lowered himself to a sorry state of poverty, corruption, wahhabism and squalor. It's sad to see.

True enough, but they were primitive cultures. The Roman empire and other advanced cultures educated/converted/assimilated them. Natural selection.

So they congregated in Calais because the borders are closed, so they can't leave and they can't go anywhere. Please show me how they didn't accept asylum in France when they weren't allowed in France. I don't think you understand how the EU works. They spread out all of the refugees between the member states.  

Also, if they're economic migrants, wouldn't you think they'd jump at the chance to get a job anywhere? 

Let's also think critically here: maybe, just maybe, some of them have family in Germany and want asylum there so they can be with their family? Maybe that's why they're demanding to go to Germany? 

And about terrorism: all of the ISIS incidents that have happened in Europe have been caused by citizens born and raised in France or Belgium. Again, that's what screening is for. 

Also, the San Bernardino guy wasn't a refugee. He was an American citizen. His wife came to the US on a K-1 visa (aka a green card) from Pakistan, not as a refugee. K-1 visas are for fiancées and spouses, not refugees. K-1 visas are screened differently than refugees. They get a fast track to legal status. You're comparing apples and oranges. So unless you're saying we should ban Americans from marrying foreigners, that's irrelevant. 

As for economic capacity: we have 350 million people here. We can handle a lot more than 10,000 refugees. We're the richest country in the world. We have plenty of space. Plenty of empty houses. Lebanon took in 1 million. They're a country with a population of 4 million. There is no reason we can't handle more. Hell, we took in more after WWII and Vietnam. We took in people from all over Southeast Asia. Ever heard of the Killing Fields? We took in hundreds of thousands of boat people from Cambodia alone over the next few years, no problem. So you're saying fuck people like the Rohingyas escaping genocide, right? How dare they want to go to someplace that touts itself as a place of religious freedom after being persecuted for years! 

For each of the past three years, America has taken in ~70,000 refugees from all over the world per year. In 1993, America took in 142,000 refugees from the Balkans, twice as much as all the refugees taken in 2015. And you're saying we don't have the resources to take more than 10,000 in 2016? 

And yes, I absolutely would take in a refugee family if it weren't for my SO. He wouldn't allow it. But I would. Even the goddamn Pope personally took in refugees, like the good Christian he is. You know why I would? Because a family friend, [Leo Bretholtz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Bretholz), only survived the Holocaust because a kindly nun took him in and protected him. Because both sides of my family came to America as refugees. If they just stopped at the next country over, they would be dead and I wouldn't be here. They came to America to escape the pogroms. My great grandmother also helped facilitate the relocation of refugees during the rise of Hitler. Apparently, shiny new F35s are more important to you than human beings. Because that's what you're supporting. 

And I'm also putting my money where my mouth is because I'm going into a field where I can do humanitarian work and help people, just like my great grandmother did. I want to get a master's in global health so I can provide aid to children like this baby.

No, you are not, and that's evident by the multiple aspects of science denial contained in this comment.


&gt;&gt; Fracking is bad for you.

No, lax regulations are bad for you, not fracking.

&gt;&gt; Nuclear needs to be phased out.

Why does nuclear need to be phased out, why should cheap, clean, abundant energy be phased out?

&gt;&gt; Consumers have a right to know when GMOs are contained in products they are buying.

Ah, the ol ""WE GOTTA LABEL GMOS"" gambit, here, let's take a look at what the science says.

http://www.agbioforum.org/v6n12/v6n12a13-carter.htm

&gt;&gt; During a short time period in the late 1990s, some food products in the EU were labeled as containing GM ingredients. According to Kalaitzandonakes and Bijman (2003) and Bernauer and Meins (2002), GM products then vanished in the EU. We found additional evidence in Japan, another country that has adopted mandatory labeling, where it is difficult (if not impossible) to find retail food products labeled as containing GM ingredients. Mandatory labeling also exists in Australia and New Zealand, where there is not much choice at the retail level.

&gt;&gt; Ironically, this fact has not been well publicized, and as a result many observers still question how anyone could be opposed to mandatory labeling if it provides information to consumers. Ignoring the current situation, some European newspapers have predicted that GM foods will ""invade"" the retail shelves with the new EU labeling regulations. This has not been the case so far with mandatory labeling; we believe the new EU regulations will do little to provide additional consumer choice.

&gt;&gt; Why does it matter? At the domestic level, we ask whether a policy is beneficial if it is intended to provide consumer choice but fails to do so. The policy results in additional taxpayer costs due to enforcement and testing. In addition, losses are experienced by those consumers who would prefer to buy lower-priced GM food products. More importantly, mandatory labeling acts as an import barrier and diverts trade. Mandatory labeling will impede the widespread adoption of GM food crops such as wheat and rice

&gt;Australia: Almost all of Australia's population is on the coast.  With that in mind, Australia will be very quickly decimated as the US's navy bombards every large populated city and sizable military base in Australia.  Every plane will be downed, every boat will be sunk, every hope of mobilizing anything beyond gorilla fishing boats will be destroyed.  People will evacuate to the bush but will be too focused on surviving to do anything.  Sorry, Aussies.  You chose the wrong side.

Australia is no where near a major military, I don't have a clue why there mentioned

&gt;Japan will go much the same way as Australia thanks to their similar layout.  It will go much faster due to Japan's lack of military, though their paramilitary police will be difficult.  Still, with the US's navy circling the islands uncontested, Japan is, like Australia, crippled to the point of being harmless outside of its islands.  China will be trouble and likely try to attack while we deal with Japan.  China has a massive Army but their navy and air force are both smaller and less advanced than the US's.  The US will keep the Chinese penned inland.

Except that China has the more advanced airforce in this situation since the US is only able to used carrier launched aircraft. Su-30&gt;F-18

&gt;the UK is another replay of Japan, with the EU countries playing the role of China just same, penned in and everything.

I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about

&gt;Southern Europe will be ran over so fast they'll call it The Blitz 2: electric bungaloo.  The US forces are already across the Mediterranean, once the US navy come knocking it won't look pretty.

Are we even looking at the same map? Is the Gibraltar strait not contested between Spain and Morocco and the Suez Canal likely to be contested by Israel and Egypt? How is the US navy going to get into the Mediterranean ? 


 &gt;There will be intense air battles all over Souther Europe, due to almost all EU members having decently sized and very modern air forces.  

Of course the EU has a decently sized and very modern Air Force, but obviously not the UK or Japan, whom are one of the largest military spenders in the world

&gt;Unfortunately the US most likely made them and have the modern version of whatever the EU is fielding.  

How is that unfortunate?

&gt;As well, countries like Germany and Switzerland, who could slow down the US Air Force, are in perfect position to be attacked from the north and south, splitting their already small airforces in two.  

Why are Germany and Switzerland capable of ""slowing down"" the US Airforce, but not the rest of Europe ?

&gt;As for the land-segment of the war, the US has two very large sources of expendable soldiers, SA and Africa.  Without these two, the US forces would have no hope of taking any mainland Eurasia more than a few miles inland.

This makes no sense how does the US manage to invade mainland Europe when they don't have anywhere near the sealift capacity to make a landing and a breakthrough in the first place?

&gt;China will be a lot of flat land with a lot of troops.  Air superiority here will be easier to get and more effective thanks to the flat planes.

How does flat plains affect whether they can achieve air superiority or not ? Do aircraft suddenly fight on the ground ?


&gt;Russia has been waiting for this moment since 1992.  Unfortunately, Russia just isn't prepared for it.  

How so? You're making statements which make no sense what so ever, this included. Atleast explain how or why.

&gt;The Middle East is pretty boring once Turkey is defeated.  And they will be defeated.  

Explain to me, if this invasion is presumably coming from Greece after the US has conquered it how will they get through the Thracian border which is a choke point which will give Turkey a massive advantage ? Also what happens if Turkey decides to destroy the bridge connecting Western Istanbul to Eastern Istanbul, how does the US cross ?

Swede here who lived a year in Saudi Arabia

It's kind of sad because whenever I voice about these things I get briganded by /saudiarabia. I don't care because fuck em.
I've been to 36 countries, I've seen poverty, death, torture and other. I don't usually blame because I haven't lived the lives of other people so I can't judge if they are good or evil.

But fuck Saudi Arabia. Fuck the arabic peninsula, fuck it so fucking hard jesus christ fuck it. Think it's bad? It's worse than that. It's filled with the most hypocritically pious sexists, slavers, racists, xenophobes etc. and what is worst is that they don't just look down on the ""worst"" of the world. They hate everyone who is not themselves.
Send your daughters and sons to europe and have them educated? Check. Let them lavish in greed, sex, alcohol, parties etc? Check. Act as if they're fucking muhammed/fatima reincarnated one they come back, all the whilst hating and judging every westerner that comes there? Check.

My mother is a lone mother of three. After a man was masturbating on the fucking buss whilst staring at her (for not wearing the face-veil, even though she wore the entire black dress anyway) we were told by the religious police we should be thankful she was not raped for the succubus whore she was not wearing the entire Niqāb. 


Because if she had been raped it'd been her fault and they'd killed her for luring men. And this is just one out of hundreds of stories, the beating of ""guest-workers"" (slaves), the raping of Philippine nurses until they actually contested who was the main rape-ee because she got the best gifts, the stealing of our passports trying to keep us once we tried to flee/move, the systematic murdering of female babies of which tons came into the ER when the parents/people got guilt-tripped once the baby started turning blue and yellow... Often way to late to save it.


I really need to make a huge huge post one day and just copy+paste it in every topic about these things because tons of people ask for more stories. All the while I get re-linked in /saudi, /dubai, /qatar etc. and mass-msg'd and harassed by people explaining to me how I'm a liar because pious muslims of the middle-east would never rape a woman unless she was totally asking for it.

They have a good position to sell to eastern europe, africa, and even asia. As africa and even eastern europe develop and electrify they will need equipment (so definitely long term play).

,0,False,,d897mh0,Jeffffffff,"Video is made up of a bunch of different images that change around 30 times per second. Historically, televisions always ran at the same speed. In North America, it was about 30 frames per second (NTSC), in Europe about 25 frames per second (PAL). This leads to certain problems when you're releasing the same movie between regions (to further complicate things, film projectors have been running at 24 frames per second pretty consistently since sound was added).

On modern (LCD/digital) televisions, there's no problem switching between framerates, so it doesn't really matter anymore if the video you're watching is from Europe or North America, but some videos are still 25 frames per second and some are still 30 frames per second. You have to dig pretty deep to actually find this information (if you have VLC installed, you can find this information in the codec information dialog).

Subtitles, of course, need to be synchronized with the video. Every line in the subtitle has a reference for when it should be displayed, and when it should disappear again.

If you have video and subtitles that are correctly synchronized, and then remove the first second of video, every subtitle will appear one second later than it should. This is consistent though---the synchronization will not get worse throughout, it will always be one second off.

Some subtitle formats use frame numbers as time references rather than minute/second/millisecond. Because this is what the decoder is dealing with internally, there is less processing required to handle the subtitles.

Suppose a subtitle should be displayed after exactly five minutes. If the video is run at 25 frames per second, this means it should be displayed on frame 7500. But, if the video is run at 30 frames per second then this same spot in the video will be frame 9000 (1500 frame difference). At ten minutes, this is frame 15000 @25 or 180000 @30 (3000 frame difference)

This means that the subtitles taken from a European DVD will have different timing references than the same subtitles taken from a North American DVD. If you play a North American video with European subtitles (or vice versa), synchronization will be incorrect. It also means that the further you are into the video, the worse the synchronization will be.

There are tools that will recalculate frame references for subtitles (it's theoretically dead simple to do, but I don't have any experience actually doing it, so no software recommendations).

---

The popular srt format stores timing information in minutes/seconds/milliseconds rather than frame references so it is immune to this problem. If you experience this with an srt subtitle track then most likely you just have poor subtitles.",t3_55bgcp,1478229359,1475293861,False,explainlikeimfive,t3_55bgcp,t5_2sokd,,2,0

&gt; I don't see you proposing solutions.. nobody is making any claims that aren't backed by an abundance of evidence.

Yeah, nobody is throwing around terms like Rapefugees"" at all.  What mountain of evidence have *you* provided?  Youve just made a bunch of unsubstantiated claims.  As far as proposing solutions . . not surprisingly, we don't agree upon the problem .  . . you are singularly focused on how issues impact you, Europe, Europeans and the West.  I don't agree with that narrow definition of the problem.

&gt; You want a big number to scare people, there are 65 million refugees worldwide today, that number is only growing and the scarier thing is that the rate is also growing.

Absolutely, this is a huge problem.  But again, the overwhelming majority of those are internally displaced and I ask again, are you more concerned about the welfare of these people or more concerned they may inconvenience you?  It's worth asking.

&gt; Not entirely true, crime in many parts of Europe is starting to increase or the rates of decrease are stagnating. Many large inner cities are experiencing their highest homicide rates in a decade.

I forgot that the only part of the world that matters is Europe and the US!  

&gt; I don't necessarily agree you have to throw money at everything either, legalising drugs alone would have a huge impact on the problems in the US for example, it would also be a major boost to the economy..

Kinda does. Heck, it's our support of brutal dictatorships in South America that keeps that region of the world icy towards us. That affects our geopolitical relationship with them. We're all humans.

&gt; Just like moving into the crimea is an attempt to push back against the west's crusade against their buffer states and achieve parity with western aggression.

Moving into Crimea was because Russia had no other option. Theres no parity to be had with the US at this point. The only thing they want is to secure assets for their own country. Which, in this case, was economic potential of Crimea and a warm water port.


&gt; like remember the time where one of our fruit companies set up shop in Colombia essentially working them like slaves, and then when they complained about it they all ""disappeared?"" or how we propped up brutal dictatorships in South America throughout the cold war? 

... you know, I think this is actually whataboutism. I mean, of course the US did horrible things. You tend to do horrible things when you think what you're doing is 'just'. I do not approve of it. At all.

But the problem is is that we are not talking about Columbia or South America. We are talking about Ukraine and its unique relationship with Soviet Union turned Russia.

Ukraine is at a point where it simply 'can't' survive on its own.

1. You probably won't refer to Western Art as European art very often uness you're not familiar with art.

2. It's not going to be common to find the terms ""people"" and ""art"" together unless we're talking about a minority group in art, because you don't write or say ""white people, art"" since we consider that as the sort of default setting for our culture's art. We just say ""people, art"" or ""our art"" or ""the art."" So there are very few pages and images labeled ""xxxxx people, art"" which show white people. They're probably instead labeled by the name of the work or the movement in which the art was produced. In contrast there is much much less African American and African European art (or art depicting these ethnicities), so we can learn about our culture by how these subjects are treated in art, we also have entire departments and subspecialties who study the African diaspora and their culture in the West. This academic context is actually one of the few places where you will see all of our art referred to as European art, because it's specifically looking at the West, as a whole,  and how the Western art (across many periods and art movements) interacts with this ethnic group. (You could also see ""European art"" in the context of a world art class or survey but those are not very popular outside of educational contexts.  Even in this context we tend to teach embassy we call ""world art"" with a huge focus on Western Art and not acknowledge that bias in our coverage.)",t1_d892vm6,1478231377,1475303026,False,conspiracy,t3_55a8f8,t5_2qh4r,,2,0

First of all, any country touched by black people has always been damaged; you look at Africa, and the only prosperous, independent countries it produced were: Rhodesia, and South Africa- at least before Africans decided they're in charge. If you love them so much, go live in Liberia and die from Ebola, please. And take your beloved blacks with you, and hopefully you'll enlighten the dark continent with your superior knowledge of history and political correctness. 

When white people shipped off the worst of their society, they formed countries like South Africa and Australia, countries that for *some reason* PoCs like to immigrate to. Where is your influx of immigrants from Europe to some 3rd world African shithole? 

Civil Disobedience is still disobedience, and if it takes a bunch of dead PoCs and their white, liberal sympathizers to restore the peace, so be it; and it should not stop until they understand what peace and order is. People complain about oppression by burning private property? They have **to die** if they will not respect other peoples' property. I will not ask you politely, I will shoot you and your friends if you go near my property the way they rioted in North Carolina. I have a right to defend my property, and I don't care if you Dindu Nuffin, or if your boon mama cries about how ""You's gonna college, git edjuceshun, Dindu Nuffin."" You have no real idea as to how far right these chimpouts push people, and no amount of ""debates"" from faggots with multi-colored hair will stop it. The only thing these people really understand the language of bullets and beatings. Law and obedience means *nothing* to them, and so they deserve none of it. 

Your revisionist history is incorrect, and even so, irrelevant- the innocent, angelic people from the 60's you like to believe existed are not the same as the spoiled, entitled, welfare queens and criminals of today. The more you look at it, the more you have to ask if desegregation was a good thing- the farther away you take a black man from Jim Crow, the more miserable he is, or is he not miserable, until everyone is a mulatto, and America is no more than a collection of Detroits everywhere, just like Africa?  

Please, tell me. What color are the people who mostly populate the jails of America? Don't avoid this question because it's racist, but you will because it's inconvenient for your little liberal narrative of justified violence. 

Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian refugees who came with nothing but their shirt have done more the last 40 years than all the 200 years of ""Emancipation"" that was given to them- *Given to them*, not **earned**. 

Black neighborhoods are poor because their inhabitants are violent, they are violent, because they are dependent on the State, which does not provide them with anything that makes them self-sufficient, further creating a cycle of bastards, deadbeat fathers, and ""Hey, Gibs Me Dat"" mentality which your ""Gentle Giants"" have for justifying their thefts.  

Are they really justified? I'd say no. When things like riots happen in places like Charlotte, innocent, hard-working people, who rightly believe the shooting does *not* affect them, **move away** because they have common sense; and so, their savings, and business, and opportunities go with them- Your ""black neighborhoods"" aren't violent because they're poor; they're poor **because they're violent**. It's inherent in their culture. 

Would you really please be honest and tell me; if you take the whole lot of America's black population; no, in fact, just Detroit, and switch them with the entire Swiss population, would Switzerland still be a rich country? No. Barely numerate populations would not be able to replicate Swiss society. They'd twerk and kill each other first. You'd say ""Because there's not enough opportunity/slavery/white people are evil"" But it's not just a thought experiment- Black people have already driven away white people, even in Detroit; the mostly-white city of Livonia is located a few miles away from Detroit, and it's more prosperous than Detroit. It is a fallacy that opportunity necessarily equates to success. You can give all sorts of opportunity to black people, but if they are failures, then that opportunity belongs to other people; and if that pisses you off, or a mob of black people, then fuck you, fuck them, deal with it. Are you going to riot and inflict violence on innocent bystanders and your own town as a way of dealing with it? Then you deserve to die, because you are my enemy who wishes to take away what I earned and worked for; you are *not* nobler than a mugger or a burglar.

Oh, and by the way, the Keith Lamont Scott was shot by an African American police officer, Brentley Vinson- but please that's just ""Black on black crime"" right, it's still whitey that did it, right? Therefore, riot in the streets, right? 

Your martyr is some wife-beater convict lowlife who was shot because he refused to comply with the police. That's the common theme with your black people. That's why they're in jails, getting food and shelter from honest, taxpayers, when it's just cheaper to to shoot them and feed them to each other. 

[People like you enable black people to continue making trouble for everyone and digging themselves deeper into misery by telling everyone that they are right in their attitudes and ways of reacting to hardships handed to them by history, by ""the system"" and life in general.

Um . . . you have one narrow focal point of viewing the refugee crisis - what's the impact on Europe / West.  Just because that's the only. part of the problem you want to focus on, does not make you more objective.  Ignoring the causes of the refugee crisis, a look at devastation they are escaping from is not objectivity.  Ignoring the humanitarian concerns because god forbid human misery might affect your emotions does not make you objective.  You are seriously conflating refugees with economic migrants, just acting as if they are just everyday visitors who showed up at the door.

I gather based on your post history that you don't share much sympathy for Muslims because of their religion.  So let's just pretend that instead of Muslims, its 1944 and 1 million Jews are refugees, and a bunch of them are anarchists or communists, and have higher crime rates.  Would you consider a discussion on allowing these Jews in as refugees that *does not even mention the holocaust* to be ""objective?""

&gt;  That is not the point, if Turkey or Jordan face major problems in the future, the problem in Europe get's infinitely worse.
Again, these countries are broke and don't can't provide asylum to hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom are trying to get to Britain and Germany anyway....

I don't understand the point you are making.  Is it that these two countries cannot manage the refugees?  I said that myself.  You're the one who thinks they can.  My point is that its a figment of your imagination that there is willingness in Europe to provide financial assistance to those countries.  You're dreaming.

&gt; Nobody here is throwing rapefugee around...are you saying Cologne and other incidents haven't been perpetrated mostly by migrants, have you cared to look at crime stats throughout the EU based on ethnicity?? Are you saying Islam doesn't treat women abhorrently, Indonesia, the beacon of moderate Islam for the left as an example, saws away the clitoris of 99% of female Muslim infants.

I don't think you understand - under the agreed upon convention on the rights of refugees, just because you happen to have shitty views does not mean you are not entitled to human rights.  And yes, rapefugee has been thrown around A LOT.  Perhaps not on this sub, but it is a common term used by right-wing outlets in Europe and the US.  Let's be fair here, refugees have been completely dehumanized by the right-wing.  They are treated as pariahs without any empathy for their circumstances.  I mean you're a good example of it - reducing them to statistical details and attaching probabilities to the chances they will cause Europe to collapse.

&gt; Guess what, if Turkey and Jordan fall, Greece and Spain will soon follow, the EU will follow, what happens after that is anyone's guess but there won't be anywhere for refugees to go if you let them all in arbitrarily with no vetting and no multilateral approach.

It was only after we became relatively prosperous that people began to indulge in alcohol and drugs. Unfortunately in places like the Philippines they have not yet grown and prospered and developed a stable infrastructure, and thus the issue of drug cartels (and some users) make the further development that much harder if not impossible. 

Duterte is fierce, and barbaric. But I think that's just an example of how absolutely awful the poverty and the drugs are there. 

Keep in mind he did not come out of nowhere. He was mayor of Davao for years. And it used to be one of the most crime-ridden cities in the Philippines, and he transformed it into one of the few cities where tourists feel safe to visit. The people of that city absolutely adore him because he made them more prosperous. 

He won the Presidency by an overwhelming majority. To be frank, if drug cartels and drug users weren't causing problems there, Duterte probably never would have formed the opinions he had. It's important to realize that drug addiction in a developing country is fundamentally different than in America or Europe, and thus a much greater danger for the society.

If you are not willing to live with the possibility of a nude or erotic or otherwise embarrassing video or picture getting leaked onto the Internet, then don't create the picture or video in the first place and especially don't share it with strangers.

Addressing your question, sure, you can make a legally enforceable contract with someone that includes a confidentiality clause.

The difficulty will come if the video somehow does make it onto the Internet, and you have to enforce the terms of the contract for the breach. Unless the other side admits ""aw shucks, we done messed up"" and agrees to pay you for your trouble, you will have to go to court and prove your contract was breached, and show your damages or losses, and win, and get a judgement against the defendant, and then enforce that judgement.

The next problem is the remedy of money. If your purchaser doesn't have income or assets, you can win a huge lawsuit against them, only to have them file for bankruptcy and your judgement is useless.

And the final problem is, once the video is leaked to the Internet and copies wind up on servers in Eastern Europe, or Brazil, or anywhere, it will live out there in the digital ether forever.

TL;DR - you can include a confidentiality clause in a contract and it could be legally enforceable, but you're going to have a long, rough road getting any money for your damages, and you will find it impossible to put the sex tape genie back in the thumb drive bottle once it's been turned loose on the world.",t3_55bla9,1478231974,1475306709,False,legaladvice,t3_55bla9,t5_2rawz,,4,0

&gt;He triggered article 50 and facilitated the negotiations to give the UK a better deal than they had under the EU?

His goal was to hold a referendum on EU membership in the hope that the majority would vote to leave. He achieved that goal, but has said that he would get back into politics and trigger article 50 himself if he had to.

&gt;Or did he campaign with a bunch of bullshit

If you're talking about the NHS thing, then I agree that the ad was misleading. I think the point they were trying to get across was that the money saved *could* go to the NHS, though the ad made it seem like it *would*. Having said that, it's highly unlikely that one ad on the side of a bus changed the outcome of the referendum by 0.05 points, let alone over 3.78 points. Claiming that the entire campaign was based on bullshit because of one dishonest move is just not reasonable.

I don't think it was ever his plan to stick around, especially since he was in no better position (as UKIP leader) to trigger article 50 or lead the negotiations than he is now.

&gt;Con man? You bet.

This is the part that makes absolutely no sense. He had a comfortable life in the private sector before he became a politician. What did he personally gain from spending twenty years working tirelessly towards one singular goal? He has spent his entire political career literally trying to make his position in the European Parliament redundant, so it can't have been for that.

Basically, American conservatives are so incredibly extreme, they've dragged the entire political spectrum to the right. Because of that, our only major liberal party can't - and won't - pursue decisive global warming counter measures; as moderate Americans are basically the equivalent of conservative Europeans, so putting extreme counter measures to global warming on the party platform would cost the Democrats 7/10 elections. 

I'm not saying American conservatives are evil. No, the Republican elected officials are the evil ones. Ever since the early 1960's and the beginning of the GOP's Southern Strategy, the Republican party has halted (or slowed to a crawl) all progress on fighting global warming, among many other issues. Because the GOP panders and bows to big businesses (like oil and gas companies), nothing that would have any sort of measurable impact on global warming can be passed as long as Republicans hold a majority in either House or have a Republican President. They've proudly campaigned on an anti-science, anti-reason, anti-logic platform, and they've won. 

But that's not to say Democrats are entirely free from guilt. Although the Democrats aren't the root cause of this issue, they show no backbone in the face of Republican stonewalling. Instead of pursuing extreme countermeasures to global warming in spite of the GOP, the Democrats have put global warming action on the backburner because they're more concerned with winning elections than doing something important.

When I refer to the GOP or the Democrats, I'm not referring to Republican or Democratic voters, nor am I referring to specific elected officials. I'm referring to the establishment for both parties. Of course anti-establishment candidates like Trump aren't any better. He's stated on live TV interviews an over Twitter that climate change is a Chinese hoax... No wonder Europe laughs at us.

,0,False,,d89e6kp,riverstyx80,"British economic policymakers confront big challenges. They have to manage departure from the EU with the minimum damage. They also need to make the UK economy far more dynamic. The latter cannot be achieved if they do not abandon the myth that Britain is already an economic success, albeit one choked by the dead hand of an over-regulated European economy.

Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform provides a far more realistic picture in his Brexit Britain. Measured at purchasing power parity, the rise in the UK’s gross domestic product per head between 2000 and 2015 was smaller than in Germany, Spain and France. Over this period, the UK outperformed only Italy, among the EU’s largest pre-2000 members. In 2015, the UK’s GDP per head was lower relative to the average of the 15 pre-2000 EU members than in 2000: its GDP per head was a mere ninth within this group.

The UK also has the highest income inequality among these countries. Furthermore, notes Mr Tilford, UK real wages fell by 10 per cent between 2008 and 2014, before a tiny uptick in 2015, while German and French real wages rose. In 2015, only London and the South-East had higher GDP per head than the average of the EU-15 countries. Other UK regions were at or below that average. In all, it is hardly surprising so many UK voters feel left behind, as shown in the EU referendum.

True, the increase in French real wages has coincided with high unemployment. But that is not true in Germany. UK workers also work longer hours than those in other EU-15 countries. This is presumably to make up for low real wages, themselves largely due to the UK’s poor productivity. According to the Conference Board’s invaluable “total economy database”, the only EU-15 countries to have lower output per hour than the UK are Greece, Italy and Portugal, while the UK’s productivity per hour has stagnated since 2007. Again, of the biggest five EU-15 members only Italy performed worse on this measure. The UK also now runs the largest current account deficit, relative to GDP, in the EU-15.

The UK, then, has low unemployment. But it also has high inequality, mediocre real incomes, at least by the standards of its European peers, and poor external competitiveness. Above all, recent productivity growth has been truly awful.

Moreover, such failings, relative to the UK’s EU-15 peers, cannot plausibly be due to the burden of regulation since, as the OECD rightly stated in its pre-referendum report on Brexit, “regulations are low relative to those in other EU member states”. If that made the difference, the UK would be more productive and dynamic than its peers, not less so. Given this, scrapping remaining regulations would not be transformative.

Some point to free-trading Hong Kong and Singapore as models for the UK, rather than to its European peers. But these two are, first, tiny and second, far from being multi-party democracies. Singapore’s government has had a powerful role in managing the overall development of the economy. Why, above all, should these places be more relevant models for the UK than Germany, the Netherlands or Sweden?

The implications of a realistic view of the UK economy is that, even without the looming shock of Brexit, the economy suffers from big weaknesses relative to the European economies that many Brexiters despise. Some argue that a real depreciation of sterling is mainly what is needed. If sustained, the post-referendum devaluation should indeed help, though it means a fall in real incomes and wealth. Yet devaluation alone will not cure UK weaknesses.

The UK has to rectify longstanding supply-side failings. The list includes: low investment, particularly in infrastructure; inadequate basic education of much of the population and the innumeracy of much of its elite; a grossly distorted housing market; over-centralisation of government; and a corporate sector whose leaders are motivated more by the share price than by the long-term health of the business. Not surprisingly, given all this, the UK economy is highly dependent on inward foreign direct investment, which Brexit would seem virtually certain to weaken.

If the UK is to thrive economically, it will not be enough for it to manage Brexit, hard though that will surely be. Its policymakers must also start from a realistic assessment of the UK’s mediocre performance. This is no world-beating economy. It is not even a Europe-beating economy, except on creating what are too often low-wage jobs. It will have to do far better if it is to deliver the higher living standards its people want in the tougher environment ahead.",t3_55cghu,1478232693,1475311894,False,ukpolitics,t3_55cghu,t5_2qhcv,,10,0

One of our guides is the daughter of a diplomat (who is now in Europe) so she speaks a number of European languages and she seems to know the world quite well.

season two fnatic struggle and there is surprisingly more praise for the russian overlords than shittalk. also it was more about shittalking teams like tsm not the region itself till worlds atleast but the hopes for na weren't high so like I said the trashtalk was not as prevalent

after spring season 3 allstars happened and na starts mocking europe again. c9 is praised as the best western team going into worlds

after season 3 worlds eu mocks na again 

battle of the atlantic happened and na calls it a win, eu calls it a win and both sides trashtalk each other. this is the first occurance of the ""eu always mocks na circlejerk and because of that na can always trashtalk them"" that I remember

season 4 worlds na trashtalks eu because of kabuum 

tsm wins IEM and na trashtalks eu more 

msi happened and eu talks trash back after the infamous ""eu will crash and burn"" 

season 5 week 1 na talks trash, eu talks we should root for the west (while there were also many na fans that said that because origen 3-0 and cloud 9 3-0)

season 5 week 2 eu trashtalks na

msi season 6 na trashtalks eu till now

,0,1475325046,,d89ehpm,Jerlenard,"&gt;How are they ""generally"" labour aristocrats?

Because they're *not* exploited, unlike what /u/Queermmunist is saying. Their objective material interests are bound up with imperialism. They not only know this, they will actively try to keep this relationship going.

&gt;Are we labour aristrocrats outside of Germany, or Denmark?

That is a debatable question. I would say countries like Spain, as a *whole*, are on the *margins* of the imperialist system. That is, more people in Spain benefit from imperialism than those who do not. In my opinion, traditional Marxist-Leninist tactics in the trade unions should still be somewhat viable in these countries, but that will never work in Germany, 'America,' France, Britain, etc.

&gt;Isn't labour aristocracy refering to sold-out labour leaders in Unions and socdem parties?

No. That would be the labor bureaucracy. The *social-base* of the labor bureaucracy is the labor aristocracy. The labor bureaucracy are the *institutions* that represent the labor aristocracy.

&gt;Are we in Spain (mostly whites) ""generally labour aristocrats""? 

Two things:

1. Not really helpful to think of Europeans in Spain or elsewhere as ""white"" people. The term should basically be restricted to English-speaking Europeans in North America, or just not used at all.

2. Yeah, probably. Spain is probably better off than Greece is, which is itself on the *margins* of imperialism parasitism.

&gt;In colonized Galicia, in occupied Basque Country?

Possibly, but the national question could play a decisive role in a revolutionary situation in those places. It's like asking whether the Québécois are exploited in North America; maybe not, but the national question could still be the decisive factor there.

&gt;Or is it that the true labour aristocrats are those leaders of the main Unions CCOO UGT who haven't called for a general strike since forever, despite having the worst working conditions in our history since Franco?

Well, they are definitely the labor bureaucracy, and should be opposed regardless of whether or not Spain is mostly labor aristocrats.

&gt;The ""labour aristocracy"" you all talk about is a bluff

It's actually the foundation of all Marxist-Leninist tactics in the trade unions.

&gt;because you don't even get to analyze the current conditions of countries that you consider ""white"" or ""first world"" 

Some people do indeed use First-World as a euphemism for ""white,"" which is a profound error, not only because it masks the exploiter nature of certain non ""white"" groups, but because it lumps certain European nations into the camp of the oppressor, when they are not part of it.

&gt;and the reconfiguration of global capitalism and the decay of the social-democratic myth of the end of class struggle in ""Europe"" and the de-facto division of industries and production in Europe to meet German consumption and France's production needs. 

I'm more convinced by the KKE's line on this question, which is skeptical of the idea Germany and France are exploiting most of the other European nations. I don't think it is true, but I am not hostile to the idea in principle. However, I'm not willing to say the junior partners of Western imperialism aren't also parasites just because they're not the top dogs in the imperialist scheme.",t1_d88can1,1478232849,1475313142,False,communism,t3_550v7r,t5_2qolz,,1,0

&gt;* Beijing officials see ethnic affairs work, such as improving Mandarin proficiency among minorities and in grade schools, as key to ensuring national cohesion and creating economic opportunity, but many Tibetans view these as barely masked cultural assimilation measures.

&gt;* The Reuters report also said the party official vowed to uproot what he called separatist and subversive activities of local monks.

&gt;* Wu, who was appointed party secretary in the Tibetan Autonomous Region in August, made news in 2013 by ordering Chinese troops to strike hard at massive protests in Dhathang Township, Driru County, where a government mandate requiring Tibetans to raise Chinese flags over their homes sparked several days of demonstrations.

&gt;* Two days after his call for a violent crackdown, an estimated 60 protesters were injured when Chinese troops opened fire on a crowd, according to Tibetan ex-patriots who maintain close links to the region, where news reports are frequently blocked by government censors.

&gt;* Earlier this month, China's Foreign Ministry threatened countermeasures against Dalai Lama supporters after the Tibetan spiritual leader spoke at the European Parliament in France.

When we generally envision Concentration Camps, we tend to think of camps like Dachau, Buchenwald and Auschwitz, i.e. camps run by the Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps (IKL) resp. the Economic and Administrative Main Office of the SS (WVHA), being huge structures with SS-guards, a camp Gestapo, a Kapo System, a net of sub-camps etc. And while this is the main definition for Concentration Camps (also, in distinction to death camps) for most people and most historians, the Nazis tended to use the term more liberally.

To use an example form my close area of expertise: In the Serbian town of Šabac, the Wehrmacht ran a camp intended to hold the entire male population of the surrounding area in order to subject them to questioning who was supporting the Partisans. 25.000 people were imprisoned in this camp between September and December 1941. Throughout all its correspondence, the Wehrmacht in Serbia refers to this camp as their concentration camp. However, while living conditions in this camp were appalling and executions frequent, there was no forced labor scheme, no SS-guards (the guards came from a Police Battalion), no Kapo system etc. Basically, it does not fit our popular perception of concentration camps despite the fact that the Wehrmacht is consequently calling it that.

Because the SS had been even before the war so successful in establishing concentration camps as a uniquely National Socialist institution in the minds of the historical actors, among the Nazis the moniker concentration camp can be seen – in the word of Nikolaus Wachsmann – a ""brand"". And not just for the Nazis, also for their prisoners and victims, the term concentration camp came to signify a unique form of Nazi imprisonment. According to the latest research, in between 1933 and 1945 and especially during the war, the Nazis ran 42.000 camps all over Europe. Most of them were not concentration camps in the narrow definition (run by the IKL or the WVHA, forced labor, Kapo Scheme). However, for their prisoners (and some Nazis as obvious from the Wehrmacht example above), that distinction mattered little since they could not ask a guard ""say, is this camp run by the WVHA?"" Thus in many reports as well as official conrrespondence by the Nazis, a lot of camps are called concentration camps that were not like what we have in our heads when we hear the term.

The same holds true for the camp in question here. The camp Gliks was in is the Forced Labor camp for Jews in [Baltoji Voke](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.0&amp;tab=3&amp;page_index=1#result_list), which according to the official registry of Nazi camps is also referred to as [Waka Biala or Belaja Vaka](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&amp;id=436) or Weiße Wache. While little more concrete information about the camp itself is available (all I was able to find is that this was essentially two camps, one for women, one for men and that the main forced labor scheme was to dig / cut peat and that it was dissolved in 1943), similar camps were quite common all over Eastern Europe. Run by local authorities, the Wehrmacht or the local Gestapo, the purpose of these camps was – obviously – to exploit Jewish labor before handing the people in question over to the machinery of annihilation. In Lithuania alone, over 25 such camps existed and the prisoners in these camps were by en large Jews who had somehow escaped the Einsatzgruppen shootings directly after the German invasion.

The extermination program of the Germans obviously involved a lot of logistics and its speed as well as other factors were often influenced by economic and other factors. In Lithuania after the Einsatzgruppen had carried out the initial wave of shootings in 1941 after the invasion, still Jews like Gliks, as well as German Jews deported to the Ghetto in Vilinius remained. After this initial wave of mass executions, the Einsatzgruppen moved on to the other Baltic republics, the Russian core territory and Belarus. At the same time, in early 1942 the Nazis' priority in terms of the so-called Final Solution were the Polish territories. The Aktion Reinhard Death Camps as well as the Chelmno Camp in the first months of their operation almost exclusively killed Jews from Poland not just because that was the biggest Jewish population in the Nazi occupied territories but also because the Nazis calculated that getting rid of this Jewish population had priority because it freed the most food stuff which then could be used for the German population. Thus in territories like Vilnius we have this gap in the killing where from the initial wave of Einsatzgruppen, it takes some time until the killing process picks up speed again. In the meantime, the Jews of these territories were put in camps like the above mentioned in forced labor schemes.

Only with the massive expansion in the gas chambers / crematoria in Auschwitz Birkenau in 1943 do the Nazis reach a new killing capacity and while in Vilinius in the meantime, there had been mass executions etc. it is only then that these Jews come into focus of the killing apparatus again. A similar example of such a scheme like that one in Baltoji Voke and elsewhere in Lithuania would be that of the Dienststelle Schmelt. Under the authority of the Sonderbeauftragte des Reichsführers SS für fremdvölkischen Arbeitseinsatz in Oberschlesien (Himmler's Special Envoy for Jewish Forced Labor in Upper-Silesia) Albrecht Schmelt. From 1940 Schmelt operated a huge number of camps in the Upper-Silesia area where Polish jews were used to built the autobahn between Krakow and Berlin. Schmelt employed thousands of Jews while close to them in Auschwitz hundreds of thousands were killed and while Schmelt regularly deported its Jews to Auschwitz to be killed, there were Jews who worked fro Schmelt until 1944 building the Autobahn. Now in 1944, most of the Schmelt Jews were also killed but the idea was similar: While they were available or while the killing capacities were at their limit, Jews could be used for forced labor.

So to sum up: Gliks was in camp that as a Nazi camp can be called a concentration camp but that does not exactly fit what we have in mind when we hear the term. These camps were created to exploit Jews for their labor force while the killing machinery focused on other geographical areas. In 1943 when killing capacities were expanded, these camps were dissolved and their inmates send to the Ghetto to await deportation to a death camp or being executed.

Except the tory party didn't stand soley on that issue, didn't actually command the majority of the public vote against all others just the largest vote share

&gt;It is not the governments job to inform the people, it is the job of the people to inform themselves about issues like this. Blaming either campaign for lies is stupid when you should look to the people who believed them.

If its not the governments job to inform the public (never actually said it was and I probably agree its not their job but it is in their interest) and the responsibility falls to the public themselves then you can safely assume that a proportion were uninformed due to constraints outside their control i.e. working all hours to keep their head above water, lack of access to unbiased materials, fear of expressing a viewpoint that would be seen as socially unacceptable in their surrounds. 

&gt;So in essence you want to deny both direct democracy and representative democracy. I guess what you really want is a oligarchy where only the intelligentsia and elite make decisions for us because we are all too stupid. In your opinion.

Didn't deny either, I just pointed to some of the flaws, if we opt for a direct democracy we may as well say whats the point in having elected representatives, if we keep to a representative democracy then parliament shouldn't pass the buck on a tough decision, parliament needs to remember its elected to represent our interests and our concerns not our views. We now in a situation parliament well more specifically the government is opting to ignore and failing to represent 48% of the electorate even if the entire electorate was accurately informed and it still went 52-48 then parliament still needs to represent the interests of all of us to not do so smacks of mp's with self interests at the priority, think about it there has been very few mp's that have spoken of the interests of the 48, the government is basically acquiescing to the brexiteers viewpoint of hard brexit. I wouldn't be surprised to which ever way this turns out the tory party is going to find itself kicked into the long grass for another decade or more or even possible have a split along the Eurosceptic lines, the irony been cameron gave the referendum to bring about an end to infighting over the EU issue in the party and in turn apart from not getting the result he wanted he may have sounded the death knell of the tory party as is.

Edit: Quickly jumping back to the issue of an informed electorate, it was shown in the media multiple times throughout the campaign people actually asking for more information more facts so people were actively trying to educate themselves on the issues but those responsible for publishing their plans, intentions how they would handle things (government/ both campaigns) but they didn't because they didn't really have any plans, so the electorate can't inform themselves if the information isn't available.",t1_d89f7vr,1478233490,1475318289,False,unitedkingdom,t3_55c35d,t5_2qhqb,,7,0

,0,False,,d89ftfa,Phineasfogg,"The insanity of Brexit is that none of the people who campaigned for it can say what it means or how it will be implemented. The pro-Brexit politicians fall largely into two camps; those who favour a soft Brexit in which the UK remains within the European Single Market, and leaves the political union, and those who want hard Brexit, where the UK leaves the Single Market as well.

Both of these are insane, for different reasons. If the UK stays in the Single Market, as the soft Brexiteers would like, almost everything they campaigned against will continue to exist (free movement of people, the majority of EU law overriding British law, a UK contribution to the EU budget) and worse still, Britain will likely end up paying more into the budget — although all these amounts were always trivial in the scheme of the UK's budget — and will have no influence whatsoever over the EU law it will still have to implement to remain within the single market. Their hope is that Britain will somehow get a sweetheart deal that lets them cherry-pick the stuff they like and jettison the stuff they don't, which is a fantasy, as the deal they strike has to be capable of surviving unilateral vetoes from 27 members and the European Parliament. I bet you couldn't get 28 people to agree on a free chocolate bar if you gave each of them a unilateral veto.

The hard Brexit crowd see a future in which Britain sets out on its own and strikes trade deals with whomever it wants on its own terms. The problem is that our largest trading partner is the EU and striking deals with other far-flung countries is not going to fill that hole. Moreover, Britain as a trading entity is a drop in the bucket with most of the trading partners with whom it would seek to do deals, which are likely to leave it far more exposed to the export interests from those countries than to produce some halcyon age for British exports. Not least because Britain doesn't have any trade negotiators or expertise in striking deals as that's all been dealt with by the EU for the past 43 years since Britain joined. If this were not insane enough, the reversion to WTO rules while Britain flails madly in the post-Single Market seas will make Britain a non-sensical location for multinational export-driven businesses, which will further depress manufacturing jobs in the country and destroy the financial services industry that is one of our largest service exports.

The insanity of Brexit is that soft Brexit is a shit sandwich that breaks all the promises of the campaign while hard Brexit is a form of economic harakiri. The only mercy in all this is that the politicians charged with delivering Brexit all campaigned for it, so if Britain pulls back from the brink, nobody should be able to say that it was because the deals were made half-heartedly.",t1_d89eam1,1478233522,1475318556,False,worldnews,t3_55bu2h,t5_2qh13,,8,0

Sure the UK wants out, but only 52-48. Also the polls shows they are not really favourable to a hard brexit. But those are polls, not votes.

There is no definitive proof that the EU would not give up on the Freedom of Movement. The real problem is that they refuse to negotiate before A50 and once the A50 is triggered, the UK is basically in position of de-facto hard brexit unless it manages to get something better. That's a super weak negotiating position.

The way out of this is to force the EU to negotiate before A50. To do that they would need to delay triggering A50 until enough EU countries are pissed off and reconsider the no negotiation rule.

Unfortunately, that would probably mean delaying for a few years, which the UK public would consider that the government is not doing their job in executing the Brexit.

The only option of the government would be a vote: ""If we can't get anything better, do you accept the economic consequences of a hard brexit."" If the answer is yes, then the government would be able to trigger A50.",t1_d89emqs,1478233847,1475321109,False,unitedkingdom,t3_55c35d,t5_2qhqb,,4,0

En gros, ce sont les premiers sites qui sont montrés sur les moteurs de recherche, et ils sont de la propagande pro-vie.

That's because the Holocaust didn't begin until the war had been going on for 2 years. The Anti-semitism of the Nazi's however was well known, the laws they were passing weren't secret.

&gt;Hitler got himself on the cover of Time at one point.There was a lot of positive regard for fascist regimes amongst elite opinion in Europe and the US in the 1930s.

Getting on the cover of Time doesn't mean you'r well liked, it means you've probably done something noteworthy. The Time ""Person of the Year"". Is *""for better or for worse...has done the most to influence the events of the year""*, many war leaders and dictators have been on it.

&gt;As the West, in general, won the war against the nazis but the west had committed similar atrocities,

Source please on the UK or US committing genocide.

&gt;But western regimes have enthusiastically supported regimes just as evil and murderous in the past 60 years which shows that the official line is untrue. 

Don't make the best the enemy of the good, just because some western regimes have support some bad regimes doesn't mean that all other regimes are equal. Take things individually. Expecting every western regime from 1945 to now never to even talk to a dictator seems asking too much.

&gt;Large scale modern wars come at such a cost to the citizenry that when the war is over, the citizens have the moral highground, one way to assuage them is to persuade them of how much better they are than the enemy and how it was immensely moral to vanquish the enemy, standard propaganda.

Which is no different that wars 2000 years ago, or 1000 years ago or 500 years ago. The winner always thinks they're right. However that doesn't mean they're always wrong either. 

Stopping Nazism was the most important thing to do between 1939 and 1945. Yes Stalin did bad things, yes the Allies did bad things, but that doesn't mean those things cancel each other out.

The Nazi's were perceived so badly, because they were so bad. That's not to say that other people never kill anyone, or that other people maybe haven't killed more. The detail is important, the regime showed the industrialisation of murder and torture. Stalin or Mao may have been happy to watch millions die to meet their ends. For nazism the end itself was the deaths, If they could ahve killed more they would have.

- Replace the Council with the national parliaments

SVAK,0,False,,d89ijdq,grumbal,"UK to lay claim to array of Brussels cellars, art and property as part of split

Britain is planning to claim a share of the EU’s 42,000-bottle cellar of wine, cognac and other spirits, its art collection and its €8.7bn property portfolio as the government gears up to haggle over Brexit with Brussels.

As in any divorce, untangling EU-UK financial affairs is expected to be one of the most difficult part of the negotiations. Any exit deal must settle complex liabilities including the UK share of guarantees on €60bn of Eurocrat pensions and almost €20bn of European Investment Bank loans.

As it seeks to minimise any financial hit, Britain is eyeing the other side of the EU’s balance sheet, which includes assets ranging from land and office space to dozens of space satellites, the European Parliament’s art collection, the wine and spirits stock — and Margaret Thatcher’s old Conservative party citadel in Westminster.

“Of course we will go for the assets,” said one British official involved in preparations.

The ratio for divvying up the value of assets with Britain is likely to be highly contentious. But on the basis that Britain makes around an eighth of net EU budget contributions, its claim would cover roughly 5,000 bottles of wine, 250 bottles of spirits, €2.25m worth of art from the European Parliament’s collection, and around €10m from the book value of the European Court of Justice building.

Much of the financial detail of the divorce deal will be handled by Michel Barnier, the former French foreign minister who officially takes up his post as the commission’s chief Brexit negotiator on Saturday, some 100 days after the EU referendum.

The EU’s consolidated accounts from 2015 show property and equipment of €8.7bn, valued at the price paid when the buildings were purchased, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. Britain would be expected to press for a survey to find the current market value on the assets. 

Among these assets are more than 1.6m square metres of office space in Brussels alone, covering the European Parliament’s main buildings, the new “Europa” summit building for European leaders, and some 60 Commission buildings. This includes the Berlaymont headquarters, which the commission leases but presents as an asset in accounts because it can exercise an option to buy the building from Belgium for €1 in 2031.

Most tantalising for Brexiters may be the potential to reclaim 32 Smith Square, the former home of Conservative Central Office and backdrop to three Thatcher election victories. Bought for £26m and renovated in 2010, the Westminster property was rebranded “Europe House” and serves as a base for the commission and European Parliament in Britain.

Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who as an MEP still has use of an office in the building, said Britain should take back the landmark. “I think they should make it a monument to Mrs Thatcher and to Brexit, Mr Farage said. “They should turn it into a museum.”

Along with extensive properties in Luxembourg and Strasbourg, the EU maintains a network of agencies, delegations and offices around Europe, with prized buildings such as its Paris representation on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

As the EU has expanded its presence around the world, it has built a network of more than 300 properties in 138 countries. A fifth are owned by the bloc, with EU properties as far afield as Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.",t1_d89hpo8,1478234868,1475327275,False,europe,t3_55cojn,t5_2qh4j,Slovenská Džamahírija,6,0

&gt; When an American home improvement TV show visits a remote Eastern European village, the young crew thinks the lack of mocha lattés and free wifi will be the worst of their problems. But after their filming interrupts the superstitious villagers' private religious ritual, the situation takes a turn for the homicidal... and when the blood starts flowing, that's when things get really weird. With THEY'RE WATCHING, noted graphic novelists and animators Micah Wright and Jay Lender turn a classic horror premise upside down to create a fresh, funny, eye-popping twist on the genre.

I hated them for it, it's one thing to go out begging if you are a fucked up junky or an alkie or runaway from the care system quite another to drag your kids into it.

There are still British people out there begging but the mix has changed over the last couple of decades.

&gt;It's rare that I actually see a bonafide homeless person

How can you tell without asking them? When I slept rough I never carried my bedding around with me. Yes you see some of the old jakies pushing carts but most I knew stashed their stuff during the daytime somewhere near their sleeping spot or with drop in centres rather than lugging it round all day. I looked homeless, I was manky I stunk my clothes were falling apart thats more to do with being seriously fucked up rather than being homeless but there were others who you would not think were rough sleepers by the look of them. 

People beg because it's easy money when you are unable to keep your shit together to be able to hold a job. There were people I knew through begging who were muggers, shoplifters, burglers, prostitutes, rip off merchants of every kind, luckily I never got into any of that shit. You have to be pretty low to go begging in the first place but the alternative income scources that a few will turn to are far more damaging to our society as a whole than having some scruffy git ask you for change on the way to and from work.

The country is definitely live-able but it's an environment one must adapt to if they are to successfully live there on a long term basis. 

Many Indians *never* plan on moving back once they've left. I knew a co-worker whose entire existence in the states consisted of literally nothing more than waking up, going to his job, and then going back to his little apartment which had little more than an Xbox and internet. He had no girlfriend, few friends, and despite living a year in the city, had ventured no where other than to his place of employment. And yet, he'd baffle me when he told me he was never going to move back to India, a past life he described as everything someone could really want out of life. I simply didn't understand what was so great about the US, or what was so bad about India.

On the other hand, many Indians I've known have been keen to return to the mother country as soon as they can, only remaining in western nations for the high paying jobs, the world renowned education, or the benefits of obtaining a European or American passport. The Indian way of life is the way they're used to, the way they have known, and the way they prefer, in relatively stark contrast to the western model. 

India is simply a ""corrupt"" nation. Corruption is ingrained into most walks of life. The police, the tax collectors, the business men, almost all walks of life are tainted to some degree with underhanded deals and payoffs. It's not even viewed as especially immoral by most. As far as business is concerned, it's just another operational cost, like so many taxes and fees enforced by the western legal systems. However, in India, the payoffs commonly reap tangible rewards. Often business owners see themselves paying much less in bribes to crooked tax collectors then they would paying the standard amount required by legislation.

While India comes in second place to China in terms of population (a nation that has more cigarette smokers than the USA has citizens) it does come in first when in comes to population *density*. While the nations of Europe struggle to keep their population growth levels at sustainable rates, India struggles to keep it's growth under control, the methods of which range wildly. The most recent involved multiple ""Sterilization Camps"" that resulted in the deaths of dozens of women due to unsanitary surgery procedures. The camps were quickly shut down. While India is one of the world's burgeoning superpowers, unfortunately, much of the country still remains in a 3rd world condition and with a population as staggering as India's, it can prove problematic. Only about half of Indian households have modern toilets and much of the population sees itself being left behind or simply dragged along as India's wealthy and elite attempt to bring the nation forward.

Overall, many visitors to India experience a 2nd string nation with clear starter potential. While the nation as a whole continues to power ahead, many pieces are left behind, struggling to keep up with industries that have made the old way of doing things superfluous.

Although the reasons to explore the grand nation of India are endless, visitors in certain regions should be prepared to experience certain obstacles in their travels such as massive overcrowding, extreme poverty, *horrid* sanitation standards, and corrupt law enforcement.",t3_553rkz,1478235429,1475329880,False,IWantOut,t3_553rkz,t5_2r5hw,,3,0

That you believe that only shows how harmful anti-EU propaganda is.

Seriously: Why do you believe that?

&gt;Some economies were absolutely incompatible with then Euro. Just look at Greece.

And what makes you believe that? 

Here is one of many relevant studies:   
http://anon-ftp.iza.org/dp8162.pdf

One relevant portion:   
&gt; Specifically, **per capita GDP or productivity levels significantly increase with EU membership in Denmark, Ireland, United Kingdom,
Portugal, Spain, Austria, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.**     
&gt;The effects are smaller but still positive, for Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    
&gt;Finally, and surprisingly, **the evidence supports the view that only one country (Greece) experienced
lower per capita GDP or productivity compared to its counterfactual after EU accession.**

Literally only ONE member state is worse off after joining the EU than it would be without the EU and that's Greece.
 
As for Greece: It ruined itself. Because it lied. It cheated its way into the EU. It cheated itself into the Euro. It desperately wanted to be part of the EU and get the Euro and faked its economic performance and was backed by shitty American rating institutions like Goldman Sachs vouching for them. It begged to be a part and got accepted... then it failed. It fucked up. It's really nobody else's fault. It's not the fault of the EU. It's not an argument against the EU. It's an argument against the Greek government.

None of the main parties are very successful and all sorts of people have excellent reasons to dislike them, but the electoral system is skewed in such a way as to reward minuscule differences in public opinion with landslide victories.

The system is structured in such a way that if you can appeal to swing voters on the fringes of your party, you're rewarded enormously. At the last election, the Tories managed to appeal to centrist voters on the relative left fringe of the party by being more economically credible than Labour was at the time: no global financial crises had happened on their watch and if you were middle class and 30-50 your income was stable. At the same time, they managed to appeal to voters on the right hand fringe by promising to be tougher on immigration, and promising the referendum: because if you're working class and 50+, then you've seen a lot of change over the last thirty years or so, consisting amongst other things of demographic changes from immigration and closer European integration, but you've also been completely fucked economically and socially, and these two obvious facts are easily connected in your head.

So basically, none of them are outright popular as such, but the Tories are currently somewhat better at appealing to swing voters who might otherwise have voted for the Liberals or UKIP than Labour are at appealing to would-be Liberal or Green (or any of dozens of minor left-wing parties) voters, or indeed people who don't vote.",t3_55cv2b,1478235734,1475331192,False,unitedkingdom,t3_55cv2b,t5_2qhqb,Scotland,2,0

No. Of course a small strata of colonized people *did* gain material benefit, the so called *petit bourgeois*: the clerks, administrators, mid-sized land holders, etc. These classes were able to take advantage of colonial rule and largely inherited the post-colonial states. 

In other cases, minorities that had no power or were actively oppressed by greater society were usually given power from (and made dependant on) colonial rule. The Tamils in Sri Lanka, and the Tutsi in Rwanda, serve as examples.

The bible is long boring and contradictory, mixed messages. Everyone knows the bible has gone through several human filters and can accept that some things might have got lost in translation/editing. Jesus is a pacificst hippie whose example doesn't lead you to slavery.

I think from the parts I read that the quran is easy, straightforward, more consistent, for-dummies. It is part of all muslim doctrine that it is exactly the word of god, no errors, eternal, it doesn't go out of fashin. Mohammed is Isis.

This differences are important. Christianity can be deformed more or less by what the new generation of people (and Popes) interpret of it. It is easier not to conflict with the doctrine. Islam, you can fool one generation. But, as long as you retain these doctrines, the next generation can just re-learn it, having no reason not to trust their own interpretation (the obvious one) of the books. Seems like a waste of time.

Interesting supporting fact I think I heard: new generations of highly educated European muslims, are statisticaly more ""radical"" than their parents.


So, in sum, at least from my view, it is hard to answer how a religion such as that one gets reformed. I don't know, but it is harder than Christianity. However, we have some advantages. A more economically productive successful non-muslim world that believes in human rights above religion (or we should), with awesome technology and higher standards of living, ""surrounding"" almost all muslim countries, giving them ""motivation"" to loosen up on the ""can't draw pictures"" and etc. More proof that every scientifically debunkable statement in Islam is crap. Way better communications to faster spread the word and ""dissolve stupidity"". Probably, the best way to go is to enhance these advantages to the maximum. For example, the non-radical-islamist world needs a way clearer priority: human rights &gt;= religion; religions are just a set of ideas that SHOULD be wildly rejected when they are harmful and abusive. Sam's brutal honesty on this are more important for non-muslims and barely-muslims than for the majority of the not-so-smart definately-muslims. We need to go in strong steps, from the less radicals to the most radicals. Furthermore, we need to make it necessary for muslims to step up and label themselves as ""western-compatible muslims that defend human rights and human law above their books"" or ""literal muslims that wants infidels dead or in shame"", or ""i will call myself a muslim but couldn't care less if anything makes sense, I just live"". The world would have little problem defending itself against, not opening its borders, etc, to some of those, without fear of offending/hurting/killing/__phobia'ing the rest.

&gt; Was the entire linguistics subfield of syntax revolutionized like 50 years ago...

This is *exactly* what happened, in fact.  To be more specific, the publication of Noam Chomsky's *Syntactic Structures* (and his related work with Zelig Harris, prior to that) was, to put it mildly, very significant for linguistics.  This goes beyond issues of ""generative grammar"" and processes of mind, which are still in contention today.  Early Chomskyan theory was less interested in these questions, and among other things, one of Chomsky's major early innovations was the development of phrase-structure maps, which were a (largely) new method of schematizing sentence and clause structures.  This innovation alone overturned much of the previous thinking about the ""complexity"" of sentences in different cultures or sociolects—often coded language for cultural or racial prejudice—and allowed language researchers to demonstrate the fundamental complexity of *all* human language (""complexity"" here meaning something akin to ""capacity for embedding and subordination"").  This innovation is allied to Chomsky's general claims about how language is generated, namely a distinction between ""competency"", which is innate and hard-coded, and ""performance"", which is determined by external physical and cultural factors.  The contrast is important, as it establishes language as a phenomenon separate from culture.  There is still debate about how much or even if this is true, but whatever the case, the ""Chomskyan revolution"" radically altered how linguists and ""grammarians"" think about language systems, and led to a major break with the descriptive practices that, as you point out, underlie traditional Latin grammars.

It's important to keep in mind too that the mid-century linguistics revolution wasn't the result of just a new approach to syntax. At nearly the same time there were major innovations in several other linguistic subfields, and the legacies of these have also substantially altered how we understand languages, including ancient languages.  The most important, in my mind—perhaps even more important than syntax—was the development of formal Sociolinguistics by Bill Labov.  Among many things, Labov's studies convincingly demonstrated that non-prestige dialects (i.e., the speech of minority groups, members of various economic underclasses, of the so-called ""uneducated"", etc.) were in fact *grammatical*, according to the standards of their speech-communities.  This overturns the idea that non-elite speech is a ""deviant"" or ""degenerate"" variation of ""proper"" language, and instead establishes it as a ""proper"" entity  in and of itself.  Moreover, Labov demonstrated that supposedly ""low class"" or ""vulgar"" (!!) features were not exclusive to the speech of ""the masses"" and all that, but in fact existed within a spectrum of usage, and were innate even to the speech of *educated societal elites*.  This is a big deal, especially for traditional Latin scholarship, which tended—or rather, tends—to schematize a bivalent situation: ""the educated"" used Ciceronian Latin, and everyone else (i.e., uneducated dummies) used ""Vulgar Latin"".  This schema is then used as a prop for ugly cultural prejudices, and to dismiss entire swaths of Latin textual evidence, while at the same time explaining away similar features in high-prestige texts are otherwise awkward or unsavory.  Thankfully, modern linguistics scholarship on Latin rejects the older schema, which has led to a recent and exciting flourishing of work on previously under-studied areas of Roman/Latin culture and society.  The older notion is still entrenched in Classics pedagogy, however, and is trotted out with disheartening frequency.  It's fairly common in this sub, in fact.

&gt; Do you need a linguistics background to make anything of it?

No, not as such.  To make an analogy: do you need an archaeological background to appreciate the reconstruction of the *Domus Aurea*? A background in Homeric philology and Indo-European to enjoy the *Odyssey*?  Having those may allow a richer understanding, and certainly allows one to engage in high-level scholarship, but it isn't necessary to appreciate and make us of the findings of scholars who have that training (assuming the findings are explained well).  

The problem is that, in my experience, so, so, so many Latin scholars devoutly believe that that they have a nuanced understanding of the language simply because they know the *grammatical* literature well.  This is akin to someone claiming that they know a lot about an area's geography because they have studied different maps of it.  The claim is...kind of true, but also deeply misleading.  Even worse (and to extend the metaphor), traditional Latin grammars are often bad maps—they may give accurate descriptions of specific locations, but their directions to and descriptions of those locations (i.e., their theoretical underpinnings) are badly distorted or patently false.  The value of  linguistics training is that it provides you with an understanding of how a language *works*—for example, access to the rationale of *why* a language subordinates something in a certain way, not just that it does.  This in turn allows one to see and understand the patterns that guide usage, which is hugely useful for literary and stylistic analysis.  It also allows scholars to develop less overtly biased understandings of cultural practice, which is no small thing, and something that Classics as a field has badly sinned against in the past.

&gt;  Does it heighten your appreciate of the language to have done some specific study of syntax?

This is somewhat addressed in my answer above, but to elaborate: really, any intro to ling class should be enough, at least to give a sense of where the differences lie.  Syntax as a subfield is *incredibly* fractious, with many competing theories.  But, any training in high-level structural analysis is enough to demonstrate the real existence of linguistic complexity in all language, and also to counteract the very atomistic view of traditional grammars.

Hope that helps—it ended up being longer than I'd anticipated.  Feel free to follow up, though!

Um, bullshit? Libertarianism means free movement of people and labor, it also means being able to wear whatever you want, which is opposed to the burka ban which Farage endorses.

Maybe it has something to do with the rising number of hate crimes since Brexit?

&gt; I'm not defending Hillary or shitty free trade deals, but the answer is free trade deals that have enforced worker and environmental protections. Trump isn't talking about any of that. He's talking about isolationism, and withdrawing from the global economy.

Right, and that would be better, actually, than the ""free trade deals"" that take jobs out of this country.

&gt; And this alone isn't enough if a reason for you?

Nope, Hillary's just as racist. ""Superpredators""? Letting her DNC staffers use the term ""taco bowl"" to refer to Latino voters? Insulting all Bernie supporters by calling them basement dwellers? Also, Hillary clearly supports Trump's racism, considering she's been at his events and all.

&gt; I'm not defending Obama. I'm saying that Trump had promised to deport 11 million people, tearing millions of families apart. On top of being a logistical and fiscal nightmare, it's very callous.

*****
&gt; Europeans have been boycotting British cars since the Brexit vote, according to the boss of the nation&amp;#039;s biggest auto firm, Jaguar Land Rover.

&gt; Speaking at the Paris Motor Show, Speth said JLR&amp;#039;s European sales team have reported customers turning their noses up at British cars after the vote to leave the EU. &amp;quot;They have the very first customers in their showrooms [who] clearly highlight that they don&amp;#039;t want to buy British products any more,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; He warned that the car industry would feel the pinch much more in the event of a hard Brexit that results in tariffs being slapped on to goods traded with the EU. He said carmakers would face a double whammy as import tariffs force up the cost of the parts they buy from Europeans and higher export tariffs make JLR vehicles less affordable for Europeans.

The UN has consistently proven that without the US it has exactly 0 power to keep the peace. The EU has never been able to secure Europe without the help of NATO. And the US is the only reason China's military hasn't been more aggressive than it is.

We've been trying to scale down our roll internationally in the hopes that *someone* would realize they should step up, and look what happened - no-one's volunteered and Russia has realized what's going on and has started to expand again, this time using subterfuge since Putin knows that with the current US climate of drawing down international involvement the last thing the US public will go for right now is Cold War style brinkmanship with Russia.

,0,1475338185,,d89o4kr,Balind,"You agreed to the contract by your guardians consenting to it. And probably their guardians, and so on.

The situation you described is not at all analogous.

Social contract is more along the lines of you inherited a house in a place with a strong homeowners association group. There are rules to follow, which you've consented to (or in this case your guardians did and you don't want to or can't see any possibility of getting out of them).

They can and will fine you if you don't follow the rules.

You can't just unilaterally take yourself out of the HOA because they suddenly don't suit you. You either have to sell your house and live somewhere else or sign some new contract with the HOA.

The former is always an open option. The latter is usually only possible with great wealth or power. In the analogy, you can pay the other homeowners to allow you to put up some eyesore - enough 0s on a check will convince them to do it.

In real life, this would be the equivalent to finding some land without sovereignty (or buying some land off a country that does), and hoisting your own flag. Can't afford that? It's unfeasible? You're damn straight it is. But those are the options available to you.

The rest of the world decided that was a bad idea, because the last time we tried a bunch of parcels of sovereign land (Middle Ages and Renaissance), it led to a ton of tiny little statelets fighting. You can still find a few tiny city states in some places in Europe though.

The problem was he apperantly was completely oblivious to what was going on in the world, because he went to Italy in 1938. He ended up getting drafted into the Italian military since he was born there. Unfortunately for him, he was completely unaware he didnt actually have to join the Italian military, as the US would have contested it had he tried to get into contact with an embassy or something.

Luckily for him, he was only assigned to patrol around Italy, and Italy surrendered/turned on Mussolini before the Allies advanced far enough to encounter my great uncle. It was all apperantly very awkward since my grandfather and the rest of his brothers had been part of the US military and fought in Europe.

&gt;Plague. Fleas are the vector for the plague (or black death), which infects man as well as rats and other rodents. There are three forms of plague that occur in humans: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. The bubonic type, in the form of the bacterium, Yersina pestis, is transmitted by fleas. The disease is passed as fleas regurgitate plague bacilli when biting, when flea feces are scratched into the skin, or when the host ingests an infected flea. The plague has killed millions of people in history, especially in the 14th and 17th centuries. In 14th century Europe, the great pandemic resulted in twenty-five million deaths. The plague is still a problem to society, with some 5,000 cases annually.

On 23rd of September, the parliament, controlled by nationalist conservative party ""Law and Justice"" rejected a bill, which was put forward by a ""Save the Women"" coalition and gathered 250 thousand signatures. It was supposed to liberalise abortion law and called for sexual education.

,0,1475342535,,d89qtpr,rforqs,"Actually with a bit more linguistics and some logic you can answer that.

English is a Germanic language and it also borrowed quite a lot from the French languages, Medieval Latin, Greek and the native Brythonic languages (those Celtic guys before the Anglo-Saxons). Some of these languages' descendants (French and German) now use a uvular fricative or other guttural-R. Others like Modern Latin and Greek, Welsh and Cornish, all have a coronal-R (alveolar flap or trill). All of these languages ultimately come from Proto-Indo-European which we think was likely an alveolar trill because so many of its descendants use that sound or an alveolar flap today.

So is it possible that English has always sounded this way and that it's just a rare language that always held on the an original postalveolar approximate? Yes, it's totally possible, but its a lot more likely that English got its approximate from the fronting of the Germanic and French uvular fricative.

You might ask why we don't look for primary sources of people describing ""proper language"" to common people or something like that. And it's true that there are sources that describe how the languages sounded at the time. But if you noticed how much clarification parent comment needed to make from OP's question before he actually started talking, you can see that, short of using modern phonological lingo, it's hard to tell what the author really meant by a ""hard R"" or ""soft R"", much less what they meant by ""Volvuntur lingua fortis et infirmus"".

That's one of the reasons why a lot of linguistics is so difficult to ELI5. Without a deeper understanding of the discipline, linguists literally don't know what you're talking about.

Tl;dr if you were really so interested in the answer you'd take the time to read the whole thing, come on. (I mean just look at how much time I'm wasting telling you to just read the whole original?)

,0,False,,d89rlx9,The_Old_Gentleman,"&gt;Regarding the first problem: while I'm sure a Corbyn/Sanders govt would face multifarious institutional barriers, I feel like they would be much better equipped to overcome these than SYRIZA. In particular, international financial institutions would have nothing like the coercive ability they had in the (admittedly very particular) circumstances of the Greek case. In addition, surely the idea of mass capital flight from the US in particular is somewhat far-fetched, given the enormous repurcussions a meltdown in the American economy would have for the global economy (and international capital) as a whole. Would international capital really be willing to, as it were, cut off its nose to spite its face just to prevent a resurgence in the US welfare state?

That is a good point - for one Corbyn and Sander certainly don't face the same hardships that SYRIZA did, though they also don't have plans quite as ambitious. North-American and the richer Western European countries also have enough essential human capital and infrastructure to prevent a mass capital flight like we usually see in reformist Third World countries (for the record, i am Latin American myself, so that colors my perspective). A North-American radical social-democrat would certainly not lead to a Venezuela-type situation (though it's worth remembering that Venezuela didn't suffer just from capital flight alone but also from the *enormous* incompetence and foolish policies of the PSUV as well, but that's another matter).

But notice how Corbyn and Sanders have already suffered massive bureaucratic opposition from *their own* parties alone, and that's before even getting into a position in government and facing the official opposition parties and the rest of the State bureaucracy. Would they fare any better as heads of Government if they even managed to get to that point? And while mass capital flight in a First World country is certainly an unrealistic prospect, it is not too far-fetched to believe that more US capital would flee a higher Federal minimum wage or a corporate tax hike and lead to worsening conditions for workers [Which is not to say that minimum wage increases of corporate tax increases are policies doomed to fail or that shouldn't be supported - they should be supported and can succeed, but they can only really succeed when backed by *international* working class activity and organization].

&gt;Regarding the second problem: sure, Sanders didn't invent mass discontent with capitalism, but I think it's unlikely that if not for Sanders more of this apathy would have been channelled into greater radicalism. Instead I think we'd just be seeing even more people entirely disinterested in any sort of political idea, be that anarchism, ""democratic socialism"" or whatever. In addition, Trump/populist nationalism would perhaps be having even greater success in appealling to those disgruntled with the status quo had an alternative from the left not been compellingly articulated by Sanders. [...] Finally, speaking from my own experience in the UK, witnessing the staggering hostility towards Corbyn from pretty much every institutional aspect of what one could term the British establishment has very much been a radicialising experience. 

Your point is correct and more nuanced than mine, and comes from a personal experience i certainly can't quite engage with - my own personal experience is different, i have seen formerly radical social-democrats ascend to the top *and then* fail miserably, and am seeing my country's Left fail to get over that and create a new alternative; but that says nothing about the State of the Left in the US or Britain does it?

I think that while anarchists in their capacity as anarchists shouldn't publicly campaign for politicians, join political parties or divert resources to their support, an anarchist should definitely engage with the elections and our position on reformists like Corbyn and Sanders should be to *neither* cheer-lead for them nor villify them. That a politician like Sanders will appears and try to channel Leftish discontent with capitalism is certainly inevitable - it happens at every economic and political crisis, and will keep happening, it's too good of an opportunity to pass up - and while what ultimately happened with the Sanderista movement is that it died down and co-opted certain forces this period is also a great opportunity for agitation and education.

What we should do instead is engage Sanders voters and point out all the massive institutional obstacles in Sander's path or how Sander's policies may not obtain their intended result - and point out what *can* obtain that result instead. We should engage with Sanders voters to spread an awareness of how capitalism is necessarily exploitative, how the State has been and will continue to be massively slow to find and implement solutions to massive long-term problems, how a different and better world could look like, and how *direct action* - forming autonomous unions and striking, forming your own mutual-aid societies, occupying and transforming spaces - is a course of action that can get results now and empower those who practice it instead of delegating power and agency to a bureaucracy that has vested interests of it's own. Give out copies of [To Change Everything](http://www.crimethinc.com/tce/) and [Abolish Restaurants!](http://www.prole.info/ar.html) at Sanders rallies, [protest](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/trump-protests-free-speech-gop/) and hence disrupt the racist platforming in Trump rallies and show the bigots that they are *not* the ""silent majority"" they think they are, giving *direct physical aid* to immigrant and other marginalized communities, creating links between anarchist circles and Black Lives Matter protesters and the Prison strike and other such social movements, etc.

,0,False,,d89rwbg,SteampunkWolf,"&gt;The book comes from a good place, and much of the first half is trying to explain why Eurasia was able to domesticate so many crops and animals whereas the Americas and Africa were not.

The first problem here is, that whole ""Eurasia had better crops thing""? It's bollocks. I'm going to point to [the review by J. M. Blaut](http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/Blaut/diamond.htm) again. Simply put, in the book Diamond dismisses  root crops like yams and taro and tropical grains like maize as less nutritious than Eurasian grains like wheat and barley. The problem is, as Blaut points out, they aren't, they're just as good, Diamond's claim is based on discredited research. Blaut also adresses the North-South and East-West axis part of Diamond's theory which you mentioned in the Civ episode and how it makes little sense considering how and where crops are actually grown.

As for the racism - do you know the old Simpson's quip ""Not racist, but #1 with racists""? *GGS* is very popular with racists and not-quite-racists and this quote from Kathleen Lowrey of *Savage Minds* expresses why pretty well:  
""This is a punchline about race and history that many white people want desperately to hear. Those dying black kids at the end of the special -- we know, because We Are Not Racist, that they don’t deserve what they are getting. They are not inferior. In fact, there but for the grace of god…. And it poisonously whispers: mope about colonialism, slavery, capitalism, racism, and predatory neo-imperialism all you want, but these were/are nobody’s fault. This is a wicked cop-out. Worse still, it is a profound insult to all non-Western cultures/societies. It basically says they’re sorta pathetic, but that bless their hearts, they couldn’t/can’t help it. Such an assertion tramples upon all that anthropology holds dear, and is a sham sort of anti-racism.""

Maybe I am doing Jared Diamond a disservice, maybe he himself isn't racist and Eurocentric and tried to write a book to disprove those very concepts. The problem is, he failed. He wrote a book that to racists reads ""Europeans are the greatest and this is why"" and since they don't really care about the why part anyway it just says ""Europeans are the greatest"". Again - this may not have been his intent, but it's one of the results, and anthropologists and historians have been criticising the book as having done a major disservice to the field.

Ultimately, whether or not *GGS* is purposefully or accidentally or even not at all racist and/or Eurocentric doesn't even matter. The really most important thing I want to highlight is that modern historians and anthropologists are very critical if not outright hostile towards *Guns, Germs and Steel*. There is merit in looking at environmental factors and seeing how they impacted history, but *GGS* is highly reductionist and makes big and bold claims based on very little concrete evidence.",t1_d89pnt5,1478239639,1475343786,False,Yogscast,t3_55df39,t5_2sg86,,38,0

We are currently in an interglacial period of the Pliocene-Quaternary ice age.  When this ice age ends temperatures will return to ~12-15° warmer than they are  now.  This will be marked by the total loss of the polar ice caps and the ice sheets that now still cover Greenland and northern Europe.

Trelleborg in Denmark and Birka in Sweden are viking age settlements that have been excavated and turned into museums with reconstructed viking buildings. Scandinavian vikings founded several cities on the British Isles, among them Dublin and York. Both of those cities have viking museums. Before the vikings came to the British Isles, neither the Irish or the Scandinavians had a tradition of permanent urban settlements. 

In Norway there's a large reconstructed longhouse at the Lofotr museum, and the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo contains very impressive artifacts, showing the quality of viking woodcrafting and shipbuilding. The museum also contains the oldest example of the log cabin construction style in Norway: a small burial chamber that was placed inside the Gokstad ship to house the body of a viking nobleman.

In addition there have been excavations of viking settlements in Iceland, Greenland and Canada. 

Longhouse building tradition in Scandinavia goes back to the Neolithic epoch. But this architecture disappeared near the end of the viking age. In Norway and Sweden, where wood is plentiful, it was almost entirely replaced by log cabin style buildings. Farms and urban settlements consisted of several smaller buildings instead of a few longhouses. With the introduction of Christianity, stone architecture in the form of churches and monasteries was introduced to Scandinavia. But this also happened just after the Viking period.

In continental Europe wood was more scarce, so compared to Scandinavia they used more clay, straw and stone as building materials, even before the middle ages. Instead the log cabin style was probably imported from Russia. There was a lot of trade, and other cultural exchange between the Kievan Rus and the Vikings.",t3_55bzs4,1478242690,1475345628,False,history,t3_55bzs4,t5_2qh53,,1,0

I'd suggest you look to the west coast, Glasgow will have vacancies in pretty much every field so whatever you do, there are likely jobs...and housing is definitely a lot more affordable here on the west coast than anywhere in England, certainly southern England....

For instance, I'm in the process of buying a house, and I've been looking for a 2 bedroom house.
I've seen a number of them - I'm looking at one right now on a website; it's a 2-bedroom semi-detached house. It's in a small village within easy commuting distance of Glasgow. It's admittedly ex-council but home-report suggests it's in good condition. Needs a new kitchen/bathroom etc. but that's normal. Price? Offers around £60,000.

I pulled up rightmove and looked for similar properties in or around the town I grew up in, in east anglia.
Ex-council or the like, easy commuter distance of Cambridge. Good(ish) area, trying to do a good comparison for you.
There's a few to choose from, so lets go with the cheapest. Similar property, ex-council (tho looks to be a little newer), needs a new kitchen/bathroom etc. Price? £170,000.
So roughly 3 times as much. And actually the area isn't quite as nice...

Rental is even worse.

Move to Scotland. Plan now. You've got 2-3 years at my guess to re-locate before it will get a little more complex.

Or stay in a country that will be going through *significant* political &amp; economic upheaval fairly soon, where austerity is an ideological not financial agenda, where immigrants are being openly derided in the streets and face attacks etc., a country which fairly soon I suspect will find itself isolated and alone on the edge of Europe, with serious funding shortfalls for its public services both as a result of a skill shortage and the idealogical drive of the Tories to privatise all services where possible, and defund any they cant...

Beat the rush. Plan and move soon.
I suspect post-Brexit once we're heading straight for independence, there will be a sizeable shift of financial institutions to Dublin &amp; Edinburgh...with Edinburgh being the main beneficiary given our land-border, the ease of commuting for companies that want a toe in the rUK and the EU, the already established sector here...

&gt;I'm explaining that if you don't like the system that you can leave, therefore the system is voluntary. I then went on to say that whatever coercion DOES exist (for instance, the difficulty and cost of moving to a different country) can be attributed to your parents, not the system itself.

Seriously? Attributed to my parents? This isn't even an argument. Maybe you have rich parents, but I'm a member of the proletariat class.

If I could leave, I guess I'd go to a country that'd get ""liberated"" by a capitalist country and die.

Also finances are by far not the largest hurdle of moving. It's all political...

If you're not talking about physically leaving (forming a communist commity within the current capitalist system), I've replied to another user about exactly that in this thread.

Large segments of the population in America were ambivalent or even pro German. Walt Disney, Charles Lindbergh, Henry Ford, etc were all pro German. 

This was during a time of Jewish subversion of the banking, entertainment,  newspapers, and academia in America.  Some people didn't like it, some did, and some didn't notice. 

Even the great General Patton, who had seen up close and personal everything in the European theatre, had come to the conclusion that we were on the wrong side or ""slaughtered the wrong pig"". 

Long story short if the Germans had won WWII would be seen as reconquista 2.0. A few eggs broken to make some omelettes. We would look back on it as the time Europe banded together to exterminate Bolshevism, usury, Jewish media domination, and other threats to its continued existence.

,0,False,,d89uuw4,FranthonyAF,"It has been 374 years since Karl II of Lichtenstein first came into possession of the silver sphere .  At roughly the same size as a cannonball but seemingly weightless and covered in seemingly thousands of engravings carved into its shining surface, it was to become a prized yet secretive treasure of the Liechtenstein Royal Family that had been recovered in 1642 from one of the sacked castles during the Thirty Years War.  At the time there had been orders given to the military commanders of the Catholic League which stated that if any such object were to be found it must be returned to the Emperor Ferdinand III upon pain of death.  With knowledge of these orders, Karl II knew that whatever it truly was must carry great value and could be sold to a different nobleman or monarch for a great price.  
Upon further inspection of the sphere however, Karl noticed that some of the engravings appeared to be Egyptian hieroglyphs, others Ancient Greek, and many in Latin.  Having been schooled in Latin, Karl examined the engravings and found them to be the names of Roman Emperors dating back to Augustus.  Following the Roman names were many other rulers and Popes of Europe including Charlemagne, Edward III, Alexander VI, and Emperor Charles V.  The most recent name that he discovered was that of Christian IV of Denmark.  
Karl came to the conclusion that whoever possessed the object at the time must deem it necessary to carve their name into it.  Being a main of faith and defender of Catholicism, Karl couldn't let a Protestant have the last name on the sphere, so he took it upon himself to engrave his own name in Latin ""Karl Princeps â Liechtenstein"" onto the sphere.  
Almost immediately upon the completion of the last letter, the sphere began to levitate and a voice began to speak to Karl in his native German saying ""Congratulations Noble Prince on being deemed worthy enough by your predecessor to posses the Sphere of Leadership. We had lost communication with your world for some time now, but we are glad to hear from you once more.  Your predecessor no doubt explained your duties but I shall review them now. By the Laws of the Galactic alliance, you are now the Voice of your planet and Leader of all of its people as have been the possessors of each Sphere on every world for millions of years.  It shall be your duty to decide on your successor when the time comes, and to monitor the citizens of your world and decide upon when they are ready to be exposed to new technologies which we will then make readily available to you.  Many of your predecessors have decided to keep your world relatively primitive, but again that is the prerogative of the Voice and Leader. We hope to hear from you often, and will notify all other members of the Alliance.""
Karl, shocked yet excited saw this as the moment of his family's ascendancy.  He decided that he would one day grant this sphere to his son and keep it a family secret.
So it went that the House of Liechtenstein, while never holding much territorial power, became de facto rulers of planet Earth and shaped the course of human history from 1642 onwards.

Things aren't so different between the two as to be polar opposites. That being said, I've got a couple pieces of advice, and a couple questions for you to ask yourself:

- Do you want to be a doctor, and if so, is it so important to you as to deal with this for the next however many years til you graduate? You can make a decent living if you're willing to do a physical job, and since you're in medical school you've obviously finished an undergrad. If being a doctor is what your family wants and not what you want, do something else. I was a vendor my first few years of college. I was only part time, but the full time guys were making $40,000 a year starting out, which was enough to be middle class when you're by yourself where I'm from. Either find something with your undergrad or look for a career you might enjoy. The police, firemen, and EMTs are always hiring. 

- Don't focus on the why. Focus on the is. You are gay. You are not a Muslim anymore. Don't worry about why you're this way, just worry about how to move forward. Handle the things you have control over and try not to worry so much over the things you don't.

- Distance yourself from your family. Prepare yourself for what's inevitable. You can't pick your family. I understand you love your's. I love mine. I was lucky enough to be tolerated by mine, if not accepted. Maybe your mother's attitude would change slightly if she knew, but don't hold out for that hope cause it only makes things harder. Focus on you, make some friends, make your new family. 

- Life can be shit. You play the hand you're dealt. At the same time, you've gotta have the lows to appreciate the highs. [Bob Ross helps me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJfjmxOR2I) Without dark and light, happiness and sadness, you have nothing. 

- Appreciate the little things, because they get you through. The big things are often little things in disguise.

32: CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in masturbatory pleasure and sexual enjoyment after circumcision, indicating that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men, possibly because of complications of the surgery and a loss of nerve endings.

33: CONCLUSIONS: The glans of the circumcised penis is less sensitive to fine touch than the glans of the uncircumcised penis. The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis.

&gt; U.S. Maple was an American avant-garde rock band. The group was formed in 1995 at Chicago's Northern Illinois University by former members of Snailboy aka. Shorty and the Mercury Players. The band consists of Al Johnson (lead singer), Mark Shippy (guitarist), Pat Samson (drummer), and Todd Rittmann (guitarist) — who banded together with the intent of becoming the deconstructionists of rock and roll.

&gt; The members from each band met at the corner of Grand and Western Avenues, and as the band would reveal later on their website, began discussing how the group could erase rock and roll from their collective minds. The assembled group set out to devise a working method for reorganizing Rock and Roll, keeping only what they felt were its most important core elements. Recognizing they were kindred spirits, the group decided then and there to join together in an attempt to realize some of their musical ambitions.

&gt; U.S. Maple inherited vocalist Al Johnson and guitarist Mark Shippy from Snailboy/Shorty, while drummer Pat Samson and second guitarist Todd Rittman were transplants from the Mercury Players. The band's first recording came in the form of a two song 7"" single produced by Doug Easley and recorded in September 1995 at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee (during these sessions a cover version of AC/DC's ""Sin City"" was also recorded, and eventually released on Skin Graft's ""Sides 1-4"" 7"" compilation). U.S. Maple's first single featured the songs “Stuck” and ""When a Man says Ow!” The independent label Skin Graft Records took an interest in the band and signed them to the label, releasing the ""Stuck"" single in the fall of 1995.

&gt; The band recorded their first full-length album, Long Hair in Three Stages, late in 1995 at Illinois' Solid Sound Studios located in Hoffman Estates. The album was produced by indie music producer and former Sonic Youth guitarist Jim O'Rourke, and was fueled with jarring guitar noodling, vocal wheezes and howls, and spastic drumming — all staples of the band's elastic song structures. Skin Graft released the album in October 1995 in both vinyl and CD formats; the vinyl pressings included a bonus track and hand-made sheet metal jackets manufactured by the bandmembers themselves. The band then embarked on a six-week, twelve country, European tour in support of their first album. While in England, the band recorded a Peel session for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show.

&gt; When the band returned home from their European tour they recorded a second single featuring a cover of the 1961 Dion &amp; The Belmonts hit ""The Wanderer,"" as well as an original composition, ""Whoa Complains."" In 1997 the band returned to Solid Sound Studios to record their second album, again with producer Jim O'Rourke. This session produced the album Sang Phat Editor, which was released by Skin Graft Records in June 1997.

&gt; In the fall of 1998 U.S. Maple left Skin Graft, signing to Drag City the following year, due in part to the influence of Drag City labelmate Jim O'Rourke, but also due to an agreement by the label to support the band during their busy tour schedule. 1999 saw the band returning to the studio to record the followup to their Skin Graft work. Their third album, Talker, a darker, sparser record than their previous albums, was recorded at B.C. Studio in Brooklyn, New York. The album was recorded by Michael Gira, former lead singer of post-industrial rock band Swans, with Martin Bisi engineering.

&gt; In 2000, U.S. Maple earned a mention in the song ""Goodbye Forever"" by another Chicago-based band, the Alkaline Trio. The song appears on the Alkaline Trio's self-titled album, and includes the line ""Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple? / Somehow the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel.""

&gt; In 2001 the band released their fourth album, Acre Thrills. The album was recorded in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, at Pachyderm Studio, and mixed a week later in Richmond, Virginia, at Sound of Music. In the summer of 2001, after the recording of Acre Thrills, drummer Pat Samson left the band, and was replaced by Adam Vida. With Vida, the band released their fifth and so far last studio album, 2003's Purple On Time., which saw a departure from the confrontational, fervent, and violent aspects of previous releases. Purple on Time. contained more conventional song structures, including verses, more straightforward instrumentation, and singing (instead of animalistic moaning and crooning). Read more on Last.fm.

Because in my opinion, Turkey should be more of a melting pot the then the U.S. is, and in fact, it was one at some point in time.

The U.S. also preaches that its national identity isn't based on ethnicity, when in fact, obsession with color and shape (of their faces, etc) are front and center, if not overtly then implied, of everything in the U.S.

Europeans are because there really has never been a European Empire, well, besides the Romans. But in the past 1000 years Europe has just been one hot bed of Nation versus Nation, Religion versus Religion, and shifting borders, alternating alliances, etc.

So I can see how they may be obsessed with people's ""colors and shapes"".

Helen Goodman:  Is there not a risk that a speedy withdrawal could mean that we have no legal cover whatsoever, for example on agriculture.  It is the most obvious example, but there are other examples too.  Could you just say something about that and how one might handle that issue?

Professor Dougan: EU legislation applies in the UK without any form of domestic transposition, either by Act of Parliament or by statutory instrument.  If we leave without having made a conscious political choice that that legislation needs to be replaced—whether it is replaced in the sense of pure replication or whether it is replaced in the sense of a new statutory regime that differs from the current norms—the danger is that will simply disappear from our legal system upon the point of withdrawal.  We will be left with legal vacuums where suddenly we do not have any regulation of important parts of the economy and society. 

This does not just apply to agriculture.  It applies to important parts of environmental policy and consumer rights.  It applies to quite significant parts of financial services regulation.  All across the legal system there are pockets of our law—EU regulations in particular—that will need to be put on to a firm statutory instrument basis.  If we do not do that, they will disappear.  To be frank, it will wreak havoc with the authority of public bodies to take legally binding decisions and with the legal relations of individuals and businesses.  It is a job that really needs to be done.

Q85            Helen Goodman: Are you suggesting that, in parallel with the withdrawal process and negotiation—we will come on to when Article 50 is triggered in a moment—we need to be introducing primary domestic legislation on all these big four areas that you have mentioned?

**Professor Dougan: I would go further.  I am suggesting something quite a lot more thorough than that.  Also, in fields where there is statutory implementation of EU law and statutory instruments transposing EU law into UK law, we will need to double check all of it.  Much of that legislation will simply make cross‑references to EU legislation or it might confer decision-making powers upon EU bodies or agencies.**

**It might well be that the legal basis of some of these statutory instruments is not entirely secure.  It is not just about the areas of UK law that derive directly from the EU through directly effective EU regulations; the whole legal system needs to be checked to make sure that we do not inadvertently wreak chaos upon the authority of our public bodies and the security of individual relationships.**

&gt; The possibility that ayahuasca and other psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin [mushrooms could help in the treatment of mental illnesses](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lsd-paradoxical-effects_us_56c1f74de4b0c3c55051f453) has helped revive a new wave of research into the drugs, which were rendered illegal in the 1970s. But how these drugs affect the brain remains unclear. The [handful](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/how-hallucinogenic-mushro_n_6075486.html) of [studies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/how-hallucinogenic-mushro_n_6075486.html) that have started to look into this question suggest they work by altering the patterns of communication among several brain networks, thus opening new ways of thinking and perception. 
&gt; 
&gt; Kuypers, who has studied both the negative effects and potential medical uses of the drug MDMA, was approached by Jordi Riba, a researcher at Sant Pau hospital in Barcelona and a longtime researcher of ayahuasca. Riba was interested in a creativity test that Kuypers and her colleagues had previously set up and wanted to have ayahuasca users take a stab at it.
&gt; 
&gt; The team visited two spiritual ayahuasca-using groups and invited members to enter the study. Twenty-six healthy people participated in the study. They were experienced in taking the brew; many of them had taken it dozens of times. Their interest in psychoactive drugs, they told researchers, stemmed from a desire for personal experimentation and enhancing introspection, self-knowledge and personal growth.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the tests used in the study was the “picture concept test,” which has been traditionally used as part of intelligence tests in children. In its simplest form, the test involves four pictures in two rows, and the test taker has to find an association between one of the pictures in each row. The number of pictures can go up to 16, divided in four rows, making the test more sophisticated.
&gt; 
&gt; [Here’s an example of what a simple form of the picture-concept test might look like](http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/57ec0ac91b00003007ef2ed6.jpeg)
&gt; 
&gt; The participants took the test once before and once during the ayahuasca trip (interestingly, the people reported liking the test, saying the colorful images spurred their imagination).
&gt; 
&gt; When on ayahuasca, they actually became worse at pointing out the correct solutions, suggesting their convergent thinking was impaired. But instead, they offered many alternative and original solutions, finding associations that weren’t readily visible, pointing to a more divergent way of thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, the correct answer above would be to pick the sun and the moon — both belong to the category of celestial objects. But you could also pick the mushroom and unicorn, arguing that being on shrooms could make you see unicorns. There are many such out-of-the-box reasonings possible, and you can imagine how things can escalate quickly once the number of pictures goes from four to 16.  
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not clear whether the alternative solutions that people came up with were always actually good ideas — we still don’t know if taking ayahuasca can give you the idea for your next book or startup. But it was the flexible way of thinking and tackling a problem that was the most interesting and potentially useful, Kuypers said.
&gt; 
&gt; How long this spike in divergent thinking and creativity lasts is another question, Kuypers said. Future studies should test people a day later or so to examine the long-term effects, she said.
&gt; 
&gt; “It would interesting to see if they were still different in divergent and convergent thinking after their trip,” Kuypers said. “It would be useful to see the long-term effects of the drink, especially if you want to use it in psychotherapy.”",t3_55ex56,1478287764,1475352702,False,IndianEnts,t3_55ex56,t5_2syn4,,2,0

&gt; BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators plan to order Alphabet&amp;#039;s Google to stop paying financial incentives to smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search exclusively on their devices and warned the company of a large fine, an EU document showed.

&gt; The EU competition enforcer in its charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said it planned to tell the U.S. technology giant to halt payments or discounts to mobile phone manufacturers in return for pre-installing Google&amp;#039;s Play Store with Google Search.

&gt; The regulators also want to prevent Google from forcing smartphone makers to pre-install its proprietary apps if this restricts their ability to use competing operating systems based on Android.

You're not anti-democratic?  Then how do explain you in another thread saying things like this about Hong Kong and China?

&gt;They are young, delusional kids who were brainwashed by pro-democratic propaganda. They spend a few years abroad in the west, see that the west is further developed and conclude that being part of China must clearly suck! They look at Hong Kong's downturn and look at what happened and conclude it must all be China's fault.

Alright, it's just democratic propaganda that makes them not particularly like the Chinese government?  A government that jails journalists and political activists that are inconvenient for them?  I guess that's just pro-democratic propaganda to you.

It's also pretty cute that you say they don't do those sorts of things.

Do you think that if Shaquille O'Neal was born in this era (between 17-30) and playing League, he'd have the potential to reach what he did in Bball in league of legends? What if Einstein invested his life playing soccer instead? This is just a couple examples. Everyone has talent in a certain area, you put Faker in to play American football vs tyler1, and where's it going to get him? lol Koreans are smarter not only because of the education that they receive which is constantly pushing them but also the work ethic. This is not a 1-day thing but has been going on for a long time! Not to mention, they are more talented when it comes to details, calculations, minuscule things. Ofc, you have your own views, these are just mine and I feel like I made enough valid points to atleast cater to these views if not convince you or anyone else.

You're right, that's why I said that they need to probably increase the rewards and make LoL more attractive to play/invest in, popularize it. The 1 mil. championship reward hadn't been increased until people noticed and pointed it out after Monte said something. And they've been earning 100's of milliions, doing a billion or more transactions. While they did encourage e-sports to an extent, eventually greed kicked in. Look at the difference between a million world championship reward and making 7-800 mil or more for revenue.

I completely agree with you, but even if they have the talent, they might not have the drive. Piglet talking about how he had to leave and drop for a challenger team to play because his teammates disappointed him. And he said that he'd continue to play with those guys if they made it past to the LCS, unfortunately they did not. Lack of talent there even if they put in the effort.

I like talking to you and I think that your points are very valid. However, let's agree to disagree on the talent bit. I still feel that the KR players are just more talented when it comes to strategy and intellectual capacity. Game mechanics and reactions. It doesn't mean that we don't have amazing talent in NA but they are very few and probably not the ones into League. (Comes back to the whole, League needs to be vitalized in NA and EU, better perks for talented players maybe; needs someone maybe commissioned to find talent and recruit them for the e-sports scene. Thinking about it, 1 mil. might not be a lot for the NA players but it is a lot for KR's, maybe an incentive of earning more would help a lot? They should add more teams for the next worlds if possible, spread League to the middle-east too! o7)",t1_d89v2ke,1478288335,1475354472,False,leagueoflegends,t3_55e8sp,t5_2rfxx,I'll grape you bitch.,-3,0

technology,0,1475366686,,d89z3gv,MrDowntown,"Telephony was initially a local technology, as the early battery-powered instruments could only communicate a few miles.  So unlike the telegraph, telephones were initially used only for communication between people in the same city.  Small telephone networks began to be established in business centers, serving communication between businesses, but wealthy businessmen and doctors soon saw the value of having instruments at home as well.

Unlike the European experience, where telephony (like telegraphy) was seen as an extension of post-office service, US telephone companies were private enterprises.  Within a few years of Alexander Graham Bell’s invention in 1876, telephone exchanges existed in most major cities and many smaller towns in the United States, operating under licenses from what Bell and his investor partners established as the American Bell Telephone Company.  After most of the Bell patents expired in 1894, telephone companies sprang up even in small towns, and in cities of any size it was not uncommon to have competing companies—a development spurred by invention of the automatic exchange in 1892.  Old advertisements will sometimes highlight two different phone numbers for the same business, saying things like “Phone Main 6200 or Automatic 4882.”  [This 1910 map](http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~200183~3000108:Lines-Of-The-Bell-Telephone-Compani?trs=242&amp;sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;mi=124&amp;qvq=q%3Abatch001%3Bsort%3APub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No%3Blc%3ARUMSEY~8~1#) shows how the Bell  companies had concentrated on business centers of the East, and how sparse service—and especially connection to nearby towns—was across the West.

Beginning in 1907, the Bell System’s Thomas Vail sought to bring much of the nation’s phone service under control of a single enterprise, carefully structured to avoid antitrust problems.  Regional operating companies provided local phone service, but typically purchased all equipment from the Bell System’s Western Electric subsidiary, and used AT&amp;T Long Lines Division for long-distance connections.  Competing local phone companies soon disappeared, but some important pockets were served by General Telephone or other independent companies rather than Ma Bell.  Though Bell eventually controlled 80 percent of American phones, they only controlled 30 percent of the geographic area. After 1949, the Rural Electrification Admistration began to support expansion of rural telephone coöperatives to provide service in sparsely settled areas—the only significant involvement of government in US telephone service.

This landscape shifted dramatically after the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, as the regional “Baby Bells” first became independent of the Bell System, then combined with each other and with General Telephone to confront the growth of mobile phone service in a drastically different antitrust environment.

If your argument is taken to its extreem and the entire economy were to collapse and money became worthless, there are still valuable assets, possibly in the hands of a very few, which have intrinsic value as a store of wealth.  Food, agricultural land, electricity, natural resources,  weapons.  Even if the government were to fall away, the people controlling these resources would be the new ruling class.

Now let's continue the thought experiment and consider that these elites are the robot-owning people.  Do they have any need for the remaining 99% of humans?  Or do they rather just trade hard assets with other robot owners and take steps to protect what remaining wealth they do have from the hungry masses?

What about government -- wouldn't they step in to enforce distribution of wealth to the people?  Assuming that they had any desire to do so, and would not just happily cash checks from the robot industrialists as Rome burns, the mass of humanity will simply be pulling the break on development speed, drawing resources away from the automated industries that now generate the vast majority of the wealth.  Redistributing wealth would be an acceptable (and humane) outcome in a situation where everyone plays by the same rules, but we live in a multi-national world where nations compete for resources.  Even if the US and EU did enact such redistributive policies, Russia, or China, or Korea, or Botswana may be perfectly happy to allow its robot industrialists to pay zero taxes and reinvest 100% of their profits into growth.

El 26 de Julio de 1822, San Martín y Bolívar tuvieron una reunión extremadamente secreta en la provincia de Guayaquil (recién liberada).

-El futuro de Guayaquil.
-El pago a Perú por el apoyo brindado en la campaña.
-El fin de la guerra en contra de los realistas (pro-españa).


Pero al haber sido una reunión a solas, secreta y sin testigos quedá aún cubierta por un velo de misterio la razón por la cual, esa misma noche, San Martín entregó el mando de los ejércitos independentistas a Bolívar.


Algunos historiadores dicen que San Martín estaba agotado y que Bolívar era más ambicioso, otros sugieren que San Martín quería que Guayaquil fuese controlada por alguna corona Europea y Bolívar no. En alguna oportunidad leí que fue decisión de la logia masónica a la cual pertenecieron los Libertadores.

Yeah, I can understand the exploration part. The stories thing is opinion as you said - most players really enjoyed the Coil story and the Alexander one turned out quite nicely with this final wing.

As for the net code, there's nothing necessarily wrong with it (and there certainly are very few limitations with the game engine), it's only that the tick rate is purposefully set slightly lower. This is obvious when taking into account the tick rate changes they've made on two occasions already, and the changes to NIN mudras, etc. Although a large part of the latency also comes from where the servers are located. When they added the EU data center it made everything much smoother for me, so it really depends on how far away from the servers you live.

It certainly doesn't stop them from implementing complex mechanics. I'm not entirely sure what your definition of ""complex"" is. I've raided in both WoW and FFXIV (and a handful of other MMOs) and I don't see any direct limitations. Nathaniel Chapman's twitter and blog are quite insightful when it comes to comparing the two, it's well worth a read!

* Punctuality, preparedness and a willingness to make the most of a two night raid schedule.
* Ability to communicate appropriately i.e Working microphone, no issues talking/responding in a raiding environment.

The problem is, during the EU referendum  I saw exactly what EU money did to supposed 'experts' and 'academics' in their fields. All the scientists, all the economists were ranting at us about how it would be a disaster and they were practically acting like the world would end. They've all pretty much been proven to be full of shit, the ones who were pro-remain were receiving EU money which is why they held the positions they did, I suspect it's a similar sort of thing for global warming but that's just my opinion.

Diamond and Alex Ich changed the way the jungle works, and in S2 they were almost untouchable. xPeke at this prime was a monster and even out of his prime managed to be so massive for his team. 

I think though, we have seen the fall of those players. Diamond changed the jungle but since then he has been outclassed in some pretty huge ways. The same for Alex, he was this aggressive monster that just oppressed whoever he played against, but he fell off and hard. Froggen is a little different in that he still puts up impressive numbers and seems to have improved along with every else around him. 

Bjergsen has just been untouched as far as his skill since he came on the scene by other western players. Many comparisons to Faker have been made, and I think they are warranted. Bjergsen brings a map-wide gravitational pull with him to every game. The enemy team HAS to deal with him, and there isn't an option to leave him alone.

With xPeke as the example here - you can tilt Soaz and outmuscle his botlane with all your jungle pressure, maybe a TP here or there. When you do this, you can let xPeke sit in a 1v1 and your midlaner can just hold on.

Substitute in Bjergsen in that same situation and it will change a lot. Bjerg will come out with a huge CS lead and probably a solo kill or two, and then carry that lead out to the map. You MUST respond to him.

He has the aggressively overpowering nature of Alex Ich, the late game control and teamfight mastery that Froggen does, and he has proven himself (after this long now) to be an excellent team player and rallying point like xPeke was.

The leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi, took care of his people, they had free education, medical, and housing paid for by Libyan oil exports. He refused to put his country in debt to the bankers (her donors) and had gold backed currency. Hillary brought in foreign opposition forces (mercenaries) to cause civil unrest and overthrew the legitimate government, killing Gaddafi by torture and sodomizing him with a sword even though Gaddafi agreed to step down and accept Hillary's terms 3 times. She wanted him dead. Hillary's mercenaries went on to ethnically cleanse Libya of all black people and opened the floodgates for the refugee crisis. 

This isn't a talking point, it's a war crime and a crime against humanity. The migrant crisis in Europe and here at home are the direct result of Hillary's actions in Libya and Benghazi.

,0,False,,d8a54hb,coffeelover96,"Edgar was so damn close to figuring out who was committing all the grisly murders in his small New England town. Bodies had been ripped apart and eaten. Local authorities assumed it was a bear or a wolf, but Edgar knew the truth. It was a werewolf. 

No one wanted to believe him. He was just a washed up journalist who had moved to town a year ago. Everyone knew he was a little bit too familiar with the effects of alcohol. He couldn't say anything without it being wrote off as a crazy conspiracy. 

That was a shame too. It's really taxing on a Pulitzer Prize winner's psyche to be called insane by a bunch yokels. This time was the worst. He knew he was right about this. He had investigated rumors and proved them to be true in Transylvania for Christ's sake. 

That's why he was there after all. His ""Transylvania Papers"" were a laughing stock of the world of journalism. He needed to get away, and his great aunt's farm in the countryside would do it.

So he was surprised when the telltale signs of a werewolf were all over the town. Bodies only surfaced following a full moon. Wolf fur was found near the vincinity of every case. 

He tried to break the case to the local papers, but they again laughed at him. People who got there educations at community colleges were laughing at a Pulitzer Prize winner! He wanted to burst. Their horrendous shrieking was driving him mad. 

""A bunch of jackasses run this paper!"" he said as he walked out of the editor's office. He was going to prove them wrong. He had to do it. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't believed this time. He knew he was right, everyone was just against him. 

He decided he would take matters into his own hands. He drove to the local gi store to buy silver bullets. He was going to show everyone what was killing the locals. 

""Hi,"" said the friendly gun shop owner, ""What can I do for you?""

""Do you, uh, have... have silver bullets?""

The owner walked over to a locked case and grabbed a special looking box of bullets. ""Here you go!"" he said with a nice warm smile.

""You're sure these are pure silver?""

""Oh, I  guarantee these bullets are pure silver.""

Edgar thanked the man and made the local transaction. He drove home with great haste. He was going to prove he wasn't a lunatic. He put out a lure that a priest in Europe gave him. It a 95% chance to bring in any werewolf. 

The full moon rose and Edgar waited. He waited, waited, and waited some more.

He looked down at his watch. 3 AM. ""Godamnit!"" He cried out. He was wrong. There was no werewolf. Maybe everyone was right, maybe he shouldn't have quit taking his anti-psychotics. 

Edgar held the gun to his head in shame. He couldn't go on living knowing he was wrong. He was going to end it all. 

Just then a large figure burst into his house. It was a hulking beast covered in fur. A werewolf. 

Edgar kept back and let out a great scream. He fired several shots at the monster but it slowly approached. He looked at it and recognized a wacky tie on the demon from somewhere. He knew this creature.

The beast let out a great bellowing howl and struck Edgar. He fell to the floor and looked up at the beast. He realized it was the damn gun store owner.

""Goddamn you to Hell you creature of-""

Edgar's neck was snapped. He died. He was released from his sad existence. 

The beast drug Edgar's corpse outside and enjoyed its feast. It had won this battle. Now no one would stop it. This town belonged to him now.

In the same comment thread you extend a subjective and insulting label to people who uphold the right of revolution and then classify all the people you've already slurred as provincial or bigoted. Classy.

Some three dozen state constitutions either imply or specifically espouse the right of revolution, and the Declaration of Independence invokes it as a *natural right.* How does the Constitution abrogate all of that?

Moreover, the idea of the Second Amendment as a defense against tyranny is no contemporary invention. I'm not going to attempt to fill in the gaps in your education on early U.S. history, but I will dump a few quotes to show how seriously you've mischaracterized 
this matter.

**Hamilton, 1788:**
&gt;If circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude, that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people, while there is a large body of citizens, little if at all inferior to them in discipline and use of arms, who stand ready to defend their rights...

**Noah Webster, 1787:**
&gt;Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. 

**Jefferson, 1787:**
&gt;What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure. 

**Madison, 1788:**
&gt; Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.

**George Mason, 1788**
&gt;When the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually. . . .

 We can have a discussion over the role of arms in society. I welcome that. But let's be honest with each other about history - especially when the history of this issue is so well-documented. An armed populace has *always* been controversial, and it has always - rightly - been considered a threat to the government.",t1_d8a3li9,1478292304,1475367577,False,politics,t3_55ev3d,t5_2cneq,,4,0

Indeed the theory wasn't new in Gardiner's 1998 book. It was old at that point. A whole 3 years since Gardiner came up with the theory in 1995 in the original version of the book called ""The Riddle of the Titanic""."" It makes sense as to why this book is not mentioned. Co-author Dan Van der Vat disowned the theory and has not participated in the 3 updates of the book that have since been released. I wonder if James Cameron's Titanic had anything to do with it. It wasn't released until 1997 but it may have been announced years beforehand.

[An overlook of the major differences between the ships by deck](http://www.paullee.com/titanic/switch.html)

[interview with Mark Chirnside that didn't make it into the documentary](http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/MARK%20CHIRNSIDE%20INTERVIEW%20JUNE%202004.htm)

[Dissertation by Chirnside](http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/pdfs/Conspiracy_Dissertation.pdf)

[Book on the subject. Highly recommended](https://www.amazon.ca/Titanic-Olympic-Which-Ship-Sank/dp/0752461583/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475366512&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=titanic+or+olympic+which+ship+sank)

The above destroys the theory in its entirety, but I'll address the article directly.

There is no evidence there was damage to the keel. The HMS Hawke was over 10 feet shallower in the water than Olympic right off the bat. She also only penetrated 8 feet into a ship 92 feet thick. How the keel would have been affected when the Hawke wouldn't even hit the floor of the worker's areas remains a mystery. Gardiner is the first author ever to say that the report was lying and there is no evidence to support this.

Even if it was, the [SS Suevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Suevic#Salvage) accident took place the same year as when the Olympic Class started to be designed. Did they just forget everything immediately?

See Chirnside's dissertation on the cost of the repairs. Take into account WSL's internal fund for the ships and the insurance they carried.

See Paul Lee's article for a non-exhaustive list on differences.

Why is it that anyone who brings up the portholes never ever links to an image of [Olympic at launch](http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcaky06UlJ1qmyxbjo1_1280.jpg) or [after her launch and before May 1912] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Olympic_sea_trials.jpg)? Look at the image and you'll see why.

Titanic had the unevenly-spaced windows in April 1912. Olympic later had a refit to make her closer to Titanic but her windows are still noticeably different. This mistake is perpetuated because that stupid documentary which uses several images of the Titanic and *not the Olympic* to confuse the viewers.

The list to port is fiction. Olympic was repaired to her original specification. Titanic developed a list over her voyage that was later corrected. It was due to uneven trim.

""Runners"" worked on vessels in European ports of call. They wouldn't go on transatlantic journeys because it would mean 2 weeks away from home. The workers who operated in the bowels of the ship had no contract. They signed on per voyage. They elected to go for other ships that were operating at the time. This got turned into ""NOBODY WANTED TO WORK ON TITANIC BECAUSE THEY ALL KNEW!"" It's total bullshit. It should also be noted that many of Titanic's passengers were transfers from other ships, increasing the numbers of risks involved.

Refer to Chirnside's interview for information on fanfare of Olympic and Titanic and passenger cancellations. It should be noted that several extremely high-ranking individuals in the White Star Line and Harland and Wolff were aboard, Ismay included. Ismay was the only one who lived and he spent the rest of his life in shame. You should also note that Morgan died a bit over a year after this. The article also points out that he was with his mistress yet doesn't connect the dots on why he wouldn't be honest about his whereabouts.

[Californian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Californian) was a common cargo liner that was [way too small to be involved in any rescue operation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Californian.jpg/800px-Californian.jpg). It was rated for 104 people maximum, passengers and crew included. Titanic had 2,200 people on board. The accusation that Californian had rescue gear aboard is baseless. The manifest has been long lost and Gardiner hasn't ever seen it himself. Californian stopped because they were afraid of sinking, something the Titanic did.

How does Titanic's hull number on Titanic's wreck indicate it's Olympic at all? Before anybody responds with ""read the article,"" it's abundantly clear I have. Think about what this article is trying to claim.

[Titanic's nameplate during the 1987 dive when it was first uncovered and **not** during the 1985 dive or any dive with Ballard present.] (https://youtu.be/Cp1Jqi_PhUg?t=5m24s) Start around 5:24.

[The nameplate during an early 2000s NOAA expedition.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wKaTNLBc1Q)

All ships used metallic grey primer before paint. Olympic's first coat of paint, as you can see in the image of her launch, was basically white. Titanic shows grey primer and black paint when it isn't silt or bare iron.

As with many things, it just asserts that insurance fraud was common and that the media wouldn't be sufficient to spot anything. No sources or events needed at all. Never mind that the ships had large differences between them that anyone on board would have noticed such as entire rooms not existing on Olympic but present on Titanic. Those first class passengers paying thousands of pounds in 1912 would have been awfully pissed to learn they were sleeping on the open deck.

I think that's the point. I think we are supposed to see that the Empire is so over-eager in their hunger for bigger and bigger ships that they are skipping the easy, common-sense steps that would ensure one kamikaze A-Wing can't deliver a fatal blow like the one we saw. They aren't interested in things like fail-safes, auxiliary command centers, or clear chains of command, because they are too busy just adding more guns. The Executor is supposed to be so scary on paper that potential enemies just surrender without a fight. 

Vader and Palpatine don't seem like the sort of guys who would have been terribly interested in proper ship design. Palpatine always seemed to have some other objective in mind for both his weapons and his empire. We never got to know what it was. And I know Anakin was a pilot and general in the Clone Wars but .... you know, somehow I think he was beyond caring about anything besides how big his ship was and how many guns it had. And no way was Vader going to let another command crew exist. Sith don't share power like that.

I know this is old EU, non-canon stuff now, but in the comic books, there was a subplot where Vader's command crew decides they have to mutiny and kill him. They deactivate the airlocks and try and flush him into space, but they underestimate the power of the Dark Side. It doesn't end well for them. 

I know it's not canon anymore, but it just goes to show that the Imperials under Vader's command were probably even more afraid of him then the Rebels were. You can't just relieve someone like Vader of command, no matter how unhinged he is. It wouldn't surprise me to learn he's survived attempts to assassinate him before.

Since we're all adults and realize that we have responsibilities outside of gaming, we don't expect our members to be professional gamers who are online 24/7. Although gaming is a hobby for us, we do have some knowledgeable players who will happily lend you a hand in your journey through Destiny.

Thanks and stay safe Guardian!

PS. Most of our clan mates are located in North America, we however have a couple of people from the UK, and would like to get more players from EU! Gamers from all timezones are welcome!",t1_d8868gc,1478293584,1475372078,False,Fireteams,t3_54qgk6,t5_2zc5x,,1,0

&gt;* According to a press release, UK government unveiled a project to invest 1.3 billion British pounds ($1.7 billion) in the construction of the new Successor-class nuclear submarines, part of the full 178 billion-pound spending plan for Britain's military.

&gt;* MOSCOW (Sputnik)  The UK government unveiled a project to invest 1.3 billion British pounds ($1.7 billion) in the construction of the new Successor-class nuclear submarines, part of the full 178 billion-pound spending plan for Britain's military, a press release issued on Saturday revealed.

&gt;* ""Britain's ballistic missile submarines are the ultimate guarantee of our nation's safety  we use them every day to deter the most extreme threats.

&gt;* Along with increasing the defence budget to buy new ships, planes and armoured vehicles, this shows that this Government will never gamble with our national security,"" Defense Secretary Michael Fallon was quoted as saying in the press release.

&gt;* The proposed replacement for the Vanguard-class of ballistic missile submarines has generated controversy over its cost.
