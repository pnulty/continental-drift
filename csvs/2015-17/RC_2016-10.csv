"Lies bloody lies, and statistics alive and well here. Why on earth would you represent figures in terms of applications per million population? You might as well express it in terms of number of kebab shops per country, or number of Chihuahuas per household i.e. any fucking meaningless basis you like.

So, if we take the actual populations of these countries, and express the figures *properly* in absolute numbers per country ... oh look, the UK is now 7th instead of 19th. Someone obviously had an agenda when they chose how to express those figures.

"Far more important than the specific morality of the candidate the US chooses to be President, probably the most important issue with regards to America biblically would not be the immorality of the country itself (there are many, many countries which would compare ""favorably"" to the US in terms of immorality), but rather what sets the US apart from the rest of those nations: their aggressive promotion of unbiblical ""human rights"" in other countries. 

For example, there are several Western European nations that have had homosexual Prime Ministers already, like Luxembourg, Iceland, etc. There are western European countries where the people are probably even more immoral than Americans are, according to those Pew surveys of what people find acceptable in various parts of the world, which we all read about once or twice a year. However, no one can accuse Luxembourg and Iceland of aggressively promoting the acceptance of immorality in other parts of the world or regionally. 

A lot of EU nations have homosexual marriage, and the US was a lot slower in adopting this than many other countries. But even so, America is the only country, or at least the main country, aggressively promoting unbiblical ""human rights"" all over the world, including homosexual rights. America even has a ""global envoy for homosexual rights"", an office created in 2015 http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/02/237772.htm. 

American values, such as free speech and  freedom of the press, are not actually biblical values, and are in fact directly contradicted in scripture, for example Ecclesiastes 10:20, Provebrs 24:21, and others. And yet America has taken an opposite position on these things, and literally twists the arms of other countries into adopting American norms as gospel. And we can see how all this does is spread immorality and unbiblical norms of governance into other countries. 

This is something which sets America apart from the rest of the world, and it is not a good thing. Biblically, it would be far better for America to have a President who himself may not have morals which agree with the Bible, but who would also scale back America's aggressive diplomatic behavior in some of these regards. This is probably the #1 thing to focus on for America from a Biblical perspective, in my opinion. 

From that perspective, a lot of Trump's, let's just say, ""less than democratic"" statements, for example his admiration for Putin, etc... might be viewed in a much more positive light than you would first think. 

It is a sad thing for America that they have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Trump, but from a Biblical perspective the discernment issues surrounding Trump are a lot more complex than simply what HE does with HIS mouth and what HE does in HIS OWN life. If he were indeed to scale back America's involvement in foreign affairs, as he has made pretty clear he would do, this would only be a boost for America from a Biblical perspective.

"I don't know why you would consider his view point particularly new. This has been the standard line of argument used by the nationalist side when they weren't fear mongering.

It's simply common sense that when a smaller political entity joins a larger political entity, it must give up some of its rights to self-determination. It's also common sense that not every decision made by the larger political body will be in the individual interests of every single smaller entity. Neither of these are inherently bad; the only question, or what should be the only question, is whether these costs of membership outweigh its benefits. In their answer to this question as regards to Brexit, economic and political experts were fairly unequivocal: no.

It's this sense of give and take that the pro-Brexit side intentionally avoided addressing during their campaign, and this MP is not really an exception. You could take his speech and replace *the UK* with *Cornwall*, and *the EU* with *England*, and most of his arguments would still make superficial sense (except for the undemocratic election of European Council members); for almost all of their important political decisions, the Cornish have to appeal through a ""third-party"" in the way of British Parliament, and in most cases wherein their interests are at odds with those of the rest of the country, they're going to be told no and to suck it up; yet Cornwall would be completely retarded to try become an independent nation. Now, this analogy does fall flat at a few points, as England isn't beholden to membership by the threat of military force, nor is the EU as critical to its existence, but the main point is that a lot of the rhetoric these politicians use is intentionally myopic, designed to pluck a few emotional heart strings whilst avoiding a view of the contradicting whole.",t1_d88tl0m,,0,False,,d88zymy,anon383929,,1,3,1478225534,1475280366,False,t3_5587yt,worldnews,t5_2qh13

"One thing that's important to point out - under your scenario, the north would explicitly be subsidizing the south with cash payments. 

The reason America can work with a single currency and with the same programs on a federal level is that we have two important factors:

* free movement of population and very little cultural barriers in the way of movement - one language as an example, one set of laws.
* Massive transfer payments between the rich areas and the poor areas.  New York and California and Texas pay way more money into the Federal government than most states per capita, and they subsidize Mississippi and West Virginia and so on to a very large degree.

If the EU wanted to be a federal state, you'd need to see MORE of the north subsidizing the south, not less.  If Greece and Germany had the same rules about X level welfare and medical coverage, Germany would be able to pay for it and Greece wouldn't.  In order to keep promises to those in Greece, the northern countries would subsidize Greece's pensioners.  

This is just like how New Yorkers and Mississippians are both promised Medicare, but New York contributes enough to pay for it while Mississippi doesn't.  So New York makes up the difference for Mississippi so that those in Mississippi don't go without Medicare.

"&gt; That is a very limited view on what life is all about. 

It's a view that leads to better societies and happier people, so I'm going to keep espousing it.

&gt;This could be because millennials do not have the wealth to be married or pursue family units, however there are tax benefits to marriage that should strengthen the financial well being of both parties.

Getting married takes a certain amount of capital. You have to have your own place, so the millions of millennials who still live with their parents are out. All of the societal expectations that come along with Marriage are not cheap (ring/wedding/party).

&gt;And the countries that we look to as models for proper wealth distribution (especially the EU and Canada) all have lower childbirth rates per woman than America.

Millennial unemployment is even worse in the EU than it is in the US. Naturally, they have even lower rates and marriage and childbirth.

&gt; Wealth does not seem to be a factor for large family units in other countries. (Anecdotally we see the poor typically have bigger families here in America)

Poor women have lots of kids out of wedlock. No offense, but that is not what I mean when I say family. It neither achieves happiness nor productive societies.


&gt;Americans are still marrying and breeding more often than other countries with better wealth distribution.

Not true. Millennials in EU have even fewer opportunities, and get married and have kids less.

&gt; Millennials don't want to get married because it is no longer about economics, but about love. Unfortunately this is at odds with accumulation of wealth because marriage has many benefits.

Agreed that it is not the only cause. But it does hurt.

&gt;Wealth redistribution is going to need to be done through smart financial policy that includes better tax incentives for buying a home, socialized healthcare, and minimum wage increases.

LOL. The solution is not to give people things. The solution is eliminate pernicious ideologies like ""everyone needs to go to college"". If anything, we need to decrease the social safety net.

claro, isso pq ele não se alinhou com nenhuma potência. a ideia de política internacional que a gente vive hoje está, em certo ponto, baseada em esferas de influência, que é uma ideia antiga, mas que sobrevive. isso significa que, se você consegue um patrão mais forte para seu país, você está de boa com o resto do mundo. se você é arabia saudita e proíbe mulheres de votar, mas está sob a proteção americana, tá de boa, por enquanto. se você é bielorrussia e ainda mantém um regime autoritário, mas está sob proteção russa, está de boa. se você é venezuela e mantém um regime autoritário, e seus amigos sul-americanos mudaram o governo, seu governo vai cair também.

no final das contas, é o quanto de poder seu grupo consegue manter coeso. duterte está se isolando. não tem apoio dos estados unidos. rússia não parece dar muita bola pra eles. união europeia é defensora de direitos humanos neste século, então não também não vão apoiar duterte. resta china. se china não estiver afim das filipinas, duterte tá morto.",t1_d88il0q,PR,0,False,,d890nl8,tupiniquinium,"Curitiba, PR",0,3,1478225897,1475281519,False,t3_557v0i,brasil,t5_2qh9i

There is every reason to oppose the EU. The people have voted and they voted against being ruled by an undemocratic, centralised, authoritarian superstate led by Germany.

"Again, apples and oranges. You're talking pre and post air travel. It's a lot more economical time/money to travel via airplane than rail. Moreover, the US doesn't have anything like the navigable water/canal network coverage Europe does, again because of distance and geography. To replace that logistics network, we largely use rail where we don't have good rivers. So most of that rail line through cities is designed and optimized for cargo transportation, not people.

As to high speed rail, a link between Chicago and New York would require clearing 5 or 6 State legislatures, and many more cities.

An equivalent link in Europe doesn't exist, there aren't any countries with major cities that far apart. It would have to be a government line, the right of way costs to buy land for a high speed rail link across the northeast would be astronomical.

If you want to hear a comparison of population, imagine if the population of America, of all of Europe (that includes Russia), the population of Canada, the population of New Zealand and Australia, and the population of Mexico were all added together. 

That's a population of 1.325-1.35 billion people. For comparison, China had a population of 1.357 billion 3 years ago in 2013. 

So it's not that special to find an asshole. By number of tourists, there were 100 million people [That left China to visit the world around them](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/tourism/2015statistics/outbound.htm). America was at 68 million people leaving. [Source](http://www.ibtimes.com/americans-traveled-abroad-record-numbers-2014-1826816). That's around the population of France.

So yes you're going to run into a lot of assholes.

"So I in the North west of this planet : 

I have several countries but very little lore on them. Other than their names and some general information.

For example Tora Mora, is a country dominated by vampires and vampire hunters. As it is constantly in a struggle for power between the two groups. (Other than that not much information!) I love the idea of a gothic society but I want to give it a different spin to it that is wholly unique to it. Infact after my current book series in the same world I want to focus on the vampire hunters of Tora Mora after the Descendant series 1, and focus on this area.

Morabin - A country gone to chaos and known for its wine. Once ruled by Glasgith before it disolved its rule. (Check out the lore on Glasgith on the bottom, think steampunk isolationist russian-eastern european empire) 

Pandoris - Gone to War- It is a kingdom that is surrounded on all sides by its enemies, think greece.

Logosh -  Little to no info - Other than it is known as the land of the wilds. (Dominated by Mountains and harsh climates. Think stereotypical LOTR culture meets Lovecraft.

The Mountain Land Clans - Ruled by Gryphon and Air castes of human tribes who ride great beasts into battle. But due to their climate they are clans. (Closet thing to stereotypical dwarves, but are human.)


Lorish - North of Aleris once ruled by Vernoians before their destruction. They venerate their dead and are known for their woods and their blackened towers that were built during teh War of the Gods. (Looking for some idea to push these guys in, have no identifying culture)

Vael - A Seafaring culture often is known for discovering many parts of the known world.  Think Phoenicians, and I really don't know what else.

The Dread Lands - Said to be ruled by the Yeti Tribes, and the Northern Elves (actual Elves, often called the White Elves and the Snow Elves) They have isolated themselves and are known as the people of the gods, they were driven here during the Exodius in the first age by the Empire of Talderia and Vernoia during the War of the Gods. Other than that the Kingdom of Oren has kept a close eye on the dreadlands and the lands north of it. (don't know if I should make this the north pole or just north of the equator. (30 degrees)


Hector the Lord of Cinder - Fought a Levithan was known to wield a giant torch weapon that caught his enemies aflame. Needs to be a hero with flame afinity

The Xenophros the Black Herald - King of Sidhe, before he was slain by the Vampire Lords of Tor Mora during the second age. Rose an ancient evil that almost destroyed the world. Don't know what else.

Jaxia The Keeper - Communed with the Elder Beings and one of their faithful servants, traded their humanity away to be an envoy to them. (Immortal) It is insane and is a lovecraftian envoy to its Lovecraftian Inspired Gods.

The Blackened Axe - an artifact weapon possessed by a Revenant (not much is known about it, other than necromancers worship it). It is a cursed blade similar to the Beroia (Knight of the Cursed Blade of King Arthur) it seeks a new master to possess and to take their soul to try and manifest essentially.

"&gt; Então se você nasce numa casa onde um homem por gerações corta a grama e ameaça a família caso ele não os pague você é obrigado a pagá-lo pois afinal ele lhe prestou um serviço em cortar sua grama e você está em débito com ele? O ciclo após iniciado é vicioso e perpétuo?

Se a sua sobrevivência depender disso e não existir outra opção, sim, acho que estará em débito.

&gt;Eu interpretei como ""não tem alternativa senão o Estado fornecê-las"", pois em outro contexto não saberia por que motivo você respondeu ao meu comentário. É óbvio que existem coisas fornecidas pelo Estado sem as quais não vivemos, mas é também óbvio que não é necessário que o Estado e não outra entidade as forneça (que foi o que eu escrevi).

Meu ponto é que estamos inscritos em determinada circunstância histórica, econômica e social. Pode-se até querer modificá-la, abri-la mais à iniciativa privada, mas deve-se reconhecer toda a estrutura que se recebe pronta, da qual nos beneficiamos. Por isso o argumento da renúncia ao sol.

&gt;Eu acho que há uma confusão sobre o assunto da discussão aqui. Eu iniciei-a em resposta ao colega, que propôs que devemos pagar por serviços públicos, ao que respondi que, apesar de eu crer que Walter não estava falando exatamente sobre isso, sim, dado que eles existem alguém tem que pagar por eles, mas que é questionável se é benéfico que existam, isto é, que sejam fornecidos pelo Estado e não por terceiros. Ao que você respondeu que ""não existe alternativa"" e que ""o sol sempre iluminará nossas vidas"", etc. Daí minha estranheza.

Não que você pense dessa forma, mas me incomoda essa alegação que vejo sendo repetida de que estado não serve pra nada, que imposto é roubo e que só não se recusa a todo esse aparato por coação, quando na verdade ninguém poderia simplesmente descartá-lo por opção.

About half the human population lives on coastal cities and coupled with the rising tides driven by anthropogenic climate change, a *shit ton of people* would be displaced. 

Not a big deal? Okay, how is Europe handling the migration crisis it's currently dealing with? That's a human driven conflict. 

How will our food chain be affected? Changing climates may mean that areas where we once relied on to feed us may no longer be viable.

Due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to vote in the referendum. I wasn't too concerned by this as I would've voted remain and was convinced that remain would win by a landslide. I was devastated upon hearing the result.

On reflection, the result is probably positive for our country - we can gain some autonomy back and can set our own laws and policies rather than having them dictated by foreign politicians. With any luck, other European countries will see that they are loosing their sense of identity and follow suit in leaving the EU. If they do, hopefully Europe can retain its diverse, rich, cultural identities.

My ancestors helped build this country. They have fought and died for this country and its people. Not for an island, or a tectonic plate, or a planet, but a country and all that represents.

The average number of deaths a year due to terrorist attacks is definitely lower during the years following the establishment of the EU than the years preceding it.

I'm not saying the EU didn't necessarily contribute to the reduction, but it is possible that the decrease would have occurred even without the EU.

Yes, I do. Just look at those places. Putrid, diseased wet jungles filled with toxic insects and bloated, muddied rivers. And the people of those countries reflect that.

&gt;Muslims valued sciences and technology long before Europe was even established. 

Well, ""Europe"" was established, I'd say, with the Roman empire, which was undoubtedly the greatest empire of all time (not by territory, but by every aspect of society, including science, culture and economy). Everything we have today is due to ancient Greeks and Romans - Aristotle himself is at the basis of most modern sciences. And that's all hundreds of years before Muhammed. However, I'll give praise where it's due; Muslims achieved great successes in philosophy, medicine, and other sciences before they succumbed to religious dictatorship and primitive barbarism we see today. It's a pity, to be honest. As it was before, Muslims and the White man were on equal footing as brave explorers and scientific pioneers. But today, the Muslim has lowered himself to a sorry state of poverty, corruption, wahhabism and squalor. It's sad to see.

"The Economist is considered to be the premium source when it comes to Extemp, as it combines analysis with conciseness. I'd also recommend Foreign Policy, Foreign Affairs, and Brookings, but for specific issues you'd also want to look at ""local"" sources (ex: Xinhua for China, allAfrica for Africa, Político Europe for Europe). 

Extemp has a relatively short learning curve - your first 2 to 3 tournaments, you'll be like ""wtf is happening"", but after that it will become easier to make cohesive, 7 minute speeches. I would do some heavy filling for the next 2 weeks (~100 articles/week per team member), then use the week before the tournament to do full-length practice speeches. 

It's good that you already know to outline your speeches. Something that may help is splitting your paper into 4 ""boxes"", and writing your intro and points into each of those. I'm a visual person so this helps me quite a bit. 

In general each speech should have 7 to 10 sources - 1 in the intro to give background on your topic/why your question is important and 2-3 in each point. When introducing a source be sure not just to regurgitate what it says, but provide your own analysis and explain how it relates to the problem. 

I can't stress this enough: IMPACT. You can have a great speech content-wise, but you have to tell your judge why it matters. This can mean saying at the end of every point ""The impact of this will be overwhelmingly positive/negative on society/economics/law, as it will improve quality of life/raise GDP/increase crime.""

And about terrorism: all of the ISIS incidents that have happened in Europe have been caused by citizens born and raised in France or Belgium. Again, that's what screening is for. 

Also, the San Bernardino guy wasn't a refugee. He was an American citizen. His wife came to the US on a K-1 visa (aka a green card) from Pakistan, not as a refugee. K-1 visas are for fiancées and spouses, not refugees. K-1 visas are screened differently than refugees. They get a fast track to legal status. You're comparing apples and oranges. So unless you're saying we should ban Americans from marrying foreigners, that's irrelevant. 

As for economic capacity: we have 350 million people here. We can handle a lot more than 10,000 refugees. We're the richest country in the world. We have plenty of space. Plenty of empty houses. Lebanon took in 1 million. They're a country with a population of 4 million. There is no reason we can't handle more. Hell, we took in more after WWII and Vietnam. We took in people from all over Southeast Asia. Ever heard of the Killing Fields? We took in hundreds of thousands of boat people from Cambodia alone over the next few years, no problem. So you're saying fuck people like the Rohingyas escaping genocide, right? How dare they want to go to someplace that touts itself as a place of religious freedom after being persecuted for years! 

For each of the past three years, America has taken in ~70,000 refugees from all over the world per year. In 1993, America took in 142,000 refugees from the Balkans, twice as much as all the refugees taken in 2015. And you're saying we don't have the resources to take more than 10,000 in 2016? 

And yes, I absolutely would take in a refugee family if it weren't for my SO. He wouldn't allow it. But I would. Even the goddamn Pope personally took in refugees, like the good Christian he is. You know why I would? Because a family friend, [Leo Bretholtz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Bretholz), only survived the Holocaust because a kindly nun took him in and protected him. Because both sides of my family came to America as refugees. If they just stopped at the next country over, they would be dead and I wouldn't be here. They came to America to escape the pogroms. My great grandmother also helped facilitate the relocation of refugees during the rise of Hitler. Apparently, shiny new F35s are more important to you than human beings. Because that's what you're supporting. 

And I'm also putting my money where my mouth is because I'm going into a field where I can do humanitarian work and help people, just like my great grandmother did. I want to get a master's in global health so I can provide aid to children like this baby.

It's kind of sad because whenever I voice about these things I get briganded by /saudiarabia. I don't care because fuck em.
I've been to 36 countries, I've seen poverty, death, torture and other. I don't usually blame because I haven't lived the lives of other people so I can't judge if they are good or evil.

But fuck Saudi Arabia. Fuck the arabic peninsula, fuck it so fucking hard jesus christ fuck it. Think it's bad? It's worse than that.

Send your daughters and sons to europe and have them educated? Check. Let them lavish in greed, sex, alcohol, parties etc? Check. Act as if they're fucking muhammed/fatima reincarnated one they come back, all the whilst hating and judging every westerner that comes there? Check.

My mother is a lone mother of three. After a man was masturbating on the fucking buss whilst staring at her (for not wearing the face-veil, even though she wore the entire black dress anyway) we were told by the religious police we should be thankful she was not raped for the succubus whore she was not wearing the entire Niqāb. 


Because if she had been raped it'd been her fault and they'd killed her for luring men. And this is just one out of hundreds of stories, the beating of ""guest-workers"" (slaves), the raping of Philippine nurses until they actually contested who was the main rape-ee because she got the best gifts, the stealing of our passports trying to keep us once we tried to flee/move, the systematic murdering of female babies of which tons came into the ER when the parents/people got guilt-tripped once the baby started turning blue and yellow... Often way to late to save it.


I really need to make a huge huge post one day and just copy+paste it in every topic about these things because tons of people ask for more stories. All the while I get re-linked in /saudi, /dubai, /qatar etc. and mass-msg'd and harassed by people explaining to me how I'm a liar because pious muslims of the middle-east would never rape a woman unless she was totally asking for it.

Communal sharing = marxism and a perfect match was born! The cold war aesthetic came from growing up in Europe during the cold war and always having this big secretive black hole entity called the USSR on our doorstep. It wasn't really a scary thing, it was an intriguing thing. The movie Firefox, Brazil, 1984, The Prisoner etc., were heavily influenced by the cold war I think, and in turn influenced us too.

"Oh Dear. No sir, I have no intention of lying.

I am well aware of the reason why The Soviet Union wanted to do that in Cuba. That is why I don't really fault the Soviet Union for having such a strong nationalistic stance on things. It is obvious to me that it just didn't _occur_ to them one day. It was beaten into them, again and again.

For one thing, Ukraine doesn't involve Nukes (thankfully) and the situation surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis and Crimea do have appreciable differences.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was an attempt at parity with the US by Moscow because they were terrified of us when they learned we had missiles in Turkey. It's true that we did negotiate with them to dismantle our nukes in Turkey... but did you also know that we were intending on getting those Nukes out anyway? They were outdated and we wanted to take them out... (I hope I'm remembering this correctly from that Soviet Union History class I took...)

But. We are now dealing with Ukraine. Let's talk about what happened in this Country.

Do you know what the Soviets did to Ukraine at the end of World War II? The Soviets weren't interested in building up any other country, they were interested in reparations no matter what (you would to when your casualties make up the vast majority of the body count of the war.) They were not interested in respecting their neighboring countries... Do you know what they did to the Ukrainians? You really want to know?

[Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)

Ukraine is not Cuba. It's hardly the US' fault that the Ukraine _may_ not want to be too close to Russia after essentially being a client state and this atrocity aimed at quelling any independence movement.

Did you know about this?

"Alright my apologies then, I am impressed by your mature response even after my somewhat childish rant. 

I don't disagree with what you have said in the slightest about collateral damage and weapons funding to terror states like Saudi Barbaria and Iran, those are extremely significant topics which must be addressed, but being from the region myself I am acutely aware that the most potent phantom menace to this whole terrorism phenomenon is on behalf of moderate Muslims, who range from either wholly oblivious to mostly passively supportive/defensive of the most brutal aspects of their ideology, which in some ways is understandable because much of Islamic theology is inherently violent and averse to modernity and the liberal democracies in which it now dangerously resides. I call it a phantom menace because it so often goes overlooked by the general media and public either for fears of baseless accusations of Islamophobia, or simply the overwhelming focus on the minority of Muslims that clearly have a much louder voice/impact than the supposed 'majority' of 'moderate' Muslims who can much more easily and efficiently make their counter claims heard and enacted by virtue of their supposed overwhelmingly larger constituency, sadly this is clearly not the case. 

My point is just that it is time for this so-called majority of peace-loving Muslims to act out and ostracise these fringe sects (if we can even call them that) from their ideology to begin a comprehensive process of reformation within the faith. How many protests for example, from Muslim minorities in Europe or America did we see after all the countless terror attacks in recent memory and in the past decade, none, surely you would think that something as simple as an organized protest would emerge if we continuously hear how ISIS is not Islam and similar facile arguments from Muslim community leaders, apologists and general citizens. The reality is the actions of the Muslims community has been muted at best, at worst wholly complicit. 

The only time Muslims (and indeed Islamic governments) came out en-masse in protest have been during episodes like the Danish cartoons crisis and Charlie Hebdo, this example and many like it paint a disturbing picture of a (much larger than admitted) passive majority that acts as an essential incubator to the cancerous epidemic that is Islamism and Jihadism. If Muslims can deprive the extremists of this then they can finally be eradicated, not by Western bombs and intervention as you correctly pointed out, because only Muslims can solve their fitna as they term it, from within.

&gt;Yeah I agree with all of that. So do most Americans...which is why he will win in a landslide. 

Uh no most Americans don't. Remember that time they elected the black president, not once, but twice?

Let me break this down for you since Trump supporters are known to be a bit slow:

You want to hate all Muslims even though Islamic terrorism has killed more Muslims than non-Muslims. You want to complain about that but not about all of the whites that shoot up schools and malls. And you want no gun control. You want to use torture and worse, which doesn't give good intelligence and is a violation of international human rights law. You want to kill terrorists' families, even if they are not involved in criminal activity. That's jsut fucking barbaric. You can't kill innocent people for being related to a criminal, they didn't choose to be.  

You want all black people to have no way to defend themselves when a cop decides to kill them with no trial, no judge, no jury. That is literally unconstitutional and again barbaric. In a civilized society all those accused of a crime have the right to a fair trial and to face their accusers.  

You have no respect for Asian people because they watch TV all day or don't contribute to the world. First of all that isn't true, look at where every fucking thing you own is made. They work a lot harder than your ass. Where do you think like half of the scientific advancements in the world are made, in Europe or America, yeah, and the other half in Asia, especially Korea and Japan. I'd love to see what you'd do if your family member was dying and only a medicine made by a Japanese or Korean doctor could save them. I wonder what would win out your love for your family or hate and bigotry.   

And finally the border wall. So explain to me why you should be allowed in this country if you happen to be born white, like Trump's wife and not if you're born Latino like all of the countless people you want to deport? Oh and you want to talk about illegal immigration? Don't forget that your white ancestors stole this land by killing its native people. This land doesn't belong to them at all and you can see how terribly they treat those native people when they want to build their huge fucking oil pipelines through the reservations that they forced them onto. 

I think you're just a bigot who needs to get off his high horse and realize that you don't get everything you want because you're born white or born into money. That's all I have to say. Make America great again is such an ironic motto seeing as Trump has exposed the worst side of America. More like Make America Hate again. In just a few months Trump has undone decades of civil rights battles fought to make humanity more equitable and free.

"It has more to do with the way WG's Asia office is actually run (or maybe not run) than it does with the market they're in.  WG has a pretty horrible track record of exploiting markets for the money they could be offering, though.  They put huge amounts of effort into Russia with Europe being #2 ... even though NA makes them the most money overall.  However, WG NA is pretty bad compared to WG EU and WG Russia.

It's not even that there's no money in Asia - I'm pretty sure even the Asian players from the poorest nations in Asia, if they have an internet connection, are at least as wealthy as most Russian players.  Meanwhile, with the income disparities in a lot of ""poor"" Asian countries, those Asians who are on the internet playing games are likely to have the disposable income to be buying ships.

Given the big gaming thing that Asians have, Asia could be making them a lot more money than it is now; they just don't really choose to invest the effort it'd take, or WG HQ doesn't go and make the ""personnel changes"" necessary to make Asia office better.

A common experience on the Asian server (I play there at times with my JP friends) is how toxic the chat is.  Great, is it really that expensive (you know, with the wages in Asia) to hire moderators to sit on servers and deal with the constant vitriol and hate speech?  I'm sure there's enough bilingual and trilingual or more college students looking for money who'd be willing to take a telecommuting job over the internet even if pays little.  Given how little uniformity there is between WG's regional offices, I'd imagine WG Asia could do something like that even if none of the other WG offices do.

As for ""not understanding what goes on in chat"" -- the grass is always greener on the other side, trust me (I play on Asia and NA).  The choice is:

Frustration because you can't communicate with your team because many of them don't speak English (Asia).

"I'm not impressed with your liberal arts indoctrination regimen, which is all about dismissing a person rather than proving his claims wrong by expressing ""Wow, just wow!"" In fact you forgot to put ""It's 2016"" in your little wall of text. 

First of all, any country touched by black people has always been damaged; you look at Africa, and the only prosperous, independent countries it produced were: Rhodesia, and South Africa- at least before Africans decided they're in charge. If you love them so much, go live in Liberia and die from Ebola, please. And take your beloved blacks with you, and hopefully you'll enlighten the dark continent with your superior knowledge of history and political correctness. 

When white people shipped off the worst of their society, they formed countries like South Africa and Australia, countries that for *some reason* PoCs like to immigrate to. Where is your influx of immigrants from Europe to some 3rd world African shithole? 

Civil Disobedience is still disobedience, and if it takes a bunch of dead PoCs and their white, liberal sympathizers to restore the peace, so be it; and it should not stop until they understand what peace and order is. People complain about oppression by burning private property? They have **to die** if they will not respect other peoples' property. I will not ask you politely, I will shoot you and your friends if you go near my property the way they rioted in North Carolina. I have a right to defend my property, and I don't care if you Dindu Nuffin, or if your boon mama cries about how ""You's gonna college, git edjuceshun, Dindu Nuffin."" You have no real idea as to how far right these chimpouts push people, and no amount of ""debates"" from faggots with multi-colored hair will stop it. The only thing these people really understand the language of bullets and beatings. Law and obedience means *nothing* to them, and so they deserve none of it. 

Your revisionist history is incorrect, and even so, irrelevant- the innocent, angelic people from the 60's you like to believe existed are not the same as the spoiled, entitled, welfare queens and criminals of today. The more you look at it, the more you have to ask if desegregation was a good thing- the farther away you take a black man from Jim Crow, the more miserable he is, or is he not miserable, until everyone is a mulatto, and America is no more than a collection of Detroits everywhere, just like Africa?  

Please, tell me. What color are the people who mostly populate the jails of America? Don't avoid this question because it's racist, but you will because it's inconvenient for your little liberal narrative of justified violence. 

Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian refugees who came with nothing but their shirt have done more the last 40 years than all the 200 years of ""Emancipation"" that was given to them- *Given to them*, not **earned**. 

Black neighborhoods are poor because their inhabitants are violent, they are violent, because they are dependent on the State, which does not provide them with anything that makes them self-sufficient, further creating a cycle of bastards, deadbeat fathers, and ""Hey, Gibs Me Dat"" mentality which your ""Gentle Giants"" have for justifying their thefts.  

Are they really justified? I'd say no. When things like riots happen in places like Charlotte, innocent, hard-working people, who rightly believe the shooting does *not* affect them, **move away** because they have common sense; and so, their savings, and business, and opportunities go with them- Your ""black neighborhoods"" aren't violent because they're poor; they're poor **because they're violent**. It's inherent in their culture. 

Would you really please be honest and tell me; if you take the whole lot of America's black population; no, in fact, just Detroit, and switch them with the entire Swiss population, would Switzerland still be a rich country? No. Barely numerate populations would not be able to replicate Swiss society. They'd twerk and kill each other first. You'd say ""Because there's not enough opportunity/slavery/white people are evil"" But it's not just a thought experiment- Black people have already driven away white people, even in Detroit; the mostly-white city of Livonia is located a few miles away from Detroit, and it's more prosperous than Detroit. It is a fallacy that opportunity necessarily equates to success. You can give all sorts of opportunity to black people, but if they are failures, then that opportunity belongs to other people; and if that pisses you off, or a mob of black people, then fuck you, fuck them, deal with it. Are you going to riot and inflict violence on innocent bystanders and your own town as a way of dealing with it? Then you deserve to die, because you are my enemy who wishes to take away what I earned and worked for; you are *not* nobler than a mugger or a burglar.

Oh, and by the way, the Keith Lamont Scott was shot by an African American police officer, Brentley Vinson- but please that's just ""Black on black crime"" right, it's still whitey that did it, right? Therefore, riot in the streets, right? 

Your martyr is some wife-beater convict lowlife who was shot because he refused to comply with the police. That's the common theme with your black people. That's why they're in jails, getting food and shelter from honest, taxpayers, when it's just cheaper to to shoot them and feed them to each other. 

[People like you enable black people to continue making trouble for everyone and digging themselves deeper into misery by telling everyone that they are right in their attitudes and ways of reacting to hardships handed to them by history, by ""the system"" and life in general. You don't do them any favors by avoiding the necessity of personal responsibility and instead blaming things that no one can really be rid of, things like death, inequality and hardship.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqO7zlGHEJ4)",t1_d88zh2u,,0,1475305721,,d89blvi,UnworthySinner,,0,2,1478231396,1475303137,False,t3_550p53,Assyria,t5_2tc0r
"I agree. He has managed to stay in the champ's league (and go to the knockout stages) every year while consistently having to buy cheap players and sell them when they became world class, which is something very few managers would be able to accomplish. He did all of that while playing some of the most attractive soccer in Europe (not always, but more often that not). I hope he stays on for another 5 years or so and proves to everyone he can make Arsenal a winner again now that we have the resources to compete in the transfer market.

Also, I think it may be hard for Arsenal to recover after he leaves (unless we get an amazing replacement). Many top players have come to Arsenal because of their respect for him (and they might leave without him), and I think there are very few coaches who could replicate the attractive soccer we are able to put on display most games.

"Trading for more TAM really shouldn't be necessary. If you'll recall, we didn't even use half of the original $500k to buy down Omar's contract before signing Dos Santos and getting an extra $1.6m to play with from the league. And [according to K'Bax](http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-galaxy-european-players-20160203-story.html), JVD and De Jong were signed for $500k each, which means both would have only cost us $100k TAM combined.

I'm still not clear how Gyasi's being paid -- I've heard everything from TAM to ""HGPAM"" so if someone wants to chime in here, please do -- but in the end, his salary really shouldn't do much to alter this calculus. The point is, we still have almost $1.8m left ($1.6m of which is expiring next year, so there's no point in saving it), and Keane cannot take more than a $2m paycut.

So unless we do something crazy like re-sign Gerrard and Donovan each to $1m contracts, we should -- I repeat, *should* -- be okay. In fact, even then, we'd be fine, since only $600k per deal would go to buying them down (and 3 x 6 makes what, class?).

For all we know, this could have been the FO's plan all along: hoard as much TAM as possible and see who will bite. It might have even been how the team was going to make space for Zlatan in the summer.

All we know for sure is, if no one *is* willing to take a paycut down to the $1m level, there is absolutely no incentive in holding onto that TAM. Therefore, it's totally possible we could choose to extend both Keane and Gerrard one more year and sign a couple Euros/MLS FAs to one-year deals. We could even trade our TAM for additional international roster slots, draft picks, allocation picks, you name it. 

The only question that really matters here is, is Keane more valuable to us than saving that TAM/DP slot for someone else? ",t1_d894lmv,keane,0,1475304881,,d89bxrb,walcottonearly,Robbie Keane,0,2,1478231562,1475304117,False,t3_55932h,LAGalaxy,t5_2rza6

"out of curiousity I found your post here too (came from r/denmark)

reading this side of things, I work in a large company where we have a company in India, and while Copenhagen is not London, Indians aren't uncommon here, as our company as well as other (also university) have indians. There are plenty of restaurant where indians like the selections (esp. on Nørrebro).
Your savings should allow you to get an apartment easily (as discussed in /denmark - look for a ""andelslejlighed"") you got enough for buying into one (it's a thing between renting and owning, rent is low but requires a large downpayment, you own the inside of the house and ""all of you"" own the outside of the house, tenants basically bought the house together).

Forget having a car in Copenhagen, it's expensive, parking etc. biking is the thing, public transport is REALLY good (I lived across Europe, CPH got the best).

as another mentions the food - no big differnce in being vegetarian or not, again I would recommend Nørrebro or Copenhagen NV - as there are many foreigners and many shops with ""exotic"" goods. regarding ""flashing"" being a vegetarian, no problem at all, just Vegans are annoying (treat it as some sort of religion) but for sure, do not be afraid to describe your preferred food coise at restaurants or canteens.

University will help you start your life here, I know the program vaguely, and it seems good, take all the offers they give, e.g. free tours, language classes or culture classes. India and Danish culture are worlds apart (which is also why I would not recommend you trying to drive a car here...)

language, all danes speak english, but you do want to learn danish when you are here. some people pick it up super fast e.g. my cousins wife from Brazil spoke danish in less than a year, really well. my ex-wife refused to speak danish after 5+ years up here, and she felt ""left out""...and well, she's an ex-wife, just couldn't take it I guess.

"idk, developing countries are not the same as the US. We were lucky that there were no widespread drug problems in the early days of our society, and it was able to grow and prosper. It was only after we became relatively prosperous that people began to indulge in alcohol and drugs. Unfortunately in places like the Philippines they have not yet grown and prospered and developed a stable infrastructure, and thus the issue of drug cartels (and some users) make the further development that much harder if not impossible. 

Duterte is fierce, and barbaric. But I think that's just an example of how absolutely awful the poverty and the drugs are there. 

Keep in mind he did not come out of nowhere. He was mayor of Davao for years. And it used to be one of the most crime-ridden cities in the Philippines, and he transformed it into one of the few cities where tourists feel safe to visit. The people of that city absolutely adore him because he made them more prosperous. 

He won the Presidency by an overwhelming majority. To be frank, if drug cartels and drug users weren't causing problems there, Duterte probably never would have formed the opinions he had. It's important to realize that drug addiction in a developing country is fundamentally different than in America or Europe, and thus a much greater danger for the society.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/e1bea80733394ff682a5c263481c0fd6.png)  

&gt; Angels &amp; Airwaves (also known as AvA) are an alternative rock band from San Diego, California, created by former blink-182 and Box Car Racer guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge. The current line-up consists of Tom DeLonge and Lostprophets drummer Ilan Rubin.

&gt; Tom DeLonge began working new material during the blink-182's final tour in 2004 and shortly after they began their hiatus in February 2005. For half a year he worked alone in his home studio before gathering musicians to form the band. Upon fiddling randomly for several weeks with the band's logo, Tom suddenly realized that if he were to invert the middle ""A"" of the band 's acronym into what appeared to be a ""V"", he would have the name of his daughter, Ava. As rumors were floating around about the band's ""break-up"", DeLonge chose to abstain for half a year from any interviews surrounding the issue and his future plans; instead he concentrated on writing and recording in his home-based studio. In September 2005, he finally spoke publicly in Kerrang! magazine, where he unveiled the name of his new band, ""Angels &amp; Airwaves"". The band included former Hazen Street guitarist and high-school friend David Kennedy, former Rocket from the Crypt drummer Adam Willard and former The Distillers bassist Ryan Sinn.

&gt; The band released their first single, ""The Adventure"" on May 18, 2006 and their debut album, ""We Don't Need to Whisper"", on May 23, 2006. Recorded and produced at DeLonge's Never Pants Ranch, the album is a mix of huge production values and anthemic songwriting sounding nothing like the pop-punk sound that earned DeLonge huge amounts of credit for his work with Blink-182

&gt; The band released new album ""I-Empire"" On 5th November, 2007 which gained fast popularity, climbing to the number one spot on iTunes almost overnight.  The first single from the new album, ""Everything's Magic"", was leaked onto the internet, and on August 25, 2007 it was the most requested song on California radio station KROQ. Angels &amp; Airwaves began streaming the song on their myspace profile on August 28, 2007. I-Empire debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at No.9 with sales of 66,000 in its first week. On November 16, 2007, Tom announced on Modlife.com that ""Breathe"" will be the next single/music video off of the I-Empire album.  A documentary by the band entitled Start The Machine has also been released.

&gt; According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Tom Delonge tradmarked the name ""Angels and Airwaves""  on June 24, 2005. The name apparently occured to him whilst driving in his car. Realizing this would be frequently abbreviated to ""AAA"", he decided to move the middle letter upside down for a more unique and personally meaningful ""AVA"" as his daughter is named Ava. This was amongst the lingering confusion of Blink-182's ""indefinite hiatus"" which later led to a confirmed split and the beginning of the band.

&gt; In an interview with British magazine Kerrang!, DeLonge commented about the band's beginning:
""Just before all the blink-182 stuff happened when we were in Europe, I had a really weird epiphany. My heart was beating about a hundred miles a minute for three weeks straight and it had never happened to me before in my life. I really felt like I'd been touched by something and I felt I was meant to do something massive.""

&gt; Originally, ""Valkyrie Missile"" was stated for release via iTunes on December 13, 2005, DeLonge's 30th birthday. However, due to discussions with their record label, Geffen, the band decided to push the release date back to a later date. Instead, the Angels &amp; Airwaves website produced the first ever glimpse at the movie currently in production, a 1-and-a-half minute long trailer featuring portions of the delayed song.

&gt; Angels and Airwaves released both a music video and a short film for their first single, ""The Adventure""; the band also released a short film for ""It Hurts"" via the band's official website. Both are short sci-fi films and together form the first part of a proposed ten-part series, following the cast's struggle through an unfamiliar world. On October 3, 2006, the band released the third installment in the series, ""The Gift"".

&gt; ""Do It for Me Now"" was released in the US as the second single and ""It Hurts"" was released in the UK as the second single at the same time. The music video for ""It Hurts"" is in fact the short-film released on April 18th and was available to select on the UK music television channel Kerrang!.

&gt; In 2006, the band embarked on their first full-length tour, which was headlined by Taking Back Sunday and supported by Head Automatica and The Subways. Numerous one-stop dates at the Give It A Name 2006 festival were played with the likes of My Chemical Romance, Lostprophets, We Are Scientists, Hundred Reasons, Panic! at the Disco, The Bled, Thrice, Billy Talent, Goldfinger, Underoath, Paramore, The Ataris, Aiden and Atreyu. The band also played on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 15, 2006. The band headlined a tour in the US, supported by The Sounds, which ended with a stop in Mexico City, Mexico. After that tour, the band went to perform in Japan and Australia.

&gt; They also performed at two shows at London's Hyde Park and in Manchester supporting the Foo Fighters on their successful In Your Honor tour. Over 100,000 people over both days. Other bands they played with over the two days included The Strokes, Eagles of Death Metal, Motorhead, Queens of the Stone Age, Juliette and the Licks, and Brian May and Roger Meddows-Taylor from Queen.

&gt; Among the plans for a big future, AVA have announced they are planning on releasing a film involving their music. The World War II-based movie is being created primarily through the use of CGI. This ""story"" is apparently based upon Tom's life and will give viewers insight into the hiatus of blink-182. Currently, the only known cast member is Michael Ostman.

&gt; 
Tom DeLonge stated in his PR Editorial Review:
""So preachy, I know. And I don't mean for it to be. I wanted it to be the recording of an emotional event in my life. I love the idea of an album doing that, because I knew that if I could get 150,000 people in an arena to have the same feeling at the exact same moment, it would end up feeling like a religious event. I really want the room to be dark, with black light or a candle. People should have headphones on, and they should be really comfortable, maybe sitting on the floor, leaning against the bed. I spent a year and a half working on this record, trying my hardest to give people a moment of escapism. All I ask is 50 minutes of a lowered heart rate.""

&gt; On 16 July 2007, the Angels &amp; Airwaves website was updated to feature a teaser trailer in the startup.

"No i meant something like, turkey giving them (completely random numbers) 5bn $, in exchange they will get to buy some electricity for cheaper until they saved worth 6bn $. If the nuclear plant is better and more efficient it would generate more electricity than the current one anyways.    
Of course  they would need to make agreements in the furst place, but business is a good reason to do so.

And if, let's say USA gives them 10bn $, they can agree that an American company builds the power plant. That woulb be like boosting their own economy. And is actually done frequently by the governments.

And maybe some European country spends 10bn $ aswell, but they buy the Uranium only from a certain supplier for the next 100years.

"Okay, I'm going to be honest with everyone on this sub. I'm kind of in the middle here. I think, by itself, Lausanne is not a victory. The treaty itself is unfair to us, and it indeed has created borders where our F16's are in ""enemy territorial waters"" right by our own coasts. It's also ironically unfair to Europe now because the refugees have such an easy time getting into the EU by hopping into Greece on a 5 min boat ride.

But what I understand is that this was the best anyone could have done. And I don't think anyone but Mustafa Kemal could have gotten a deal as this. In that sense and under the circumstances of the time it should be fully considered a victory.

I feel like we should be able to move from all this nostalgia Ottoman times talks but to be honest we're constantly reminded by it by others as well. Armenians, the Greeks with their islands next to our borders. The Syrians pestering about Hatay. The world not recognizing legitimate Turkish Cypriot claims.

"If you compare our political parties to political parties in Europe, you'll see that European conservatives are much closer to American liberals than they are to American conservatives. 

Basically, American conservatives are so incredibly extreme, they've dragged the entire political spectrum to the right. Because of that, our only major liberal party can't - and won't - pursue decisive global warming counter measures; as moderate Americans are basically the equivalent of conservative Europeans, so putting extreme counter measures to global warming on the party platform would cost the Democrats 7/10 elections. 

I'm not saying American conservatives are evil. No, the Republican elected officials are the evil ones. Ever since the early 1960's and the beginning of the GOP's Southern Strategy, the Republican party has halted (or slowed to a crawl) all progress on fighting global warming, among many other issues. Because the GOP panders and bows to big businesses (like oil and gas companies), nothing that would have any sort of measurable impact on global warming can be passed as long as Republicans hold a majority in either House or have a Republican President. They've proudly campaigned on an anti-science, anti-reason, anti-logic platform, and they've won. 

But that's not to say Democrats are entirely free from guilt. Although the Democrats aren't the root cause of this issue, they show no backbone in the face of Republican stonewalling. Instead of pursuing extreme countermeasures to global warming in spite of the GOP, the Democrats have put global warming action on the backburner because they're more concerned with winning elections than doing something important.

When I refer to the GOP or the Democrats, I'm not referring to Republican or Democratic voters, nor am I referring to specific elected officials. I'm referring to the establishment for both parties. Of course anti-establishment candidates like Trump aren't any better. He's stated on live TV interviews an over Twitter that climate change is a Chinese hoax... No wonder Europe laughs at us.

A new course offered at Coachella Valley Rep, focusing on the singing actor's skills. A six week course on six Wednesdays starting October 5th at the CVRep campus on 111 in Rancho Mirage. Afternoons 3:00 to 5:30

S I N G I N G F O R A C T O R S
• is a six week course that helps actors develop vocal technique and effective communication through song.

• helps singing actors, through exercises, to increase range, strength, flexibility, clarity of tone, and ease of production.

• focuses on the delivery of repertoire, with an emphasis on healthy vocalism, appropriate style, and awakening the artistic imagination.

In each of six sessions, singing actors...

• are led by the instructor through vocal exercises that help improve vocal function.

• present songs from the music theater repertoire – to live piano accompaniment – and receive one-on-one instruction.

• observe the work of other singing actors in the class as they perform and receive instruction.

T H I S C L A S S I S F O R Y O U!

Been told you haven't got a good voice?
Sing out of tune?
Don't project?
Unhappy with how you sound, and think you're stuck with it?
Come learn the truth. You can change a habit as quickly as you can change your mind. And how we sing is a result of habits. Like any other habits, these can be replaced with better habits. The voice can be moved from dysfunctional to functional – and the result
is a fine, strong, expressive instrument.

Happy with how you sing, but want to work on a certain aspect of your singing? That happens here too!

Voice lessons in the marketplace can run anywhere from $50 an hour to $300 and more! In the safe, supportive environment of Singing For Actors, you receive intensive, personal instruction from a seasoned professional in the field – and for a fraction of the
cost! (30 per class = $180 total)

"You are literally asking why there is a form of progression in the game.

Other games have unlockable things as well that you need to play for. It motivates people to play. It's also not ""limited time only"", you can still get 10 tabs, you just need more seasons to get it because you missed out on the first two seasons. You'll have the maximum 10 tabs after season 10 if you get it every season from now on (including 7).

I think you're overreacting a bit, it's not *that* hard. And if you are only playing the game on a casual enough basis so that it is a hurdle for you, you shouldn't have that many space issues anyway. You're probably keeping a lot of items that aren't worth keeping.

"Hasn't been a better time to be a Celtic fan ! Brendan Rodgers has brought a great air of hope, optimism and excitement back to the club.  
Managers of the past have talked about playing 'the Celtic way' but this is the first time we've seen a Celtic team attack with such verve, creativity, aggression and bravery since the Tommy Burns day.  Funnily enough, who Brendan Rodgers who had great admiration for.   A highlight of this was towards the end of the Man City game, poised at 3-3, Rodgers decided to go for it and bring on two attackers while Man City were replacing strikers with defenders.  
As yer man Bryan says above, past few years have been lacking on the excitement front, with managers like Ronny Deila and Tony Mowbray failing to entertain the fans or deliver good results.  Neil Lennon took us to new heights in Europe, but created a siege mentality which brought a bad atmosphere at times.  Still a Celtic legend though and brought some good times and togetherness when it was needed.  
Also this year, the club became the first ground in the UK to introduce safe standing.  Like stadia in Germany, rail seating was introduced and has brought back the atmosphere to the north curve.  Look out for it in the top right hand corner of televised games.  This is also where the Green Brigade are located.  A much maligned Ultra group who have been the target for politicos looking to make a name for themselves and targeting them with the sectarian brush.

"&gt;British economic policymakers confront big challenges. They have to manage departure from the EU with the minimum damage. They also need to make the UK economy far more dynamic. The latter cannot be achieved if they do not abandon the myth that Britain is already an economic success, albeit one choked by the dead hand of an over-regulated European economy.

&gt;Simon Tilford of the Centre for European Reform provides a far more realistic picture in his Brexit Britain. Measured at purchasing power parity, the rise in the UK’s gross domestic product per head between 2000 and 2015 was smaller than in Germany, Spain and France. Over this period, the UK outperformed only Italy, among the EU’s largest pre-2000 members. In 2015, the UK’s GDP per head was lower relative to the average of the 15 pre-2000 EU members than in 2000: its GDP per head was a mere ninth within this group.

&gt;The UK also has the highest income inequality among these countries. Furthermore, notes Mr Tilford, UK real wages fell by 10 per cent between 2008 and 2014, before a tiny uptick in 2015, while German and French real wages rose. In 2015, only London and the South-East had higher GDP per head than the average of the EU-15 countries. Other UK regions were at or below that average. In all, it is hardly surprising so many UK voters feel left behind, as shown in the EU referendum.

&gt;True, the increase in French real wages has coincided with high unemployment. But that is not true in Germany. UK workers also work longer hours than those in other EU-15 countries. This is presumably to make up for low real wages, themselves largely due to the UK’s poor productivity. According to the Conference Board’s invaluable “total economy database”, the only EU-15 countries to have lower output per hour than the UK are Greece, Italy and Portugal, while the UK’s productivity per hour has stagnated since 2007. Again, of the biggest five EU-15 members only Italy performed worse on this measure. The UK also now runs the largest current account deficit, relative to GDP, in the EU-15.

&gt;The UK, then, has low unemployment. But it also has high inequality, mediocre real incomes, at least by the standards of its European peers, and poor external competitiveness. Above all, recent productivity growth has been truly awful.

&gt;Moreover, such failings, relative to the UK’s EU-15 peers, cannot plausibly be due to the burden of regulation since, as the OECD rightly stated in its pre-referendum report on Brexit, “regulations are low relative to those in other EU member states”. If that made the difference, the UK would be more productive and dynamic than its peers, not less so. Given this, scrapping remaining regulations would not be transformative.

&gt;Some point to free-trading Hong Kong and Singapore as models for the UK, rather than to its European peers. But these two are, first, tiny and second, far from being multi-party democracies. Singapore’s government has had a powerful role in managing the overall development of the economy. Why, above all, should these places be more relevant models for the UK than Germany, the Netherlands or Sweden?

&gt;The implications of a realistic view of the UK economy is that, even without the looming shock of Brexit, the economy suffers from big weaknesses relative to the European economies that many Brexiters despise. Some argue that a real depreciation of sterling is mainly what is needed. If sustained, the post-referendum devaluation should indeed help, though it means a fall in real incomes and wealth. Yet devaluation alone will not cure UK weaknesses.

&gt;The UK has to rectify longstanding supply-side failings. The list includes: low investment, particularly in infrastructure; inadequate basic education of much of the population and the innumeracy of much of its elite; a grossly distorted housing market; over-centralisation of government; and a corporate sector whose leaders are motivated more by the share price than by the long-term health of the business. Not surprisingly, given all this, the UK economy is highly dependent on inward foreign direct investment, which Brexit would seem virtually certain to weaken.

&gt;If the UK is to thrive economically, it will not be enough for it to manage Brexit, hard though that will surely be. Its policymakers must also start from a realistic assessment of the UK’s mediocre performance. This is no world-beating economy. It is not even a Europe-beating economy, except on creating what are too often low-wage jobs. It will have to do far better if it is to deliver the higher living standards its people want in the tougher environment ahead.

Reasons to vote for Hillary instead of Trump:

1- Hillary supports science: renewable energy and the fight against climate change (http://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11548354/hillary-clintons-climate-and-energy-policies-explained).  She supports reform of healthcare; USA spends more than twice as much per capita as other major countries, but gets worse health outcomes.  She supports regulation of big business, the guys who crashed the economy in 2008.

4- Hillary's lies: no doubt she's lied a couple of times about the email thing, as well as the whole email setup being bad judgement.  She lied about the ""sniper fire"" thing.  She's changed her positions on a few issues, voted badly sometimes (such as on Iraq war).  But I think she's going to skate on the email thing, and in 25 years of constant attack and investigation, little has stuck.  I don't think her corporate ties amount to ""corruption"".

8- I don't like Hillary's positions on military/war, pro-Israel, privacy/encryption.  But Trump's positions on those issues are just as bad or worse: torture suspects, kill families of ISIS members, ""Close our Internet up, to fight ISIS terrorist recruitment"", against net neutrality.  He seems a bit pro-Israel (http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.716746).
http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm

9- I do like a couple of Trump's positions (we'll see if he sticks to them).  We need walls and other border enforcement along the Mexican border; laws have to be enforced (but expecting Mexico to pay is lunacy).  Trump says he'll cut the military budget (but maybe just by the mythical ""cutting waste"").  I like his ""we should pull back from being the world's policeman"" (but how does that conform with his plan to destroy ISIS and take the oil from radical states ? http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-massive-ground-force-may-be-needed-to-fight-isis/ and http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-news-donald-trump-announces-his-plan-to-destroy-the-islamic-state-isis/).

10- Trump vows to close down the EPA and the Dept of Education.  That's a recipe for letting corporations pollute as much as they want, letting climate-change get worse and worse, making our already-bad education system worse, and letting religious schools teach science-denial.

11- Trump seems a bit irrational.  Not only is he a ""birther"", but he seems to believe conspiracy theories.

"The confusion in this case stems from the use of the term Konzentrationslager. When we generally envision Concentration Camps, we tend to think of camps like Dachau, Buchenwald and Auschwitz, i.e. camps run by the Inspectorate of the Concentration Camps (IKL) resp. the Economic and Administrative Main Office of the SS (WVHA), being huge structures with SS-guards, a camp Gestapo, a Kapo System, a net of sub-camps etc. And while this is the main definition for Concentration Camps (also, in distinction to death camps) for most people and most historians, the Nazis tended to use the term more liberally.

To use an example form my close area of expertise: In the Serbian town of Šabac, the Wehrmacht ran a camp intended to hold the entire male population of the surrounding area in order to subject them to questioning who was supporting the Partisans. 25.000 people were imprisoned in this camp between September and December 1941. Throughout all its correspondence, the Wehrmacht in Serbia refers to this camp as their concentration camp. However, while living conditions in this camp were appalling and executions frequent, there was no forced labor scheme, no SS-guards (the guards came from a Police Battalion), no Kapo system etc. Basically, it does not fit our popular perception of concentration camps despite the fact that the Wehrmacht is consequently calling it that.

Because the SS had been even before the war so successful in establishing concentration camps as a uniquely National Socialist institution in the minds of the historical actors, among the Nazis the moniker concentration camp can be seen – in the word of Nikolaus Wachsmann – a ""brand"". And not just for the Nazis, also for their prisoners and victims, the term concentration camp came to signify a unique form of Nazi imprisonment. According to the latest research, in between 1933 and 1945 and especially during the war, the Nazis ran 42.000 camps all over Europe. Most of them were not concentration camps in the narrow definition (run by the IKL or the WVHA, forced labor, Kapo Scheme). However, for their prisoners (and some Nazis as obvious from the Wehrmacht example above), that distinction mattered little since they could not ask a guard ""say, is this camp run by the WVHA?"" Thus in many reports as well as official conrrespondence by the Nazis, a lot of camps are called concentration camps that were not like what we have in our heads when we hear the term.

The same holds true for the camp in question here. The camp Gliks was in is the Forced Labor camp for Jews in [Baltoji Voke](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.0&amp;tab=3&amp;page_index=1#result_list), which according to the official registry of Nazi camps is also referred to as [Waka Biala or Belaja Vaka](https://www.bundesarchiv.de/zwangsarbeit/haftstaetten/index.php?action=2.2&amp;id=436) or Weiße Wache. While little more concrete information about the camp itself is available (all I was able to find is that this was essentially two camps, one for women, one for men and that the main forced labor scheme was to dig / cut peat and that it was dissolved in 1943), similar camps were quite common all over Eastern Europe. Run by local authorities, the Wehrmacht or the local Gestapo, the purpose of these camps was – obviously – to exploit Jewish labor before handing the people in question over to the machinery of annihilation. In Lithuania alone, over 25 such camps existed and the prisoners in these camps were by en large Jews who had somehow escaped the Einsatzgruppen shootings directly after the German invasion.

The extermination program of the Germans obviously involved a lot of logistics and its speed as well as other factors were often influenced by economic and other factors. In Lithuania after the Einsatzgruppen had carried out the initial wave of shootings in 1941 after the invasion, still Jews like Gliks, as well as German Jews deported to the Ghetto in Vilinius remained. After this initial wave of mass executions, the Einsatzgruppen moved on to the other Baltic republics, the Russian core territory and Belarus. At the same time, in early 1942 the Nazis' priority in terms of the so-called Final Solution were the Polish territories. The Aktion Reinhard Death Camps as well as the Chelmno Camp in the first months of their operation almost exclusively killed Jews from Poland not just because that was the biggest Jewish population in the Nazi occupied territories but also because the Nazis calculated that getting rid of this Jewish population had priority because it freed the most food stuff which then could be used for the German population. Thus in territories like Vilnius we have this gap in the killing where from the initial wave of Einsatzgruppen, it takes some time until the killing process picks up speed again. In the meantime, the Jews of these territories were put in camps like the above mentioned in forced labor schemes.

Only with the massive expansion in the gas chambers / crematoria in Auschwitz Birkenau in 1943 do the Nazis reach a new killing capacity and while in Vilinius in the meantime, there had been mass executions etc. it is only then that these Jews come into focus of the killing apparatus again. A similar example of such a scheme like that one in Baltoji Voke and elsewhere in Lithuania would be that of the Dienststelle Schmelt. Under the authority of the Sonderbeauftragte des Reichsführers SS für fremdvölkischen Arbeitseinsatz in Oberschlesien (Himmler's Special Envoy for Jewish Forced Labor in Upper-Silesia) Albrecht Schmelt. From 1940 Schmelt operated a huge number of camps in the Upper-Silesia area where Polish jews were used to built the autobahn between Krakow and Berlin. Schmelt employed thousands of Jews while close to them in Auschwitz hundreds of thousands were killed and while Schmelt regularly deported its Jews to Auschwitz to be killed, there were Jews who worked fro Schmelt until 1944 building the Autobahn. Now in 1944, most of the Schmelt Jews were also killed but the idea was similar: While they were available or while the killing capacities were at their limit, Jews could be used for forced labor.

So to sum up: Gliks was in camp that as a Nazi camp can be called a concentration camp but that does not exactly fit what we have in mind when we hear the term. These camps were created to exploit Jews for their labor force while the killing machinery focused on other geographical areas. In 1943 when killing capacities were expanded, these camps were dissolved and their inmates send to the Ghetto to await deportation to a death camp or being executed.

"&gt;""My decision to attack Poland was arrived at last spring. Originally, I feared that the political constellation would compel me to strike simultaneously at England, Russia, France, and Poland. Even this risk would have had to be taken.

&gt;Ever since the autumn of 1938, and because I realized that Japan would not join us unconditionally and that Mussolini is threatened by that nit-wit of a king and the treasonable scoundrel of a crown prince, I decided to go with Stalin.

&gt;In the last analysis, there are only three great statesmen in the world, Stalin, I, and Mussolini. Mussolini is the weakest, for he has been unable to break the power of either the crown or the church. Stalin and I are the only ones who envisage the future and nothing but the future. Accordingly, I shall in a few weeks stretch out my hand to Stalin at the common German-Russian frontier and undertake the redistribution of the world with him.

&gt;Our strength consists in our speed and in our brutality. Genghis Khan led millions of women and children to slaughter -- with premeditation and a happy heart. History sees in him solely the founder of a state. It's a matter of indifference to me what a weak western European civilization will say about me.

&gt;I have issued the command -- and I'll have anybody who utters but one word of criticism executed by a firing squad -- that our war aim does not consist in reaching certain lines, but in the physical destruction of the enemy. Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness -- for the present only in the East -- with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion, men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (Lebensraum) which we need. **Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?**""

"&gt;""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" --Working Definition of Anti-Semitism by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia

http://european-forum-on-antisemitism.org/definition-of-antisemitism/english-english


&gt;Antisemitism is hatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews.

https://cst.org.uk/antisemitism/definitions

&gt;The belief or behavior hostile toward Jews just because they are Jewish. It may take the form of religious teachings that proclaim the inferiority of Jews, for instance, or political efforts to isolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. It may also include prejudiced or stereotyped views about Jews.

&gt;Greece in the EEC was trying to unify with Cyprus, so Turkey invaded.

That's not true, as I understand it that's just what Turkey said to justify their occupation. Either way, the existence of the ECC, let alone the EU, had no bearing on it. Turkey are not in the EU and the person you replied to was talking about war between EU states. Your idea of a counter argument to talk about two countries before the EU existed, one of which isn't even in the EU. If that wasn't enough you start banging on about internal conflicts as if that also was a valid counter point.

Is there better chocolate than Hershey?  Yup.  
The circlejerk that redditors put on when Hersheys chocolates comes up, is ridiculous.  They make it sound like it tastes like vomit (BundleFly approves) and they wouldnt even give that brown sugar bar to their worse enemy.  
Of course the reddit hivemind is responsible for being the de facto standard of everything.  
   • Hershey Chocolate bar tastes good?  
    ° **WRONG!**  
   • Servers, waitress', bartenders should get tips.  
    ° **WRONG**  
   • Big Bang Theory is a great show.  
    ° **WRONG (I DEFINITELY AGREE)**  
   • Steve Buscemi was studying how to melt steel beams at Oxford college, which is older than the Aztec's, because he was a former firefighter in NYC.  Thus he knew 9/11 was an inside job and that info about melting steel beams was needed since he decided to come back to his firehouse and help save Harambe, because #DickLivesMatter.  
    ° **OK, you can have that one**  
  
But I know that 99% of those redditors at one time LOVED Hershey Bars.  But since Europe finally found something they are better at then us, we can't just let that slide.  So we'll take the ~~loophole~~ initiative and show we have better palettes.  After years of eating shit pressed into rectangles-within-rectangles, our taste palettes are far superior than anyone else (not trying to humblebrag, just stating facts)...Now that we went off-topic, can focus and talk about Rampart.

"&gt;The people voted in the conservative party which as part of the representative democracy agreed to a referendum.

Except the tory party didn't stand soley on that issue, didn't actually command the majority of the public vote against all others just the largest vote share

&gt;It is not the governments job to inform the people, it is the job of the people to inform themselves about issues like this. Blaming either campaign for lies is stupid when you should look to the people who believed them.

If its not the governments job to inform the public (never actually said it was and I probably agree its not their job but it is in their interest) and the responsibility falls to the public themselves then you can safely assume that a proportion were uninformed due to constraints outside their control i.e. working all hours to keep their head above water, lack of access to unbiased materials, fear of expressing a viewpoint that would be seen as socially unacceptable in their surrounds. 

&gt;So in essence you want to deny both direct democracy and representative democracy. I guess what you really want is a oligarchy where only the intelligentsia and elite make decisions for us because we are all too stupid. In your opinion.

Didn't deny either, I just pointed to some of the flaws, if we opt for a direct democracy we may as well say whats the point in having elected representatives, if we keep to a representative democracy then parliament shouldn't pass the buck on a tough decision, parliament needs to remember its elected to represent our interests and our concerns not our views. We now in a situation parliament well more specifically the government is opting to ignore and failing to represent 48% of the electorate even if the entire electorate was accurately informed and it still went 52-48 then parliament still needs to represent the interests of all of us to not do so smacks of mp's with self interests at the priority, think about it there has been very few mp's that have spoken of the interests of the 48, the government is basically acquiescing to the brexiteers viewpoint of hard brexit. I wouldn't be surprised to which ever way this turns out the tory party is going to find itself kicked into the long grass for another decade or more or even possible have a split along the Eurosceptic lines, the irony been cameron gave the referendum to bring about an end to infighting over the EU issue in the party and in turn apart from not getting the result he wanted he may have sounded the death knell of the tory party as is.

Edit: Quickly jumping back to the issue of an informed electorate, it was shown in the media multiple times throughout the campaign people actually asking for more information more facts so people were actively trying to educate themselves on the issues but those responsible for publishing their plans, intentions how they would handle things (government/ both campaigns) but they didn't because they didn't really have any plans, so the electorate can't inform themselves if the information isn't available.",t1_d89f7vr,,0,1475318637,,d89fr2s,Toxen-Fire,,0,7,1478233490,1475318289,False,t3_55c35d,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb

"I am not dissing you manager either, in fact I have the greatest respect and admiration for what Wenger achieved 10-15 years ago. And being my brother a huge Arsenal supporter, I kind of consider Arsenal like my second favourite team in England (I've been at Emirates too!). In recent years, with Liverpool often left outside European competitions, I even cheered Arsenal in the Champions League!

All I'm saying about Wenger is that lately he's been enjoying too much trust from the fans, because he's always there, doing his thing, true to his ideals, and Arsenal results didn't change a bit. 

From the outside I think that a new manager, younger, with new perspective, new attitude, new stimulus to achieve things that Wenger already achieved many years ago (do you really expect a new generation of ""invincibles"" out of him?), would do much better even without buying any new players.

"**Porcupine Tree**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/15cc734fb0e045e3baac02674d2092d6.png)  

&gt; Porcupine Tree is a British rock band formed in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom in 1987. During the course of the band's history, it has at times incorporated psychedelic rock, alternative, ambient, electronic, and, most recently, metal and post-rock into its unique style of progressive rock.

&gt; Porcupine Tree started out as a ""fake"" band, the only real member being multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson. Wilson's first two releases, Tarquin's Seaweed Farm (1989) and The Nostalgia Factory (1990), were both released on cassette tapes. In addition to the band's trademark psychedelic sound, these two tapes also contained heavy ambient and pop influences. Wilson's favorite tracks were then compiled into the CD On the Sunday of Life... (1991), while the more ambient-leaning tracks were also collected in Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994). The first of these two featured many new versions of songs.

&gt; Wilson then went on to release Voyage 34 (1992) and Up the Downstair (1993), which refined the sound of the previous albums and removed the pop influences. Both of these were later re-released, the first as Voyage 34: The Complete Trip (2000), which included an extra two remixes (a total of four), while Up the Downstair was remastered at 2005 with real drums added in place of the drum-machine beats.

&gt; The Sky Moves Sideways (1995), often considered the band's best album by long-time fans, largely uses the spacey nature of previous albums. By the time of Signify (1996) Wilson had a full band at his disposal: Chris Maitland (drums), Colin Edwin (bass), and Richard Barbieri, formerly of Japan, on keyboards.

&gt; The band's next two albums, Stupid Dream (1999) and Lightbulb Sun (2000), saw them take on a more alternative rock-oriented sound, while still drawing influence from as far back as Up the Downstair. During this period, the band garnered increasing recognition, both in their home country and abroad. Finally, they were signed to Lava Records (a major American record label) in time for the release of In Absentia, with Gavin Harrison replacing Chris Maitland on drums. This album shows high metal influences, due in part to Wilson's work with Opeth on their album Blackwater Park. The band continued this sound for their 2005 release, Deadwing, which has the heaviest and most noticable metal influences. 

&gt; In April 2007, the band released their album Fear of a Blank Planet. an album clearly influenced by the post-rock genre, but also sees them expanding the metal side of their music, yet still remaining true to older facets of the band's sound.

&gt; In April, 2007, the band embarked on a six-month world tour in support of Fear of a Blank Planet, one that included Europe, the U.S., Japan, and Australia. The new album was featured, and the show featured the films and projections by the band’s long-time visualist Lasse Hoile.

&gt; Fear of a Blank Planet  is already the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful album of the band's career, charting high in most countries (even giving the band their first top-forty album in their home country). Porcupine Tree spent most of 2007 on tour promoting the album, and a new EP Nil Recurring containing material left over from the album-writing sessions was released on the band's own label Transmission in September.

&gt; The band started recording their tenth studio album— The Incident.—in February 2009. This was confirmed by the band, posting this message on their official website: ""Writing for the next PT studio record is well underway, with the band recently spending two weeks scheduled in the English countryside working on new tracks. Recording of these pieces and a new 35 minute SW song cycle were due to start in February..."" A tour was announced on the band's website and MySpace, along with dates, following release of the new album. Around March and April, Wilson commented the 35-minute song kept evolving and now it has become a 55-minute song, occupying the entire disc.

&gt; On 20 May 2010, Porcupine Tree released their second live concert film on DVD and Blu-Ray titled  Anesthetize, it was recorded live on 15 and 16 October 2008 in the Netherlands at the 013 Tilburg venue.
On 17 June, the band announced on their website that a new live album titled Atlanta, recorded during the tour of Fear Of A Blank Planet at the Roxy theatre, Atlanta, on 29 October 2007, would be released in a near future. This album was released via online distribution only, without any class of physical format; all the sale proceeds were donated to Mick Karn for his treatment against cancer.

"Politics in the United States has it moments, but you have to understand it's very polarizing. People love to argue about it. There's plenty of other countries have the same attitudes about freedom though. Generally new freedoms take a while before they are widely accepted here because we aren't centralized and states have a lot of power so usually you will see a few states take the initiative. Massachusetts legalized same sex marriage in 2003 which was one of the first places in the world that recognize it. It took a while before other states accepted it and even longer for it to be finally legal throughout the land. I have to say it's great we can have 50 different democratic experiments going on at once and I think that's where we are more unique than most places.

Marijuana is another, more states are now legalizing it even though federally it's still illegal which creates a lot of challenges for banking.

"&gt;Okay, but I do that too; I love playing girls in games, actually I usually pick them, and I generally like games in which you're a girl.

It's certainly a thing some guys do. But did you identify with them? Because looking back it's pretty obvious IMO. Literally all of my favorite characters were female, I'd identify with them, etc. But yea, it's certainly not something that necessarily makes someone trans. And I didn't mean to imply that.

&gt;(I don't expect you to know them since they're pretty obscure).

Well, you're right. I don't recognize them. Glad to see someone else with obscure/niche interests.

&gt;So you mean, you at first doubted it, right? Like, it can't be right. But now you know for sure, I guess. 

No? As I said, I never doubted that I wanted to be a girl. I *did* have some issues with connecting ""I want to be a girl"" with ""that makes me trans"". And I still feel a bit weird about explicitly saying ""I'm a girl."" Not because I don't want to be one. But simply because I still recognize my body as masculine and having male parts. There was never a moment that I said ""you know what, maybe I don't want to be a girl.""

&gt;What do you mean? A lot of things I'm seeing here are literally off the rails. 

Well the trans stuff is the most obvious. There's also stuff like otherkin, which if you remove the ""I am"" and change it to ""I like"" it makes a lot more sense. Or stuff like the feminism movement where the original goal was equality for women, and the tumblr version is 'hate men'.

&gt;Uhm, well, sorry, maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but if, as a guy, you've ever sucked dick, or let a guy suck your dick, you're NOT straight. Period.

I guess we'll just agree to disagree.

&gt;I have googled and taken this ""Kinsey scale"" test, and the result was: 

There's not a test. If you took one, it's some weird bullshit. It's essentially just a thing of saying ""some people aren't completely straight/gay"".

&gt; She's a pretty girl, but still has the voice registers of her 'old life', if I may call it that without sounding bigoted. 

I just picked a random vid. Some of hers she has a better voice, others her voice is worse. But hopefully you get the point. And yea, sometimes a person's voice isn't perfect. It's pretty damn hard. Have you ever tried it?

&gt;Being European, I have no freaking idea what 6'6"" means (and I'm too lazy and drunk to look it up)

Oh, yea that's an american thing. I don't know what you use, but that'd be ~198cm. Whereas my height is something like ~168cm.

&gt;Oh, it sounds like you have some hurdles to come over. Seriously. But I'm sure you'll make it. Don't worry about your chin!

Well it's not even that. The dysphoria around it and whether it passes are two different things entirely. There are girls who pass completely and are indistinguishable from a cis (non-trans) girl but still get dysphoria over their looks. As I said, mine varies a bit from day to day. Some days I don't have any issues, other days I have a lot.

&gt;Most guys think she's hot. But she doesn't have a pointy chin. I'm just trying to put the relativety in here. 

;) That's nice of you. I'm fairly confident I won't have issues in the future. I've always been fairly physically feminine. And hormones are pretty crazy.

&gt;I'm afraid that I'll just get nasty if I get into this, so I'll pass for now. 

That's fine. Hopefully it's clear where I'm coming from. I generally just try to live and let live, and hope that people extend that same courtesy.

&gt;I wish you the best, I really do.

What? What kind of response is that? You say I don't know what I am talking about yet make no effort to tell me why I don't know, or tell me what i am wrong about. Why is this sub/website full of so many fucking idiots. It's not hard if you disagree to actually respond and tell me why I am wrong but nobody on this site can do that.

You haven't even disputed a single one of my points either. You've said Arsenal have changed since 2007, yeah they have but they still have shown nothing to suggest they will ever have success under Wenger. If you disagree then tell me what suggests that Arsenal will have success under Wenger. Otherwise this comment is a dead end. 
 
Lets look at the 3 seasons. The last 3 years don't suggest Arsenal will win the league, Arsenal underperformed last season, should have won the league but let Leicester win it.

 3 years ago was even worse, how does the 2013-14 season suggest Arsenal can win the league under Wenger, it suggests the opposite. You were top of the league for the most time that season yet finished 4th. City, Liverpool and Chelsea finished above you, Everton just below you. Every single one of those 4 teams that finished around Arsenal that season thrashed Arsenal. 6-3 against City, 6-0 against Chelsea, 5-1 against Liverpool, 3-0 against Everton. You can not win the league if you are top of the league for so long and then lose by 3 or more goals to City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Everton. Not to mention managing to lose twice to Moyes United. If you've even bothered to read this comment this is what pisses me off about your comment, you said the last three seasons which includes 13-14 suggest that you've been up there and could win the league under Wenger. You bottled it that season. From top to 4th and lost to all the big teams. How the fuck can you argue that as a positive and then get upvotes whilst I get downvoted. So that leaves the 14-15 season, you finished 3rd, well done! How does that suggest you can win the league under Wenger.

I know for a fact you haven't even read this comment, this comment will be downvoted, you can respond saying I don't know what I'm talking about without telling me what and or why I am wrong and you will get upvoted. That's how arguments go on this site. But the fact is you don't know what you're talking about when you use a season where you bottled it and finished 4th, losing to every good team, and a season where Leicester won the league to suggest Arsenal can win the league again.

I stand by my comment, there has been nothing to suggest that Arsenal can win the league under Wenger or have European success under Wenger.

"Sounds cool, thanks for the recommendation! For anyone wondering, here's a review of the book from Amazon:

This is two really wonderful books and one less wonderful book all wrapped into one.

The first book, which is terrific, is a brisk and accessible tour through a series of real-life experiments deeply grounded in data: ""A study of corruption in Indonesia found that the stock prices of companies whose leaders stood closest to that country's dictator in photographs suffered most when the leader fell ill.""

More: ""When American cities have built new rapid-transit stops over the last thirty years, poverty rates have generally increased near those stops."" It's not that transit stops cause poverty, he explains; rather, poor people value being able to get to work without the expense of owning a car.

That insight, like many of those mentioned by Professor Glaeser, bears on the main topic of his book, the economics of cities. The author proves useful as a guide to the research of others as well as in conveying his own thoughts. ""Nathaniel Baum-Snow, a Brown University economist, has calculated that each new highway passing through a central city reduces its population by about 18 percent."" And, ""Dartmouth economist Bruce Sacerdote found that children displaced from New Orleans by Katrina had a significant improvement in their test scores. He found the biggest beneficiaries of the exodus were children from poorly performing schools who left the New Orleans area altogether."" It's the counterintuitive nature of these insights that makes them particularly delicious -- that expensive highway project that the local congressman fought to get funded turns out to be bad for his city, and Hurricane Katrina turns out to have been a good thing for the education of its ""victims.""

The second excellent book within Triumph of a City documents the way that regulations prevent cities from accommodating the needs of people. ""Too much preservation stops cities from providing newer, taller, better buildings for their inhabitants,"" he writes.

Historic preservation laws are just one part of a set of barriers to building that also includes zoning, environmental laws, and government approval processes. ""Over the past forty years, we've experienced a little-remarked revolution in property rights in America,"" Professor Glaeser writes. ""We have gone from a system wherein people could essentially do what they wanted with their own property to a system wherein neighbors have enormous power to restrict growth and change.""

The strength of the first two books makes the weakness of the third book contained within Triumph of the City all the more disappointing. This third book-within-a-book consists of a series of left-wing assumptions.

The problems of cities, Professor Glaeser insists, won't be solved by ""mindlessly relying on the free market."" In fact, he says, ""there's no free-market solution for the great urban problem facing slums....Cities desperately need forceful, capable governments to provide clean water."" He doesn't mention that here in America, private water systems produce 4.6 billion gallons of water a day, or about 1.7 trillion gallons per year. Or that the private drinking water business is a $4.3 billion per year business, with at least 12 publicly traded companies among the players (more if you count bottled water).

Professor Glaeser has a strange crush on the French school system. ""If America imitated the best aspect of European socialism and invested enough in public schools so that they were all good, then there would be little reason for the rich to leave cities to get better schooling,"" he writes. Later, he repeats, ""If the United States emulated France and embraced nationwide quality schooling funded by the state, there would be less reason to flee urban areas.""

In fact the 2009 results from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program for International Student Assessment, which studies 15-year-olds, found that America outperformed France in reading and science. France did better than America in math, but is that a reason for America to emulate or embrace an educational system that in two of three categories measured produced worse results than ours? The latest UNESCO statistics also show that the United States outspent France on primary education, as measured by annual public expenditure per primary student as a percentage of GDP per capita.

The sections devoted to global warming veer into self-righteousness. ""Anyone who believes that global warming is a real danger should see dense urban living as part of the solution....The polar ice caps appear to be melting quickly and threatening seaside cities from New York to Hong Kong with the prospect of severe flooding,"" he writes. ""For the sake of humanity and our planet, cities are -- and must be -- the wave of the future.""

It's not just cities that Professor Glaeser has in mind for his project of saving ""humanity and our planet"" but also taxes. ""Current U.S. gas taxes are too low,"" he insists. ""Throughout the world, we can adopt a global emissions tax that charges people for the damage done by their carbon emissions. The actual size of the tax needs to be worked out by the experts....""

Toward the end of the book, he writes, in arguing for more stimulus spending to be directed at cities: ""The five least dense states managed to sit out the recession with an average unemployment rate of 6.4 percent, as of December 2009."" For a book whose whole argument is ""the power of proximity"" in cities to create wealth, jobs, and growth, that's a fact that undercuts the author's argument, and one wishes Professor Glaeser would at least try to explain it. He does not.

Professor Glaeser is also not always as clear as one would wish in terms of his definition of a city. Is it the whole metropolitan statistical area, or just what lies within the municipal boundaries? Sometimes cities and suburbs have similar characteristics in terms of density, they just lie on opposite sides of political boundaries. If cities make us ""richer, smarter, greener, healthier, and happier,"" as the book's subtitle claims, would just expanding some political boundaries help? Or is density all that is required, and, if so, why aren't dense suburbs just as good as cities?

Professor Glaeser himself, who grew up in Manhattan, moved his family to the suburbs of Boston, a decision about which in the book he expresses a certain amount of ambivalence and, perhaps even guilt. He seems to want an increased gas tax and a lower home mortgage tax deduction to make it more cost-sensible for him to live in the city, but those may strike Americans who don't share Mr. Glaeser's taste for cities as high prices to impose.",t1_d89fuew,,0,False,,d89i449,Laphroaig18Lover,,0,-1,1478234658,1475326193,False,t3_55blsw,financialindependence,t5_2t34z

"For decades no one really cared about the full face Islamic veil in most of the western world.

Full faced veil is used as part of their cultural appropriation and not allow Muslims to integrate into western society.

While banning full face veil feels good, unless there is an effort to stop the salafist and wahabist preachers and mosques  there will be social problems like religiously fractured society, alienated youth, and domestic terrorism.

"First of all I'm not even American. Second, going to jail for voting for someone would be repressive and be preventing political freedoms would it not? Hm that's ironic considering the topic of our conversation.

Just to add

&gt;""In the 16th – 18th century, Africans enslaved 1.5 million White Europeans in the Barbary Slave Trade. African Muslims raided up the coastlines of Europe, particularly the British Isles but even as far as Iceland, kidnapping and enslaving White European Christians.""

-Source ( https://violenceagainstwhites.wordpress.com/white-slaves/ ) and for further reading https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade, as well as the History of Slavery. ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery ). 

To quote the above, ""The history of slavery spans nearly every culture, nationality, and religion and from ancient times to the present day.""

As well as, ""Slavery was known in civilizations as old as Sumer, as well as almost every other ancient civilization. The Byzantine–Ottoman wars and the Ottoman wars in Europe resulted in the taking of large numbers of Christian slaves.""

""Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC), which refers to it as an established institution"". 

So we know slavery existed from at least 1760 BC, yet ""slavery became common within the British Isles during the Middle Ages."" Wow, that's only a couple thousand years.

Oh so believe it or not, America isn't the only place that had slaves. Oh and even though slavery is illegal worldwide now, human trafficking still exists. And guess where human trafficking occurs? Africa and other developing regions, and that's not by outsiders, that's Africans trafficking other Africans.

Hm, so, I suppose that would mean it's not white males who are to blame for slavery, but perhaps that's just a shitty aspect of human nature. But how come the West don't practice it anymore? Because it's about the society and culture in which people live, and includes so many more factors than white men being to blame.",t1_d89i9dc,,0,1475327999,,d89ieyl,AloeVera3ply,,0,2,1478234807,1475326969,False,t3_55acxj,spirituality,t5_2qhc5

"UK to lay claim to array of Brussels cellars, art and property as part of split

Britain is planning to claim a share of the EU’s 42,000-bottle cellar of wine, cognac and other spirits, its art collection and its €8.7bn property portfolio as the government gears up to haggle over Brexit with Brussels.

As in any divorce, untangling EU-UK financial affairs is expected to be one of the most difficult part of the negotiations. Any exit deal must settle complex liabilities including the UK share of guarantees on €60bn of Eurocrat pensions and almost €20bn of European Investment Bank loans.

As it seeks to minimise any financial hit, Britain is eyeing the other side of the EU’s balance sheet, which includes assets ranging from land and office space to dozens of space satellites, the European Parliament’s art collection, the wine and spirits stock — and Margaret Thatcher’s old Conservative party citadel in Westminster.

“Of course we will go for the assets,” said one British official involved in preparations.

The ratio for divvying up the value of assets with Britain is likely to be highly contentious. But on the basis that Britain makes around an eighth of net EU budget contributions, its claim would cover roughly 5,000 bottles of wine, 250 bottles of spirits, €2.25m worth of art from the European Parliament’s collection, and around €10m from the book value of the European Court of Justice building.

Much of the financial detail of the divorce deal will be handled by Michel Barnier, the former French foreign minister who officially takes up his post as the commission’s chief Brexit negotiator on Saturday, some 100 days after the EU referendum.

The EU’s consolidated accounts from 2015 show property and equipment of €8.7bn, valued at the price paid when the buildings were purchased, mostly in the 1980s and 1990s. Britain would be expected to press for a survey to find the current market value on the assets. 

Among these assets are more than 1.6m square metres of office space in Brussels alone, covering the European Parliament’s main buildings, the new “Europa” summit building for European leaders, and some 60 Commission buildings. This includes the Berlaymont headquarters, which the commission leases but presents as an asset in accounts because it can exercise an option to buy the building from Belgium for €1 in 2031.

Most tantalising for Brexiters may be the potential to reclaim 32 Smith Square, the former home of Conservative Central Office and backdrop to three Thatcher election victories. Bought for £26m and renovated in 2010, the Westminster property was rebranded “Europe House” and serves as a base for the commission and European Parliament in Britain.

Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who as an MEP still has use of an office in the building, said Britain should take back the landmark. “I think they should make it a monument to Mrs Thatcher and to Brexit, Mr Farage said. “They should turn it into a museum.”

Along with extensive properties in Luxembourg and Strasbourg, the EU maintains a network of agencies, delegations and offices around Europe, with prized buildings such as its Paris representation on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

As the EU has expanded its presence around the world, it has built a network of more than 300 properties in 138 countries. A fifth are owned by the bloc, with EU properties as far afield as Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.",t1_d89hpo8,SVAK,0,False,,d89ijdq,grumbal,Slovenská Džamahírija,0,6,1478234868,1475327275,False,t3_55cojn,europe,t5_2qh4j

&gt; When an American home improvement TV show visits a remote Eastern European village, the young crew thinks the lack of mocha lattés and free wifi will be the worst of their problems. But after their filming interrupts the superstitious villagers' private religious ritual, the situation takes a turn for the homicidal... and when the blood starts flowing, that's when things get really weird. With THEY'RE WATCHING, noted graphic novelists and animators Micah Wright and Jay Lender turn a classic horror premise upside down to create a fresh, funny, eye-popping twist on the genre.

"EU - Alliance (Nordrassil) - Sanctus. 4/7 HC

Are you looking for a guild that you want to be in, not one you feel you have to be? A guild that you can call home, where the people are not only willing to help, but are happy to. Who you’ll not only view as guild mates, but as friends. Then you’ve come to the right place!

We are currently looking for friendly, mature, and eager members to raid against the Legion. With the new built-in Flexible system, we will of course be exceeding the previous limit of 10, and hopefully in the near future, have over 25 committed raiders.
To qualify for our Core raider spot, you must raid a minimum of 2/4 raids a week, and meet the expectations of a raider. I.e. bring your own flasks and food and be there on time. The ability to move from Fire is a must.

Sanctus was formed in May in the year 2005.

We are an adult guild with a minimum age requirement of 18, with exceptions made for exceptional applicants.

We are focused on progression, while being well aware that this is still a game and that most of us already have jobs and families to tend to.

We raid 4 times a week from 20:30 to 23:30 server time. We use Mumble for raids and it is available for any guild member to use at any time. We are a funny, friendly and diverse bunch who see Sanctus as a family and have a stellar history of welcoming back previous members looking for that one place in the game they truly did call home.

We are currently looking for Range DPS (Preferably a Shadow Priest and Boomkin) to add to our 32 man strong raiding team, but exceptional melee applicants will be considered, more details can be found on our website. So if we sound like the right place for you, please apply via www.sanctus.eu

For any question, feel free to contact any of our officers in game (Ciel, Sendahl, Nephelle, Tadkir, Chippy, Galadius and Thesk) who will be more than happy to speak to you.

We look forward to meeting you!",t3_55crsz,alliance-warlock,0,False,,d89jpqp,Theskian,,0,1,1478235447,1475329962,False,t3_55crsz,wow,t5_2qio8

"Resource scarcity is not the only ramification of over population and those are the ramifications I specified On purpose. With how much western governments subsidize food production food shortages are not really an issue unless a nation intentionally creates food shortages by protecting it's own food producers.  And that's what central American nations do, not the middle east. The Arab Spring wasn't a simple series of bread riots. It was a massive uprising fueled by anger towards old orders proped up by weak systems of nepotism that were unable and unwilling to pacify the enormous glut of young people.  Trow Facebook and Twitter into that powder keg and you get that Arab spring and people's heads start getting chopped off.   These people had no social or political standing because those orders didn't have room for them and because those orders would lose their power by enfranchising them.  Take a look at the history of the renaissance.  What preceeded it?  An enormous chunk of Europe's population croaked from the plague.  A huge amount of wealth and land was freed up.  Labor became scarce enough that old feudal rules and serfdom evaporated.  The fact is that larger populations are harder to placate and Keep in order.

Yes, we did, we offered material, financial, and moral support to the anti-Russia demonstrators, Ukraine flipping is our fault. And we did take them under our wing because right after they flipped they were started signing economic agreements with the EU. Now tell me, if we didn't really want it then why would we do that? 

&gt;Excuse me? You just said none of it matters in your previous post.

It doesn't matter, but my argument was that it was negated by those countries being in our sphere of influence, **NOT** by other similar crimes by other countries. In other words if Russia tried setting up shop in like Colombia or Brazil then we wouldn't care what we have done to those countries, we would flip our shit, just like Russia flipped shit over Ukraine. That's my whole argument, stop straw manning me into a fallacy that I didn't commit.

"&gt;Of course it's like that, children are not autonomous beings. Start poking that bear and all of a sudden you have pedophiles managing to justify their abuse by claiming the child made it's own choice in the matter.

I didn't say it wasn't like that?  I was just explaining their point!

&gt;I'm gonna make this easy for you to follow. Are those affected by murder the dead one or those still living?

I'll answer your question with another question - if you murder someone - someone who no one else cares about, say a homeless person who no one knows - is that unethical or not?  Should someone who does that get let off murder?

I think we view murder as a crime against the victim.  When children are killed we mourn the life they could have lead.  People talk about how ""they had a bright future"" and so on.  Of course the families are the ones who live with it, but you should be pushing for way more radical legislation than abortion if you think murder is only a crime against the family and friends - as I said, what about killing unwanted adults?  Hey it could even be kids - we could really lighten the load on the foster system by mass slaughtering all the unwanted children.  Why is it different once people are born?  What changes with your reasoning?

&gt;Letting an affected part decide upon the ifs and buts of anything is not a good idea and it only leads to ""Head for and eye, hand for a tooth"" situation of escalating retaliation.

As I said, as voters as potential parents not impartial.  Many parents would rather their child just.. went away.  That's why many abort.

&gt;Do you even know what neutral means? Please explain to me the reasoning behind why a neutral party all would turn to abortion if they could because out here in the real world where I live only those in need of abortion would have one.

I'm saying it's in the interest of everyone with representation to make it easier to kill their unwanted children, because they can have more control over their lives.  The only people who face downsides are the victims, the babies, who are killed.  The nearest thing to a neutral party might be the infertile?  All I'm saying is we have a vested interest, and so we are obliged to be responsible when making decisions on behalf of those who actually are affected by it - i.e. those who actually might die.

&gt;Don't act stupid, a pregnant woman wanting an abortion and the people around her trying to influence her decision have nothing to do with any baby.

I wasn't acting stupid, I'm just not remotely in the same headspace as you.  What about the baby inside the woman?  Are you being stupid here?

&gt;To hide behind words like selflessness when wanting others to conform to your conviction is something an egoistic coward does.

Have you really forgotten that this is all about a baby?

&gt;-Somebody think of the children! is in this context not really about the children but about the person noticing their powerlessness in their control of others and the need to make those around to have the same opinion.

It's bizarre that you are refusing to consider that valuing human life is anything to do with pro-life vs pro-choice.  Do you treat other political issues this way?  It's such a non-argument:

E.g. ""I don't think we should fight in iraq"" ""*You don't care about iraq, just about people sharing your opinion*"" or ""I think the UK should remain in the EU"" ""*You don't care about the Eu, just about people sharing your opinion*"" or ""I think that we should let in the refugees"" ""*You don't care about refugees, just about people sharing your opinion*""

Even if you want to assume everyone who disagrees with you does so in bad faith, then you should at least engage with their arguments.  You're just attacking me and my motives for arguing.  Even with that I've not given you any reason to draw the conclusions I have.

Then why did they do it? I know why they did it, because after decades of the west encroaching on their turf they decided to push back to see what they could get away with, because they were rapidly running out of things to lose.

&gt;But it's naive to think that if we just act friendly to the Russian government, suddenly they will be fair and equal

I never said that, but we won't know until we try, but the thing is we have been antagonizing them since '91, all Im saying is if we stopped seeing them as people who want to take over the world and actually gave them some space to breathe then maybe, just maybe they would be much more friendly towards the west. The idea that we have been treating them fairly and they are out of line is the most western-centric thing imaginable and it straight up ignores the perspective of the other side, and if we continue to do that then it will ultimately lead towards destruction.

&gt; * The EU competition enforcer in its charge sheet, known as a statement of objections, said it planned to tell the U.S. technology giant to halt payments or discounts to mobile phone manufacturers in return for pre-installing Google's Play Store with Google Search.

&gt; * Google could face a large fine because the anti-competitive practices, which started from January 2011, are still ongoing, the document said.

&gt; * Separately, the Commission is investigating whether Google favors its own shopping service over those of rivals, and could also fine it in that case.

&gt; * The document, close to 150 pages, was heavily edited, with large sections of confidential information redacted by Google.

"I love Toronto - it's one of my favourite cities in the world.

It depends on your interests. Toronto's got a nice wide variety of things you can do.

For museums there's: 

* Art Gallery of Ontario. In my opinion, nothing short of spectacular both in terms of Frank Gehry architecture and display - love hanging out in their massive [galleria italia](http://www.loulou.to/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/frank-gehry-galleria-italia.jpg). They have some European masters on the first floor (Caravaggio's Massacre of Innocents, a Rodin, two Bernini, some Monet, Waterhouse, etc). The Canadian hang on the second floor is also quality work.

* Royal Ontario Museum. Special exhibit is presently Chihuly, a spectacular glass artist from Seattle. It's incredibly beautiful. Well worth a trip. Other highlights include the dinosaur gallery, gems, and the ancient greek/roman section. 

* Casa Loma - if you're into weird urban castles and eccentric millionaires it's a pretty cool spot to hang out. It's got spectacular view of the city. Was used in the filming of the original XMen movie.

* Aga Khan Museum - one of the city's newest museums, the AKM is dedicated to Islamic art. It is truly spectacular.

* Bata Shoe Museum - architecturally shaped like a shoe box, the Bata is actually a lot of fun. They've got smugglers trick shoes, astronaut boots, foot-binds and ancient greek sandals on the first floor. Right now their temporary exhibit is Fashion Victims which could be fun.

* Other museums in the GTA area include the Hockey Hall of Fame (hockey), Gardener (ceramics), the Textile Museum (obviously textiles), MOCCA (Contemporary Art), the Powerplant (also contemporary art?), Spadina House (historic home), and a few others I'm forgetting.

For neighbourhoods to check out there's

* Kensington Market - a funky little enclave in the heart of the city filled with bohemian-esque thrift stores, cafes, bars and graffiti art. Conveniently super close to Chinatown which is also a fun place to spend a little time. Tons of great bakeries and great food.

* Similarly Queen Street West has some funky shopping and tons of amazing back-alley graffiti.

* The Annex also has a lot of great little bars, shops and restaurants. I also love wandering through the Annex/Christie Pitts looking at the houses. It's adjacent to the University of Toronto. Which is gorgeous. If you want to check out where Mean Girls and Good Will Hunting were filmed, check it. It's ridiculously beautiful. Except for Robarts, the post-apocalyptic chicken-shaped library.

* Brewery District - home to Mill Street's brewery. It's decorated with a ton of public art. I think they have markets there somethings. There's a Balzac's coffee as well. A fun place to get a bite and hang around outside.

Other:

* Steamwhistle and Mill Street Brewery both do cheap brewery tours. They're a lot of fun.

* Toronto Island can be incredibly beautiful. Not sure what the weather's like in T.O. right now but if the leaves are turning that would be an amazing day. There's gorgeous beaches to walk along, gardens, and specatcular views of the city. I think you can rent Bixi bikes and take them across on the ferry for a quicker trip.

* Toronto Zoo's out in the burbs. But it's got Pandas right now. So that could be worth it if you're into that.

* Aquarium. Never been but I hear it's grand.

* If you're feeling touristy, you can take a ride up to the top of the CN tower on a clear day for some views of the city. If you're feeling flush you can also pay to do the [Edgewalk](http://css1.www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/headers/newEdgeWalk2.jpg).

* Take in a Blue Jays game. If you can. They're fun. I'm not a baseball person but we got cheap nosebleed tickets and ate beer and hot dogs and it was a blast.

There's obviously lots more too - Hockey Season is back on if you feel like paying a ton of money to see a sucky team get wiped off the map. CFL might have started. The big all-night art festival is, perhaps, tonight? Nuit Blanche? It's a bit of a shit show, honestly, but some people love it. Not sure what the Ballet/Opera are up to but I've been to one of each and found they were pretty quality.

There's lots of amazing food in Toronto but if I had to recommend anything I'd say hit up Pai for the braised beef Khao Soi. I go every time I'm back in the 6.

"You know a lot of historians actually doubt Ghengis Khan killed anywhere near the amount of people he is suspected of killing (40 million). It's important to note that the mongols simply did not have the manpower to slaughter that many people. What most people agree on was that they did however rapidly burn down crops in a very efficient manner, causing famine. Not only that but their rapid global movement spread disease from different parts of the world. The initial Chinese invasion by mongols did not depopulate china, it was when diseases were brought from the conquest in east Europe that caused China's population to decreased so rapidly. 

That's not to say the Mongols weren't horrifically brutal, but the death toll from them directly likely doesn't go past 5-6 million. 

Even so that puts them as the deadliest group of all time up to that point, but nowhere near hitler (50 million), Stalin (25 million, King Leopold (10 million), or Mao (30 million). ",t1_d89ckdb,,0,False,,d89kqmf,willmaster123,,0,1,1478235952,1475332073,False,t3_55bu2h,worldnews,t5_2qh13

"The third paragraph is the one that really answers the question and it contains no technical jargon.

The question wasn't ""What's the difference between a hard and soft R?"" it was essentially ""Why doesn't English have a sound found in distantly related or unrelated languages?"" That's clearly a flawed question based on the assumption that all these languages *should* have the sound, which is baseless. That's why the answer boils down to the rather simple ""Languages are different from one another."" The rest of that post is basically bonus info not directly related to OP's question.

ETA: So I may have been a little presumptuous myself to say that the question was *clearly* flawed, so I figure I'll use this space near the top to explain why I felt that way:

The relationships among languages have more in common with biology than chemistry: it's about constant, branching evolution rather than discrete categories and predictable interactions. But languages don't even have the guiding force of natural selection and are instead subject to the whims of human beings. 

Of the languages that OP mentioned all but Japanese are in what's called the Indo-European family. Despite strong vocabulary influences from French after the Norman Invasion and conscious efforts at Latinization, English is on the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family owing to its underlying grammar. 

Grammar is conserved in languages more strongly than the sounds, and that's why it shouldn't be surprising to OP that even related languages (never mind the rather distant ones they cited) can have very different sounds. There are all sorts of reasons why it happens (repeated mistakes, isolated populations, neighborly influences, drifts between related types of sounds, or even human will or simple human capriciousness) but the relatively sudden  appearance or disappearance of sounds in a language is quite common.",t1_d89jfbb,,0,1475346602,,d89kwer,DoofusMagnus,,0,149,1478236032,1475332385,False,t3_55csc4,explainlikeimfive,t5_2sokd

"Pour plein de raisons. Dans le travail à la chaîne, les employés sont interchangeables et le recrutement ne pose pas de problème puisqu'il y a beaucoup plus d'employés potentiels que de place dans le contexte du chômage. Mais ce n'est pas le cas dans tous les domaines.

Dans certains domaines, il est difficile de recruter. Par exemple, les profs n'ont pas eu la réforme des 35 heures. Si demain on tentait de passer leurs horaires à 16 heures par semaine au lieu de 18 heures avec souvent des heures supplémentaires, il n'y aurait tout simplement pas assez de candidats compétents au concours pour assurer le même nombre d'heures global avec la même qualité du point de vue de l'Éducation nationale.

Dans d'autres domaines, où les travailleurs ont une expertise rare, voire pire lorsqu'il y a un *intuitu personae* fort, les travailleurs ne sont simplement pas interchangeables, ou alors difficilement avec des compromis. Cas extrême: les artistes. Par exemple, Yann Tiersen peut écrire des musiques de films. Si son nombre d'heures de travail est réduit et qu'il est compensé par un autre compositeur, le travail de cet autre compositeur ne sera pas le même que celui qu'aurait effectué Yann Tiersen.

Il y a des domaines où on ne peut pas remplacer les gens à la volée. Par exemple, un chirurgien ne peut pas facilement être remplacé en cours d'opération par un autre s'il s'agit d'une opération complexe. Ou un codeur ne peut pas être remplacé au milieu de sa ligne de code à la volée par un autre facilement. C'est pour ça que les médecins font des gardes qui durent longtemps, sinon il faudrait faire des relèves supplémentaires pour informer le remplaçant de l'état des patients etc... ce qui serait une perte de productivité et de temps.

Enfin, la formation de certaines personnes ou les conditions de leur exercice rendent extrêmement coûteuse une division supplémentaire du travail. Un pilote de chasse par exemple a reçu une formation de plusieurs millions d'euros. La diminution de ses horaires de travail augmenterait énormément le coût de la main d'oeuvre, sans commune mesure avec le salaire payé. Un pêcheur sur un chalutier en haute mer, un scientifique sur la banquise, un sous-marinier ou même un éleveur de haute montagne ne peuvent pas être remplacés sans un coût très important par individu (déplacement en avion, hélicoptère et reste de la logistique etc...) donc mieux vaut avoir des gens qui travaillent pendant un certain temps avec des horaires très élevés, que plus de travailleurs avec des horaires plus faibles.

TLDR: désolé pour le pavé. En gros ça dépend du métier.",t1_d89jord,,0,1475333457,,d89lae4,thomanou,,0,16,1478236223,1475333121,False,t3_55cis2,france,t5_2qhjz

&gt; En quoi est-ce réjouissant d'obtenir un million ? ce n'est pas mon but dans la vie. Pourtant l'argent comme finalité et les gros sous, c'est ce que l'on t'a dit de penser et de courir après, il me semble.

Je n'ai pas dis que c'était réjouissant, mais tu as l'air de pleurer parce que tu ne gagnes pas assez pour ton précieux travail. Je voulais dire qu'en tant que patron, tu es généralement rémunéré à la hauteur de tes efforts (propos à nuancés, c'est plutôt valable pour les PME que les grands groupes). 

&gt; Par contre, ce que tu ne veux pas comprendre c'est que ton bout de code commence à intéresser des gens quand les projets se chiffrent par millions (et là peut-être que tu peux être payer seulement 50k à l'année, oui seulement).

"It depends on which country you are talking about, and what your definition of ""colonialism"" is. For example, the Turks conquered, ruled, and enslaved white southern Europeans (Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, Serbians, etc.) for over 400 years. Was this ""colonialism""? The Moors conquered, ruled, and enslaved white Spaniards for nearly 800 years. Even Sicily and Malta were ruled by Arabs, and Arabs spread their seed there. In fact, even today, the people of Malta speak a Semitic language that is closely related to Tunisian Arabic, due to Arabs fathering many children with the local white women and teaching them their language. Many southern Italians also look like Arabs to me, and regional words like *mafia* are probably derived from Arabic. Was this also ""colonialism""?

You should keep examples such as the above in mind when attempting to answer the question, ""Did colonialism affect a positive change?"" and ""Was colonialism moral?"" Europeans only ruled Muslim countries for a relatively short amount of time in the 19th and 20th centuries, and several Muslim countries were never officially colonized at all (e.g. Turkey and Iran). On the other hand, Muslims have conquered and ruled various European countries for hundreds of years, and also conducted slaving operations as far afield as Iceland. Over 1 million Western Europeans were enslaved during the 16th-18th centuries, while about 2.5 million Eastern Europeans were enslaved during the same time period. Many of the favorite concubines in the harems of powerful Muslim rulers were white European slaves. For example, Suleiman the Magnificent's favorite wife, Roxelana, was a slave taken from modern-day Ukraine.",t3_55decd,nationalbolshevist30px,0,1475335434,,d89ly47,PeddaKondappa,Ethnocentric Collectivism,0,2,1478236548,1475334316,False,t3_55decd,DebateFascism,t5_2v642

"Un grupo de traballo político sobre un concello é algo moi necesario xa en termos de calidade democrática da sociedade. Se ademáis está vinculado ao partido, tamén é importante, porque é o que vai facer grande este partido: a participación.

A cuestión está en qué facer... Sería moi útil que houbese unha lista de Concellos con círculos activos que podan servir de referencia, e cos que comunicarse. A partir de aí podería facerse ata unha guía de por onde comezar. É da información de coordinación que se bota en falta e que debería saír da xente do Consello Cidadán Autonómico, ou da secretaría de Organización. Eu a pediría directamente. E se necesitades que alguén respalde esta solicitude, contade comigo. So son un cidadán máis, pero e bo sumar sempre :-D

Como ideas, unha das cousas que me parecen máis importantes para facer é a de establecer contacto co tecido asociativo do voso concello. Propoñédelles reunirvos con eles para que vos falen da súa actividade, e das necesidades que ven no concello para desenvolvela de xeito adecuado. Despóis sería interesante presentarvos nos barrios á cidadanía, e facer a mesma labor de recollida de información. De todo iso sacaredes o programa electoral para o voso Concello.

En canto a cuestións concretas de política municipal, non é moita cousa, pero estiven a traballar no meu concello nun proxecto que agora -por falta de tempo e xente- está parado. Ao mellor sacades del algunha información interesante: [Narón Aberto](http://naronaberto.blogspot.com.es)

A verdade é que me resulta emocionante saber de grupos de xente interesados en botar a andar un círculo. Persoalmente, estaría encantado de estar en contacto con vos para ir tomando nota da evolución do voso caso concreto, porque sempre pode ser de gran axuda para outra xente que se anime a iniciar. 

Un saúdo e moita sorte!

"&gt; I want to get a bike so badly but the thought of dying in my 20's terrifies me.

then you're already ahead of the stereotypical young male rider that ends up killing himself on a bike. Riding is dangerous, that's why you should take every precaution to not die if you decide to do it. Obviously that means getting safety gear and wearing it, but it also means learning how to ride in a manner conducive to A: learning and B: not dying. I gather from your post history that you live in the USA, so your options are probably very limited in that regard. I implore you to seek them out anyway, and yes that includes paying big bucks if you need to because if that helps you to not die or getting hospitalized then you just saved yourself a lot of pain/trouble. For some perspective, IIRC I paid about €1500 for my drivers education/on road lessons and exams, and then I paid ANOTHER €1500 a few years later for my motorcycle lessons/exams. Yes, that's expensive and yes, over here in western Europe, that's typical. I learned a lot during my parking lot lessons and later during my on road lessons, and after I was good and done and passed my exams, they declared me ready to start learning how to ride a motorcycle.

I don't know what you can do in your situation to learn how to ride a motorcycle other than an MSF course, but if there's an option for you to get some quality 1 on 1 time with an experienced instructor on the road or even on a track, go for it. $1000 is peanuts compared to crashing your bike like so many newbies do",t3_55cb5i,nl,0,False,,d89m9lx,fiah84,Honda NC700SD (DCT),0,1,1478236705,1475334876,False,t3_55cb5i,motorcycles,t5_2qi6d

""Aikun Mophus X300 is the influence for Nintendo's upcoming NX portable console, in the design for gamepad control on each side of the nice glasses-free 3D display. Available at $249 for early bird orders on Indiegogo, the retail price is to be nearer $329, it will also be available on Amazon soon in Europe and in the USA. Powered by the Allwinner A83T Octa-core ARM Cortex-A7 with PowerVR SGX544 GPU. The future of console gaming must be made for Android, and the Aikun Morphus X300 shows how the form factor of the future of gaming must implement gamepad controllers on each side of the display, which is what Nintendo for sure is developing for the Nintendo NX platform of the future.

"I'm going to assume you mean colonialism in the European style:

&gt; Was colonialism moral?

No. Conquest, plunder, and oppression is *never* moral. I'm sure many comments will follow that scream ""But these non-whites did it too!!!!1!!1!"" Let me say that conquest is never moral no matter who does it. It's human nature, yes. But not all human natures are worthy of celebrating. 

&gt; Did it improve the lives of the colonized

No. Of course a small strata of colonized people *did* gain material benefit, the so called *petit bourgeois*: the clerks, administrators, mid-sized land holders, etc. These classes were able to take advantage of colonial rule and largely inherited the post-colonial states. 

In other cases, minorities that had no power or were actively oppressed by greater society were usually given power from (and made dependant on) colonial rule. The Tamils in Sri Lanka, and the Tutsi in Rwanda, serve as examples. 

For the average, everyday colonized person however, colonization was a negative. 

&gt; the colonizers 

Absolutely. I could rant about this for ages but the book *How Europe Underdeveloped Africa* is am excellent read on how the former benefited from the latter. But to sum up, colonization allowed Europe the labor and resource pools necessary to reach the levels of wealth and power it did, along with hobbling potential competitors.

"&gt; You speak like it would be an awful thing to see power shift back towards the member states.

It's not so much that it would be awful, but that it would mean the EU was permanently deadlocked and therefore functionally useless.

Any large political structure is a balancing act between democracy (that makes it accountable to its citizens) and a hierarchy and/or processes that mean subsets can be overruled in order to *actually get things done*.

Direct democracy is a great idea, but it doesn't scale well - 100% agreement gets harder as the size of group increases, and beyond a certain point is simply impossible to achieve.  Likewise, even *majority* agreement is increasingly difficult as the scale and complexity of problems increases and the number of possible positions goes up exponentially (as with, say, the dot-and-comma details of the kinds of massive policy decisions that affect the entire EU).

This is why pretty much every political system in the world has one or more representative arms (who vote and agree on general direction), but also a vast and persistent (and as far as possible apolitical) civil service charged with actually *researching and implementing* the strategy and taking tactical decisions to make that happen.

The EU is certainly not without flaws, but getting rid of the (apolitical, aside from a by-design loyalty to the EU as an institution) civil service in favour of moving *all* legislative and executive power to a fractious coalition of member states is basically a recipe for complete deadlock and dysfunctional EU governance that's incapable of ever getting anything done.  It's hard enough to democratically decide on what *should* be done - if we start trying to democratically vote on *how* it should be achieved in every detail then nothing would ever happen.

The EU exists as a separate entity for exactly the same reason as the Federal government exists in the US - because a squabbling coalition of members with only loosely aligned interests that can be played off against each other is not *capable* of acting decisively on behalf of the whole, and providing a unified and coherent front to the rest of the world in the way the EU (or USA) requires to be successful.

This isn't an argument that the EU (or even the USA) is *required* in the world, but *if* you want to have one for the stated reasons it exists, then it pretty much has to have some power and decision-making ability of its own (as distinct from the consensus of the member states), or it simply can't work.

&gt; If it gets to a point like that, then clearly the EU is pushing for things that are against the interests of a majority of the member states, at which point the EU either needs to change and fall in line with that, or split/disband.

Yes and no.

If the EU is *actually, on balance* acting against the interests of its member states more than in favour of them then yes, they'd be right to withdraw or demand reforms.

However there's a thousand-mile gulf between *is* acting against the members' best interests and *presented as* working against their best interests by people with a vested interest in seeing it fail (say, UKIP) or in shifting blame from themselves onto an institution that can't answer back (say, every UK government for the last 40 years).

Equally, there's a difference between acting against *a* member's best interest *upon occasion* (but which will nevertheless cause great consternation in that country and be dragged up in every discussion about the EU for years afterwards) in the interests of the whole and acting against *all or a majority* of all members' interests on *a majority of issues*.  Hell, there's a difference between acting in the overall interests of the whole and acting selfishly in its *own* interests, though the two are routinely conflated.

The trouble is that almost everyone (a lot of the media, governments, etc) has a vested interest in blaming problems on the EU, and national governments in taking credit for any successes themselves.  Public perception is not necessarily a reliable guide to reality, that goes double when it's being filtered through groups who are themselves biased and self-interested in altering those perceptions, and that means that even if the *perception* is that the EU is failing or undemocratic, that doesn't mean that it necessarily is.

Don't get me wrong - it may be, and it may deserve to fail.  However, I find it very hard to believe one can make a reasonable case that if a majority of a country votes to leave the EU, that that's necessarily *factually* the best thing for the country, or even ""reasonably looks like it, given a cool-headed assessment of all the facts"".

Democracy is important, but has systematic problems with populism and demagoguery - it's not a perfect solution without control mechanisms to tamp out imperfect information or wild swings.

"&gt;For example, it is likely to be a red line issue for the EU to end up in a situation in which the a state which is not a member has a better deal than states which are members. 

Define 'better'. The UK will be locked out of Schengen and the Euro, will not be part of the political project and likely several other aspects, will not have free-movement, will have no representation in the EU bodies.. Those are all benefits of membership that EU members enjoy.

Your point on investment uncertainty is well put, and very much applicable to Nissan. However you also can't discount access to the UK market, yes the UK is only 1 of 28 current members, but it does represent 17% of new car registrations. It's variable by brand too, if you look at Nissans own sales figures from 2015 the UK represents 10% of Nissans global sales, and more than 60% of Nissans sales across Europe (not the EU...).  Then there is existing investment and infrastructure. In short it's complex and by no means obvious. 

If there were tariffs imposed, then Nissan moving to a different EU country, would mean increased costs for the bulk of the EU sales, that isn't a good thing for Nissan. Now sensibly, Nissan is looking to protect itself, but at the same time, the options to simply shift investment may well not be there in the current market, and the costs associated with doing so could be far higher than remaining in place.

&gt;IMO, the UK is in the process of throwing away a structural advantage, and no amount of talking it up can make up for that loss. 

Sort of, but the point is around what the alternative looks like, and yes that comes with an uncertainty cost.

&gt;What could help are: 1. Extensive exchange rate devaluation 2. Wage devaluation, being the single largest cost to most companies 3. Housing devaluation, being the single largest cost to individuals

"That's a very valid point.

I mean, in the end, **we all migrated out of Africa 6 million years ago** and in various waves.

The varying waves and settlers eventually even mingled with each other (Cro Magnon man comes to mind) and people have been migrating as long as they have been people.

I get that.

But when one starts to think in terms of nationalism, self-determination, and who came where first, these are how the arguments start to devolve.

Were Armenians always living in Eastern Anatolia? No.

Did they migrate there? Did they arise out of a mixing of arrivals? Did it happen over generations or all at once?

Look at all the migration occuring now from the middle east into europe. How is that going to be looked upon centuries from now?

Will there be a leader that says, ""Muslims and middle easterners aren't really European! They need to 'go back where they came from!' How dare they move to a place they weren't originally from!""

I mean, it sounds silly, but it's happened before.

So when Hitler makes the argument that the Ashkenazi (huh, you can't spell Ashkenazi without nazi!) Jews migrated to Europe, he is justifying his soon to be proposal to eliminate them and get Germany back to its ""original"" or ""unadulterated"" status.

Ironically, when I point out that Armenians, or Assyrians, or Greeks, were in Anatolia before anything we can consider to be a modern Turk was, I'm trying to justify my right to exist someplace I was originally from.

It would have been nice if those million and a half Armenians weren't ""deported for their own safety"" or ""moved because they were deemed to be traitors"". I forget which one it is. Or is it both? Worried about our safety and pissed off at being traitors?

"*This is long but bare with me - it's an opinion I wanted to air*

I've missed the reactionary comments after not winning a game 8-0. You don't call for the head of the manager after drawing 1-1. People treat this team as if we won the treble every single year for fifty years. 'Go back to 4-2-3-1, Müller as a CAM, play Robben for the full 90 minutes!' every single match Bayern don't win. 'Müller spielt immer!' to 'He's not good enough right now!' People seem to forget that Bayern played a 4-2-3-1 for a few seasons before winning the treble and in that time won absolutely nothing.

Losing 1-0 to Atletico isn't a really shit result. It's a shit feeling to lose to a team but it's the team that have managed to get further than we did in the CL for the past few years.

Drawing to a team that are currently undefeated isn't a crying shame either. When was the last time Bayern went a whole season winning every game? When was the last time Bayern went a whole season without conceding a scrappy goal? Bayern is a fantastic team but not everything will be happy all the time ever. Drawing to Köln isn't something to call for Ancelotti's contract to be shredded.

Is there anything that really stands out about today and the match against Atletico? Yes. If there's one thing that the treble season highlights it's the importance of having competition within the squad and removing any sense of complacency. You had Shaqiri, Müller, Robben and Ribéry all going for similar positions, Kroos, Schweini, Luiz Gustavo, Martinez.. so many people going for central midfield positions and up top you have Gomez, Mandzukic and Pizarro.

Our winger situation is a bit tricky because of the onus of having to replace two of the best wingers European football has seen very quickly. But up top the situation is worse. You have one striker who has a big ego. He's not going to give his all because why does he have to? He's not going to get dropped any time soon. In fact, he's probably going to get rewarded with a fat contract in a few weeks. If you have competition for your position, you're going to want to show that you are the best option. Look at how Robben played in 12/13. Every single game he worked his hardest because he knew a lot of fans were calling for him to be dropped after his performance against Chelsea. Everyone here knows what happened then. Bayern need to get another good centre forward in the winter if only to give Lewandowski a kick up the arse and say 'you're not guaranteed a start, no matter how good you are.' When he was dropped for a couple of games last season, he came on in the second half against Wolfsburg and fucked them right up.

"&gt; The NATO alliance is keeping Europe under the protection of the US nuclear umbrella. Wreck it, and you'll have a bunch of nations including Germany in a new arms race to get their own nuclear weapons. That's the last thing in the world that we want. Nuclear proliferation increases the odds of a nuke falling into terrorist hands, among other problems.

Who said we couldn't be allies without NATO?

&gt; I'm not defending Hillary or shitty free trade deals, but the answer is free trade deals that have enforced worker and environmental protections. Trump isn't talking about any of that. He's talking about isolationism, and withdrawing from the global economy.

Right, and that would be better, actually, than the ""free trade deals"" that take jobs out of this country.

&gt; And this alone isn't enough if a reason for you?

Nope, Hillary's just as racist. ""Superpredators""? Letting her DNC staffers use the term ""taco bowl"" to refer to Latino voters? Insulting all Bernie supporters by calling them basement dwellers? Also, Hillary clearly supports Trump's racism, considering she's been at his events and all.

&gt; I'm not defending Obama. I'm saying that Trump had promised to deport 11 million people, tearing millions of families apart. On top of being a logistical and fiscal nightmare, it's very callous.

Which is why Congress won't let it happen.

"&gt; I person who is largely responsible for horrible unnecessary Wars (Libyia, Syria, Yemen), Hundreds of thousands dead, Widespread Corruption, A rapist husband.

Wait, I'm confused about what you are suggesting.  

The war effort in Libya was led by France.  Obama was criticized for the choice of only offering air support while European troops were on the ground.  

The war in Syria is a civil war, related to the Arab Spring.  Clinton's only statement on that point was that the US would not become involved.  

And the war in Yemen is another civil war, and it only started in 2015, when John Kerry was Sec. of State.  How could Clinton be involved in it?  

""Widespread corruption"" is a blanket statement that has no specifics attached to it, but the major points of ""corruption"" would be Benghazi, Clinton Foundation, and email deletion, which she has been intensely scrutinized for, and yet found not guilty (or at least, not criminally guilty).  

And how the hell is ""rapist husband"" even a criticism of Hillary?  This is especially bizarre, because it is essentially saying, ""I choose to vote for a rapist, because the alternative is a woman married to a rapist,"" which makes no sense.

"&gt; The level of delusion over the impact Brexit is going to have is kinda crazy. 

Yes and no. Of course these catastrophic consequences are quite unlikely. But they're not entirely impossible. I.e. if the UK and EU fail to reach an agreement and the UK is suddenly not only out of the internal market but entirely separated from the rest of the continent the UK's GDP is expected to shrink be more than 10%.  If that coincides with another global economical crisis and political instabilities the effect could indeed be horrific. 

So no, you shouldn't expect to live in a wasteland in 5 years, but the risk of that happening is slightly bigger than it was before the vote for Brexit. Realistically the result will only be a bad deal for the UK. I  expect that the EU strongarms free movement of people through (maybe with some cosmetic limitations) and that the UK will have to pay about as much as before to the EU. Horrific scenarios may not be realistic but they put the EU in a very good bargaining position.

"&gt; handgun prohibition 

That depends upon the area in which you are referring too. If you are talking about in the United States - no. A city / statewide prohibition of, in this instance, handguns is pointless. 

The point of a prohibition is to bar that item from the marketplace; however, when the next city / state over has that same prohibited item perfectly legal to purchase it's going to flow in from there. That's simple economics. 

If you're talking about in the european and canadian context I would argue it is. This is because they have better control over the firearms market from a top-down sense. 

Guns aren't as easy to manufacture as drugs, and a gun that would run you $600 here in the US - like my Baretta 92FS for instance - would likely by 5x to 10x that price in a european country where it is illegal to own.  

Honestly when it comes to gun control I think the [Canadians have it done the best.](http://www.howtogetagun.ca/)

* Take a class to be certified to use a weapon for hunting. 

* Another class to be able to have a handgun. 

* Pass the tests. 

* Prove you're a competent owner before you're ever sold a gun. 

* Leave all current firearms, even those outlawed, with the current owners, because it would be impossible to gather them all up. 

That's just my opinion on it though. If you were honestly interested versus probing for inconsistency.

"Actually with a bit more linguistics and some logic you can answer that.

English is a Germanic language and it also borrowed quite a lot from the French languages, Medieval Latin, Greek and the native Brythonic languages (those Celtic guys before the Anglo-Saxons). Some of these languages' descendants (French and German) now use a uvular fricative or other guttural-R. Others like Modern Latin and Greek, Welsh and Cornish, all have a coronal-R (alveolar flap or trill). All of these languages ultimately come from Proto-Indo-European which we think was likely an alveolar trill because so many of its descendants use that sound or an alveolar flap today.

So is it possible that English has always sounded this way and that it's just a rare language that always held on the an original postalveolar approximate? Yes, it's totally possible, but its a lot more likely that English got its approximate from the fronting of the Germanic and French uvular fricative.

You might ask why we don't look for primary sources of people describing ""proper language"" to common people or something like that. And it's true that there are sources that describe how the languages sounded at the time. But if you noticed how much clarification parent comment needed to make from OP's question before he actually started talking, you can see that, short of using modern phonological lingo, it's hard to tell what the author really meant by a ""hard R"" or ""soft R"", much less what they meant by ""Volvuntur lingua fortis et infirmus"".

I don't think there's a whole lot you could do/say in the Republic to get yourself into much trouble. If you visit the north it'd probably be best to avoid religion/politics but people both sides of the border are generally very easygoing and open minded. 

If you're of Irish descent and describe yourself as Irish, you may cause a few eyes to roll but that's essentially it. Oh and don't criticise our president (not that he could be faulted on anything, of course) as he has a cult-like level of support and following, the Taoiseach is fair game though.

&gt;I love deep forests, dark green awesome forests filled with potential. 

While our few remaining native woodlands are insanely beautiful, Ireland is among the most deforested countries in Europe so you'll have a very difficult time finding wilderness that could compare to parts of the US in terms of size or remoteness. Most forests you will find will be non-native coniferous forests but as other users have mentioned, the area around Glendalough has some stunning native forests. 


&gt;Since we only have a week, what places would you recommend we go too and see? 

Kerry and Galway are the counties with the most dramatic and rugged landscapes and Galway also has a nice medieval city. Donegal is also an area of outstanding natural beauty but its location and relative inaccessibility make it a bad option for a one-week holiday. I'd recommend spending 2 days in each Dublin, Galway and Kerry with an extra day to spend in whichever place you end up liking the most. 


&gt;What's your favorite kind of food in Ireland that he and me should try?

Irish meals tend to be unexciting at best and stomach turning at worst. Just order whatever appeals to you the most rather than meals advertised as being traditionally Irish; the quality of our produce is much higher than most of Europe and the US so dining is generally a very enjoyable experience. 

The exception to this is the full Irish breakfast. This is glorious and should be eaten on each morning of your trip. We also do crisps (potato chips) better than anywhere else so make sure to try a variety of them.

"IIRC it's a technique invented by the European Sheik named Amsah, hence the name Amsah Tech.

"&gt; Except the ones that didn't, that I already mentioned. I wonder how many times I already repeated that just because they are a certain way right now, it's the only way they can be, nor we necessarily need it to be that way. For an example, a few decades ago no country recognized same-sex marriage. Now it changed. Civilization keeps going fine.

&gt; Across the world business suits are considered the proper attire for business matters. It does not mean it can't be done in another attire.

&gt; Don't come with backwards logic and call me dogmatic because I won't adhere to your view of the only possible societies.

&gt; Which is false. Ancient Greece, nude colonies, yadda yadda. Don't come at me with ""modesty"" because we are talking about breasts.

You actually haven't mentioned any. Ancient Greece had MORE nudity, but they still had a sense of sexual propriety. Show me the civilizations that have no sexual modesty and I'll show you failed civilizations.

&gt;I see the leap you had to make to relate these two things

There's no leap. Without breast feeding, female breasts wouldn't be sexualized. period. Like I said (and you ignored), full breasts are a sign of good genes.

&gt;But you won't budge an inch to relate these two things.

&gt;If you can make a parallel between female breasts and genitals, you can't ignore that female breasts are the counterpart to the male chest. Interestingly enough I learned male toplessness also used to be illegal

Male breasts are not functional the way that female breasts are. Why is this so hard to understand? They're not the same, so equality has nothing to do with it. You could say it would be an issue of equality if men were allowed to expose their hands but women weren't, because there's no functional difference between the two, and there is no material reason for people to sexualize female hands over male hands. **Not the case with breasts.**

&gt;I'll give you a point. There is an argument to be made about full on nudity. This isn't it. You can't argue against it female toplessness by arguing against exposed genitals, because that is another matter. If the issue is just genitals, it doesn't concern to toplessness. When the issue becomes the right to expose genitals, then you use that argument.

Ok so if there is an argument to be made about full on nudity, then stop trying to argue that nudity or sexual modesty has nothing to do with successful civilizations. I'm trying to establish a baseline but you're too stubborn to admit it. I'm not saying we HAVE to cover breasts up because we also cover penises. The point is that some level of modesty is necessary for humans to interact with each other successfully on a large and complex scale. It could be sexual tension, it could be shame, I'm not sure, but it's delusional to look at human history and not conclude that propriety has some connection with successful civilizations.

&gt;This is the kind of flawed logic that says, to bring back another example, that gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry because if everyone becomes gay nobody will reproduce and humanity will end. And even that silly argument still has a line of thought that can be followed.

Not sure what you're trying to say here. I've never heard anybody say gay marriage should be illegal cause it will turn everybody gay. I also don't see how that would have anything to do with what I'm saying in any way.

&gt;What I gather from yours is:

&gt;* ""All successful advanced societies are against female toplessness.""
&gt;* ""Modesty is a fundamental part of civilization.""
&gt;* ""Therefore we shouldn't have toplessness""

That's because you're not reading what i'm writing, or at least not understanding it. I've said many times that by pointing out that civilizations throughout history have valued sexual modesty that I'm merely getting your side to admit that it's not arbitrary to do so. What your side always does is to try to pretend like there's NOTHING different or special about nudity. ""It's just skin, so why can't I show it?"" It's childish and silly to ignore that this stuff matters at SOME LEVEL. If you want to make the case that exposing nipples won't practically be a problem, then go ahead and make that case but STOPPPPPP pretending like it's arbitrary or like it's an issue of equality.

&gt;What is it supposed to imply? That civilization will end or regress if we have female toplessness? That only societies who are against female toplessness can survive, or evolve? That toplessness is against technology? That female toplessness was a determinant factor of the fall of ancient societies that accepted it?
All of that sounds crazy. It makes you sound like a troll. And I do hope you are not a troll in CMV because that would be just sad.

I never said any of this, and in fact I have explicitly said things to the opposite. I never said female toplessness leads to the collapse of society. You just don't have a real argument so you're lashing out and putting words in my mouth. What I *am* saying is that in order for people to get along with each and be civil, some level of sexual modesty is necessary. That level of modesty may change from culture to culture for different reasons (such as climate), but it still exists in some form.

&gt;Even if it was just that female toplessness will destroy modesty, that is still alarmist for no reason. It used to be that women showing their legs was considered immodest. Now they do quite often and... we are still here. That didn't cause any crisis. There is no reason to talk about civilization like it was going to ruin it. This is the same

Let's be honest, you have no idea if it caused any crises. Yeah we're ""still here"" but social unrest and social trust etc aren't the only thing keep western civilization afloat. For instance, if law enforcement and criminal rehabilitation tactics improve, rape will go down, and as rape goes down, people will become less worried about rape, and that could lead to less sexual modesty. So all you see is civilization improving and modesty eroding and you assume that modesty isn't important, when in reality all it means is we're richer and safer and so people can be less modest. That doesn't mean it's a good thing, it doesn't mean that if we stayed more modest we wouldn't be EVEN BETTER than we are today.

&gt;You see, your last argument, you act like it's damning, but I can just as easily present it back to you. Why should you draw the line? You are the one adamant against toplessness. You are the one bringing exposed genitals into it.

Actually I think if you go back through my posts you'll see that I'm not particularly adamant one way or the other, I'm just adamant against making stupid arguments and ignoring history. It likely won't be a huge deal if female toplessness happens, but it's also not a huge deal and not an example of inequality if it doesn't. Society decides what is decent and indecent, so change their minds.

&gt;But still, it is irrelevant because that's not what is being discussed. It's about breasts, and breasts are not genitals. Stretching the association won't change that.

&gt;Fortunately, in any civilized place, there is more to the law than what random people feel about things. Those values I mentioned, equality and freedom, guide the law. And turns out the ""silly protest marches"" are working out pretty well, considering public female toplessness is allowed in most of the US and some european countries.

Whether they're working well or not (which there is no reason to assume they are), it doesn't make them any less silly. Female breasts are functionally different, therefore it's not sexist or unequal to require they be covered up.

The problem is, as Blaut points out, they aren't, they're just as good, Diamond's claim is based on discredited research. Blaut also adresses the North-South and East-West axis part of Diamond's theory which you mentioned in the Civ episode and how it makes little sense considering how and where crops are actually grown.

As for the racism - do you know the old Simpson's quip ""Not racist, but #1 with racists""? *GGS* is very popular with racists and not-quite-racists and this quote from Kathleen Lowrey of *Savage Minds* expresses why pretty well:  
""This is a punchline about race and history that many white people want desperately to hear. Those dying black kids at the end of the special -- we know, because We Are Not Racist, that they don’t deserve what they are getting. They are not inferior. In fact, there but for the grace of god…. And it poisonously whispers: mope about colonialism, slavery, capitalism, racism, and predatory neo-imperialism all you want, but these were/are nobody’s fault. This is a wicked cop-out. Worse still, it is a profound insult to all non-Western cultures/societies. It basically says they’re sorta pathetic, but that bless their hearts, they couldn’t/can’t help it. Such an assertion tramples upon all that anthropology holds dear, and is a sham sort of anti-racism.""

Maybe I am doing Jared Diamond a disservice, maybe he himself isn't racist and Eurocentric and tried to write a book to disprove those very concepts. The problem is, he failed. He wrote a book that to racists reads ""Europeans are the greatest and this is why"" and since they don't really care about the why part anyway it just says ""Europeans are the greatest"". Again - this may not have been his intent, but it's one of the results, and anthropologists and historians have been criticising the book as having done a major disservice to the field.

Ultimately, whether or not *GGS* is purposefully or accidentally or even not at all racist and/or Eurocentric doesn't even matter. The really most important thing I want to highlight is that modern historians and anthropologists are very critical if not outright hostile towards *Guns, Germs and Steel*. There is merit in looking at environmental factors and seeing how they impacted history, but *GGS* is highly reductionist and makes big and bold claims based on very little concrete evidence.",t1_d89pnt5,,0,False,,d89rwbg,SteampunkWolf,,0,38,1478239639,1475343786,False,t3_55df39,Yogscast,t5_2sg86

"It is hard to know what an Al Gore Presidency would look like, although I believe he would have directed significantly more resources into internal energy development and stimulus rather than create pretext to invade Iraq.  If we did, it probably would have been on humanitarian grounds and we may well have handled the aftermath much better, although again that is all very speculative.

Hillary Clinton is not Al Gore.   She has participated in upheaval in the mid east, backed it and is calling for greater presence there.   She is openly antagonizing Russia in a very calculated way and has shown a strong willingness to compete for Syria.   

The geopolitical reality is that the interest in Syria has everything to do with providing alternate oil pipeline access to Europe, and has been a longstanding state military objective.  Our policies clearly indicate that we favor using turmoil to create a realignment in the region, without regard to the human cost.

Inflaming sectarian schisms is a means to this end, and does not lead to a resolution scenario. Internal Arab division is seen as superior to cooperation, which is very similar to the failed British policies which created the framework for the current situation there.

This is the agenda of both the neoliberals and the neoconservatives, and is driven by war profiteering and a desire to utilize fossil fuels as a primary economic and political driver, among other considerations.

Actively posturing against Russia is part of this strategy, as conflict ensures a steady flow of non-productive funding to the military industrial complex as well as creating tensions which are suitable for increasing domestic control over the citizenry through measures such as the patriot act.  The cold war was nothing if not lucrative and useful for consolidating ""patriotic unity"". 

Clinton advocated for aggression throughout her time as Secretary, and would enact that if President.  This will inflame traditional cold war hot spots and require militarization of the Russian front among others.  

The nature of her reactions to conflicts, particularly her ill advised plan to create a no-fly zone in a proxy territory of a major power while that power was invited and flying active missions is borderline insanity.  It would only take a spark to reignite the cold war, and the risks of escalation that creates, and she is intent on providing that match.

I am firmly in favor of electing a responsible candidate who will not push these types of detrimental agendas.  I would find either third party candidate as an acceptable alternative to traveling further down that path.

"Friends of Europe,

I see a lot of questions about Mexican cuisine, tacos, burritos, and the like. Now, of course we love tacos, but I'd like to clarify that that's not the only thing we eat. Mexican cuisine is as diverse as the country itself and it's history. We have pre-Hispanic dishes, baroque dishes, Neo-classical dishes, and even modern dishes, with global and local influences.

For example, did you know that the Philippines was discovered by Spanish explorer captains, but with a Mexican crew, and a Mexican-made ship that sailed from Acapulco? For a short while, the Philippines was governed from New Spain (now Mexico). Indeed, the Spanish trade with Asia included a trade route that passed through the Tehuantepec Isthmus, in Oaxaca. Many foods in the region are inspired from Asia.

Or that American Chinese food was invented in Mexico? NPR ran last year an piece about how immigrants from China failing to immigrate into the US settled in Mexico and created the modern dishes of Chinese food served in US malls for passers-by.

There are 32 states in Mexico, each with its own cuisine. If you come to Mexico, please try the tacos, but also please look for the other dishes. You'll be amazed!!",t3_55du3s,,0,False,,d89sbbi,[deleted],,0,124,1478240275,1475344434,False,t3_55du3s,europe,t5_2qh4j

"Im sure there are, but the truth is that the general population don't drink wine even once a week, and also for some reason I found Mexican wine to be too sweet, not all but most were, but lets be honest here, Mexico is not known as a wine producing country, i think that a couple of generations are needed to even get renowned wines.
Also because the weather is completely different to europe, in mexico i think it's hard to get good produce for wine. 
I mean very wet cold winters, and mostly dry hot summers, in most of mexico it rains during the summer and during the winter it's only mildly cold and it doesnt rain during winter, this is why I find the weather in Mexico to be much better than what i've seen in europe, but this is why there's not much wheat production in mexico as well as raisins, and other mediterranean crops.

"A yes, fictional Europe. 1939 was when the  Germanian Empire (def not germany) took over its neighbor livonia (totally not poland) on its first step on taking over Europe. Even in fictional anime Europe, Poland is being taken over.

This was a very solid first episode and I really enjoyed it. I loved the scene were the the German(ian)s were invading while the opera singer sang on in the background. I really enjoyed the pretty good depiction of blitzkrieg, where combined arms easily destroyed lines of defenses designed around WWI ideology (defenders are in trenches and utterly overwhelmed). 

I think the story is interesting, the character designs looked great and the pilot was excellent. 

I will be sad when the panzers start being destroyed and the junkers are being shot out of the air ([those beautiful machines...](http://i.imgur.com/XOrwKyF.gif)) but I am very much looking forward to seeing where this show will go.

Some specifics about the episode. 1- The two soldiers accompany the princess died, and I really like that because because too many shows have the opponent being utterly incompetent. 

2- Attention to detail: Something I noticed in my second watching of this episode was that after the princess gets out of the shower [you can actually see the scar she has on her right side.](http://i.imgur.com/lga53OY.png) Later on, in the Witch's flashback you can see that the princess is wounded protecting the witch.

"&gt; Wait, so it's wrong to equivocate two political parties AS political parties?

It's incorrect to take ""Republican Party 1960"" and ""Republican Party 2016"" as having something in common besides the name, because partisan shifts occur in which different constituencies are subsumed into different parties.

Everything important about a party is determined by who is in that party. Conservative Christians are now Republicans. They were once Democrats. You seem to be treating the party as if it has some immutable essence that persists over time, and saying that that essence shows the party isn't really concerned with abortion. The problem is that there is no such essence. Everything is determined by the people in it. The Republican Party is now the party that fights for the interests of conservative Christians. It was not always that way, but it is now.

&gt; Because, objectively abortion rates have dropped under a Democratic administration

This is a merely utilitarian point. The purpose of electing pro-life politicians is not to lower abortion rates any more than the point of electing anti-Nazi politicians is to lower the number of concentration camps. ""Lowering"" is the wrong goal. It trains us to think that things are getting ""better"" when they are not. The only acceptable number is zero. And if it is not zero, the people responsible for making it nonzero should be punished. This is the obligation of the law, which exists to do justice. The Democrats' agenda encourages this dereliction of duty on the part of the law. A party which fails in the central obligation of the law is not fit for anything and should be fought at every turn.

&gt; You were the one who told me to look to the 80s for the real policy foundations of the GOP. I am just responding to your points.

But we're talking about abortion, so that wasn't relevant. You originally claimed on the subject of abortion that ""the GOP won't do much either."" That is the point to which I am responding.

&gt; If we are to go on GOP policy history (in just 30 years), they have done nothing for the pro-life cause. 

The judges appointed by the GOP are the only reason this country has not gone more and more insane. (Compare the US to [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_v_Canada_(Attorney_General)) and Western Europe to see how far the madness can go.)

"Thank you for a well thought out reply.

You are right - I should have defined better better. :-) 

I meant that any advantages that the UK experiences as a result of Brexit can't come at the expense of the EU; that's where the red line is.

So for example - there is a large and well financed set of scientific and research institutions and the UK benefits disproportionately from them. I would expect that to end unless the UK pays proportionately more than the amounts other members pay to participate. And I expect that the UK would lose any ability to influence direction. 

An example is in the bio-informatics arena - Europe has set up a project to develop systems and processes to share data. It's not glamorous, no fundamental advances will come directly from this work, but it's the difference between motorways and ordinary roads. It's important and useful because we pour money into the life sciences, but it's not used as effectively as it could be, since there aren't common mechanisms in place to house and maintain the terabytes of raw data that may come from each funded study, to curate and catalogue it, and make it searchable and accessible. The UK houses the central organization which co-ordinates the development of this infrastructure. I expect that to change unless the UK ponies up extra funding; there's no reason why it should benefit from European level work at the same price as others if they aren't inside the club.

Nissan - we'll see. My bet is that near term production decisions favour Spain over the UK unless there is a large intervention by the UK government.",t1_d89niua,,0,False,,d89tvbd,wellthatexplainsalot,,0,1,1478243076,1475346889,False,t3_55blt5,Economics,t5_2qh1s

British laws are rela timely simple on airsoft.

To buy a gun, you must be 18+. 

You have to buy a two tone weapon until you get your UKARA sorted.
To get your UKARA defence, you need to play 3 games in 2 or more months.

So, for example;

You play your first game tomorrow, 2nd October. You play again on the 16th, and then again on the 30th. You've now played your 3 games, but you're yet to pass the 2 months. Come the 2nd of December, all you need to do is play one game after that and on that day you can have your UKARA form stamped and sent off. 

You can have a friend with UKARA buy the gun for you,  and that wouldn't really cause too much trouble, but legally the gun is your friends so I wouldn't use it if they weren't there. You're better waiting.

Gunfire and Taiwaingun will do this for you if you request it.

"A few things. I don't know what country you're living in, but you said the West, so I'm going to assume Western Europe. I'm from the US. Things aren't so different between the two as to be polar opposites. That being said, I've got a couple pieces of advice, and a couple questions for you to ask yourself:

- Do you want to be a doctor, and if so, is it so important to you as to deal with this for the next however many years til you graduate? You can make a decent living if you're willing to do a physical job, and since you're in medical school you've obviously finished an undergrad. If being a doctor is what your family wants and not what you want, do something else. I was a vendor my first few years of college. I was only part time, but the full time guys were making $40,000 a year starting out, which was enough to be middle class when you're by yourself where I'm from. Either find something with your undergrad or look for a career you might enjoy. The police, firemen, and EMTs are always hiring. 

- Don't focus on the why. Focus on the is. You are gay. You are not a Muslim anymore. Don't worry about why you're this way, just worry about how to move forward. Handle the things you have control over and try not to worry so much over the things you don't.

- Distance yourself from your family. Prepare yourself for what's inevitable. You can't pick your family. I understand you love your's. I love mine. I was lucky enough to be tolerated by mine, if not accepted. Maybe your mother's attitude would change slightly if she knew, but don't hold out for that hope cause it only makes things harder. Focus on you, make some friends, make your new family. 

- Life can be shit. You play the hand you're dealt. At the same time, you've gotta have the lows to appreciate the highs. [Bob Ross helps me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJfjmxOR2I) Without dark and light, happiness and sadness, you have nothing. 

- Appreciate the little things, because they get you through. The big things are often little things in disguise.

Best of luck OP. Losing your family may suck, but you can and will move on to better things. You will eventually get to a point where you can look back on this chapter in your life as a building block to where you are then.",t3_55eh0y,,0,False,,d89uvhc,rainbowgeoff,,0,7,1478286438,1475348455,False,t3_55eh0y,askgaybros,t5_2vgfw

"&gt; Politik der AfD ist Gift für uns als Exportnation

9% Außenhandelsüberschuss der Exportnation sind Gift für die Welt. Sie sind unmoralisch. Moralisch ist nur, was noch funktioniert, wenn es alle machen. - Beispiele: Deutschland kolonialisiert schwache EU Mitglieder (Balkan, Osten) als Absatzmarkt und Billiglohn-Werkbank und zerstört mit industriellen Agrarprodukten afrikanische Erzeuger und die einheimische Umwelt.

&gt; ...die Wirtschaft wächst, die Arbeitslosigkeit ist niedrig...

Die ""Wirtschaft"" ist nicht das Volk. Sie produziert Kapitalrendite für Wenige; für Arbeitseinkommen bleibt immer weniger vom Nationaleinkommen. - Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist niedrig, weil a) die Arbeit präkarisiert wird (Geringfügige Beschäftigung, Zeitarbeit = Sklavenarbeit, befristet Verträge = Unsicherheit, und b) soziale Schulden angehäuft werden (Stichwort Altersarmut)

&gt; Entscheidende Maßnahmen, um die Wirtschaft wetterfest zu machen, hat die große Koalition bisher nicht umgesetzt

Aber die Industrie, die hat geleistet! Nur zwei Konzerne, VW und Deutsche Bank haben so gut vorgesorgt, dass Strafen von bis zu 32 Milliarden Dollar drohen. Hut ab! Davon kann Deutschland 3 Jahre lang den Länderfinanzausgleich bestreiten.

&gt; Die Rente mit 63 Jahren war ein Riesenfehler. Deutschland wird in den nächsten Jahrzehnten Arbeitskräfte verlieren, während es immer mehr Rentner gibt. Wegen der steigenden Lebenserwartung darf längeres Arbeiten kein Tabu sein

Es gibt schon keine Jobs für die unter 50 jährigen. Alles, was Lonhnkosten im verarbeitenden Gewerbe verursacht, wird in Sklavenlohnländer ausgelagert. Mit China ist die Außenhandelsbilanz, atypisch zum 9%igen Gesamtüberschuss, massiv negativ. Das hat nur einen Grund: Nein, nicht die Qualität, Herr Grillo, sondern den Sklavenlohn.

&gt;Die Kosten der Energiewende steigen trotz gegenteiliger Versprechen ungebremst

Die Drittkosten der Kohleindustrie werden seit über hundert Jahren ungehemmt auf die Allgemeinheit abgewälzt. Die Schäden für Gesundheit und Umwelt zahlen die Bürger für die industriellen Großverbraucher mit. Die Endlagerung des Atommülls ist komplett ungeklärt und stellt ein Risiko für die Steuerzahler dar.

&gt; Aber keine Ausgaben in den Konsum, bitteschön. Sondern Investitionen in die Infrastruktur. Nur so gibt es nachhaltiges Wachstum und dauerhafte Beschäftigung.

Ich schlage vor, wir schalten alle Werbung in TV und Presse für ein Jahr ab: Kein Konsum, bitteschön. Das eingesparte Geld investieren die Firmen selbst und laufen nicht immer reflexartig zu Vater Staat mit der Forderung nach Fördermitteln. - Wachstum und dauerhafte Beschäftigung sind Friedmann'sche Märchen. Wachstum findet dort statt, wo Rendite winkt. Also China, Pakistan, Türkei,...- Beschäftigung kommt in der hochproduktiven Industrie im Grenzfall gar nicht mehr vor. - Wir müssen vielmehr die neoliberale Freihandelspolitik umkehren und die Handelsbilanz in zwei Ebenen ausgleichen: Geldvolumen UND Arbeitsplätze.

&gt; (TTIP)...Die Industrie sitzt nicht am Verhandlungstisch

Das ist jetzt wirklich schade, denn sonst sind es die 2500 Lobbyorganisationen in Brüssel ja gewohnt, die Verhandlungen zu diktieren.

&gt; Sinnvoll wäre es, das Beschäftigungsverbot in der Zeitarbeit vollständig abzuschaffen

Seit wann ist Präkarisierung sinnvoll? Es mag einträglich sein für die Eigner von vielleicht 50 Zeitarbeitsfirmen und deren Kunden, aber nicht für die Beschäftigten.

"Yes, but.... I think that if she spoke like she really thought all the time, she'd ruin her chances to be President, because this world for some reason (and I will not immediately blame ""human nature"") runs on being practically two-faced in order to accomplish ""goals"" with the way the media works and society metaphorically consumes itself. 

Trump is as terrifying of a presidential candidate who I could ever have imagined, and I say this without any intentional hyperbole. The majority of the Trump base who are not all ""intentional, evil fascist racists"" and are just disgruntled Americans who have yet to really immerse themselves in the -vastly- more broad definitions of culture, behavior and reason while simultaneously not achieving the overhyped ""american dream"" that was sold off with the rise of mass advertising. But the worrying thing to me is that he appears to rely on hate and action over compassion and caution, which is worrysome to me. 


Pardon the Trump rant, back on topic...

This is my problem with her and why I was committed to -not- supporting her vote for any reason up until about a month ago or so. Something genuinely clicked when I watched a John Oliver piece about scandals. He talked down all the hyped up stuff about her and did make concessions about the Uranium deal with Russia and a few other things. See the thing is on that though, he didn't mention how the wikileaks from the DNC literally have people using the words ""pay-to-play"" in their discussions about donors. It -IS- an unpopular thought because it's playing right to the special business interests that are ruining this country, and this planet. 


She's still living in the 1980's when the speed of public scrutiny allowed you to run on dishonesty and subterfuge at all costs, while saying what you need to win votes of the uninformed and people not following the money. I have, in my completely uneducated and certainly ""uninformed"" manner, been watching politics in America for the last decade or so and it's become clearer and clearer that when she says ""They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future."" she's not saying that because she understands how to fix the issues in America while not playing shady-whoo with corporate and corrupt influences. Like: FRACKING. Like: DAKOTOA PIPELINE Like: HAITI 

I mean if I could sit down with her in a room for like 30 minutes (Secret Service and all, whatever) and get her to actually tell me what she actually truly honestly feels about the ""shadow banks"" and fracking and the fact that the environment is collapsing. And I would really ask her if she could support the basic minimum wage like the have in Europe and why all the things the Republicans whine about being too expensive are actually, IMHO, easily obtained by the garbage wasteful amount we put into national defense. Et cetera....

And boy, if by some magic spell she actually had to tell the ""Truth"" and things sounded like she does want to ""save America"" from the strange and upsetting financial fuckery going on that is a result from runaway capitalism and the gigantic hold ""OIL"" has on the world.... I would drop every thing I'm doing and go campaign right now. Literally for every day, out traveling, telling people. 

But I don't. I think she's in it for herself, or her friends, or the ""powers that be"" or that she doesn't even understand that she is being used by in her honest quest for ""America', or maybe by some unknowable portion of natural greed that comes along with power and aspirations to change the world. And it pisses me off that she thinks we're uninformed. We're as informed as we can be considering all the lies you, the DNC, the media who covers for you time and time again, and the sheer millions of dollars people who support you paid to ""go online and correct scandalous information"". 

IN short: We're NOT FUCKING DUMB, Hillary. We've seen you blather about Bosnian sniper fire, and then when the pictures come out, you're getting hugged by kids. You lie in a way just like the over-successful 16-24 year old's who everyone who grew up in contemporary America remembers oh so perfectly (depending on their demographic, I guess) and dislike heavily. And that's not a bad or evil thing, but no one wants to vote for that in numbers enough to beat a fucking raging bigoted fuckwad who likes to make fun of disabled people and minorities in enough of a landslide to convince people that they shouldn't also behave like raging bigoted fascists too. Tell us what you're actually doing like a semi-honest person like Bernie Sanders, or get the hell out of the running because you're going to doom us all playing politician.

"I've nothing too major, an accumulation of smaller things, they still cast a few shadows though. 

My mother's parents were first cousins, which means most of their family disowned them. 

My father's sister had a long running affair with a married man, he promised her he loved her and they would run away together but he pulled out, cold shouldered her and she ended up committing suicide. 

Two of my second cousins are cracked. They live in a huge old house on a big farm. Their father was a real ""mammy's boy"", and married to a woman he didn't know within two weeks of her death, he was in his late forties at that stage. There was a lot of trouble in that house. She hired a man to kill him, she disowned her children, he was extremely wealthy through stocks or something, but he hid it all. After he died no one knew where the money was, so the mental state of his children just kind of deteriorated. The house started falling down around them but they dont care. Theyre hoarders now, I think it's a feeble attempt at recollecting their families former glory...


On a similar note: I think my dads parents were very wealthy. They sent their daughter to Europe to college (which was unheard of where I live), and they sent my dad to an agricultural college, which again was odd as most young men just took over the farm without formal education on the runnings of it. They also remodelled their house extensively, it was built of stone and so quite cold, they basically added extra internal walls of drywall/wood throughout the whole house. Ive no idea where all the money went or what happened, they were definitely much wealthier than the average person in my area.

We know Scotland doesn't have a veto because it doesn't have EU membership of its own right. No Scottish government representative has ever signed the Treaty on European Union.

So what we're saying, then, is political affiliation doesn't count for much, since a particular party may change its views arbitrarily, and the only thing a platform can promise is inconsistency.

Good.

&gt;Everything important about a party is  is determined by the people in it. The Republican Party is now the party that fights for the interests of conservative Christians. It was not always that way, but it is now.

I do not accept that as a reality, based primarily on the sheer impotence of the GOP to do anything in the Conservative Christians' interests.


&gt;This is a merely utilitarian point. 

We live in a utilitarian society. Whether that is *right* or *just* is not really relevant to our discussion. You cannot ignore the reality of what is in favor of your idealism. You cannot ascribe to an all-or-nothing fanaticism. We have to work within the broken system.

&gt;The purpose of electing pro-life politicians is not to lower abortion rates any more than the point of electing anti-Nazi politicians is to lower the number of concentration camps. 

We are not in a state where criminalizing abortion will be effectively legislated. As Pope Benedict stated, if we can make MOVEMENTS toward a more moral society, then we ought to do so. Incremental steps are necessary here.

One could very well argue it would be *better* to have limited the casualties in the holocaust than to, say, simply protest that there be no holocaust at all. 

Unless, of course, you would like to be the one holding that banner of war. Yet I have seen no revolutionary camps led by /u/Thomist.

&gt;Lowering"" is the wrong goal. It trains us to think that things are getting ""better"" when they are not. 

So if you had to choose between a party that effectively has lowered abortion vs a party that has effectively done nothing to limit abortion, which would you choose?

Don't tell me you'd seriously draw a line in the sand and say, ""Nope, it's all or nothing, and if more Children have to die because of my unrealistic idealism, then so be it!""

&gt;The only acceptable number is zero. And if it is not zero, the people responsible for making it nonzero should be punished. This is the obligation of the law, which exists to do justice. 

No arguments. So what has the GOP done again?

&gt;But we're talking about abortion, 

In a wider context of the GOP being an unreliable party to support, yes. I'll use whatever damnable evidence I can to convince my fellow Catholics of this. 

&gt;The judges appointed by the GOP are the only reason this country has not gone more and more insane. (Compare the US to [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_v_Canada_(Attorney_General)) and Western Europe to see how far the madness can go.) But have fun with your court full of more Sotomayors and Kagans and Ginsburgs, if Scalia and Alito aren't good enough for you.

I'm still waiting for you to show me evidence where having GOP judges has actually been a GOOD thing. Because, as I've said (and as history shows us), GOP judges are at best impotent when it comes to enacting any pro life law. 

You made an attempt by treating Scalia as our salvation: ""He MIGHT have voted against it, which would not have done anything effective, but at least he MIGHT have taken a stand, dammit!""

Head on over to /r/dgu to see. I haven't seen the numbers lately so I could be off by a lot, but IIRC the most conservative estimate is 500k times per year. I carry every day and it's protected me from getting robbed, but that's purely anecdotal.

"&gt; I think you mistake exactly what the Act of Union was. That was a union of the crowns, not the creation of a UK-wide EU equivalent. The result of combining the crowns was to create a single, unitary state. That was the intended result and not some trick that Scotland fell for.

Not only is this irrelevant, it's also inaccurate. Inaccurate because the Union of the Crowns and the Act of Union are two separate things which happened 100 years apart. The Crowns were united in 1603, the state was created in 1707. Irrelevant because most peoples views on the constitution and politics probably have probably changed somewhat in the last 300 years. I don't think you can really claim that Scotland as a nation did anything in 1707, it was 221 years before universal sufferage ffs. A few barons agreed to it =/= the nation agreeing to it.

"In terms of food try and find a pub that serves a nice Sunday carvery. An unexpected Irish delicacy would be a lunchtime chicken fillet roll, get it with lettuce and mayo at the least, any respectable Centra or Spar will have it at the Deli area. As others have recommended you need to get a full Irish breakfast, aka a fry, also try a breakfast roll. Meat and diary products should taste very different from America so experiment, try some lamb, brisket etc. Get a glass of milk and get your dad to try some Guinness.

Where to visit based on your preferences.. Keep in mind Dublin city will be quite similar albeit a bit smaller than your typical European capital. You'll notice the architecture will stand out as being quite eclectic, modern mixed in with the old, lots of twisty roads and paths very unlike the very structured American city blocks. Dublin city has some great touristy attractions, I'd recommend spending one day just exploring the city centre. Some of my favourite sites are the Guinness Brewery tour, Jameson Distillery tour, Kilmainham Prison, Dublin Castle, Trinity College Grounds and Trinity Science Gallery (Free for Entry), St. Stephens Green, National Leprechaun Museum and Temple Bar! Avoid the Wax Museum.

If you want to experience the Ireland you see on TV and movies leave Dublin.

I'd highly recommend [Portumna Forest Park](http://www.oaklodgeportumna.ie/sites/default/files/styles/things_to_do_fullsize/public/portumna-forest-park.jpg?itok=ckYthziR) in Galway, [Gougane Barra Forest Park](http://www.gouganebarrahotel.com/uploads/images/headerimages/Around%20here/Coillte%20Forest%20Park/sli-an-easa.jpg) in Cork and [Avondale Forest Park](http://coillteonfilm.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Avondale_12.jpg) in Wicklow.

"[Professor Dougan talked about this in his response to the Treasury Select Committee.](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/the-uks-future-economic-relationship-with-the-european-union/oral/34854.html) I'll quote the specific sections:

Helen Goodman:  Is there not a risk that a speedy withdrawal could mean that we have no legal cover whatsoever, for example on agriculture.  It is the most obvious example, but there are other examples too.  Could you just say something about that and how one might handle that issue?

Professor Dougan: EU legislation applies in the UK without any form of domestic transposition, either by Act of Parliament or by statutory instrument.  If we leave without having made a conscious political choice that that legislation needs to be replaced—whether it is replaced in the sense of pure replication or whether it is replaced in the sense of a new statutory regime that differs from the current norms—the danger is that will simply disappear from our legal system upon the point of withdrawal.  We will be left with legal vacuums where suddenly we do not have any regulation of important parts of the economy and society. 

This does not just apply to agriculture.  It applies to important parts of environmental policy and consumer rights.  It applies to quite significant parts of financial services regulation.  All across the legal system there are pockets of our law—EU regulations in particular—that will need to be put on to a firm statutory instrument basis.  If we do not do that, they will disappear.  To be frank, it will wreak havoc with the authority of public bodies to take legally binding decisions and with the legal relations of individuals and businesses.  It is a job that really needs to be done.

Q85            Helen Goodman: Are you suggesting that, in parallel with the withdrawal process and negotiation—we will come on to when Article 50 is triggered in a moment—we need to be introducing primary domestic legislation on all these big four areas that you have mentioned?

**Professor Dougan: I would go further.  I am suggesting something quite a lot more thorough than that.  Also, in fields where there is statutory implementation of EU law and statutory instruments transposing EU law into UK law, we will need to double check all of it.  Much of that legislation will simply make cross‑references to EU legislation or it might confer decision-making powers upon EU bodies or agencies.**

**It might well be that the legal basis of some of these statutory instruments is not entirely secure.  It is not just about the areas of UK law that derive directly from the EU through directly effective EU regulations; the whole legal system needs to be checked to make sure that we do not inadvertently wreak chaos upon the authority of our public bodies and the security of individual relationships.**

He goes into more detail on issues related to this, you can read it in the link above from Q82 onwards.

"I lived in Madrid, Spain for 14 months in 2015-2016. Currently I live in Southern California and have lived in socal prior to Spain for the past 15 years.

This was a apartment in the center of the city and my wife and I eating out every night and taking a month of travel In August. We were living very comfortably on 40k euro a year.

Having said that, Spain is middle of the pack expensive. Italy, Greece, Croatia, most of the Eastern European countries (Czech, Hungary) are much less. 

We could have bought an apartment in the city for less that 200k euros which is pretty decent when mortgage rates their are less than 1%

"It happens with most governments - including the UK's. Looking at this it seems they thought they could put the spending on the EU account, but the ONS pointed out they couldn't due to technicalities. However, if they can fix those problems (which they seem to be trying to) then everything will be fine.

It's partly why the EU has this huge team of auditors who go through all public spending in far more detail than most national government auditors do - making sure that what was claimed was within the rules, and claiming back as much as possible that wasn't.

Sometimes this is done deliberately by Governments; iirc there was a bit of a problem during the recession with national governments having to pull out of co-funded projects due to needing to cut their budgets, but wanting the projects to go on anyway so just putting all the cost on the EU. Of course, as soon as the accounts go through a year or so down the line the EU refuses to pay it, and the national or local government has to pay it anyway, but it keeps the spending from their accounts for a bit...",t1_d89o9ko,,0,False,,d89xr3y,DukePPUk,,1,3,1478287843,1475352953,False,t3_55d5x9,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv

"&gt; Well... Looking at the statistics from the latest civil war, 86% of Syrian refugees will return to Syria

Oh... you're so naïve.

&gt; and to my knowledge, there has never been any problems with the Turkish population of Germany? 

Yeah there is... German government is systematically importing Turks to replace Germans. Germans are going to go extinct. And it's all thanks to this program.


&gt; What about countries that are unable to be self sufficient? What should they do? """"political"" aspect of the economy"", that thing already exists, it is called embargoes, and IIRC the EU already has two or three of those going. (Russia and DPRK, and I think there is one more)

Not talking about autarky. Just saying that our economy should be a lot more ""political"" rather than ""mechanical"". Just because moving some machines over there, and some people over here would make more short term profits, doesn't mean that it's good in any MEANINGFUL sense outside of pure economics. Nation is about a lot more than economy. And completely ""boundless trade"" reduces it to just an economic zone. You can't take on any big long term projects with that world view.

&gt; WHAT? No it isn't. Some of human kinds most amazing discoveries and inventions were made with peace in mind. Then those have been used for war, yes, but it is relatively few examples that are the other way around. 

Maybe I didn't mean to use the word ""peace"", but pacifism definitely. This whole attitude of ""live and let live"", ""life is short so go on and have fun""... these are terrible for the prospects of our people.

&gt; If you would stop using a website that mostly has Wikipedia as its primary sources, and start finding more realiabel sources yourself, that would be great.

Yes, but Wikipedia is citing official data from Danish government. Where are you getting YOUR data from?

&gt; This means that all countries have to face the same, or equal, trial, when applying for citizenship.

Yeah? When did I say anything other than that? I reject mass immigration no matter where it's from - Sweden or Somalia. Reject them all equally.

&gt; Article 13: ""(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.

First of all, UN has literally zero authority on anything. They're just a forum.  
Second of all, the keyword here is **within** the borders of each state. That's basically saying no state should have apartheid where one peoples is delegated to one side of the country and the other peoples to the other.

&gt; So you can't really do more, it is already really tough to get into the EU.

Are you talking about the freedom of movement in the EU? You do realize that that only applies for living and working, right? Denmark has literally zero obligations to grant them citizenships. Oh, and I'm against EU's free movement nonsense.

&gt; So if a stateless person comes to, let's say France, they have to give him nationality. If he passes the tests ofc.

That's not what it means holy shit... they're basically talking here about STATELESS PEOPLE:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness  
  
and not just everyone who enters your territory.

"Telephony was initially a local technology, as the early battery-powered instruments could only communicate a few miles.  So unlike the telegraph, telephones were initially used only for communication between people in the same city.  Small telephone networks began to be established in business centers, serving communication between businesses, but wealthy businessmen and doctors soon saw the value of having instruments at home as well.

Unlike the European experience, where telephony (like telegraphy) was seen as an extension of post-office service, US telephone companies were private enterprises.  Within a few years of Alexander Graham Bell’s invention in 1876, telephone exchanges existed in most major cities and many smaller towns in the United States, operating under licenses from what Bell and his investor partners established as the American Bell Telephone Company.  After most of the Bell patents expired in 1894, telephone companies sprang up even in small towns, and in cities of any size it was not uncommon to have competing companies—a development spurred by invention of the automatic exchange in 1892.  Old advertisements will sometimes highlight two different phone numbers for the same business, saying things like “Phone Main 6200 or Automatic 4882.”  [This 1910 map](http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~200183~3000108:Lines-Of-The-Bell-Telephone-Compani?trs=242&amp;sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&amp;mi=124&amp;qvq=q%3Abatch001%3Bsort%3APub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No%3Blc%3ARUMSEY~8~1#) shows how the Bell  companies had concentrated on business centers of the East, and how sparse service—and especially connection to nearby towns—was across the West.

Beginning in 1907, the Bell System’s Thomas Vail sought to bring much of the nation’s phone service under control of a single enterprise, carefully structured to avoid antitrust problems.  Regional operating companies provided local phone service, but typically purchased all equipment from the Bell System’s Western Electric subsidiary, and used AT&amp;T Long Lines Division for long-distance connections.  Competing local phone companies soon disappeared, but some important pockets were served by General Telephone or other independent companies rather than Ma Bell.  Though Bell eventually controlled 80 percent of American phones, they only controlled 30 percent of the geographic area. After 1949, the Rural Electrification Admistration began to support expansion of rural telephone coöperatives to provide service in sparsely settled areas—the only significant involvement of government in US telephone service.

This landscape shifted dramatically after the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, as the regional “Baby Bells” first became independent of the Bell System, then combined with each other and with General Telephone to confront the growth of mobile phone service in a drastically different antitrust environment.

"Regiomontano here.

1) I personally haven't seen any obstacles for people wanting to go to Europe. I have many friends who have been exchange students in UK, Spain, France and Germany. And many more who have travelled around Europe just for vacation without any issues.

2) Friends who have been in Germany and Spain have told me we mexicans can sometimes be mistaken for turks, which might not be as well-perceived as mexicans (you can fact-check this one more than I).

3) To some degree. I think regiomontanos (and people from northeastern states) are very well proud of our heritage. But not near as close as americans are from theirs.

4) That we're lazy or that we don't have developed cities. - I think the first one comes from the fact that we have an education crisis and that many of the people we have working in the government are uneducated thus making many poor choices, causing people to work twice to solve those problems. But I think that speaks more about the educational problem than it does for the working person's ideology. - About the second one: yes, half of our population is in extreme poverty, but inequality doesn't negate the stupidly rich and well developed parts of Mexico.

"&gt;For those cases where contraception fails, its unfortunately but it is a risk you take, but new born babies are very much in demand in regards to adoption.   

May you please link an article that shows that new born babies are very much in demand? Also, are you saying that new born babies of whatever gender/race/mental/physical disability? Because I know for sure the percentage of what type of child/baby is adopted differs tremendously. Also, even if the percentage of newborns are high in demand, you're basically telling the ones who are aged 1-17 to fuck off because that, yet again, is lessening their chances of getting adopted.


&gt;but a bad start to life is better than no start to life, no chance to experience or exist?   

And why do you come upon this assumption? A fetus has does not know what they are missing out on, neither the good, nor the bad. The fetus could in fact be used to help stem cell research and therefore save peoples lives. 

&gt;However, i am not atall for forcing people to have birth / deny them abortion if they are still under the set stage, so you could think of it that i am pro choice in that regard   

Well that's good :). As long as you are not protesting abortion clinics and people who are having abortions, then you can think this way as long as you want. There's a certain point where your preference should not affect someone's life, so i'm glad you see it this way :).

&gt;, i feel we as a taxpayer should not be funding peoples abortions and it should be out of their own pocket unless for the exemptions.  

I don't know what the taxpayer system is like in europe, but in the us, medicare tax will increase, medicaid as well, more money will have to go towards food stamps and care.


&gt;waste of potential life.

here's a part where I disagree with you. It's not a waste, earlier in this response i wrote about stem cell research? I highly recommend looking into it and maybe it will change your perspective a tiny bit.

 They were fully convinced that the Allies started the aggressions by printing these types of posters, and the Axis retaliated because ""Anyone would get mad and fight if they were made fun of like that"". They also figured the Allies making these posters ""was way worse than Pearl Harbor"" because they just googled Pearl Harbor ""and it wasn't that bad"".

 In a very calm manner I replied kind of giving (obviously) a broad overview of how things unfolded in a  very ""basic 101"" manner.


  Nope !  No Dice !!!  They were not having it. The Americans put out these mean posters, The Japanese got offended and went to war.

"Depends on your point of view, and in short ""it's complicated"".  This is all from memory so might be a bit wrong:

Arduino was founded by 5 people.  One of the founders owned the fab which made the boards, and at some point trademarked the Arduino name in Europe allegedly without telling the rest of the group.  The Fab owner then fell out with the rest of the founders and sold his fab company and shares in Arduino to another person.  What happened next depends on your point of view:  one view is that Arduino LLC successfully trademarked the Arduino name in the US but discovered that it had already been trademarked in Europe.  The new fab owner renamed the fab company to Arduino Srl, claimed that the company was the ""real"" Arduino and started making money off the whole thing himself.  The other view is that when he bought the shares in Arduino he asked to see the company financials, but the rest of the group refused and tried to shut him out.  He reacted defensively by trying to keep what he saw as the ""real"" Arduino afloat by recreating everything which made Arduino what it was but under his control.  Cue two different companies claiming to be the real arduino suing each other.  This is why Genuino boards were created:  Arduino LLC owned the US trademark but Arduino Srl owned the European trademark, so Arduino LLC had to rebrand as Genuino in Europe.

"&gt; If the Germans won, and Hitler remained in power, you can be sure that they would have gone ahead with GPO.

It's unlikely and anyway all we can do is to speculate about this point. Furthermore you may never know, perhaps if Third Reich didn't fall in 1945 something similar to de-stalinization might have occurred once Hitler would have died. If we think about it Stalin's death followed by Kruscev's rule was what pretty much ended the period of terror in the USSR, while Soviet's row of crimes and violations of human rights lasted at least until Gorbachev's Perestrojka, at least they were really toned down. Now let's imagine a post-Stalin USSR led by Lavrentij Berija, it would have easily become a far worse regime than Third Reich.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I don't like the Soviets, I don't like the Germans, I don't like even the Japanese

Now for the Japanese is a bit different but this is another argument. Anyway it's not a matter of like or not like, it's a matter of being objective. We can't simply justify as revenge the thousands of slaughters, loots and rapes the Soviet committed in Western Europe but also in the Baltic Countries and in Poland.

so you think you can win a game that has one winner and one loser.  and you think you will be the winner! 


see stocks are not zero sum as the company produces profit and that profit goes into the market.  you buy a stock. for 100 dollars it makes ten dollars profit and issues 10 dollars dividend then you sell it for 100 dollars.   100+10 -100 = 10 see not zero sum.  

however gambling is negative sum. at least in america by law casions have to pay out 70% or something so gambling is -30% 

but foregin currency is zero sum. for every dollar you make someone loses a dollar.  so it is better than gambling.  but it is not postiive sum. and so you will not be able to compete with the cheaters.  so you will lose.

"&gt;In countries with a large majority ethnic population, the vast majority of the predominant group will probably breed with each other, since all other factors aside there wouldn't be enough minority partners for the majority to couple with. However, for minority groups, the opposite is likely to be true as even with some degree of self-segregation and in-group preference, there are comparatively few potential in-group partners to choose from. Confirming to what extent this actually occurs has to be done through statistical research rather than anecdote (I expect there is some data on this, but I don't know what it actually is). But in my case, for instance, (I am white but live in Japan), my experience and the behaviour of the few other white people I know IRL who live here supports this.

Well, that's not really our problem. If the minorities find life here difficult or find it hard to find members of the opposite sex of their own group to have sex and reproduce with, then they should go to a place where they are a higher percentage of the population.

The Japanese have enviable policies. Their policies on immigration are what we should be doing; protect the ethnic identity and domination of your people in your own country.

&gt;I don't consider it a 'waste' of resources to protect people against mass killings, torture, totalitarianism, etc. There must be rationing and triage, as well as a weighing of the risks of interventionalism, but that is not an objection to the principle of it. Further, non-interventionalism is also strategically dangerous because it creates opportunities for authoritarian states like China and Russia to expand their own ideological influence and acquire economic resources that could be used to damage or subsume liberal states.

I believe we should remain as isolationist as possible (the entire West should, but us Irish at least). It is not our duty to help these people, and we shouldn't waste our time trying. The Middle East got itself into this mess and should fix it of its own accord. We should be focusing on the needs of our native people, not the needs of outsiders on a different continent.

&gt;This example works as far as it goes, because there is no absolutely no institutional continuity, but that makes it unlike any kind of realistic situation. It's not an sufficient argument against ethnic population transfers in general, just against a high pace and low integration.

I know it's a bit of an extreme example, but as shown in previous sources that I linked about (one from 2011, no less) white Britons are actually a minority in London now, and under-five Germans are almost a minority too. And the children are what we need to examine, as they're the future of the nation. But still, we need to regain our sense of ethnic identity and severely restrict immigration and kick out as many illegals as we can.

&gt;To the degree you're making it, this is a speculative argument, because there isn't a scientific consensus on the degree to which this is caused by generic or environmental factors. It's generally a pointless argument to have between non-experts who aren't engaging in original research, so I've stated what policies I would favour if new information led to a consensus close to common alt-right hopes.

I suppose so, but at the same time, this occurs all over the world. The average IQ is carried with them wherever they go, whether it be Europe, America or Africa. So there must be a genetic factor to it. I'm not saying genetics is the only factor, but it must be a large factor.

&gt;but there are also severe ethical and economic opportunity costs to putting draconian limits on population sizes based on a one-sided hypothesis.

I understand the economic arguments, but what are the ethical ones exactly? Does each ethnic group not have a right to self-determination and domination over its own nation?

&gt;Although it is a febrile situation, Merkel's immigration policies are just bad because she turns on a dime repeatedly based on extremely short-term trends in public opinion. They have also been a major, possibly decisive cause of Brexit, which is likely hurt Germany in many ways.

"I agree with their historical importance and dominance at the time. I also definitely agree with some of their innovation being a huge part as well which is hard to compare. 

Diamond and Alex Ich changed the way the jungle works, and in S2 they were almost untouchable. xPeke at this prime was a monster and even out of his prime managed to be so massive for his team. 

I think though, we have seen the fall of those players. Diamond changed the jungle but since then he has been outclassed in some pretty huge ways. The same for Alex, he was this aggressive monster that just oppressed whoever he played against, but he fell off and hard. Froggen is a little different in that he still puts up impressive numbers and seems to have improved along with every else around him. 

Bjergsen has just been untouched as far as his skill since he came on the scene by other western players. Many comparisons to Faker have been made, and I think they are warranted. Bjergsen brings a map-wide gravitational pull with him to every game. The enemy team HAS to deal with him, and there isn't an option to leave him alone.

With xPeke as the example here - you can tilt Soaz and outmuscle his botlane with all your jungle pressure, maybe a TP here or there. When you do this, you can let xPeke sit in a 1v1 and your midlaner can just hold on.

Substitute in Bjergsen in that same situation and it will change a lot. Bjerg will come out with a huge CS lead and probably a solo kill or two, and then carry that lead out to the map. You MUST respond to him.

He has the aggressively overpowering nature of Alex Ich, the late game control and teamfight mastery that Froggen does, and he has proven himself (after this long now) to be an excellent team player and rallying point like xPeke was.

"Really good article. Though I disagree with a lot of Blair's policy choices, you've got to respect the quality of the political machine and Campbell was obviously excellent at his job. 

Three key lessons come out of that for me that any wing seeking power needs to consider:

 - Keep your eye on the voters. Always respond to voter concerns because if you don't they can blow up in your face. 

 - Don't let personal feuds get in the way of what's best for the party and the country. 

 - Develop talent across the party. Blair's biggest failing by far was stifling talent and not providing a healthy field of successors. 

And Labour talent is Labour talent whatever wing it comes from. True leadership quality is hard to come by, you can't be too picky. You've got to trust the overall makeup of the party to ground you.

There's an important distinction to be made as well between voter thoughts and voter concerns. A lot of people worry they have to be exactly like the public on every issue. What matters most is matching them on the things they consider important.  

The current top four concerns are:

1) Immigration
2) Europe
3) NHS
4) Economy

I actually ended up with a puppy from another state from a breeder who doesn't even have a website.  It's all through word of mouth on purebred dog and boxer forums.  She has secret Facebook groups for puppy buyers once you're approved.  

I sent an email detailing why I wanted a Boxer, my experience with dogs, my experience with Boxers, my family and housing situation.  When the breeder got back to me she said she'd usually have lots of questions but I'd answered most of them. I think she asked me at that point if I had a colour preference or a male/female preference.

"To be honest, you can work your way through university in the US far easier than going abroad, so I think you're forgetting a third option here.  

Some of your top countries are not cheap at all to study in (Denmark is about €10k/year for non-EU students), and/or have very expensive cost of living.  On top of tuition, you need to demonstrate money in the bank to at least cover what is deemed typical student living expenses in that country (typically €7-10k/year), most typically for the entire course of study - so 3-4 years worth for a bachelors program, as a condition of getting a student visa.  In all countries you mention, the vast majority of undergraduate programs are not taught in English.  The few that are will be very restricted in fields of study and a large proportion of them will be at private universities which are usually extremely expensive.

Then don't forget the cost of air tickets home if you want to go back say once a year.

"Here is a blog on the complexities of tarriffs on oranges.

https://tradebetablog.wordpress.com/2016/09/10/oranges-litmus-test/

&gt; The EU’s import duties on oranges are designed to reduce the flow of imports at harvest time and avoid prices falling as Mediterranean orange growers put their produce on the market. They are complex in three ways:

&gt; they have two components: a percentage of the price plus an amount in euros per tonne
they change every few weeks or months
oranges also have a tariff quota
This is spelt out in the EU’s WTO “schedules”, its lists of commitments to keep tariffs within binding ceilings (the actual duty rates charged in this case are the same or close to these).

&gt; The tariff commitments for “sweet” oranges are:

&gt; April — 10.4% (of the price) + €71 per tonne
&gt; first half of May — 4.8% + €71 per tonne
&gt; second half of May — 3.2% + €71 per tonne
&gt; June to mid-October — 3.2%
&gt; mid-October to end of November — 16%
&gt; December to March — 16% + €71 per tonne

Just one product. 

Which needs to be negotiated with a multitude of others.

Even if the UK decided on no tariffs on imports, the EU would reject tariffs free trade as this would damage Mediterranean orange production.

That's just one product. ",t1_d89k5fh,,0,False,,d8a57fc,ScoobyDoNot,,0,3,1478291466,1475364641,False,t3_55c35d,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb

"Central and Southern Mexico had big native civilizations, so when the Spanish conquered those areas, the societal makeup was mostly natives and mestizos (people of mixed Spanish and native descent) with a white European elite (that usually had some standing in Europe too).

In the West and the North there was no large native civilizations (mostly due to weather and lack of water), and natives there were nomads that had more in common with Comanches or Apaches. The people that settled these regions were mostly European settlers (that usually were not rich) and mestizos, kinda (50/50 or 40/60 either way). 

As you can see, there's a big difference in the origins of ""Mexico"", with the real Mexico being mostly the Central and South part.

&gt; Maya Jane Coles (aka Nocturnal Sunshine), is a London, UK tech house / deep house / techno producer / DJ / musician / songwriter. She débuted with the single ""Sick Panda"" (2008, Dogmatik Records) and her latest is the EP ""Focus Now"" (May 2011, 20:20 Vision).

&gt; 2010 has certainly been the year that 23 year old Maya Jane Coles announced herself as one of the most talented up and coming artists in electronic music.

&gt; In the years preceding a steady output of techy cuts on labels such as Dogmatik and 1trax simmered away catching the attention of cluded up heads and savy A&amp;R people alike. It was her début EP on Franck Roger’s Real Tone though that ignited the fire of hype and boosted her profile on the global stage receiving heavy support from the house &amp; techno elite. Aside from being hammered repeatedly on the worlds most happening dance floors ‘What They Say’ reached the number 1 spot on across the board; Beatport Deep House Chart No. 1, Tarxsource top download &amp; Resident Advisors most charted tracks for October. It’s safe to say the release won the hearts and heads of fans and critics a like and a landmark year was topped off with a nomination for Best Breakthrough Producer nomination in the DJ Mag Best of British awards.

&gt; Not one to fall victim to the pitfalls of being one of the scenes ‘buzz names’, Maya has built on her flourishing reputation with a slew of gigs across Europe holding her own alongside world renounced DJs. So much so her schedule for 2011 is already jam packed with dates across Europe; London’s Fabric, Batofar, Watergate, not to mention iconic Glastonbury Festival, just a few of the destinations.

&gt; Maya’s productions take’s influence from a diverse range of musical styles and British – Japanese heritage. Her talents are by no means confided to realms of house and techno. Under the guise of her live dub/electronica outfit, ‘She Is Danger (alongside the multi-instrumentalist/singer Lena Cullen) she has remixed the likes of Massive Attack and Gorillaz and fans of her Dubstep Product under the name Nocturnal Sunshine include key tastemakers, Joy Orbison and Sucba to name a few.

&gt; As well as her trademark bass heavy approach Maya’s diversity as a producer also shines through in productions under her own name as well. Climbing high in Beatport’s ‘Chillout’ top 100 tracks from her stunning ‘Humming Bird’ EP on Hypercolour showcase her blissful vocals and ability to create songs and not just music for the dance floor. Forthcoming EPs on Anja Schneider’s Mobilee Records and for a number highly anticipated exclusives will no doubt elevate her status even further.

&gt; A bright talent with more than a couple of strings to her bow Maya Jane Coles is only just getting started. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Marillion are a rock band formed in Aylesbury, England .  Their 30-year career is marked by two distinctive phases; the early years fronted by Fish which saw their greatest commercial success, and much longer period fronted by Steve Hogarth in which the band have constantly re-invented themselves so as to continue to be relevant into the 21st century.

&gt; The Fish era is often categorized as neo-progressive. They originally started as ""Silmarillion"" (from Tolkien's book) with heavy influences from classic Genesis but went on to develop their own distinctive sound. The band was formed in 1979 by Mick Pointer (drums), Steve Rothery (guitar), Doug 'Rastus' Irvine (bass), and others, soon adding vocalist Fish (real name Derek W. Dick), Diz Minitt (bass), and Brian Jelliman. By the time of their first album, 1983's Script for a Jester's Tear, the bass position had been taken over by Pete Trewavas and keyboards by Mark Kelly.

&gt; The studio albums Fugazi (1984), Misplaced Childhood (1985), and Clutching at Straws (1987), as well as the 1984 live album Real to Reel all sold respectably, and the band scored a hit single in Britain with Kayleigh in 1985.

&gt; When Fish left the band in 1988 after four albums he was replaced by Steve Hogarth. A former member of The Europeans and some-time collaborator with The The and Julian Cope, Hogarth brought a new energy to the band. 

&gt; Across a further ten albums, Hogarth – along with existing members Rothery, Kelly, Trewavas, and Mosley – have reinvigorated and constantly redefined Marillion’s sound. They forged into new musical territories with a succession of inventive, emotional albums, displaying little regard to the vagaries of hit charts or radio playlists. 

&gt; After the release of 1999’s marillion.com the band freed themselves from record company pressure once and for all by launching their own record label, the Intact imprint.

&gt; Thanks to their pioneering embrace of the Internet through their website http://marillion.com, Marillion have developed a unique and intimate relationship with their fans. From sponsoring entire tours of the USA to funding the recording of recent albums, Marillion’s global fan-base is unique in its affection and dedication. As a result, such passionate, wholesale support has allowed Marillion to step outside of the conventional music industry and find their own path.  

&gt; In 2001 Anoraknophobia saw Marillion take the groundbreaking step of asking fans to pre-order an album 12 months before release. An amazing 12,000 people signed up, helping to finance the recording. The band once again took pre-orders for the 2004 release Marbles, but this time the money was channelled into a campaign fund to promote its launch. The success of singles Don't Hurt Yourself and You're Gone – the latter making it all the way to number 7 – vindicated the band's independent strategy. 

&gt; Their 2007 album Somewhere Else reached number 24 in the UK album chart with their most recent single Thankyou Whoever You Are hitting the UK singles chart at number 15. The band shows no signs of fading away after more than 25 years of activity.

&gt; Their 15th album, ""Happiness is the road"", was physically released in October 2008 but was originally available exclusively from the band's website. It was released with little promotion and a deluxe pre-order package was made available as with Marbles. 'Happiness is the Road' is  the second studio double album of a long career (2004's Marbles was the other). A UK and European tour followed the album's release, and the band is taking special effort to record every show in the ""Happiness on the Road"" tour, making the recordings available from the band's website.

"No one cares about Native americans at the time. There was no need to ""Hide"" or ""coverup"" their murders.

Same with the Ottoman Empire, they were already at war with Armenians and Russian invaders working together. They had no reason to ""try to cover it up."" 

Hell the Germans had done something much more genocidal in Africa in the early 1900s. The Belgians had done something much more genocidal in Africa in 1905. The Russians were already exterminating Jews throughout the 1900s. The Nazis later, had no reason to coverup their genocide until they started losing the war and could see their defeat on the horizon. The Ottomans collapsed but the Turkish republic won their war in open warfare with the Republic of Armenia. Again... no genocide was necessary.

The Germans were already being accused of being barbarians and every single warcrime in WWI.

The Ottomans were ALREADY at war with the European powers, what is there to hide?? 

There was nothing to hide... They publicly declared the orders to relocate Armenians. They didn't hide it.

The US forces publicly moved the Cherokees from Georgia and they publicly declared it ""The Indian Removal Act.""

Imagine a law today that was called ""The African-American Removal Act."" They didn't hide anything.  They were proud of kicking out ""savage Native Indians.""

They were proud of it... It was ethnic cleansing... An evil attempt to GRAB LAND... It was not genocide though.

No matter how EVIL the action is, it's not genocide until it fits the definition.

Again: LOOK up the term genocide.

**Opening a business bank account under 2-member LLC, one of whom is based in EU?**
&gt;Hey! 
&gt; 
&gt; Me (based in US) and my friend (based in EU) want to register an LLC and open a bank account in the US for our business (also based in the US). I know registering a two member LLC shouldn't be an issue even with one of the members outside of US.
&gt; 
&gt; However, will there be any problems with opening a business bank account for that LLC? Does the bank require for both members to be US-based, or will it suffice that one of them is based in the US?

Offensive Rebounding.

Capela is elite.
Noel is just average.

"Iran's role decisive in regional equations

---

&gt;* 'Iran plays a decisive role in regional equations,' Brigadier General Hossein Dehghan said on Saturday in a meeting of the provincial administrative council in Iran's southwestern provincial capital city of Shahr-e Kord.

&gt;* 'Today the world is counting on Iran and the Islamic Republic is capable of affecting regional equations,' General Dehghan said.

&gt;* 'Iran in the region is the most stable, powerful and secure country and compared to its neighbors the Islamic Republic has the best economic situation,' he said.

&gt;* The Iranian defense minister also said the Islamic Republic is the only country that could claim it is seriously fighting terrorism, extremism and violence.

&gt;* 'By relying on its power and supremacy, the Islamic Republic of Iran can assert their stance on the global scene.'

Is Putin suggesting that the United States would engage in a nuclear first strike?

The only meaningful use case of THAAD against Russia would be to potentially limit Russia's tactical nuclear weapons capability.

"That's wrong. Let's take India as an example. Britain focused on making it into a base for power in Asia. As such, they built a strong army to project power into other countries, railways and irrigation systems to assist the economy in order to fund the army and humongous trade deficit with Britain, and an education system to staff the administrative positions with natives rather than shipping over overpaid Britons (by 1887, only 6000 of 21,000 mid-level administrative positions were held by Europeans). Due to the large population of India and the foresight of Britain to put some effort into the place, India is a great power that, while incredibly poor, is respected by other major countries.

Now lets say the British had for some reason decided to just remove the Indians from India. Assuming they could pull it off, they would have to resettle the land. Judging by their experiences in Africa, they would not have been able to get many colonists to come over. By independence, India would have a few hundred thousand people at most. The rich Indian soil and resources would be coveted by all who surround it, and eventually China or someone would invade and colonize the place.

"The **Epheria Sailboat** - *Materials List* (personal trading ship, not the guild galley) is:

​**Plans: Epheria Epheria Sailboat** (daily quest) X **20**


[Standardized Timber Square](http://bddatabase.net/us/item/4685/) X **800**


[Steel](http://bddatabase.net/us/item/4077) X **600**


[Pine Plywood](http://bddatabase.net/us/item/4658) **1500**


[Flax Fabric](http://bddatabase.net/us/item/5856) X **300**

I had worked out most of the materials for earlier [posting to KR forums  like this one](http://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=161542&amp;site=black) (site sometimes down it seems; excluding the STS which was confused in translations)

The exact materials were confirmed[ in a recent video posted](https://youtu.be/90p8aS19REA?t=22s) (link posted by /u/Shamend to the *MaMaoPrince Streaming* Discord last week) which had the English translated current KR content (allow for names not totally accurate such as the 'Dieppe Ria sailboat' which is just the literal translation of the Epheria nameused in EU/NA).

The STS will be the tough one as the Logs required can only be gathered manually not by workers, or via the Market Place and requires a huge amount.

Consider there are **3220** separate work processes to construct this ship which take it seems 1-2 hours depending on type and quality of the workers used  (much more than for the Fishing Boat at nearly nearer 5 minutes per process for 176 processes).

STS is a two part process:

Standardized Timber Square 800 = Logs x 10 &gt; Usable Scantling x 10 &gt; Standardized Timber Square.

Raw material numbers would be 80,000 Logs but allowing for procs at both processing stages at Artisan7 it will be more like **13-14K** Logs still. More or less depending on Processing Skill level and RNG.

The STS can't be brought/ sold on the Market Place for some reason, only the materials required can.

The Pine Plywood is not far behind though the Pine can be gathered by workers (at the *Serendia Shrine* node for example)

It will take a minimum of **20 days** as you can only obtain 1 x plan per day from the daily quest, not considering the time to construct it.

**Note:** *This is from the current KR content and the material requirements may change for the EU/NA release.*

On the arrival of the boat I think the OP has not seen the [official clarification that was posted](http://forum.blackdesertonline.com/index.php?/topic/114011-maintenance-updated-maintenance-september-28th/) on this;

&gt; Partial Download of the Underwater Ocean Content overhaul.  
&gt; ** Update ** We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen from the inclusion of the above ""Naval Content"" line, the actual partial download is in fact for the upgrade to the Ocean content, specifically the underwater aspects. We have opted to deliver this in smaller content packages over a the next few maintenance cycles to reduce the overall impact of such a large update.
&gt;  
&gt; **To ensure there is no additional confusion the maintenance and subsequent patch does not include the recently showcased naval content.**

Therefore the naval and ship building may not be in the Ocean content arriving around the 12 October but presumably sometime after.

"I'm basically echoing what the other person replied to you with, but the point is worth reiterating. You can't seperate the behaviour of ISIS from what is in the texts because it is crucial to understanding why they do what they do. Many people want to point at every factor *but* religion, but religious ideology really is the driving force here, and to ignore this is to be utterly confused about the problem. Just look at the magizine that ISIS releases 'Dabiq', which is actually an incredibly well written and produced bit of media. 

Edit: warning, magazine includes uncensored graphic images of dead bodies and a man having his head cut off.

[Issue 15 - PDF](http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig9_LokrvPAhUBzpQKHTBtBbMQFggaMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clarionproject.org%2Ffactsheets-files%2Fislamic-state-magazine-dabiq-fifteen-breaking-the-cross.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdqWXQN6Aq4d7khp9WtCO8QGxqPg&amp;sig2=Q-FHUMWIUb148Djn8EkGOg)

Have a look at the article starting on page 30: 'Why we hate you and why we fight you'. These people are telling us loudly and clearly that their reasons for fighting us have everything to do with religion. 

One reason this is a problem that extends beyond ISIS, and beyond Jihadism generally, is that what ISIS is doing is based on a very plausible interpretation of the texts. I'm not interested in a pissing contest, but it is a far more tortured reading of the bible that leads you to the same sort of principles. Just look at the people who are among those read the bible most literally, the Westboro Baptist Church. They're not stoning or beheading people or trying to eliminate freedom of speech, or even trying to, they're just pissing people off. This has everything to do with the differences in the texts.

Another reason is that even among 'moderate' Muslims, you find beliefs that are incompatible with open secular society in every way imaginable. Just have a quick look at these poll results:

http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/
https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7861/british-muslims-survey

These beliefs are easily justified by Islamic texts. I understand where you're coming from, and I sympathise to a large degree. I don't believe in labelling people in a way that is unfair; that is, on any particular point of concern we are never talking about *all* muslims. Hatred of all muslims is indeed bigotry and is deeply harmful both to ourselves and muslim people. In fact I'm most concerned for muslims here: Women, gays, apostates, people who merely want to be able to both practice their faith *and* criticise elements of it. These people suffer greatly and it has a great deal to do with the links between religious beliefs and behaviour. Ignoring this isn't a path to a safe or fair society.

Just to be extra clear, because there seems to be a false dichotomy here between being progressive and ignoring the religion, and worrying about the religion and being a conservative bigot. One of the biggest issues for me is that some of the only people in Australian politics that talk with any sense on the issue are people like Pauline Hanson and her crowd, and for every sensible sentance they speak on the issue, they follow with 10 others that are utterly deranged and unethical, like the idea of banning muslim immigrants. I don't want a situation where people who have legitimate concerns about harmful ideologies have nowhere else to turn but to the far-right, as seems to be occuring in Europe.

"**+44**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/8d668a249c704204a6ee51fae1652365.png)  

&gt; Formed in 2005 in Los Angeles, CA, +44 was a band from two blink-182 members Mark Hoppus (Bass Guitar/Vocals) and Travis Barker (Drums/Keyboards), who has also played in a variety of musical projects including The Aquabats, Box Car Racer, and Transplants. +44 also featured Shane Gallagher (Lead Guitar), from The Nervous Return, and Craig Fairbaugh (Rhythm Guitar/Backing Vocals), from Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards, The Forgotten, and Mercy Killers. 

&gt; It also once featured Carol Heller (Guitar/Backing Vocals), formerly of Get The Girl, but she later left the band to start a family. She is heard as backup vocalist in 3 of the tracks on the first album. The name +44 is a reference to the international dialing code for the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed the new project. 

&gt; On December 13th, 2005 (Tom Delonge's birthday), the band released a demo of the song ""No It Isn't"". Hoppus insists that, while it was directed towards Delonge's breaking up of blink-182, the release date was just coincidental. On September 1st 2006, they added a song called ""Lycanthrope"" to their official website, http://www.plusfortyfour.com. Also on September 7th, the +44 Song ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"" was played on KROQ radio. On September 18th, an unedited version of the song was posted on the band's MySpace profile. 

&gt; Their debut album ""When Your Heart Stops Beating"" was released on November 14, 2006.

&gt; Hoppus has stated that the songs ""Little Death"" and ""No, It Isn't"" are about the break-up of blink-182. In both songs lines such as ""Your cry for inspiration won't be heard on distant stars"" or ""you swore you wouldn't lose then lost your brain, you make a sound that feels like pain"" can be seen to be related to Angels and Airwaves, DeLonges new project. 

&gt; In several interviews Hoppus has claimed Tom quit the band through his agent and didn't even bother to call Hoppus or Barker.

&gt; While shooting the video for the first Single ""When your Heart stops beating"" Travis Barker broke his arm. Not noticing it was broken he played an entire European tour with the arm broken.

&gt; In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated ""I think so, yes. I love Shane [Gallagher] and Craig [Fairbaugh]. They are great guitarists and good friends and I'd love to do another record with them. I know that Tom [DeLonge] plans to continue doing Angels &amp; Airwaves in some capacity but right now all of our efforts are on Blink."" Read more on Last.fm.

"&gt;That's what the left is pushing. The right is saying fuck your identity, meet our standards.

Is it supposed to be a good thing to treat everybody as if we're all exactly the same and to assume the standards of those in power are necessarily the best suited to moral government of a society? By ""standards"" I don't mean expectations of a person by society, I mean the expectations a person has for life in a society. I might've better chosen ""norms"" but I can't find the perfect word for it.

&gt; If not for European influence, nobody would be using computers or even driving cars. We don't penalize Japan for their recent success in consumer electronics or video games--so let's not penalize Europeans for where the Renaissance or Scientific Revolution occurred.

This seems to imply that life is a competition where it's our responsibility to win individually, rather than a situation where collective betterment is favored. But my point in using ""historically advantaged"" is to say that for most of history relevant to today's society, white people have been more likely to be in power and controlling rather than subjugated or oppressed. Whether or not that's because white people created the power structure is irrelevant. It remains a fact that modern history has been kinder to certain descendants of European nations than it has to other peoples. I didn't think that was a controversial stance. The only implication I wanted to stress from that claim was that white people are less likely to be viewed as the victims of racial exploitation because they face less social pressure due to their race.

"Good point, Australia geographically resides in the Asia and Oceania region.

Legally and politically speaking however we are most closely aligned to the UK and its constitutional monarchy system - in fact, once sharing the same head of state. 

Religiosity wise, we are a heavily Christian country, with approximately  61% of Australian declaring themselves Christian at the 2011 census (25% identified as Catholic alone).
 
In terms of the social norms, ethical values and traditional customs, I think you will find Australia very closely aligned to those in European countries, thanks greatly to the large influx of European resettlement after the two world wars, but also government policy to only allow European migrants ([White Australia Policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy#)) 

While the ratio is declining, thanks to the policy's final removal in the 1970's, subsequent refugee intakes and a general market openness, the top five ancestries identified by individuals in the 2011 census were European, accounting for 60% of the respondents. The indigenous population only represent 3% of the total population. 

Maybe the 2016 census results will show change in these ratios, but it is unlikely to have significantly shifted the ratio points. 

I think on the basis of the above, Australia could be included in ""the Western World"" for all intents and purposes of this discussion.

"I'll start by saying I hate Donald Trump and am not conservative, so I will be attempting to explain their worldview here without myself holding it. But here goes...


I think part of the reason people talk past one another on this is that you're defining greatness in absolute terms, or in relation to today's America, while Trumpers are defining it in relation to the other countries on earth at that time.  The US was not perfect from 1950-1970, but it was pretty clearly the most powerful, wealthy, influential, and widely-respected country on the planet, with far and away the highest standard of living for most income percentiles. Jim Crow was horrible, but compare it to Stalinist Russia, or the mass-starvation of Mao Zedong's ""great leap forward,"" or Pol Pot's killing fields, or third world undeveloped Africa/South America, or even a shattered and rebuilding Europe (that was suffering aftereffects of some pretty catastrophic racism of it's own) and even minorities might well have been better off here, especially in the north or more metropolitan areas.  The influence of the US was enormous. We exported our culture on a historically unprecedented scale - Hollywood, American movies and TV shows and sports and companies and fashion and food.  We had the highest GDP per capita and it wasn't close. We went to the moon.  We pioneered inventions that changed the world in almost every industry. We had just won a massive, group-effort war in which we were pretty clearly on the side of the good guys.  People everywhere wanted to immigrate here, and almost nobody here wanted to leave.

Part of the anxiety that Trump is tapping into isn't that America is necessarily worse than it used to be, but that other countries are catching up.  He talks about China all the time because they rival us as the global economic superpower.  Thanks to globalization, now other countries can approach our same standard of living; they can adequately protect/provide for their own people; they can maintain stable democracies; they can make their own movies, and develop their own cultures without being so overawed by ours.

What few policies Trump has articulated - higher tariffs, lower taxes to attract rich entrants and tougher immigration to deter poor entrants - each prioritize RELATIVE power gains over competing countries, at the cost of absolute utility or wellbeing worldwide. And that's what makes him so dangerous to those of is who see through the made-up lines in the sand and just want to maximize human happiness: he wants to ensure America retains its bragging rights as ""the greatest country on earth"" even if it comes at the price of holding the rest of the world down.

If we are to ever permanently defeat him and the movement he has inspired, we will need to articulate a vision of how America can be great to the PROFIT of the rest of the world - not great at its expense.",t3_55g57m,,0,False,,d8aj23g,adoris1,,0,6,1478298174,1475391012,False,t3_55g57m,changemyview,t5_2w2s8

"Most European dope is #3, it's the freebase form Diacetylmorphine.  It can't be IV'd without dissolving it with an acid because it's water insoluble.  Can be smoked or snorted, I've heard people claiming it's not worth snorting it but I've also read claims that it's better snorted than smoked so information is kind of conflicting there, I don't have personal experience with it.  Can also be IV'd, but you need an acid to dissolve it with.

Heroin #4 is the salt form, typically Diacetylmorphine HCl but I don't see why other salts couldn't be used.  Tar is technically #4 but synthesized using a dirtier process that leaves lots of other alkaloids in the product, in addition most tar is being made with the shittier acetic acid instead of acetic anhydride. Powdered #4 won't run nicely or at all on foil so it's not great for smoking, but great for sniffing or IV'ing.

The general idea with converting from freebase to salt form is that with the proper equipment and expertise you can get a much purer product, of course there will be shitty batches made with improper techniques and even if a batch is originally good it's going to be cut a billion times by the time you buy it on the street anyways. The bigger benefit, I guess, is that the salt form of heroin can be injected easily without an acid, since salts readily dissociate in water.  

\#1 is opium and #2 is morphine base I believe, these numbers originally came from a DEA report on heroin synthesis but people kind of make up their own definitions for the numbering of heroin, which often differs by region as well.

"There's a difference between being against people of different races and/or ethnicities and being against different cultures. In America, for example, we stress a strong nationalistic message and form of civic duty. No matter where our immigrants are from, they really only maintain a distinct ethnic identity for a single generation (being solely, say, Indian instead of Indian-American) and after a few more generations they cease to be hybridized at all and are solely American, save for the phenotype of visible minorities and be solely culturally American, having limited ties to their country and culture of origin and rarely speaking the language. America is culturally ethnically diverse but not cosmopolitan, because being American- Culturally, nationally and ethnically- holds more importance than one's ethnicity nor race after a sufficient time in the country (the two exceptions being the two ethnic groups who didn't have a say in becoming Americans- American Indians and Blacks)

The difference is in Europe, they're understandably skittish about nationalism since it did kind of cause the two biggest wars we've seen to date. Because of that, there's far more ghettoization compared to the US and ethnic minorities and recent immigrants maintain a distinct first generation or hyphenated identity (""Pakistani-British"", ""Cameroonian-French"", ""Indonesian-Dutch"") for longer with stronger convictions.

I don't see much similarity in the Korean situation.

The Soviet Union and its satellites were indeed not something we Westerners would call a democracy. Nevertheless, the Communist bloc of Eastern Europe was not monolithic, and not nearly as totalitarian as North Korea is. 

It also had a strategic weight and an economic importance that warranted intense diplomatic activity. For all its bravado and the coverage it gets in the news, North Korea is a dwarf on the global diplomatic agenda.

Here in you Europe was even an incident of attempted assasination of chancellor Merkel by a drone. If I remember correctly some dipshit just wanted to have a good view and flew with his small quadcopter just too close to the chancellor. I even read about cases that fallen quadcopter either cut face open or injured head prety bad. When you want to fly a plane, you need to be somewhere out of town in the field where noone is around (but there are still idiots who fly on the beach or on the soccer fields). Classic pilots often had some sort of training by someone else or just weren't alone when flying. There used to be big clubs too even for children (in socialist era even funded by state). But most quadcopter pilots? They build something with four rotors with razor sharp carbon propellers and fly in on the parking lot or worse, in the mall just for show. My plane with one rotor is by me considered very dangerous and it can be the smallest one in my fleet. When there are people near our flying field, to watch or just cyclists, some of us always go to them and tell not to go closer - it is a safety precaution. Sometimes there was a situation that people let their children on the field and noone noticed until father during landing spotted them and almost crashed the plane (1000USD at least) avoiding them. But just for clarification, I would rather have the most expensive plane totaled than to hurt a human being. It is just the feeling that you hurt someone with it that cause us to panic. We were all losing our shit to the parents who were very aggressive saying that it is just a plane. Please understand if 9mm round can take your life, even the smallest plane could end you pretty quick or damage you pretty severely. People don't understand, for them it is just toys.

"&gt; I've read 7 million Jews were killed in the camps

I think you're misremembering. The usual figure accepted by historians is around 6 million dead Jews and many of those weren't murdered in camps. Many died through forced labor and starvation or were killed by regular execution squads or gas vans before the extermination camps were up and running. 

&gt; I'm not sure why those people are historically dismissed as if their lives were less.

The Holocaust indeed sometimes refers only to the genocide of the European Jews. They were the single largest group and probably the most essential one for the Nazi regime, so a certain focus on them makes sense. Another reason that other victims aren't (or weren't) focused on as much is that Germans weren't the only ones to dislike homosexuals and sinti and roma (there are other groups of victims as well). The romani genocide is often referred to as *Porajmos* and while some homosexuals were even further persecuted against after WWII based on 'evidence' stemming from 33-45, recognition of these crimes against humanity has steadily increased: http://www.dw.com/en/germany-remembers-gay-victims-of-nazis/a-1061158 &amp; http://www.dw.com/en/european-parliamentarians-stand-up-against-homophobia/a-1874852",t1_d8a4xju,,0,False,,d8am014,mstrkrft-,,0,2,1478299587,1475400971,False,t3_55cqd4,HistoryPorn,t5_2skqi

"Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent; the open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz.) of solids per liter, a salinity of 3.5%. Salt is essential for animal life, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues; therefore the typical diets of nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds require little or no added salt, whereas cereal-based diets require supplementation. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous of food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation. Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when people living in Romania were boiling spring water to extract the salts; a salt-works in China has been found which dates to approximately the same period. Salt was prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and the Egyptians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara in camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt has led nations to go to war over salt and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is also used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance. Salt is processed from salt mines, or by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) or mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine, and it is used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual production of around two hundred million tons of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption; other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodized to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods. Salt is an essential nutrient and the amount of salt in the diet influences health. Too much salt can raise blood pressure and may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes in susceptible populations. The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day. Humans have always tended to build communities either around source of salt, or where they can trade for it. All through history the availability of salt has been pivotal to civilization. The word ""salary"" comes from the Latin word for salt because the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt, which was quite literally worth its weight in gold. In Britain, the suffix ""-wich"" in a place name means it was once a source of salt, as in Sandwich and Norwich. The Natron Valley was a key region that supported the Egyptian Empire to its north, because it supplied it with a kind of salt that came to be called by its name, natron. Even before this, what is now thought to have been the first city in Europe is Solnitsata, in Bulgaria, which was a salt mine, providing the area now known as the Balkans with salt since 5400 BC. Even the name Solnisata means ""salt works"". While people have used canning and artificial refrigeration to preserve food for the last hundred years or so, salt has been the best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, making it one of the oldest verifiable salt works. There is more salt in animal tissues such as meat, blood and milk, than there is in plant tissues. Nomads who subsist on their flocks and herds do not eat salt with their food, but agriculturalists, feeding mainly on cereals and vegetable matter, need to supplement their diet with salt. With the spread of civilization, salt became one of the world's main trading commodities. It was of high value to the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites and other peoples of antiquity. In the Middle East, salt was used to ceremonially seal an agreement, and the ancient Hebrews made a ""covenant of salt"" with God and sprinkled salt on their offerings to show their trust in Him. An ancient practice in time of war was salting the earth: scattering salt around in a defeated city in order to prevent plant growth. Abimelech was ordered by God to do this at Shechem, and various texts claim that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus ploughed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after it was defeated in the Third Punic War (146 BC).Salt may have been used for barter in connection with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Herodotus described salt trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In the early years of the Roman Empire, roads such as the Via Salaria were built for the transportation of salt from the salt pans of Ostia to the capital. Salt was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and salt fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting salt fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass and the dye Tyrian purple; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian salt fish and salt from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire. In Africa, salt was used as currency south of the Sahara, and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in Abyssinia. Moorish merchants in the 6th century traded salt for gold, weight for weight. The Tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the Sahara especially for the transportation of salt by Azalai (salt caravans). The caravans still cross the desert from southern Niger to Bilma, although much of the trade now takes place by truck. Each camel takes two bales of fodder and two of trade goods northwards and returns laden with salt pillars and dates. Salzburg, Hallstatt, and Hallein lie within 17 km (11 mi) of each other on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with extensive salt deposits. Salzach literally means ""salt river"" and Salzburg ""salt castle"", both taking their names from the German word Salz meaning salt and Hallstatt was the site of the world's first salt mine. The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used pickaxes and shovels, began open pan salt making. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries. The word salary originates from Latin: salarium which referred to the money paid to the Roman Army's soldiers for the purchase of salt. The word salad literally means ""salted"", and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables. Wars have been fought over salt. Venice fought and won a war with Genoa over the product, and it played an important part in the American Revolution. Cities on overland Trade Routes grew rich by levying duties, and towns like Liverpool flourished on the export of salt extracted from the salt mines of Cheshire. Various governments have at different times imposed salt taxes on their peoples. The voyages of Christopher Columbus are said to have been financed from salt production in southern Spain, and the oppressive salt tax in France was one of the causes of the French Revolution. After being repealed, this tax was reimposed by Napoleon when he became emperor to pay for his foreign wars, and was not finally abolished until 1945. In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led at least 100,000 people on the ""Dandi March"" or ""Salt Satyagraha"", in which protesters made their own salt from the sea thus defying British rule and avoiding paying the salt tax. This civil disobedience inspired millions of common people, and elevated the Indian independence movement from an elitist movement to a national struggle. Salt is mostly sodium chloride, the ionic compound with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea salt and freshly mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined in the production of table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801 °C (1,474 °F) and its boiling point 1,465 °C (2,669 °F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimeter and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions and the solubility is 359 grams per liter. From cold solutions, salt crystallizes as the dihydrate NaCl•2H2O. ",t3_55haqf,,0,False,,d8amaah,arrowtotheknee_redux,,1,-3,1478299723,1475402075,False,t3_55haqf,Drama,t5_2rd2l

"&gt;3) Pay to win     
&gt;Korean players are much more accepting of things considered pay to win in the west. Most likely because gaming so huge in Korea, there are a higher percentage of hardcore players willing to drop a lot of cash for in game items so it's just the norm there.

Wrong. Koreans aren't any different from us as they also do not like P2W. They simply seem more of norm there because Koreans love to boast about their possession and have pride in something ridiculously unnecessary. Go watch Korean dramas and you'll see what I mean-- there is not a single drama that does not cover jealously and pride over something small that seems stupid and childish. It's actually very, very common thing. 

&gt;4) RNG         
&gt;There's not much to say here. Koreans love RNG for some reason. They're just more hardcore gamers in general so they actually enjoy the grind that comes with RNG systems. In the west most people are not willing to spend so much time on a game, so they quit pretty quickly once they get frustrated by the RNG systems.

Wrong. Koreans also hate RNG as much as anyone else. They just have no other choice-- whether it's because they want to feed their childish pride with it or they are worried that others would look down on them, they just want the item and the company only releases that item in RNG box. The company won't do a thing to convert such RNG item to a guaranteed purchase either because this will result is so much loss on their side and they're pretty much worried that players will turn against them on the idea. It's funny because either way it's a loss, so they just stick with whatever they had probably. 

&gt;5) Content           
&gt;I think TERA suffers from this problem much more than the others, maybe the most of any current Korean MMO. Content updates take a very long time because they are bundled into huge patches for NA/EU versions of the game, instead of being rolled more evenly over time like they are in Korea. This obviously leaves people bored after the patch gets stale. This is especially bad in TERA where most if not all current dungeons have recycled bosses that long time players have already fought a million times before.

According to recent Korean gaming popularity chart, TERA makes up only 0.50%, while Overwatch and League of Legends take 25%+. The highest rating MMO was at 5% popularity, but I forgot the name;; There's just not enough people playing MMO genre to support them probably. It's not just Korean MMO. At one point, WoW was actually not on the chart which lists top 20 games.   

&gt;6) Gender/race locking            
&gt;In Korea they don't seem to mind it much but I think they really underestimate how many potential players they lose in the west because of gender locking. These games only have gender locking because it's accepted in Korea and it's an easy way to cut corners and maximize profit.

Wrong. Several KTERA players quit TERA after the player conference saying next class is race locked (and there was a context of ""she"") as they also said it was no Popori. After people heard about this, the whole forum flipped over, which I felt bad for the moderator of Inven because they probably had to go through irrelevant QQ posts through out the forum. When Ninja was released TERA's popularity was 4%, but after that player conference it just dropped down 2%, then now it's 0.5%. KTERA actually tried to protest this by making more Poporis and Barakas after Ninja's release, but BHS is just either stubborn, blind, or just plain retarded.",t3_55h2qd,lancer,0,False,,d8amxa7,Idi0ticGenius,Loriri - Pocky | Tempest Reach (NA),0,21,1478300031,1475404518,False,t3_55h2qd,TeraOnline,t5_2s527

"&gt;Many of the poorer countries (Greece in particular) have been treated badly by Germany

The EU has virtually no control over fiscal policy, the severe recession in Greece is due to the Greek government over-borrowing due to the lower borrowing rates available to it as an EU member. After the crash EU nations gave Greece a bailout of €110 billion on the conditions that Greece follows a strict austerity policy. I think given the huge sum of money and high risk of default the demands weren't unreasonable. They proved insufficient though and a second bailout of €130 billion was necessary. 

You may be thinking that the reason austerity didn't work in Greece because The EU's austerity plan was poorly conceived. Ireland however went through a similarly severe recession and was given a €85 billion bailout and also told to follow a strict austerity plan as well. Ireland is now out of the recession and has the fastest growing economy in the EU.

"&gt; Iran doesn't have much power.

Iran is the regional power in the region. Stopping that regional power is what caused this war. 

&gt; If Iran makes a move they will put crippling sanctions again.

This is a basic misunderstanding of why the sanctions ended and why the nuclear deal was made when it was. The reason sanctions ended and the deal was done was because Europe needed it. 

At present the EU gets 39% of its gas supplies from Russia. The United States wanted to end EU dependence on Russian gas. The only country able to fill that vaacum was Iran which has the second largest reserves of gas after Russia itself. 

So you cannot move the EU from Russian gas while also having Iran under sanctions. 

That explains the timing of the nuclear deal right as tensions with Russia were increasing. 

""Crippling sanctions"" on Iran are over for good. You cannot sanction all the countries that supply you with energy after all.

"PSOE, Spanish Socialist Worker's Party is the traditional left-wing socialdemocrat party in Spain. Despite its name, they are not followers of Soviet-style socialism nor are they communists (I'm guessing you thought they were, based on your first comment). They started in the 19th century as Marxists but that has long ago changed, now they are left-center at best, usually center economically and socially progressive. They are your typical European socialdemocrat party.

Podemos is a new party (couple of years now) made up of people generally more progressive or further to the left than PSOE, but still not communists. They mostly fill the role of populist left-wing party, but they do have some nice ideas and are very socially progressive. They appeal mostly to younger people (&lt;40 years old) and have an image of political renovation of the Spanish left. They are in favour of allowing independence referendums.

IU, the United Left, is a coalition of left-wing political parties, generally further to the left than PSOE and Podemos. Their main component is the PCE, the Spanish Communist Party, who since the 90s is just a light version of what it used to be, so in the end IU is just another left-leaning socialdemocrat party, not too different from Podemos.

"&gt;Capitalists are able to maintain ideological hegemony without engaging in direct repression

That /u/mhl67 thinks this shows he is a child. He not only has no experience of political repression in First-World countries, he thinks everywhere is the same. So when /u/mhl67 goes up to someone and says ""Hey, wouldn't socialism be a good idea?"" and they say ""No, you stupid kid,"" he thinks the bourgeoisie has tricked the people into going along with capitalism. /u/mhl67 doesn't understand imperialism pays higher wages than socialism ever will, because he is a child that hasn't ever worked a day in his life.

&gt;there is zero reason socialism couldn't do the same.

The First-World child /u/mhl67 doesn't understand socialism *always* comes about via brutal civil war. Millions and millions of people would die if socialism came to 'America.' He thinks 'deh werkers' are just gonna have a big strike one day, and then the next day there will be socialism.

First-World child /u/mhl67 would do good to read Trotsky's [Terrorism and Communism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/ch04.htm), that way he can understand that not only will socialism only come about in the course of a brutal civil war, but that the people organizing counter-revolution are going to be calling themselves Marxists!

&gt;But Kautsky goes further to develop his theme. **He complains that we suppress the newspapers of the SRs and the Mensheviks**, and even – such things have been known – **arrest their leaders**. Are we not dealing here with “shades of opinion” in the proletarian or the Socialist movement? The scholastic pedant does not see facts beyond his accustomed words. **The Mensheviks and SRs for him are simply tendencies in Socialism**, whereas, in the course of the revolution, they have been transformed into an organization which works in active co-operation with the counter-revolution and carries on against us an open war. **The army of Kolchak was organized by Socialist Revolutionaries** (how that name savours to-day of the charlatan!), and was supported by Mensheviks. Both carried on – and carry on – against us, for a year and a half, a war on the Northern front. **The Mensheviks who rule the Caucasus, formerly the allies of Hohenzollern, and to-day the allies of Lloyd George, arrested and shot Bolsheviks** hand in hand with German and British officers. **The Mensheviks and S.R.s of the Kuban Rada organized the army of Denikin**. The Esthonian Mensheviks who participate in their government were directly concerned in the last advance of Yudenich against Petrograd. **Such are these “tendencies” in the Socialist movement**. Kautsky considers that one can be in a state of open and civil war with the Mensheviks and SRs, who, with the help of the troops they themselves have organized for Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin, are fighting for their “shade of opinions” in Socialism, and at the same time to allow those innocent “shades of opinion” freedom of the Press in our rear. **If the dispute with the SRs and the Mensheviks could be settled by means of persuasion and voting** – that is, if there were not behind their backs the Russian and foreign imperialists – **there would be no civil war**.

Thankfully Trotsky wasn't half as bad as the stupid First-World parasites that read him today. When the proletariat comes to power, they're going to be *killing* people like /u/mhl67. And not because they disagree with them on the DPRK! It's because people like him are total flunkies of the imperialists, and they will be actively organizing the suppression of the revolutionaries in alliance with their own imperialists. That's what revolution *is*; overcoming the ""socialist"" lieutenants of capitalism.

&gt;They should, but it's going to be illegal. Can't try to overthrow the government and then expect it to play nice with you.

The First-World child /u/mhl67 doesn't seem to understand revolutionaries are going to be doing a lot of illegal things, including calls for ""concrete violent action."" He claims to understand this, but can not see the contradiction in what he is saying! Does he imagine the Dictatorship of the Proletariat will allow the bourgeoisie and their ""socialist"" lackeys the freedom to call for ""concrete violent action"" against the revolution? If not, what does he think of his precious *freeze peach*?

&gt;No, it's workers' control, something you can't seem to grasp.

""Workers' control"" isn't socialism. Lenin made it clear multiple times it is not socialism, but a *precursor* to a centralized, planned economy. This would be easy to understand, but /u/mhl67 has no idea what a labor aristocracy is, so can not fathom how the interests of some 'workers' are opposed to others. In his mind, a construction worker in 'America' making $35 an hour is just as exploited as someone working in a clothing factory in Bangladesh for $2 a day. It never occurs to stupid First-World children to ask ""Who is going to control access to the best jobs?"" They just want to be able to go to work and have no one tell them what to do (if they want to work at all), and walk into stores and just take things. That's the parasite's fantasy of ""socialism"" that they think a revolution might bring about.

&gt;This is some tankie who doesn't actually have an argument so they need to resort to ad hominems just in order to have a retort.

Again, the First-World child would do well to read Trotsky's *Terrorism and Communism* carefully before commenting on party policy of the Bolsheviks.

&gt;""Conquered by the working class themselves"" pretty clearly does.

So yes, the First-World child thinks ""emancipation"" and ""self-determination"" mean the same thing.

&gt;That says literally nothing about the idea that workers are actually bourgeois.

First-World child also has a reading comprehension disorder, it seems.

&gt;If you believe so then you've literally rejected the entire Marxian analysis of class since you're no longer analyzing it in terms of objective structures but in terms of subjective valuations.

The First-World child should read Lenin's [Imperialism and the Split in Socialism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/oct/x01.htm) and see how Lenin interprets the quote. Did Lenin reject ""the entire Marxian analysis of class"" as well?

For that matter, how about Trotsky?

&gt;For what does America need? She needs to secure her profits at the expense of the European toiling masses, and thus render stable the privileged position of the upper crust of the American working-class. **Without the American labor aristocracy, American capitalism cannot maintain itself**. Failing Gompers and his trade unions, failing the skilled well-paid workers, the political regime of American capitalism will plunge into the abyss. But it is possible to keep the American labor aristocracy in its privileged position only by placing the “plebians,” the proletarian “rabble” of Europe on rations of cold and hunger, rations rigidly fixed and stingily weighed. The further this development unfolds along this road, all the more difficult will it be for the European Social Democracy to uphold the evangel of Americanism in the eyes of the European working masses. All the more centralized will become the resistance of European labor against the master of masters, against American capitalism.

https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/07/world.htm

Again, thankfully Trotsky wasn't half as bad as the First-World parasites who follow him today.

&gt;Not to mention your precious DPRK would be a ""liberal parasite"" as well since it's largely dependent on aid from China, which is itself getting a lot of it's capital from the economic exploitation of Africa.

First-World parasite thinks a construction worker making $35 an hour is an exploited proletarian, while simultaneously thinking everyone in the DPRK is on some kind of Chinese welfare program paid for by Africans.

&gt;So replacing ""Communism"" with a military caste system is somehow evidence of their fidelity to Marxism. Mkay. 

First-World parasite doesn't even understand why a socialist country would need a military.

&gt;Merely using the word ""socialism"" isn't evidence of anything at all.

"Silver edge is fine this game instead of blink. **But you should be able to play Meepo with blink** as against some heroes it is the best item in the game .

You shouldn't get multiple skadis, the passive doesn't stack and it has a point booster that does nothing for your clones. Meepo is someone who bursts people down, not someone who tanks all the damage on purpose -&gt; stack eblades not skadis

The only item that you should stack should be dragon lance (early game) or eblade (situationally you can stack diffusal blades too)


Your CS was very low, you need to be getting 10cs/min on Meepo. However you did have 4 cores including an AM, so I guess your CS isn't that bad ... it just could be a lot better.

You also need to take advantage of your power spike, when the game goes past ~30 mins (where you should be level 25 and 6 slotted) ... Meepo starts to get weaker and weaker. Sure he can still kill anyone in the game lategame ... but it gets difficult.

Take a look at this guy's Meepo games: http://www.dotabuff.com/players/154715080/matches?hero=meepo . Look how long the matches last and what items he builds. (Multiple hurricane pikes is just trolling, you could try upgrading one of them but I think you should sell dragon lance without upgrading it)

**tl;dr try the ""Abed"" build: BoT - aghs - dragon lance - dragon lance - blink - (try to get aegis and finish the game) - eblade (sell dragon lance if you have to) - eblade (sell dragon lance if you have to)**

"&gt; What's the point of ""representation""? Can't you empathize with a person who doesn't share your every trait, from color of skin, eyes and hair, to food preferences? 

It's more about identification. People who are underrepresented in film still watch films, so empathising with characters that don't share their traits isn't the issue. 

The viewing experience, however, is *much* richer, and more profound, when the representation includes them. I can speak to this personally, as a woman. I grew up in the 90s, representation was an underlying issue, not a hot button one like right now. By the time I was a teen, in the early 00s, I was so tired of seeing women only ever portrayed as helpless, hopeless, talentless and basically lacking in any redeeming qualities, in basically every film/show I watched. And if the women did happen to be capable, they were so stooped in sexualisation, there was basically no point in giving them added traits since nobody remembered them anyway. Watch [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6R0FuHB02g) from Charlies Angels modern remake and tell me who you think the writers/director had in mind while making it - young girls looking for kickass woman heroes in the sole action film that year featuring all female leads...or men.

The one TV show that sought to represent women was Sex And The City (you could argue Buffy did too, but SATC had specific intent to give women's inner lives a mainstream examination). The only film genre where women were represented - chick flicks - only portrayed us as consumed by the thought of marriage and children and not much else (oh, and we were all white, thin, American and upper class, of course). I had *no* role models whatsoever. I didn't need them, of course, but it would've been nice. I held onto Belle, Mulan and Kill Bill for dear life. 

Fast forward to roughly 2013, when representation has become a hot button issue thanks to online dialogue - and suddenly I start enjoying female characters in film/TV. They get actual storylines, they get saved from being killed off senselessly, they develop better, there's entirely female casts (that aren't just relegated to the chick flick genre), they aren't always the eye and arm candy in action films; sometimes Emily Blunt is simply Tom Cruise's counterpart instead of his damsel, or Charlise Theron is the kickass central character in the Mad Max remake, which has a female cast that doesn't just exist to be fucked and/or killed. Sometimes Chris Hemsworth agrees to be the good looking bimbo character for once. It's just a little bit more awesome these days to be a female viewer, even if Hollywood still has a long way to go. I remember how starved I felt for good female-based media as a teen, it reminds me of how far representation has come and how quickly it came about - once women really started to demand it. Now I'm seeing the same improvement for people of colour and LGBT+ people for the same reason. Because people won't shut up about it. That's the only way to bring about good change. The only ones complaining about it seem to be the ones who were always represented well from the beginning of modern media...

&gt; Are the movies we watch about people, or about quotas?

The movies we watch are about many, many different things all at once. Movies are as much a social snapshot of our time as they are often about fictional stories, and woven into almost every single film is a message, whether it be political, topical or personal to the director. You are being told a story and if you just look at the pictures, you're only getting 50% of the overall content on offer.

&gt; In my country, 99% of locally created entertainment is pathetic shit. So I read, watch, play media created overseas -- mostly USA, but also Europe and Japan. I almost never see my compatriots on screen, and when I do it's usually a stereotypical ""rashen mafeea"" with badly drawn tattoos. Do I care? Should I?

You can care if you want to. If you're content, fine. Nobody asked you to do anything or say anything. It was your choice to contribute to this dialogue the way you have.

&gt; ""Gone with the wind"" doesn't move me any less just because it's a story of an American woman.

Sure, but I bet even you, in all your contrary anger, could understand why black people might not like that one of the most famous films of all time only represents them as the maid to rich white people. Of course, nobody really expects diversity from a film made in 1939, but you'd think representation would've drastically improved since then and yet...

(It's probably also worth noting that Gone With The Wind sparked the same kind of reaction/dialogue about race representation back in the 40s, that we still see today)

&gt; ""Anansi boys"" has an all-black cast, and ""Snowcrash"" characters are an insane mess of ancestries, and these books are awesome.

Nobody is saying lack of representation, or poor representation, makes a film's story or characters bad. If I avoided all the films I felt could've had better representation, I'd have nothing to watch and no favourite films. 

&gt; Most anime takes place in Japan, but I don't feel less for characters called Gin, Hana and Miyuki than if their names were Grisha, Tanya and Misha. In fact, Japanese are employing a great principle of mukokuseki, ""racelessness"", making their characters persons, not representatives of some made-up groups. This is how we move beyond prejudice into a post-racial world, not by counting characters of different backgrounds.

I'm not aware of the context of race relations in Japan, so I can't really add to this. But the ""colourblind"" approach to race in Western society tends to be just more of the same casually racist mindset that caused race representation in media to be as poor as it is now. There is no avoiding race nor racial/cultural differences. There's no point in pretending race just doesn't exist when there are still racist, vile people in the world who will discriminate, vilify, attack and even kill people based on race (and everything race represents to them). A black person (or any person of colour) cannot just pretend they are ""raceless"". They're reminded every single day that they are a person of colour. It's ignorant of white people to act like erasing a person's racial identity is any kind of ""answer"" to racism. The answer to racism is *discouraging* active racism in all forms, not pretending it's not there anymore just because we wish it wasn't.

"The UK would barely be affected by Scotland leaving, it's only home to 5million people.

Scotland isn't getting another ""once in a lifetime vote"" for at-least 30-odd years. It's up to Westminster to grant referenda, and Scots knew in [2013](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21148282) that there would be a vote on EU membership if the Conservatives won the General Election in 2015. Thus in the 2014 independence vote, Scots voted to stay in the UK regardless of what its future was to be in the EU.

The UK stopped being in decline in the 1980s. Scottish people would never vote to leave now when they still have unresolved currency issues, an ageing, unhealthy population, an empty economy dependent on collapsed oil prices and subsidies from English tax-payers.

If Scotland left and joined the EU after the UK leaves, it will have to adopt the EURO and become part of the Schengen free-movement zone. That means there will be a closed border between Scotland and England, where Scotland sends over half its produce. This would be devastating for Scotland and it simply isn't happening.

These regions don't have the power to call referendums. They can only be granted by Westminster which has signaled that the previous Scottish referendum was a 'once in a generation' event, so unlikely to occur for 30 years.

"I feel like Trump's appeal to Americans is very easily lost on foreigners, especially ones from Europe, since he is very typical ""American"" (as in loud and self-confident) and has a very nationalist view on current events and problems. There are quite a few reasons I support Trump, not to say that these reasons are exclusive to him, but I will try to start off with what you brought up first since it is very late over here and I am procrastinating on my work.

&gt;  Is it because he is rich ?

Almost all of our politicians are rich (yes, even Bernie ""Jesus"" Sanders), but Americans like stories of successful businessmen.

&gt; Because he think climate change isn't real ?

Most small-government types (Libertarian / Conservative) don't like the idea of the government forcing heavy handed environmental policies. This is not necessarily because they do not believe in climate change it is just because they believe in private market solutions.

&gt; Because he dislike Muslims and Mexicans ?

As someone that lives in a border state and is a child of an immigrant, no, I don't hate Mexicans (except when tradition demands it). The federal government is extremely lax when it comes to enforcing their own immigration laws and try to interfere when the states handle it themselves. The problem with the southern border that many Europeans would probably not understand is that it is not like similar economic level borders commonly found in mainland Europe (or even the US-Canadian border). Violence around the Mexican border (especially drug cartel activity) spills over into the US and major cities leading to Houston being named the number 1 city for human trafficking and most major routes leading through it, the bodies of cartel executions being left on both sides, and hard drugs like heroin coming from cartels and decimating economically poor US towns. Even if you don't look at violent and drug related criminal activity (and depending on which economic philosophy you pray to) illegal immigrants do lower the average wage wherever they are heavily concentrated, do affect the total job market negatively and positively, and compete with lower income Americans in the economic market while having questionable tax responsibility and social spending strain. I am perfectly okay and welcoming to immigrants, but they **MUST** come here **LEGALLY**.

More specifically on Muslims, I really don't care what religion anyone is (hell, I've been defending Mormonism for years), but their religious customs and beliefs must not contradict typical Western values (choice to wear religious garments vs. forced to, etc). I do believe that terrorism must be strongly dealt with no matter its affiliates. If your question was more directed towards acceptance of refugees then I think this video by Roy Beck best sums up my opinion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE). 

&gt;  Against Hilary Clinton ?

I'm not going to lie, I would rather vote for the ghost of King George the III than Mrs. Clinton. 

&gt; TRADE

If you haven't already realized, a huge component of Trump's campaign is his focus on trade deals. I do not believe that trade deals like NAFTA are advantageous to the average American in the end when it is done with less-than-1st world countries like Mexico. Companies should not be moving an already built American plant to China or Mexico just so they can sell the finished product back to us and pocket the difference. Yes, manufacturing is becoming more heavily automatized, but I believe that a slow change within a nation, allowing the workers a chance to adapt, is more beneficial than American companies simply moving back to the US when technology allows them to fully automatize their factory. H1-B visas are also modern day indentured servitude. The employee has absolutely no negotiating power since their visa relies on their continued employment and more likely than not the company was not offering a salary lucrative enough to force the job market more in their favor to find employees. 

&gt; FOREIGN POLICY

We need to stop nation-building and being the world police. Our actions across the globe has, majority of the time, only caused destabilization and it is time we only intervene if we are directly attacked or an ally is being invaded (unlikely). Mrs. Clinton seems likely to return to a pseudo-Cold War and has already shouted her support for toppling Assad without any clear explanation for an exit plan or reason why it won't end up like Libya. The nations of the world need to run their course and we should not be picking the winners.

&gt;I think part of it was that after 13 years of full-time education, the novelty and freedom of being able to go and get trashed and miss a day of lectures was too interesting and compelling to ignore.

Amen. School did far more damage to me than good. I left school thinking I hated education and learning. Luckily I realised quite quickly that it was just school which was shit (for my interests and how I study anyway).

&gt;I've heard the EU is considering giving all 18 year olds a free 12-month Inter-rail pass for their birthday. That is a very, very good idea. ""Here, go get the wild shit out of your system, go and see the continent, figure out what you want to do, see you in a year"". Get it all out, maybe take a job serving in a cafe in a town a thousand miles away, learn something about people you know nothing about. Now come back, get into the lecture halls and do something with all those ideas.

That is awesome. Cheesy as it sounds backpacking is really a formative experience for young people, especially those who have never left home. Probably less so if they aren't doing it on a shoe string budget and just staying in expensive hotels paid for by mummy and daddy but even then it's probably a good thing overall.

It's also a brilliant way of encouraging European identity and making it clear how much we have in common. I honestly think a lot of young UKIP supporters would be shocked at how similar countries like Denmark, Germany and Austria are to England. And even the rest of the countries have a lot more in common with us then they would guess. 

Maybe that is wishful thinking though and a load of those 18 year olds would go and sit in the Irish bar and moan about how all the food is foreign. 

&gt;Good luck to you on your studies, I'm jealous. I'm in a well-paid job in a field I love, but I sometimes think about going back to University in a couple of years (I'll be in my early 40s by then), and doing something different and challenging.

If you are doing it purely to challenge yourself and learn thing you could look into doing stuff part-time with the OU. They do full degrees but also diplomas and stuff like that. I think you can stretch out a degree to like 6 years or something and it is significantly cheaper than uni plus lets you keep working, not have to move your family, etc. Obviously it's not so good if you are wanting to do something postgrad to go into a specific line of work or research but that doesn't sound like what you are looking for.",t1_d8aocgu,,0,False,,d8ap1nf,MMSTINGRAY,"Make war on a system, not a class.",0,1,1478301056,1475411853,False,t3_55grw5,LabourUK,t5_30c1v

"&gt;That is your proof of democracy? Its funny how you ignored the blatantly undemocratic Lisbon

First, we need to consider something very important; Should the EU be democratic? This is a complex question, but very important one for us as Europeans. IMO, the EU prime function shouldn't be to be democratic, but to maintain peace. The problem with having a 100% democratic system in a multi-nation system is that nothing will get done. 

You will have an political entity that would make the US congress look competent. MEP will only vote in their own self-interest -- in the case of right wing nuts (farage, le pen, wilders) against their self-interest-- and not enjoy stability, peace in the region. Freedom is not free. If we look at history; the rise of populist demagogues is the most dangerous threat to Europe. The EU is the best defense against these manipulative bastards. They will burn their nations to the ground so they can rule the ashes. They don't care about economics, peace and most importantly: Happiness.  

These are the people who tell you the EU is bad, these are the people who tell disenfranchised voters that the establishment and foreigners are to blame for their troubles. These are the people who you need to fear not the EU. 

&gt; arage was elected to be an MEP, are you seriously saying because they didn;t throw out a democratically elected member from the house that they are a beacon of democracy for it?

Farage is still an active MEP, even though his mission in life is to destroy it. He is an idiot. Although, I am a firm believer that idiots should have the right to voice their opinions and I defend that right even though his opinion is insincere and based on his own self interest. 

&gt; . Simply pretending that a huge population of the EU is discontent with the direction does not help the EU it damages it

I agree it needs reform, we agree on that . I also agree that we shouldn't ignore the idiots. This is what I believe is the biggest problem in Europe. 

There are a lot of people who have genuine concerns about immigration, economics etc, but the moderate and liberal parties refuse to talk about these issues and these people are then forced to side with the idiots; because, the idiots are the only one who address these issues.

So basically, with this deal in place, Turks won't have to prepare tens of thousands of documents for a stupid stamp. That's it. Not much will change - mostly, young people like me who have money to travel to EU but unable to cope with bureaucracy will find it easier to travel into EU. For example, I have the money to buy a ticket to Budapest and spend a week there. However, I'm a student with irregular jobs so it's impossible for me to persuade the Consulate that I have means to travel - they want to know where I work, how much I make etc. I can't provide these even though I have the money. Sure, Turkey is not in a good state and SO MANY people want to run away. However, most of the youth has things to lose. Here I go with a personal example again... I don't want to live in this country and if I had a proper chance to leave for somewhere else that's better, I'd definitely take it. HOWEVER, I never want to be an illegal, useless immigrant who gets no respect from people. I study at a good university here. I make relatively good money for a student. I'm a registered, tax-payer, respected citizen of the country. I have a place to live and stuff like that. I will never leave these all behind me just for the sake of, let's say, living in Sweden as a guy who gets shit on by everyone. So, don't worry, Turks being able to travel into Schengen zone without visa DOESN'T mean they will flood into EU to stay forever.

And another thing: we hold a very important card against EU in form of refugees. Personally, I don't care much about visa-free travel. I can live without visiting EU. However, I'm not sure if you can keep living with thousands of refugees ruining your land. We didn't ask for visa-free travel out of blue. It's a card to play. You will either grant it or get drowned in refugees.

Though I think there is a third option: Erdoğan receives all the money and accepts refugees and we Turks don't get visa-free travel. I don't want to think about this.",t3_55hll2,,0,False,,d8aqkmn,Rigelmeister,,1,-7,1478301795,1475415602,False,t3_55hll2,worldnews,t5_2qh13
"Let's take these in order:

&gt; Did the Romans go extinct? 

With the dissolution of the Roman and Byzantine empires, you could make an argument that ""Romans"" as such as extinct (though present-day inhabitants of Rome might disagree with you), but of course descendants of the population of the Roman Empire are still extant. According to [The History and Geography of Human Genes](http://www.worldcat.org/title/history-and-geography-of-human-genes/oclc/27936937) 295:

&gt; Most of the groups that came to Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire were probably too small numerically to give a detectable genetic contribution, given that Europe was already fairly densely populated at the time.

Which leads into your next question:

&gt; Were they displaced or exterminated by the Germanic tribes?

You have the movement of multiple peoples into and around Europe during the ""Migration Period"" (c.400-700 AD), including Germanic tribes like the Goths, Angles, Saxons, Franks, Lombards, and Vandals. However, compared to the native population they were relatively small, and while they set up or took over kingdoms, they tended to be absorbed rather than displace or exterminate. A really good overview on the subject is [Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376-568](http://www.worldcat.org/title/barbarian-migrations-and-the-roman-west-376-568/oclc/166626146), but the upshot is that when, for example, Odoacer declared himself King of Italy in 476, he didn't empty out Rome or put all the citizens to the sword - he reigned with the support of the Roman Senate.

&gt; To what extent are Italians, Spaniards, Frenchmen and others descended from Romans?

Long before the Migration Period, Rome expanded its borders from Britain to Northern Africa in the west, and Armenia to Egypt in the east. The Romans didn't have the numbers to displace the native populations any more than the Migration-era peoples did, but there was some intermarriage. To refer back to *The History and Geography of Human Genes* 281 on Gaul/France:

&gt; In Roman times, the population numbered about 5 million people, a high density for that time (though roughly 10 times less than now). The Roman language (Latin) fully replaced the Celtic dialects, of which only a few words survive in languages spoken today. Modern French evolved during the Middle Ages from Latin to this area, as summarized afterward in this section.

&gt; Later genetic contributions were probably scarce. German contributions include some German soldiers in the Roman army who were authorized to settle in France as farmers or as auxiliary soldiers. Visigoths were allowed by Rome to settle in Aquitania in A.D. 410, but later moved to Spain and left only a small genetic contribution. Burgundians, originally from the southeastern Baltic, settled in eastern France, but were crushed by the Huns. They gave the name to Burgundy, but survivors settled in Savoy. Another Germanic people, the Alemanni, settled in Alsatia and Switzerland and gave their language to these regions. Yet another Germanic tribe, the Franks, moved from the lower Rhine to north-eastern France, which was more sparsely settled at the time. The Franks are also believed to have contributed relatively little genetically to the Parisian area, which was then already heavily settled by Gallo-Romans, but they developed efficient political control of the region. [...] Altogether the German genetic contribution is estimated to have involved 300,00-250,000 people, or 6%-7% of the population of Gual (Fierro-Domenech 1986). Howeaver, Celtic people were themselves a mixture of central Europeans, and the high homogeneity of central Europe and northern Europe was probably already established, at least in great part, by late Neolithic times.

So if you want to define Romans as ""inhabitants of the Roman Empire"" - probably everybody in Italy, Spain, France, and most of Europe in general is descended from them. If you want to narrow that down into ""descended from someone that was ethnically Roman,"" that gets trickier. Which leads us to your next question.

&gt; Were the Romans even caucasian?

""Caucasian"" was one of the two categories of the human race (along with ""Mongolians"") created by Christoph Meiners in *Grundriss der Geschichte der Menschheit* (""The Outline of History of Humanity,"" 1785). It wasn't originally a scientific term, though it became adopted into various later racial typology schemes during the heyday of scientific racialism. So the exact answer would probably depend on how you meant ""Caucasian."" If you meant ""Were the Romans white by the standards we understand it today?"" then the answer would be: some of them! As I mentioned, the Roman Empire at it's greatest extant was hugely broad, and included a very ethnically diverse population. Certainly there were populations in North Africa and the Levant that were not what would be considered ""white"" today, and yet they were Roman citizens and intermarried with the general Roman population. You might want to read Lloyd Thompson's [Roman Perceptions of Blacks](https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ElAnt/V1N4/thompson.html), which is a bit dry but tries to show that attitudes towards race were a bit different.

Not to mention that self driving cars while they might come a feature don't expect in next 50 years to be the norm. Because you would need to replace every single car with a self driving car and while this might be maybe maybe possible in US where people do not travel abroad as much with their cars it would be near impossible in EU.  

The market with cars in the next 50 years will mostly shift to electric cars while sel;f driving just being what it is now assisted driving.  

But the technology is not even the biggest barrier. For self driving cars to actually work you need to have all cars be that and that means telling people no-more-self-driving-cars and you will NEVER pass that legislation ever in the next 5 generations.

"&gt;Trump's word choice is part of his appeal to the majority of Americans. His simple sentence structure allows him to connect to hundreds of millions of people, even immigrants with poor English skills and it's an effective way of selling an idea.

&gt; That being said my support for Trump comes primarily from my disapproval of Mrs. Clinton. She is a typical cardboard cutout of a politician with 30 years of do-nothing experience, and is now running for president promising changes.

&gt; Illegal immigration is a huge problem for the US, there are about 20 million undocumented people that live here, and they are competing with Americans for labor

I saw a joke in French (but it's probably from internet and therefore comes from English speakers) that says: if an immigrant with no money, no contact, and not speaking the language takes your job, the problem comes from you, not immigration. On a more serious note, in France at least, immigrant takes job French people don't want to do. You mostly see them taking the trash, ect. Some French wouldn't even consider those job (but some do).

&gt; Fortunately for this country, there are less Muslims that live here than in France. Believe it or not, people in the US have information from Europe, we see the massacres that occur every year from the Muslim population

So far more people have died in USA from Muslim than in Europe from Muslim (considering Turkey is not in EU). You will more likely die from car crash than Muslim attack. I strongly dislike this terror spread by media. Yes those massacre are tragic and must be avoided. But if Muslim where really all the same, as there is more than 1 billion Muslim in the world, we would see much more. There is not attack every year in Europe, so far in France there have been 3 attacks, and 1 (or mb 2, don't remember) in Belgium. Again, not taking Turkey in consideration as they have other terrorist group against their government.

"Wow, never really thought of that with the alcohol but that's brilliant. I really like how cheap, lightweight and efficient (5-7min boil of 250ml from what I read). That's badass. 

My setup is very similar except my base is a small, aluminum cup with hinges along the top. It's probably 10cm in diameter which is enough to fit 4 tea candles. After poking a couple of holes in the base, I can set my pot atop and get ~1L of water boiling in about 40minutes

Pros: lightweight and compact base, relatively efficient (with windbreaking/insulation), tea candles are cheap and last 4-8 hours, I can ""turn off"" my system by simply blowing them out, it seems to be the most efficient weight to energy ratio I can find at a price of $5, also it's a great little space heater/floor lamp, 75 candles gives you 110+hours of burn time. Aside from your alcohol stove i can't think of a cheaper and more readily available fuel source. Ethanol alcohol isn't as prevalent here in Europe whereas tea candles are sold everywhere

Cons: a 75 count bag of candles is somewhere around a kilo and bulky, and the liquid wax can get a bit messy

"I did say it was complicated! Take Socialism as an example: the Nazi state implemented Socialism in the 1930s with the aim of supporting the Fascist state, while in the UK in the 1940s it was implemented as a left-wing policy in support of Workers' rights. This is why I roll my eyes when some call Obama a ""socialist"" since Socialism is an economic idea, not a complete political ideology. It's a tool, neither ""left"" nor ""right"" by itself. The politics is an extra layer on top, such as Communism in Russia, National Socialism in Germany, or the Labour movement in the UK and other European countries.

&gt;lso our nice British cottage is more like a once great castle that the nostalgic people refuse to acknowledge is in ruin and that they should move on to a smaller, but modern, apartment. Soon enough Scotland is gonna dump england that British cottage will turn into an Anglo-Welsh one.

The UK hasn't been in decline since the 1980s. The UK is still the World's 5th largest economy despite unimaginable of growth across the developing world. I hate having to constantly restate all this. I'm just going to paste an older post of mine:

-----

&gt;In every imagination of geopolitical measurement, the UK still ranks as a Great Power. Despite the woeful fantasies of the British 'hard-left' and people from certain embarrassingly bitter countries, the UK hasn't been in decline since the 1980's.

&gt;Certain people would have you believe that somehow, in a recent yet undocumented and dateless period of decline, the UK has fallen behind countries like South Korea, Mexico or even Turkey and Egypt, when in reality the UK still ranks far ahead of supposed rising superpowers such as India and Brazil.

&gt;Despite countless (usually opinionated, non-academic) articles and reports in the media forecasting British decline and decreeing that we as Brits need to take stock of our real, particularly diminished standing in the World, the real geopolitical position of the UK remains clear.

&gt;The UK:

&gt;* is a recognised nuclear power

&gt;* is a permanent member of the UN security council, holding a veto over resolutions

&gt;* has the 5th largest economy out of 196 countries in the World

&gt;* is forecast to overtake Germany to become the largest economy in Europe by 2030

&gt;* has the World's 5th largest military budget

&gt;* has one of only several 'blue-water navies' in the World, capable of global projection

&gt;* spends the second highest total in foreign aid behind the USA

&gt;* spends the highest amount of foreign aid per capita alongside Sweden

&gt;* is home to the World's largest financial center, the City of London

&gt;This British self-loathing (of which there will be plenty of examples in the comment section later, I'm sure) goes well beyond our documented passion of eccentric, comical self-depreciation, and it's been evident for decades, as George Orwell once put it

&gt;""England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality. In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman. 

&gt;It is a strange fact, but it is unquestionably true, that almost any intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during 'God save the Queen' than of stealing from a poor box.""

"I picked up [An Environmental History of the Middle Ages by John Aberth](https://www.routledge.com/An-Environmental-History-of-the-Middle-Ages-The-Crucible-of-Nature/Aberth/p/book/9780415779463) and I'm starting to suspect historians are really weird people.

This book is an attempt to describe the relationship that humankind had to the environment from late antiquity to the beginning of the Renaissance. So far so interesting. Now there is lots of room for things that people wrote about nature and the environment, an important part of that question. Thing is, there is almost no room for the things climate science, biology, and economics we use to illustrate those issues now.

What I mean is perhaps best explained by an example that I understand reasonably well, The Medieval Warm Period a.k.a Medieval Climate Anomaly.  I would explain what it is with two pictures that look like this. [The reconstructed mean temperature record](https://i.imgur.com/W8iBXNz.png) and a [model generated map](https://i.imgur.com/bwVKyWS.png) that shows an interpretation of these data on a map. There that is what it is to me, a little blip on a line, an event that shifted warmth energy from one spot to another.

Mr. Aberth does mention some of the records use in these reconstructions, but he doesn't seem to feel the need to quantify the relative change. Instead he tells us Europeans of that time were in a cooperative mood as far as the elements were concerned. Then comes the main point, he points out that it is hard to draw a line between major events like the Crusades and climate change. Warmer climates don't have to lead to crusading activity, they could have lead to something else. At best climate is one factor among many that generated the historic outcome.

That isn't wrong, but why no pictures? Why no maps? Why no data? Later he discusses things like the invention of the windmill and its spread, but no tax records to show their use, or maps to put that spread into context. He even uses the words Malthusian trap at some point, but he never feels the need for illustrative results. For Malthus that is particularly weird as it is most easily understood as an [equilibrium point in a mathematical model](http://www.web-books.com/eLibrary/Books/B0/B61/IMG/fwk-rittenecon-fig33_005.jpg). 

It's not like there are no pictures at all in this little book either. We get pictures of paintings, of sculptures, of parchment. This man sees the world in a very distinct way. He thinks it's best to describe our relationship with nature by what we write, not by what we measurably do. We can measure signs of ancient pollution, we can reconstruct biodiversity to some extent, we can use proxies to figure out the demographics of Europe over time. All of those things have been done, he could have used them

We use those kinds of heuristics to describe how we interact with the environment today, why not use them for the past? Seriously, the EU has a Union wide strategy to prevent any further loss of biodiversity, [have a look if you don't believe me](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm). We measure dust clouds from Chinese industry and spread of pollutants through the world seas. We have satellites in space to figure out how we impact the environment.

"Levelling Kurdish cities? Death of those who were arrested since the coup? Supplying weapons and buying oil from ISIS??

Turkey is actually fighting ISIS as we speak in Syria. And this isn't US airstrike kinda empty shit fighting, they actually have ground troops in there.

Look, I know people in /r/worldnews and /r/europe would like to fantasize about Turkey having ties with ISIS and all, but those claims were never backed with evidence. Some guy in the US just said ""we have evidence ISIS supplies oil to Turkey""... That evidence have never been released. And ""supplying oil to Turkey"" doesn't even mean that Turkish government has anything to do with it. It is possible to have smugglers all the time, especially considering Syrian border is so hard to patrol, but nothing links Turkey to ISIS. There is simply no evidence on that. And don't tell me the pictures published by Russia are evidence. They just published photos of a bunch of trucks, with no information or proof on their source and destination (AFAIK, some of them even were proved to be of Kurdish government in Iraq, with whom Turkey is allies.)

Levelling Kurdish cities? Yeah, this is PKK propaganda. There have been operations in many cities since the last year, but no citizen was ever harmed by Turkish Forces during these operations. The target was PKK and their organization in Turkish cities. You can always use some Google skills and find videos released by Turkish forces and other sources that show the weapon and explosive caches found in those cities. When PKK members know they are getting outnumbered by Turkish Forces they try to gain public attention and support by claiming that they are ""innocent civilians"". This is their usual stuff, everbody who has ever dealt with PKK knows this. See, If civilians were ever killed, do you think Kurdish people in the area wouldn't riot? As said before, you can always find some really hard-proof on google and twitter.

Claiming people who are arrested will die with nothing to back it up is just dumb.

"Indian here. As others have rightly pointed out, you are missing out on a lot of great places in your itinerary. Coimbatore is my hometown and the only reasons tourists set foot in its airport is to go to Ooty, and even that place is popular because is an easy hill getaway. There are far more impressive places elsewhere in India.




Delhi is definitely not the best introduction to India. In fact none of the major Indian cities are particularly attractive for travelers, and given the state of infrastructure in cities, navigating them will be major hassle. The gems of India lie in the smaller towns and remote places. Delhi has the best connectivity both abroad and within India, use it only to get to the country. I would not spend more than 2-3 days there. You should add a day trip to Agra. 

Bikaner is a rather unusual stop in your itinerary. The most popular camel safari destination is Jaisalmer. I beleive it is better connected to both Delhi and Mumbai. 

Take a day time train to travel to Goa from Mumbai. The scenery is spectacular.

There are no direct non stop flights from Goa to anywhere in Kerala, so you should either take the train or break your journey at some other place.

If you are flying to Varanasi via Chennai, you should definitely do a day trip to Mahabalipuram.

Other destinations for you to consider

Hampi - ancient ruins with a lot of history

Gokarna - the hipster alternative to Goa. Not popular with the local crowd, you'll find mostly European/Israeli backpackers here. 

Alleppey and Munnar in Kerala are standard stops in a Kerala itinerary.


 Have a great time in India!

"Huge implications in Beijing draw for WTF qualification on the women's side!!

http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5943081/title/pliskova-radwanska-close-to-singapore-battle-royale-set-in-beijing

Serena Williams, Angelique Kerber, and Simona Halep have all qualified. Next toe in line to qualify are Karolina Pliskova &amp;amp; Aga Radwanska (with only 5 pts separating them) who will qualify automatically if they make it to 3R &amp;amp; QF respectively. (That 5 points is the difference between auto qualifying).

Rounding out top 8 are Muguruza (AQ by reaching final) Cibulkova (AQ by winning Beijing), and Keys (AQ by winning Beijing).

The next 4 spots are close enough to potentially make a push: Kuznetsova, Konta, and Kvitova.

QUARTER TO WATCH: Muguruza, Keys, Kuznetsova, and Kvitova are all in the same quarter of Beijing.

Potential R16 Matches that have huge impact on Finals Qualifications (# is spot in race to Singapore):

Pliskova (#4) vs Konta (#11) - Pliskova will have qualified by making this match, but she could essentially stop Konta's chances to qualify here.

Keys (#8) vs Kuznetsova (#10)
Kvitova (#12) vs Muguruza (#6).

EDIT: CSN's chances of qualifying in serious jeopardy as she lost in R1 of Beijing.

"&gt; They most certainly did not use the word race. You remember it because that's what you're used to. And it'd be totally irrelevant anyway. People are not getting discriminated against for being black or hispanic, they're getting discriminated for being from Ghana, Egypt or Spain. If that happens.

Defensive much? Now you, who wasn't even present at these conversations is telling me how they went down. They did mention race. They mentioned the word race, racism, prejudice, discrimination, etc. Literally had a conversation on Monday evening about this topic with a black woman and she said, ""Yeah, as a black woman here, I experience X, Y, and Z. 

&gt; People are not getting discriminated against for being black or hispanic, they're getting discriminated for being from Ghana, Egypt or Spain. If that happens.

Yes, they are. They say they do. Not so much getting gunned down in the street like in America, but from what I have been told, they face discrimination in the workplace (being seen as less competent/not as intelligent/being talked down to), ""less pleasant"" interactions with the police, etc. 

This is funny to me. I guess when people throw bananas at black soccer players in Europe, it isn't because they are black. it's because they are from a certain country. It isn't like bananas and black people have some racist connotation--you know, like black people being likened to monkeys. That conclusion is just impossible....

&gt; No, of course not. And by the way: There's hardly been slaves in europe and what could colonialism possibly have to do with any of this.

Whoosh of epic proportions. You're missing the point entirely. Europe didn't practice slavery and colonialism in its own backyard, it did it abroad. So you're telling me that engaging in the horrific practice of slavery or imperialism against darker complexioned folks on the justification that they are lesser beings would have no impact in how the descendants of said people interact with darker skinned people today?

"TL: DR - Today we take the bow/arrow and hatchet for a Spin showing our prelim bow setup and discussing a little bit about how we plan on tweaking it by making it a little easier to use.  I spend a bunch of time talking about the grip system, the ideas we are playing with and the difference between a physics versus snap grip system as well as why we would use one over the other in certain circumstances.  I finally am able to take out my inner rage on a tree and chop it down, netting myself a decent amount of wood in the process.  Our tree system looks at the size of the tree and the type of tree and from that determines how much health is has an how much wood you can get out of it, so that’s pretty much done.  I close the video up by chatting about our near future plans and why we are developing things in the order we are.  Essentially, for better or worse, I’ve looked at the final goals and worked my way back from there.  So for Early Access we want to allow you to forge your own sword, which means we need a fully functional blacksmithing system in place however a forge requires a few things to work properly: Fuel, Heat and Raw Material.  Working our way back from there I figured we’d want to build out the Lumberjack system first so you could gather the fuel, next we will be creating our heat and fire system and lastly mining.  From this point we’ll be ready to tackle Blacksmithing.   Anyways, a little peak into our thought/dev process here, as always tell us what you think and your thoughts on everything I rambled on about in this video


**00:00 - 00:40 - Introducing the hatchet and the bows and arrows**

**00:41 - 02:22 - Playing with Crossbows**

- Shooting the Light European Crossbow - 175-200lbs drawweight.  Showing off the ironsight

- Shooting the Arbalest and showing off the Goats foot lever and the bolt lock mechanism.  

- Shooting the European Crossbow - 200lbs of draw weight

- Shooting the hand crossbow

**02:23  - 06:31  - Shooting the Bow**

- Explaining the snap point that auto snaps the bow and hand in place.

 - -We use snap points so that players can quickly pick up the bow and it’s rotated and setup in your hand immediately

 - -Only used in items that need to be help in a specific way (bows, xbows, etc)

 - -Hybrid snap vs real grip system - So there will be hotspots on the objects that snap the object in your hand, but if you grab it somewhere else on the object it will attach your hand at that point
- Showing off the bow and talking about string improvements

 - -Probably will be increasing the area size where the arrow can snap into place to make it a little more forgiving.

 - -Refining the bow mechanics a little bit to make it more comfortable to players.  

 - -Limited the lateral movement and the vertical movement of the arrow when nocked

 - -Improving the haptic feedback
 - -The arrows have too much velocity right now, there isn’t much drop going on so we have to tweak how gravity affects arrows and how arrows loose velocity over time to mimic real life.

 - -We are looking for ways to differentiate the bows from one another, not juset on how they fire but how they feel.  Join the conversation on our forums to give us your ideas.

**06:32 - 09:08 - Using and discussing the Hatchet**

- Demonstrating why we like the snap to points so much.  Can pick the hatchet up anywhere on the object, but because virtual hands don’t articulate like in real life it makes it a pain in the ass to line the object up perfectly in your virtual hand with a non-snap-to grip system.

- Means you have to play around with the thing in your hand for 5-10 seconds before it’s position properly.
So we want to do all that work for you, so if you pick it up by the grip point, it auto rotates into place, along with your hand so you’re ready to go right off the bat

- Chopping down the tree, wood resources are coming out.

- Once done you’re left with a stump.  Temporary for now as it’s missing some textures and will be replaced later.

- With our trees we will have a more simplistic version where each tree has x amount of health and it will spit out a wood piece after x amount of health has been reduced.

- Starting with this simplistic system but we plan on implementing a more complex lumberjacking down the road

- First step is mimicking The Forest, where the tree falls and breaks into large pieces that can either be harvested whole or chopped into smaller pieces

- Final mode is felling the tree where then it needs to be chopped into smaller pieces which can either be harvested and send to the lumbermill or further chopped down.  Perhaps skinning the bark, chopping off branches, etc etc.  We’ll see how far we want to take it

**09:09 - 09:52 - Talking about future plans**

- Very excited to get the lumberjacking done first as it forms the foundation for so much of the crafting that will happen in Yore VR. 

- Our plan is to lay the groundwork for a complex woodworking system where the player can build anything from axe handles to houses so setting up the resources properly and gathering is crucial to those future systems

- We are building out the systems in the order which they will be used.  So our end goal for early access release is to be able to craft a sword.  

 - -To do blacksmithing properly we need to have fuel to feed our forge so we can craft our iron.  So for that we need to be able to chop down trees to get wood to burn.  

 - -We also need to refine Iron, which means that we need to be able to gather the Iron ore, but then we need to be able to refine it.. This requires fuel for the smelter and iron ore to refine.

 - -So before we tackle the crafting systems we are perfecting the gathering systems and other supporting systems that they rely on

- Hoping to have mining in next week

**09:53 -  Summarizing the dev vlog**

- Bows and Arrows

- Chopping down trees

- Grip system

&gt; * India's surgical strikes across the Line of Control in the aftermath of Uri attack has had an immediate fallout on commercial flights from India.

&gt; * Pakistan has banned low-level flying over its airspace that could result in rerouting of flights to the US, Europe and the Gulf.A NOTAM --note to airmen or a bulletin to aviators -- issued by Pakistani aviation authorities says all flights flying over Lahore will now have to fly above 29,000 feet while crossing Lahore.These restrictions will be for the whole month of October, says the NOTAM, citing operational reasons.Last Monday, a similar NOTAM was issued for all civilian aircraft flying over Karachi to maintain a flight level of 33,000 feet.Reports suggest that lower level of airspace or flight levels have been reserved for Pakistani fighter aircraft.

&gt; * ""What this means is that our flights will have to opt for longer and safer routes and that can delay flights,"" said a former DGCA official, who didn't wish to be identified.Except Pakistan International Airlines that fly between India and Pakistan, no other Indian carriers operate between the two countries.

&gt; * But Pakistan is a popular air corridor for flights operating between the Far East and West Asia, Europe and the US.

"TL: DR - Today we take the bow/arrow and hatchet for a Spin showing our prelim bow setup and discussing a little bit about how we plan on tweaking it by making it a little easier to use.  I spend a bunch of time talking about the grip system, the ideas we are playing with and the difference between a physics versus snap grip system as well as why we would use one over the other in certain circumstances.  I finally am able to take out my inner rage on a tree and chop it down, netting myself a decent amount of wood in the process.  Our tree system looks at the size of the tree and the type of tree and from that determines how much health is has an how much wood you can get out of it, so that’s pretty much done.  I close the video up by chatting about our near future plans and why we are developing things in the order we are.  Essentially, for better or worse, I’ve looked at the final goals and worked my way back from there.  So for Early Access we want to allow you to forge your own sword, which means we need a fully functional blacksmithing system in place however a forge requires a few things to work properly: Fuel, Heat and Raw Material.  Working our way back from there I figured we’d want to build out the Lumberjack system first so you could gather the fuel, next we will be creating our heat and fire system and lastly mining.  From this point we’ll be ready to tackle Blacksmithing.   Anyways, a little peak into our thought/dev process here, as always tell us what you think and your thoughts on everything I rambled on about in this video


**00:00 - 00:40 - Introducing the hatchet and the bows and arrows**

**00:41 - 02:22 - Playing with Crossbows**

- Shooting the Light European Crossbow - 175-200lbs drawweight.  Showing off the ironsight

- Shooting the Arbalest and showing off the Goats foot lever and the bolt lock mechanism.  

- Shooting the European Crossbow - 200lbs of draw weight

- Shooting the hand crossbow

**02:23  - 06:31  - Shooting the Bow**

- Explaining the snap point that auto snaps the bow and hand in place.

 - We use snap points so that players can quickly pick up the bow and it’s rotated and setup in your hand immediately

 - Only used in items that need to be help in a specific way (bows, xbows, etc)

 - Hybrid snap vs real grip system - So there will be hotspots on the objects that snap the object in your hand, but if you grab it somewhere else on the object it will attach your hand at that point
- Showing off the bow and talking about string improvements

 - Probably will be increasing the area size where the arrow can snap into place to make it a little more forgiving.

 - Refining the bow mechanics a little bit to make it more comfortable to players.  

 - Limited the lateral movement and the vertical movement of the arrow when nocked

 - Improving the haptic feedback

 - The arrows have too much velocity right now, there isn’t much drop going on so we have to tweak how gravity affects arrows and how arrows loose velocity over time to mimic real life.

 - We are looking for ways to differentiate the bows from one another, not juset on how they fire but how they feel.  Join the conversation on our forums to give us your ideas.

**06:32 - 09:08 - Using and discussing the Hatchet**

- Demonstrating why we like the snap to points so much.  Can pick the hatchet up anywhere on the object, but because virtual hands don’t articulate like in real life it makes it a pain in the ass to line the object up perfectly in your virtual hand with a non-snap-to grip system.

- Means you have to play around with the thing in your hand for 5-10 seconds before it’s position properly.
So we want to do all that work for you, so if you pick it up by the grip point, it auto rotates into place, along with your hand so you’re ready to go right off the bat

- Chopping down the tree, wood resources are coming out.

- Once done you’re left with a stump.  Temporary for now as it’s missing some textures and will be replaced later.

- With our trees we will have a more simplistic version where each tree has x amount of health and it will spit out a wood piece after x amount of health has been reduced.

- Starting with this simplistic system but we plan on implementing a more complex lumberjacking down the road

- First step is mimicking The Forest, where the tree falls and breaks into large pieces that can either be harvested whole or chopped into smaller pieces

- Final mode is felling the tree where then it needs to be chopped into smaller pieces which can either be harvested and send to the lumbermill or further chopped down.  Perhaps skinning the bark, chopping off branches, etc etc.  We’ll see how far we want to take it

**09:09 - 09:52 - Talking about future plans**

- Very excited to get the lumberjacking done first as it forms the foundation for so much of the crafting that will happen in Yore VR. 

- Our plan is to lay the groundwork for a complex woodworking system where the player can build anything from axe handles to houses so setting up the resources properly and gathering is crucial to those future systems

- We are building out the systems in the order which they will be used.  So our end goal for early access release is to be able to craft a sword.  

 - To do blacksmithing properly we need to have fuel to feed our forge so we can craft our iron.  So for that we need to be able to chop down trees to get wood to burn.  

 - We also need to refine Iron, which means that we need to be able to gather the Iron ore, but then we need to be able to refine it.. This requires fuel for the smelter and iron ore to refine.

 - So before we tackle the crafting systems we are perfecting the gathering systems and other supporting systems that they rely on

- Hoping to have mining in next week

"I have been thinking about this and made the following timetable of major events to get my head around it: 

* **June 23rd 2016**: UK votes to leave the EU.

* **March 31 2017**: May writes to the European Council stating the UK's intention is to leave the EU, in keeping with [paragraph 2, article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html).

* *April - May 2017: French presidential election*

* *August 27th - October 30th 2017: German federal election (that's a general election to you and me)*

* **March 31 2019**: Unless there is an agreement to extend the departure period, EU treaties will cease to apply to the UK from this date. 

* **May 7th 2020**: UK General Election


**Analysis**:

So, if May invokes paragraph 2 of article 50 when she has said, it will mean the UK would leave the EU around 403 days (or 1 year, 1 month and 7 days) ahead of the 2020 general election.

Now, my gut feeling is May could attempt to delay invoking article 50 (possibly using the franco-german elections in 2017 as justification) until after May 8th 2018. Doing that would mean she could put the outcome of article 50 back to the electorate, buy more time for backroom negotiations ahead of article 50 and finally by the time we vote in 2020 we won't actually have officially left the EU. This has some obvious advantages and disadvantages for May. The advantages are it means if Brexit goes horribly wrong, it won't have happened by the time we vote in 2020. The disadvantages for May are that she might get punished at the polls in 2020 if euroskeptics perceive her to be blocking brexit.

My name is Maximus, and I am the current recruiter for You Started It clan! After reading your post I would like to invite you to our clan. The difference with us and other clans is our bond. We are not just a group of people who happen to talk to eachother, we genuinely know eachother. And we are looking for people to join the ranks!

Our Counter-Strike team is currently empty, so we are looking for people to start one! Do you want to start your own team, join a very new one and help us expand our CS playerbase? You can find us at www.ysiclan.eu. We have a Teamspeak you can use 24/7 and if you need your own channels or something like that you can always contact me and I will set it up with the clan leaders!

"Deficio already talked about that with some of the coaches in the EU. The reason EU teams have problems closing out games is pretty obvious. When they scrim, and one of the teams is ahead in the early game/laning phase, most of the time the teams call OPEN/GG and go next game. So when you go on international stage and you dont get ahead, or even when you get ahead the enemy team doesnt FF/OPEN you struggle to close out games. Because this is the way you scrim. Its pretty bad habit and Deficio already pointed out several times this last split in EU. No one to blame but you own training regime.",t3_55i6tx,team 00,0,False,,d8ax9tk,KuraSanaEi,,0,2,1478305024,1475426680,False,t3_55i6tx,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx
"Complex answer.  In medieval CK times in Europe, there rules of warfare, heredity, titles, essentially the entire feudal system that dictated what you were allowed to do, at least on the surface.  Granted someone like the Vikings coming in and conquering Normandy or southern Italy broke those rules, but in general someone who just attacked his neighbor for no cause faced serious repercussions, either from his other neighbors, his liege lord, the Pope, whatever.  Not to mention the inherent difficulties of managing any amount of land when you weren't viewed as deemed by God himself to rule it. This is a big reason, other than religious fervor, that nobles would join in on the crusades, because many of those rules didn't apply when you were taking land from heathens.  Might made right, but a bigger might would generally smack you down if you didn't at least make some kind of nod to the rules.  And so in CK, you're limited to only be able take things you could justifiably claim God wanted you to have.  To do otherwise would completely cast doubt on the fundamental feudal philosophy that the aristocracy were chosen by God to rule their particular pieces of land and completely disrupt feudal society.

In EU, we start to move past that, but there was still a very large emphasis placed on having at least some kind of nominal claim to what you were taking.  As time went on, there was less than less of internal limitations of conquest and much more of an evolving balance of power, where the various neighboring states would actively ally to prevent any one nations from getting dominance, only to turn on each other the moment someone else took the lead.  There were still fairly extremely physical limitation in terms of communication and infrastructure to controlling large amounts of land.  I would argue that the entire warscore/peace limitations should be abandoned entirely in favor of a much more adapt, adept, and deep badboy system, but Paradox chose to put limitations into conquest to sort of do an all encompassing mechanic to simulate balance of power and difficulty of control, mainly because BoP is VERY hard to train an AI to do well.  Honestly, many of the wars in Europe in this period were either a complete slaughter and one side took whatever they wanted, or they were fought until both sides were exhausted and the only limitations is how badly either side wanted peace.  There was no actual limitation on how MUCH you could take.

However, what could possibly makes sense in a galactic wide, space civilizations based game that could possibly dictate you having to return planets you've conquered by force and free peoples you've enslaved for no reason other than 'because'.  If you want to make it difficult to have a huge slave population, or rule an empire where 3/4's of it are conquered worlds, THAT'S strategic depth.  But it makes absolutely NO sense to say you can conquer just *this* much and then you have to stop and give the rest back, and wait 10 years.

I think HoI is the much more apt comparison.  Germany and Japan took as much as they wanted.  No limitations, no arbitrary peaces, no forcing them to say you can just have Belarus in this war, Eastern Ukraine has to wait for the next one.  The ONLY thing that stopped this was direct intervention of their neighbors, and the internal pressures of controlling the land.  If they had won, it was ALL theirs.

"That deal has been described as 'unworkable' by most sane people. I saw it mostly as: ""Buying time for the EU to get their shit together. Also Turkey will probably will not adhere to the rules. So it won't matter."" 

I think the EU is now getting their shit together. Albeit in a hap-hazard-last-resort-schizo way. Unfortunately Turkey is descending into madness. I'm not against people seeking comfort outside of a warzone. However if about 2/3rd of the asylum requests are denied because they come from a safe country. I think we need to set up some stiff measures. Don't even mentioned the economic migrants that are coming to the EU and think all will be peachy here. 

We should look out for people in need. But also make sure we do not get overwhelmed by it. It should not be impossible to take care of 1 million migrants within Europe (or even more). However the countries in the EU should also make sure that the integration works out OK. Something that a lot of countries have not figured out. If we would have taken the appropriate steps, registration would not have been a problem. We would not have lost 600.000 migrants. It would not be possible to hire migrants illegally. We could also ask firmer measures than we take now.

It's not fair that Hungary and Austria now get the blame for moving to the right while they also make sure that the Balkan route stays closed.

Turning a blind eye to migrants with PTSD and seeing them all as innocent refugees makes our problems a lot bigger. Whereas we could take care of them and get them on their feet. Here or back home. 

We should also ask of Turkey to obey the rules of law. National as international. This is currently not happening. ",t1_d8awv6s,,0,False,,d8axdza,jhaand,,0,14,1478305080,1475426845,False,t3_55hll2,worldnews,t5_2qh13
