For small countries especially the Euro is a really tempting enterprise. Bringing the currency to the former eastern block should make a difference in closing the gap in all kinds of statistics through added economic interest and a shared responsibility.

I'm not a federalist, but I believe in the benefits of bringing the same wealth across all of Europe. It's only then when our open system works as intended. Growth in Europe is good, and growth reduces the negative phenomena freedom of movement has caused. Euro is a good vessel for this in my eyes. It can increase tourism, it can make doing business easier. All of these things integrate European countries to each other creating a need to give a shit or two about each other, which you should do in any case because the shit that gets done in one country already affects other countries in the system.

Euro is a good catalyst for the symbiosis in the EU. Western countries have wealth, eastern countries have growth. With the money from the west the east gets to grow faster, and the west gets an investment which strengthens the region as a whole reducing some of the negative effects the wealth gap has caused. At the same time these countries get an economic boost as well.

By killing off Chewie - up till that point very few film characters had died, and he was the first 'big' one - we were given a sense of ""Holy crap; These are some proper bad guys, and none of our favourites are safe.""

While it was, in a sense, nice not having to worry about our favourites dying before, it was also........I don't want to say predictable, but that's sort of what it was.

Chewie was a wake-up call, and the journey it sent Han was an important one.

Having said that, if Chewie had lived then I think the events of *Star By Star* could have served the same purpose that Chewie's death did.

----------------------------------------
In regards to Mara is where I feel the strongest disagreement of your analysis.

For starters, I can think of no reason why Lucas would have anything against Zahn - save for perhaps a tinge of envy - and I'm pretty sure that the majority of the EU authors are aware of the debt they owe Zahn for re-kindling the EU with *Thrawn*.

I personally feel that Traviss handled it excellently - not quite as well as Zahn could have, but certainly better than nearly any of the other EU writers - and am personally glad that she went out like she did - fighting hard and brutally - rather than in something as mundane as starfighter combat.

As Fett said about Caedus:

&gt; “That’s a barve who nearly got his backside handed to him by Skywalker’s wife. He still looks scared when he remembers it. Because she went at him like a maniac....”

Other than the 'purposes' you point out, you miss two big ones, one of which is really a sub-point of your #1.

With Luke not being able to go up against Caedus, Jaina had to, for the first time, properly embrace her role as 'Sword of the Jedi'.

It would also serve as the catalyst for Ben's ultimately becoming disillusioned with Caedus, and this in turn set up Ben's own brush with the Dark side.

1) Be different

2) Continue to be different

The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews. 

By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture.

Also, Hitler going a ""little overkill."" You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide.

Edit: I love this. Guy says Hitler had some legitimate reasons for hating Jews and only went a little overkill and is at +5.

En del vet kanske inte det (och tyvärr har EU:s egna statiskik just försvunnit från ursprungs-URL:en, så jag kan inte för tillfället länka till källan), men Sverige tätt följt av Tyskland ger uppehållstillstånd till flest asylsökande i EU, och de båda ligger rätt mycket högre än tredjeplatsen, och sedan är det totalt omkring fem länder i topp som ligger högre än de flesta andra.

Reminds me a tiny bit of The Secret Garden, the father's mourning, I mean. I recently took to reading *Wildwood Dancing* by Marillier Knopf. If/when you get a chance, read it, you might find a lot of inspiration from the various female characters. It's set in a Fantasy early 1800s Eastern Europe and the protagonists are three young, petit aristocrat girls raised by a single lordly father.

&gt;Another is a horror/fantasy/romance tale (possibly science fiction as well, I hate working within one genre). A young girl, living in a quit hamlet in the country, meets a neighbor girl and they discover that they can travel to a mirror dream world.

You *really* should read Wildwood Dancing, because the fantasy element is about them going to this other realm where fairies, anthropomorphic animals and vampires exist.

&gt;Yeah, it is essentially a magical girl novel. I got the idea from watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica, so don't expect nice things. Oh, and romance, the two heroines fall for each other. But it is not that simple.

I love the fact that the protagonists and heroines are all women. Very refreshing! I would have them rescue a guy at some point, a prince or something, just to throw the damsel trope on it's head.

&gt;I am thinking about integrating the above story about the woman and her father and playing with the whole missing mother syndrome that many fantasy heroes seem to have.

I would start writing it. You don't always have to have the *whole* plot all planned out. Sometimes new ideas come about as you start writing. Often times as you're writing you realise some of the plot points you wanted to do are crap xD Just speaking from personal experience. So I'd get started, you never know where a story will lead you.

Sandy Mitchell, writer of the Ciaphas Cain novels, once said that he had his character of Ciaphas down to such perfection, that writing him into various stories is easy. All he needs to do is drop him in some random situation, and knows exactly how he's going to behave, what he's going to do, etc. It's tremendously satisfying to know your character so well that they quite literally run away with the story and have you playing catch-up behind them, narrating their story.

&gt;I also have a general plot about a colonized Mars and a war between the US and the Martians. Still very much in the concept stage, but I do have a title for it. ... Also, I have a very general and rough idea about a musician woman traveling around and trying to find herself, working title, Beneath Blue Skies.

You have a very fertile, and diverse portfolio of ideas to draw from. It's wonderful stuff. The only thing you're missing is some kind of superhero novel. You may want to read *Wearing the Cape* by Marion G. Harmon. It's about a young woman who discovers she has superpowers after suffering through a car crash. It's very much a bildungsroman, but it's got a lot of romance and identity self-discovery.

It's not about 'dumb', it's about humans on large having realized that it's not needed to be a decent person (it can help for some, but it can easily have just the opposite effect), not rational given what we know about the universe, and - when it's in any way entrenched in society - a very very bad thing (mostly people being deprived of liberties or persecuted, but also concerning education, social actions etc).

Religion is a special kind of superstition (involving what psychology calls 'magical thinking') that entrenches itself in the psychology of individuals (emotional attachment) and the structure of societies - so that it's made pretty much exempt from the kind of scrutiny that any similarly ludicrous (less contentiously: outlandish) idea would face when anybody demanded respect for it.

Even in mostly secular western Europe, it was pretty much unthinkable to criticize the position of power of churches and the influence of religion in society until the late 60s, and even then it was pretty much only the younger generation where this was socially acceptable. Today still, religion is entrenched within so many societies and cultures... state churches, blasphemy laws and socially accepted religious indoctrination from childhood on are the norm.

We still live in a world where religion is the norm, and being in any way vocal about thinking it might not be a good thing (not just not a rational thing) will mark you as at least a bit of an outsider (unless you're below age 25, and even then it might still )... religion still demands special privileges (and society demands them for it) and gets them.

Individually believing in 'a higher power' or whatever isn't rational given what we know. If there are 'mysteries', then philosophy, science and rationality in general are what will get us thinking clearly about them, and maybe also to get some actual answers some day, but a 'supernatural' explanation isn't an explanation at all, it makes literally no sense. So it's not rational - but then neither is gorging yourself on fatty and sugary stuff all the time... in the world Star Trek, I think neither is encouraged, and if you demand applause for it, you'd probably get some weird looks and perhaps an explanation of why that's not going to happen. But nobody is going to forbid you or disparage you from exercising your liberties.

It's daring to display secular, humanist values and not just look away from the irrationality and harmfulness of religion is a huge part of what made me respect Star Trek... and it's appeasement of irrationality in DS9, even outright mysticism (Sisko coming to treat the wormhole-aliens as deities to be revered) made me honestly a bit disheartened.

EDIT: I also think that human society in the Star Trek universe, while probably mostly secular and not taken by the contents of religious ideology, still cherishes and values the positive cultural contributions made in societal and individual religiously motivated or framed efforts (music, literature, architecture etc) and is happy to celebrate cultural diversity (where the cultural practices aren't especially harmful to unconsenting individuals), which I also always found to be admirable. Be steadfast in acting according to humanitarian, rationalist ideals - and celebrate diversity - to appreciate and to learn. A captain Picard wouldn't express his judgement on the ideological content of a religion unless the situation makes it appropriate - and would certainly respect and cherish religious contributions to culture, as well as completely respect individual choices with regard to religiosity (where freely made and non-harmful).

As far as we know, she isn't immortal.

&gt; What real world time would GoT take part in considering their technology and laws?

There isn't really any directly comparable period. I'd say ""Europe between 1000 and 1500"" is as specific as it gets, at least for Westeros.

&gt; Why does everyone (in the show) say supporting Targaryens is treason?

What is and isn't ""treason"" depends on your perspective. If you're running the current regime (Lannister/Baratheon), then supporting another regime is treason. If you believe you're the rightful monarch (Stannis, Danny), supporting anyone else is treason.

&gt; Didn't aegon unify westeros?

Yes - with fire and blood. Believe it or not, a lot of people don't like being conquered. People like the Ironborn, Northmen, and Dornish, for example. Moreover, there isn't any reason to believe Westeros had any particular desire or need to be unified.

&gt; And if a king (or family in this case) rules for about 300 years then they couldn't have been too bad usually a bad kingdom doesn't survive that long. And I had the feeling that a lot of lines in the show hinted that the ruling of the Targaryens wasn't all that bad.

First, the Targaryens ruled Westeros for about 300 years, which is actually quite brief. The seven (ish) independent kingdoms lasted thousands or tens of thousands of years prior to Aegon's conquest.

Second, the 300 years under the Targaryens were not smooth sailing. For this, the prequel novellas and the *World of Ice and Fire* are worth checking out. There were good kings and times of peace, but there were also terrible kings, rebellions, and wars for succession. 2/3 of their reign was bolstered by dragons, which made for fairly horrific warfare.

The Targaryens didn't hold power because people liked them, they held power because they weren't successfully deposed until Robert's Rebellion.",False,cnau877,,2,tragicjones,False,t3_2qwmet,t1_cnau877

The sunlight streams through the window, striking me in the face, waking me up. *Fuck... Just what I need with this headache...* I mumble. I turn around to look at the clock... Wait, wheres the clock... It's normally right... h-... I stop. I look up at the ceiling. Something is off... I don't recognize this room. ""What the... Where the fuc-""... I stop as I hear a noise beside me. I slowly turn around and see a woman laying next to me. In shock, I continue staring. Then she opens her eyes and smiles. ""Good morning honey, how'd you sleep?"" 

Everything stops. *What happened last night?? I was celebrating new years alone at home and...and...* My racing thoughts come to a halt as she leans over and kisses me on the cheek, ""I can't wait to check Facebook to see what all my friends have to say about our engagement last night!"" *Wat...* While my mind is slowly trying to work through the headache and catch up with whatever is happening, she jumps out of bed, lunging for the laptop I've never seen before on the desk I've never seen before. ""Hey honey, whats the login again? I know you just told me last night, but I forgot."" I freeze... ""Uhhh... I... Uhh"" I stammer. *Fuck... I don't even know where I am, let alone what the password is...* She continues to stare at me with an anticipating, slightly annoyed look. *Welp, looks like I'm screwed. Might as well try and figure whatever the hell is going on now and save me the trouble*

I clear my throat nervously. ""Listen, I'm going to be blunt with you. I have a hell of a headache right now and I'm really confused. I have no idea where I am right now and, not to sound rude, any idea who you are..."" She tilts her head, and gives a short, confused laugh. ""What're you talking about? We're in your apartment. I'm your girlf- I mean, now-fiancee..."" *Well, that kinda answers something.* I laugh nervously. ""No. I mean, *where* am I? And like, who are you? Last time I checked, I was as single as a guy can get and living in a dorm in college celebrating new years alone..."" She gets a concerned look on her face. 

""What... I... You don't remember who I am? You don't know where you are right now?"" ""No,"" I respond. ""I don't know who you are nor where I am right now. Other than the facts that it's January 1st 2015, you're apparently my fiancee and I have an apartment, I don't know anything else about what's currently going on right now."" *Oh shit...

I saw all the sappy posts on facebook!"" I yelled. She freezes. She covers her hands with her mouth. ""You don't remember anything, do you...?"" She starts crying. *Shitshitshitshitshit I don't even know her and I made her cry fuckfuckfuck* 

""You don't remember how we met? Our dates? DO YOU REMEMBER PROPOSING TO ME??"" She grabs her tablet off the desk. *Wait, tablets are transparent now? That's actually pretty neat* She opens facebook, opens up a picture and shoves the tablet in my face, ""This was last night."" The picture is of a guy, down on one knee, smiling and holding out a ring to a girl who looks ready to pass out from shock. She points to the picture, ""This is you proposing to me last night. We had just walked out of the restaurant and you dropped to one knee and proposed. Do you remember now??"" she chokes out. I grab the tablet from her and stare at the picture. I close out of the picture and scroll through her wall. *Thank god these things still work the same* Her name is Crystal. Apparently we met while in Cali while I was on spring break.  Her wall had quite a few pictures of us, posts about dates we've gone on, and all sorts of similar things. *wow, there's a lot of pictures with me sitting down or portrait shots of us. I must've gotten really lazy* But as I scrolled further back, I start to panic a little. Then a lot. *I don't remember any of this!! I don't remember going to California and meeting her. I don't remember going to Ireland! I don't remember seeing London! I don't remember buying an apartment downto- HOLY SHIT I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE?!

Just promise me you won't look at your facebook yet? I don't know if you're ready for it yet...""

RT has more viewers on their English channel in America than the Russian channel. I watch RT because it's far more willing to expose fascist US government's criminal activity than highly propagandized US mainstream media (which is run by our CIA). Reddit is full of brainwashed statists, but libertarian online media is definitely more understanding of the position the US has put Russia. The US government is not popular with the majority of US citizens.

repost:  

The real truth is Obama and US politicians are extremely jealous of Putin's 90% approval rating in Russia. They want destroy Russia to bury the evidence that such a high rating is possible. /s 

Putin also wrote a letter to the US urging to not support Obama's plans to topple the Syrian government based on allegations of chemical weapons use which we later found out was Al Qaida and not the Syrian government. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Obama still has egg on his face from this incident which is why his stance has become more aggressive toward Russia. 

The US CIA incited the overthrow of the Ukrainian government. The new Ukrainian government immediately doled out ownership and development of coal and gas resources in the east including Crimea to US corporations in repayment for US support even though the fascist government of Kiev didn't own said resources. They cut pensions, raised taxes, deeply indebted the country with loans from the IMF, bailed out banks, etc. They also began working toward inducting Ukraine into NATO which the people of east Ukraine vehemently oppose. The people of east Ukraine revolted because the new government didn't represent them. Putin seized Crimea (which used to be part of Russia anyway) to protect the Russians that live there, they took a vote a huge majority of the population wanted to join Russia. If the US minded its own business the Russians would have never taken Crimea. 

US state dept. caught on tape discussing who will run the new government and who will be thrown out before the CIA supported coup: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTos0duooaU

Crimea is better off with Russia than the US, at least Russian owned Gazprom offered the Ukrainian owners partnership in resource development unlike the US that wanted to dominate everything. The majority of citizens who live in Crimea democratically voted to become a part of Russia. Russia raised pensions instead of cutting them. 

There's also been evidence presented that the MH17 plane was shot down by Ukrainians to incite hatred toward Russia. http://www.storyleak.com/evidence-conclusive-ukraine-military-shot-down-mh17-in-false-flag-operation/ 


&gt;http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/08/09/mala-a09.html A Thursday article in the New Straits Times, Malaysia’s flagship English-language newspaper, charged the US- and European-backed Ukrainian regime in Kiev with shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight MH 17 in east Ukraine last month. Given the tightly controlled character of the Malaysian media, it appears that the accusation that Kiev shot down MH17 has the imprimatur of the Malaysian state.

&gt;The New Straits Times article, titled “US analysts conclude MH17 downed by aircraft,” lays out evidence that Ukrainian fighter aircraft attacked the jetliner with first a missile, then with bursts of 30-millimeter machine gun fire from both sides of MH17. The Russian army has already presented detailed radar and satellite data showing a Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 fighter jet tailing MH17 shortly before the jetliner crashed. The Kiev regime denied that its fighters were airborne in the area, however.

It doesn't even make sense: How would shooting down a foreign plane that isn't hostile have any benefit to Russia whatsoever? Did anyone see the way Russia took Crimea?- very careful not to cause civilian casualties because they knew they would take a lot of criticism regardless. If anything US foreign policy has been much more aggressive than Russian.

Also, I'm operating within Catholicism, 100%.  I'm at a margin, sure, a rationalist-leaning margin, but still very deliberately on the playing field.  The average Jesuit priest, in my experience, is very much farther along toward materialism than me.  

Lastly, from my vantage point, I think what goes on in the faith is this:

Abandoning superstition is a process.  Centuries ago, every overwhelming thing that happened was God.  A storm, lightning, a flood, everything.  If the crops came in well, God was smiling.  If not, He was frowning, etc.

This is how the Jewish (and pagan) world thought (with variations in exactly who was smiling and frowning), and it's how the Christian world thought for a millennium.  

The world moved on, science grew up in the womb of Catholic Europe and began to narrow the range of God's action, to (as Pp. Benedict puts it) 'purify religion of superstition'.  It's a process.  It does not happen instantly.

As of now, as best I can tell, the Church is partially cured of superstition.  The process will keep moving.  In a few hundred years, this conversation will be very different, just like it would have been very different a few hundred years ago.  

I just wish it could move along faster.

Funny that, I actually have a plot similar to that which I plan on including with the Magical Girl novel, once the protagonists leave for the wider world. Though with two (might make it a brother and sister though) girls and their father is a lord/chief depending on the politics. Essentially the older sister becomes the new Lady once her father falls ""ill"", her sister was really attached to her father and is trying to find a cure. The new Lady must defend her power from a group of anarchists that have risen in the town. Our previous heroine travels to the town looking for information relating to their previous adventures and plots intersect leading to the New Lady joining the troupe (don't yet know what will happen to the younger sister, probably not anything nice). Also this will the point where most of the male characters, which have before this been in the background, start to rise in prominence and start obviously altering the plot. It might have dragons too, depending on where I go with the wider magic system beyond the Magical Girl's, well, magic. 

I kinda of want to have Magical Girls (a la Sailor Moon and Puella Magi) within the wider context of a more traditional fantasy environment since most of them are firmly planted in Urban Fantasy/Science Fiction, but it can have power balance issues which must be accounted for.

&gt; I love the fact that the protagonists and heroines are all women.

There are guys running around too, but their roles are *very* spoilerific. Just like why I didn't describe the true role of the Mysterious Waif character. Of course, I you want me to talk about the deeper plot I would be more than happy, since I find talking the ideas over with someone who can understand literature to be effective in codifying ideas, especially over the internet since I am literally writing it down. But I would be more comfortable talking about it over a PM, since, y'know SPOILERS!

Quote (emphasis mine):

&gt; Nor do the principles of equivalence and effectiveness or the principle of effective judicial protection preclude national legislation which imposes, in respect of such disputes, prior implementation of an out-of-court settlement procedure, **provided that that procedure does not result in a decision which is binding on the parties**, that it does not cause a substantial delay for the purposes of bringing legal proceedings, that it suspends the period for the time-barring of claims and that it does not give rise to costs or gives rise to very low costs for the parties, and only if electronic means is not the only means by which the settlement procedure may be accessed and interim measures are possible in exceptional cases where the urgency of the situation so requires.

It seems to mean: it's ok to have a mandatory dispute resolution path, if it's not too costly, doesn't take to long, and isn't binding, so you can still sue afterwards. Otherwise, it would conflict with the basic right to a fair trial.

Although this was for *states* (in the EU, this means: countries) having mandatory dispute resolution paths, the same logic applies to companies.

&gt;

&gt;The __""Five Eyes""__, often abbreviated as ""__FVEY__"", refer to an [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_assessment) alliance comprising [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). These countries are bound by the multilateral [UKUSA Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement), a treaty for joint cooperation in [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence).   

&gt;The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), when the [Atlantic Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Charter) was issued by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allies) to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), the [ECHELON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc), although it allegedly was later used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.  

&gt;In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) and, to a lesser extent, the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress). As part of efforts in the ongoing [War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror) since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). The former NSA contractor [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) described the Five Eyes as a ""[supra-national](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union) intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the known laws of its own countries"".  Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [domestic regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law) on domestic spying.

TLDR since this is reddit, macroeconomic policy is the combination between fiscal and monitory policy that can both be adjusted for different effects. Fiscal policy is how much government spends, taxes, and borrows. Monetary policy is control over money supply and how much it relates to money demand and interest rates and such.

The effects of monetary and fiscal policy are not independent of each other, think of it as a multivariable system. The ability to fine tune both as they relate to each other matters a great deal to meaningful economic policy.

When a country has it's own currency, it has monetary policy independence, when a country keeps it's exchange rates pegged to another currency or doesn't have it's own currency and uses another countries, then it does not have monetary independence. A country is incredibly limited in fiscal policy if it does not have the ability to set it's own monetary policy. Losing the ability to use monetary policy means the effects of both the economy ""heating up"" and slowing down is magnified, that means that a very powerful destabilizing element is introduced.

However, there are benefits of monetary unions, although only if they are heavily interconnected economically with the other regions *and* there is a great deal of policy coordination. Herein lies the problem.


A currency union is ""optimal"" if there is both near totally fluid labor mobility *and*, most importantly in this case, pragmatic automatic fiscal transfer mechanisms, which is sorely missing in Europe and actually much more developed and nuanced in the United States.

Unfortunately, the Euro was not born out of considerations of policy coordination or economic connectedness, otherwise it would not have existed in the way it does and developmental economies (which require very different policies) like Greece wouldn't have joined and given up it's monetary independence. It was born out of ideology, which isn't to hard to understand since many countries see the Euro as a way to get away from periods of historic dictatorships. However, the ideology aspect of it made both the west and these countries overlook the fact that policy coordination is *really really* important for a functional currency/macroeconomic union. The west doesn't like to commit to automatic fiscal transfers or reevaluate monetary policy for the sake of smaller recently struggling economies, really the root of the problem is small poor countries having the monetary policy that is ideal for rich large countries from the very get go of the union (cynically you could say that the west was never committed to the idea of a union, welcoming these countries when times were good and rejecting and refusing help when times are bad). On the other hand, it would be way to difficult for these small poor countries to regain monetary independence, that is, break away from the Euro zone, something that is difficult and damaging for multiple reasons.

Now I actually made this way longer than I was hopping to, but this is the conclusion of basic accepted macroeconomic models (basically IS-MP just put into words).

Long Version: A long time ago, some people lived in this strip of land. Then it was invaded. Then it was invaded again. And again. And again. At some point along here, a religion was started called Judaism. Life went on and various other countries invaded this strip of land. Eventually, the residents were all like, ""Fuck this shit. This land keeps getting invaded."" They mostly tried to leave. It was around this time that another religion was started up and the followers of that religion invaded the territory (mostly for economic reasons). For hundreds of years (a record for this piece of land), there wasn't war. Then another religion's inhabitants decided to invade (but mostly for economic influences). Then other people invaded. And other people invaded.

And that brings us to 100 years ago. The Turks owned the land. Then the British owned the land. But the land was inhabited by the Palestinian ethnic group. After Jews evacuated Europe, they decided, ""we should move somewhere fun!"" Failing to do that, they moved to the ""Invasion Magnet"". The United Nations supported this move and decided to displace a bunch of the locals. This started the chain reaction of the assholes. The surrounding countries, who were ""totes besty"" with the Palestinians decided to kick out the assholes who displaced the Palestinians. So the Israelis fought back and invaded more of the Palestinian land, which of course pissed of the Palestinians even more. Instead of a out-right war, they decided to go small-scale Guerrilla warfare. This created a really bloody mess and locals started knowing who was doing the attacking on a personal scale.

That brings us roughly to today. A large portion of both populations feel incredibly wronged by the other population but are exhausted with warfare. However, there is a small portion of the population whose cousin was just killed last week by [insert-weapon-here] because of those damn war-mongering [insert-faction-here] and they will have their revenge.

 [**Global Positioning System**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%20Positioning%20System): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Global Positioning System__ (__GPS__) is a space-based [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.  The system provides critical capabilities to military, civil and commercial users around the world. It is maintained by the United States government and is freely accessible to anyone with a [GPS receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_receiver).

&gt;The GPS project was developed in 1973 to overcome the limitations of previous navigation systems,  integrating ideas from several predecessors, including a number of classified engineering design studies from the 1960s. GPS was created and realized by the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Defense) (DoD) and was originally run with 24 satellites. It became fully operational in 1995. [Bradford Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Parkinson), [Roger L. Easton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_L._Easton), and [Ivan A. Getting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_A._Getting) are credited with inventing it.

&gt;Advances in technology and new demands on the existing system have now led to efforts to modernize the GPS system and implement the next generation of [GPS III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_III) satellites and Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX).  Announcements from Vice President [Al Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore) and the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Administration) in 1998 initiated these changes. In 2000, the [U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress) authorized the modernization effort, GPS III.

&gt;In addition to GPS, other systems are in use or under development. The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ([GLONASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS)) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s.  There are also the planned European Union [Galileo positioning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation\)), India's [Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System), and the Chinese [Beidou Navigation Satellite System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beidou_Navigation_Satellite_System).

Long distance trade and cultural contact between Europe and India is not controversial. In that sense, yes, it could be Indian in origin. There were Buddhists in Asia Minor before the birth of Christ and there were Christians in India before the Vedas were written down. 

Your theory is that the Celts were descended from Indians. Not quite, according to history, linguistics and archeology. Rather, virtually all Europeans, Persians and non-Dravidian Indians are descended from the Indo-Europeans, who, scholars now generally accept, came from an area between the Caspian Sea and the Urals. Some believe they originally came from Asia Minor, but they're in the minority. The idea that they were originally from India is rejected on linguistic grounds: the ""purest"" Indo-European words mostly refer to a temperate, steppe existence. 

They were probably the first people to tame horses and were almost certainly the first people capable of drinking milk after weaning, which gave them certain advantages -- their food supply could be richer in fat and they didn't have to slaughter their animals for food or waste energy on foraging. This gave then an edge in surviving bad years, cut down on child mortality and made them stronger for warfare. 

Through a combination of conquest and infiltration various tribes of Indo-Europeans conquered Europe, Asia Minor, Iran and India and some may have become part of Chinese civilization. One group became Vedic-speaking Indians and others became Celtic, Germanic, Italic, Greek or Slavic-speaking Europeans. 

So yes, the Druids were like Brahmins, but the Romans had their own priestly class, called Flamens, which some scholars believe to be related words and the Persians had the Magi. Also, compare Latin Rex, German Reich and Sanskrit Raja. Many of the similarities you're seeing are because of a common ancestor to both, not one preceding the other.  

As for the leaves, I think you're seeing what you want to see. In Plate A they could be either wheels or cannabis leaves and in Plate B they look like Ivy or Holly to me.

1425120010,-5,0,,,t5_2qh1u,False,0,Music,t1_cnaqzs7,1420095888,0,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""Beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading this comment about such a trivial band.

&gt;* The new year means a new currency for Lithuania - it is joining the euro, following its Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia into the currency bloc.

&gt;* A teacher, Zita Kriukeliene, remarked: ""Our litas currency is emotionally connected with independence.""

&gt;* But economists here say Lithuania was affected by stagnation and contraction in the eurozone anyway, so joining the euro will not change the picture.

Put him on a line with Galchenyuk and Pacioretty, play Gallagher with Plekanec or with Eller and Sekac. Then Parenteau and Prust/Weise play with Plekanec and you have a strong fourth line going into the playoffs with Desharnais at center with the other of Prust/Weise and Bournival/Andrighetto. Now that would be a great four lines to have for a playoff run!

But regardless, Therrien would find a combination that works I'm sure. He could also help with the power play and I think his work ethic could rub off on more players. The guy is a winner and arguably the greatest European forward of all time and while he may be 43, he still puts up points. He's currently tied for 1st in scoring for the Devils.

1425119541,6,0,,,t5_2w2s8,False,0,changemyview,t1_cnb1xcx,1420099280,0,"&gt;Actually, AD (Anno Domini) directly translates to merely ""Year Lord""... the full original phrase was ADNJC (""Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi""), with the word Nostri meaning ""Our"". So merely the two letters ""AD"" say nothing about ""our Lord"".

Not true. Anno Domini literally means ""in the year of OUR lord"" since ""domini"" is the genetive case in Latin, which indicates possession.

&gt; AD = Year Lord
Thursday = Thor's Day
Doesn't get more analogous than that. In fact Thursday is more explicit since it names the deity outright. If we were using ADNJC you'd have a point.

This doesn't matter. As mentioned above, Anno Domini literally implies that Jesus Christ is OUR lord. Also, days of the week change depending on what language you're using. English is Germanic, so having pagan Norse gods that basically no one believes in is fine. But the historical timeline is standardized across the world for almost everything non-religious, and having a system that maintains the same dating system, but is non-religious is the least controversial revision to this system.

&gt; Again, people on average reference the pagan-named days of the week and months incredibly more often than they would BC/AD, yet somehow it's BC/AD that need to be replaced, despite their replacement still inevitably leaving the implicit reference to the 2,015-year-old epoch originating as the purported birth year of the Christian messiah, where renamed weekdays and months would leave no trace of the pagan gods. This can be nothing short of bias against a calendar reference to one particular religion over others (Christianity over paganism), which is silly when coming from both a nonpagan and nonchristian perspective. As I said in the intro, whether one is still a more populous should be nothing short of irrelevant to science or any secular entity or person.

But with pagan-named weekdays, there is no significant segment of the population that believes in paganism, which is rather different from the Christian population. Renaming weekdays would only really affect one language (English) and be super confusing to English speakers while switching to BCE/CE would affect speakers of all languages while preserving the same dates as before, just with different attached letters.

&gt;Probably for the same reason science uses a lot of Latin terms despite it being an arbitrary and dead language - the influence of Ancient Rome, the Roman Catholic Church, and Western European imperialism as a whole on world culture and society. Today's ubiquitous holiday of January 1 isn't celebrated by virtually the entire world instead other calendars' New Years by mere coincidence.

But using Latin doesn't mean that you buy into everything that the Romans did or support the Catholic Church. On the other hand, using AD, is literally saying that events happened in so-and-so year of OUR Lord. It's pretty offensive to insist that everyone should continue to use AD because the Christian world was so great, when we have a system that is functionally the same, without the overt declarations that Jesus Christ is the one true God. Yes, the Europeans and Christians did a lot, but using the year number of the Western systems is already indicative of that. No need to force Christian language on everyone else.

&gt; The family of talented cook, Hassan Kadam, has a life filled with both culinary delights and profound loss. Drifting through Europe after fleeing political violence in India that killed the family restaurant business and their mother, the Kadams arrive in France. Once there, a chance auto accident and the kindness of a young woman, Marguerite, in the village of Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val inspires Papa Kadam to set up a Indian restaurant there. Unfortunately, this puts the Kadams in direct competition with the snobbish Madame Mallory's acclaimed haute cuisine establishment across the street where Marguerite also works as a sous-chef. The resulting rivalry eventually escalates in personal intensity until it goes too far. In response, there is a bridging of sides initiated by Hassan, Marguerite and Madame Mallory herself, both professional and personal, that encourages an understanding that will change both sides forever.

Regardless of education system, kids are kids, they are generally easygoing and really hate school. There's plenty of people who took a foreign language in school and barely remember ten words, just because they've never got the chance to use that language after school. At the same time there's plenty of people who have picked a foreign language online and are fluent. Anyway, I'd say there's a big difference between learning a language in school and picking it up live, in a real life or internet community that speaks it.

Ideally, schools shouldn't teach other languages. Schools should offer support and choice, so those who are interested could study a foreign language.

Anyway, these are some of the websites that have worked well in my self-planned bike-touring experience:

* [Biroto](http://www.biroto.eu) has many marked cycle routes in Europe, certainly all of the long-distance ones.
* [Bayernnetz für Radler](http://bayerninfo.de/rad) - route-planning and info for the state of Bavaria's marked cycle routes, which the international routes typically use as well.
* [Radroutenplaner Hessen](http://radservice.radroutenplaner.hessen.de/rrp/hessen/cgi?lang=DE) - Not as nice as Bavaria's, but still functional.
* [Radroutenplaner NRW](http://radservice.radroutenplaner.nrw.de/rrp/nrw/cgi?lang=DE) - Same software as Hessen's.
* [Radroutenplaner Thüringen](http://radservice.radroutenplaner.thueringen.de/rrp/th/cgi?lang=DE) - Same software as Hessen's.
* [Radroutenplaner BaWü](http://www.radroutenplaner-bw.de/) - Not super useful, as they don't list the marked cycle routes that you would take, but still helpful in planning.
* [Fietsrouteplanner](http://www.fietsvakantie.eu/) - I've used this for tour planning outside of Germany. It works quite well, although be wary of those unmarked paths they have if you don't want to travel with a GPS.
* ADFC has a [route planner](https://www.adfc-tourenportal.de) but it costs money to download the tracks, so I've just used it for getting an idea of what elevation I would be facing during tours in the alps.

This is no endorsement of colonialism but it is no comparison to mass immigration into Europe from the third world. Objectively Superior Europeans went to places like Africa and Asia bringing civilization (in the case of Africa) and great technology including modern medicine which doubled their life expectancy. They left infrastructure, schools and hospitals. The justification of Colonialism in the 19th century was much more the prestige of Civilizing lowly savages than exploiting their resources. The balance of good and bad in European Worldwide Imperialism is overwhelmingly good and it was bound to happen in the development of Human Civilization eventually, if not by Europeans then by Asians or Arabs.

To say subjecting White Europeans to minority status in their own lands is warranted because of something that happened in the past like going into undeveloped lands and outlawing the institution of slavery from a purely ethical standpoint and bringing democratic ideals shows the inferiority complex instilled in your non-white head that is causing such desperation. 

And don't say that is not what you meant, you said it is the cost of our great history.

You are not taking much chances by saying one of the province that borders the U.S since most of them does.

And you are way off(relatively to the distance and not the number of provinces in-between), it's the westerner-southern most province above Washington.

Colorado is in the middle of the U.S but that isn't very accurate either (you could say some of the states bordering it)

300 millions is about right.

You drive on the right in France as is the case in the rest of Europe and pretty much any country that wasn't colonized by the English (exception of Japan, Thailand, Nepal and Indonesia).

It varies but that's the general idea you should have.

I don't know what do you mean by ""really as bad"" and who is the ""everyone"" that says it. There are a lot of pros and cons of living here as compared to richer EU countries. Living in Poland is fine. 

Financially you are definitely better living in the Netherlands. In other aspects it's hard to say, simply because there are many aspects of life and people value different things.

And your right to question if he was a really person. I was reading a book awhile ago, never finished it, but it was about the political atmosphere at the time of jesus. It also explored a lot of the things lost in translation, for example: they say jesus was crucified with thieves except the word for thief in hebrew also meant ""revolutionary"". That word had a lot of negative connotations and it was mostly used to discredit someone the same way we used the word ""communist"" or ""terrorist"". It's a a story as old as time. You had these institutions/ideologies that mostly benifited a few select people and ""jesus"" was just some guy, or guys, who realized their was power in numbers, if the oppressed people united it would've threatened the ruling class. One man's freedom fighter is anpther man's terrorist.

I digress. The point was, whatever this Jesus guy was or did, its echoed through time. The same way we still read Shakespeare and Hemingway; these ideas resonated with people. 

If you really wanted to boil what jesus said down to the fundementals, it was all about emapthy. 

It reminds me of my favorite quotes by this guy named jiddu krishnamurti:

&gt;When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.

If you look at any sort of violent conflict between people, it has to begin with you dividing yourself from the person youre persecuting. For example, the reason hitler could kill so many people was because he saw jews as being fundementally different and lesser. You don't fight people who you identify with, like your country or family. It's called tribalism and hardwired into us (eg apple fanboys vs android fanboys, trekkies vs star wars fan boys).

If you were to look at our borders over long period of time it would look like amoebas swallowing up smaller ameobas and all that is is just people planting a flag/ideology in the ground to have people to relate to. We, as humans, like to clump together because we're social creatures; we dont have sharp claws, our strength is eachother, its in our ability to learn things and pass them down through language. Like Newton said, ""we stand on the shoulders of giants"". The reason you're alive is because someone figured out medicine and physics.

Now back to my point about empathy. Imagine two amoebas. They could do one of two things: they can either fight each other for resources or they can fuse into one super organism. Darwin had this idea about why it's evolutionarily benificial for us to care for each other. He said, if you had a small tribe filled with people willing to do anything for each other, that tribe would be more likely to survive versus a tribe filled with self interested people.

You're probably right about my survival chances in a confrontation. By myself, i absolutely stand no chance. I need people around me and I need people that care for me and for that to happen, you, like I said earlier, i have to be a lovable person first before someone can love me. This is probably going to sound really cheesy, but love and empathy are the adhesive that keeps our society together; its what bonds us. You dont need to read the bible to see that. These are ideas/conclusions that people keep coming up with, its why they resonate. There is a frequency to them but we keep forgetitng them because of our need for self preservation. However, to have self preservation to have you must first have a sense of self. 

When that happens, youre fracturing yourself from the rest of humanity because now you're thinking in terms of how something would personally affect you as opposed to how they would affect your group. You dont harm the people you identify with be it a geological area like a country or something more intimate like your family.

Sorry for the wall of text but this is just one of those buttons you can press on me. As much as I rail against divisive ideologies, that in itself is an ideology. Its a contradiction. I may think that my ideology is the ""right"" one but who doesnt think what they believe is right?  I don't know, take from that what you will. For me to be empathetic I kind of have reconcile the fact that I may not right all the time; i have to be able and open to seeing things from other people's perspective. Without that, it would be chaos. We would constantly be warring with one another. ",False,cnb5ar4,,1,[deleted],False,t3_2qxjnp,t1_cnb5ar4

Stalin was by no means an angel, but without his ""regime"" Europe probably wouldn't have been freed from the Nazis.

Egypt is still desired and the scramble for Africa begins with invasions to protectorate the Egyptian sultanate with a coptic being set up as a king.

General Curtis LeMay (US Air Force) boasted that American bombers were ""driving them [the Japanese] back to the stone age.""

Henry H. Arnold, commanding General of the Army air forces had this to say in his 1949 memoirs: ""It always appeared to us, atomic bomb or no atomic bomb, the Japanese were already on the verge of collapse.""
This was confirmed by former Japanese prime minister Fumimaro Konoye, who said: ""Fundamentally, the thing that brought about the determination to make peace was the prolonged bombing by the B-29s.""

That bombing certainly was effective largely due to Japan's complete inability to defend their skies. American aircraft had virtually undisputed superiority of the air over Japan and they used it with devastating impact. Japan's navy was just as incapable of any but token resistance.

Fully one quarter of the houses in the entire country were razed. On a single night (March 9-10) some 1,700 tons of bombs were dropped on Tokyo. A quarter of a million structures were destroyed that night - 100,000 people were killed and a million more were left homeless. This wasn't just any Japanese city - this was the capital.

On May 23, the Americans unleashed what would be the largest air raid of the Pacific War, dropping 4,500 tons of bombs on that same city.
On May 25, they dropped another 4,000 tons.

Japan's capital, along with much of the rest of the nation, lay in ruins.
Remaining factories and workshops were left to turn out what goods they could. Raw materials were hard to come by. Oil supplies had been entirely used up by April. Japan's transportation system had collapsed. Distribution of goods - particularly food was a problem that left much of the surviving populous starving and without even the most basic necessities.

These are the UNCONTESTED facts.

And yet apologists claim that a land invasion of Japan would have cost millions of Allied lives. That claim simply can not be taken seriously. It suggests that Allied forces - hardened by long experience - amply supplied - ably led - and supported by air and by sea without challenge - were likely to be defeated by militia forces composed of untrained, starving housewives, grandparents and children - all armed with spears and stones.

The truth of the matter is that an invasion of Japan would have been met limited, if any, resistance.

And the Japanese knew they were beaten. That's why they had already attempted to sue for peace. A new government had taken office in April. Headed by Kantaro Suzuki, that government's primary purpose was to end the war. In May, with Victory In Europe, it was readily apparent that Allied forces would now be able to direct all of their might against war-weary Japan.

American forces - having long-since broken Japan's codes - knew that Japan was willing to surrender.

From Gar Alperovitz's (another American source), Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam (pp. 107, 108):
*Although Japanese peace feelers had been sent out as early as September 1944 (and [China's] Chiang Kai-shek had been approached regarding surrender possibilities in December 1944), the real effort to end the war began in the spring of 1945. This effort stressed the role of the Soviet Union ...
In mid-April [1945] the [US] Joint Intelligence Committee reported that Japanese leaders were looking for a way to modify the surrender terms to end the war. The State Department was convinced the Emperor was actively seeking a way to stop the fighting.*

Even the press was aware of Japan's willingness to negotiate surrender - though they were forbidden from reporting on it. In August of 1945, the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald printed front page stories by Walter Trohan, that discussed this. This is also uncontested and easily verified - though apologists/denialists tend to ignore the inconvenient fact.

The article revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials. (The complete text of Trohan's article is in the Winter 1985-86 Journal, pp. 508-512.)

The surrender terms offered by the Japanese were, by any measure, reasonable. Essentially they offered to surrender with one condition - that they be permitted to keep their Emperor. These terms are not substantially distinct from the terms ultimately secured by the US after the bombs dropped. Papers reported Japan's surrender as ""unconditional,"" but that was not so. Japan's surrender was accepted with the condition that it retain its Emperor - who continued to serve as such until his death in 1989.

Indeed, altogether there were dozens of attempts on the part of Japan to arrange for peace. Often such overtures came through intermediaries in the international diplomatic community. On one occasion Secretary of State Stettinius told the US Ambassador in Sweden to ""show no interest or take any initiative in pursuit of the matter.""

Those are the facts.  Your quote is in reference to an excuse - one based on false and misleading information.  In short, you've drunk the kool-aid.  Consider reading a fantastic book on the subject - ""Hiroshima in America"" - about the impact on American culture that reverberates back to the decision to use the bombs.

You need to understand how the American government works first, compared with other countries with a more centralized economy. In the US the government tries to stay out of business. On the other hand, Norway's Statoil is a majority state owned and controlled company. In the US, in many states, if you find oil in your backyard, you can start pumping it out and selling it.

I agree. The Russians are just a side effect. There is no conspiracy. It's a result of market forces which made the exploitation of shale oil profitable on large scale.

Saudi hope is that they will stay profitable for longer than the shale companies. It's a staring match.

The book is about an Italian miller named Mennocchio who was tried and executed for his heretical beliefs during the 16th century. Mennochio’s beliefs and persecution were both part of larger processes;  his ideas sprang from a materialistic peasant religion resistant to religious dogma while his persecution took place in a broader trend of the ‘reconquest’ of the masses across Europe following the Peasant’s War.

 Mennochio’s beliefs are demonstrated to have not been informed by contemporary heretical sects but were relatively widespread, however they were further shaped by his selective readings of certain books like the Travels of Sir John Mandeville and perhaps the Koran. Ginzberg implies that his essential beliefs were an expression of a fundamentally pre-Christian peasant approach to religion, shaped by the books that he read and his own use of logical thinking.

Now I won't go into details about this miller's cosmology, but the most relevant section is Mennocchio's discovery of religious relativism. Throughout his inquistional record, Mennocchio claims that he is only a faithful Christian because his grandfather was too; if his grandfather were a Jew or Muslim, he would be just as faithful to that religion, a claim that would have obviously been quite shocking during the Counter Reformation. Using the Fable of the Three Rings, he argued to the inquisitors that God loved Jews, Christians and Muslims equally because they were all his children and that all of his contemporaries believed they represented the true faith simply because they were born and raised that way. This fits into his distillation of religious dogma into what was essentially a code of morality; it didn't matter if you were a Christian, Jew, Heretic or Muslim as long as you were a decent person and didn't harm your neighbours. 

This 16th century miller from an Italian village had basically discovered religious relativism, at a time when religious denomination was the primary locus of identity. Now the interesting aspect of Ginzberg's argument is that Mennocchio's beliefs were not isolated. They were simply a recorded instance of widespread agrarian belief system that was unique in that he selectively absorbed information that confirmed his beliefs from print literature. This means that while Mennocchio certainly discovered the disturbing fact that people are only religious because they enculturated, he probably wasn't the only person in the 16th century or even the medieval era who thought that way. Now this isn't an example of 'political correctness' as we would define it, and I'm sure people will get upset that I'm giving an example of religious and not cultural relativism, but you have to keep in mind that religious identity was *super* important during this period which makes Mennocchio's claims very significant.",False,cnb6tfa,,5,depanneur,False,t3_2qxco7,t1_cnb6tfa

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""Beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading this comment about such a trivial band.

I'm no pro yet, but i know my way around this scene. Truth is, it depends exactly on what it is the event consists of and what it is the client wants the video for. Like where he is going to showcase it. Is it going to be an hour long clip with all the performances? Is it going to go on youtube so the artists can share their specific clips with their friends? Is it going on some tv's in the area? Like in the lounge itself, for future visitors to see, or nearby hotels so new visitors get a glimpse. 

What im guessing is that you are looking forward to make a 1 to 3 minute video kind of like the one i made and it will be multi purpose. Advantages of this is that ofcourse you can just share it anywhere and it will be very easy to digest for the public. But try working on different versions, taylor made for each cirumstance.

As far as filming goes, i use a cn 160 led lamp, the thing is a champ and helps me get great shots, specially in the dark. It is certainly an annoying thing for the party goers but once 2am hits and they are all either drunk or drugged as hell, everything goes. I read you will be using the d810, i personally used a d5100 and i am sometimes able to get away without using the led lamp. Your d810 should defenitly do wonders in low light fron what i understand and certainly since you can control the aperture, shutter speed and iso amnually, you can get rid of some noise.

Your circumstances might ofcourse be much different than mine as far as lighting goes. Because there might be lights pointed at the performers and the audience might not be as important for the video. Try getting some shots of small things like smiles, beer being poured. Mood setters basically and then get to the real content. If you can use slow motion then you really should at least film it that way and fiddle around in post.

Another thing which is also very important is to make sure you are either in pal or ntsc depending on where you are in the world. So film 25fps/50fps in europe or pal nations, and 30fps/60fps in america or ntsc nations. Im not sure where 24p stands on this whole thing but i think i have seen people film in 24p in ntsc and pal and get great results.

Stabilization, i personally use a glidecam for all around purposes combined with a wide angle lens, and if im shooting a tele camera ona. 2nd cameraman, he will defenitly be on a tripod. Monopods are ok depending on how and what for they are going to be used. I guess you can see it as the more stabilizing gear you use,the better the shots but the worst the logistics,practicality and portability are going to be. So defenitly find out on what place in that scale you want to be.

Also try to have a safe place for your gear and drink enough,use earplugs if things get loud and get a goodsnight sleep after filming, cause the editing comes next.

A soft catch is difficult unless you rig a chariot belay*. You can add some dynamics if you wear gloves and are very skilled with a non locking belay device. IOW, not a GriGri. And you should be wearing gloves when belaying a leader on a tube device anyways. Seriously, a significant rope burn can lead to skin grafting and loss of an entire climbing season.

*EDIT: The last couple of sentences are kind of dogmatic. Sorry about that. It's my opinion. I started off using gloves with a hip belay. Stopped when I started using a tube device. Started up again after many years and seeing what can happen. People should do what they think best.*

In single pitch/sport there are some options people have tried. Such as tying to the ground anchor with a long slack loop. The idea is that the belayer will be lifted and provide some energy absorption until her acceleration flattens - and then not so much. The goal of the slack ground anchor is to allow some dynamics but not have her smash into the 1st bolt. Others have tried some additional weight such as sandbags or a pack. Whether wearing it or tying to it.

Here are two links that might help:

General info: We consist of two divisions, 40 Commando [EU] and 1st Cavalry Division [US] , and are suited to most time zones. Each unit has their own tactics, ranking and training. On the weekend both units come together and do a joint operation. Experience or inexperienced we can train you for your chosen role.
What we do: Throughout the week there are a variety of training, TVT and cooperative missions. For our weekend main operations we use a dynamic mission, this is a mission which will run throughout the deployment and can intelligently play against us as we complete objectives, For Example the 40COM units may secure a road behind enemy lines so the enemies cannot reinforce whilst the 1st Cavalry captures a town up the road with the help of their larger more mechanized units. Throughout the week there are small missions that contribute towards the main weekend effort and can either help or hinder the deployment as a whole. Our deployments are unlike that of most ""milsim"" units as we will be playing a constant mission until we either succeed or fail. For the 40COM members the operations will begin at 7PM GMT with the 1stCav unit joining later on at 7-9PM EST

J1/J2 haplogroups dominates Semitic populations from the Gulf and Mesopotamia, indicating their Semitic background. Iraqi Kurds have a strong mixture of this too because they're also descendant of indigenous Semitic populations before the Iranian migrations into the region starting roughly 4000 years ago. Turkish Kurds are more closely linked to indigenous Anatolian populations and Iranian Kurds are closer to other Iranians.

Light hair and eyes are found in all Iranian populations from Kurdistan through Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asia Minor also received European admixtures from Roman occupation, the Crusades, and the Greek migrations following the Macedonian Conquests. My family are Iranian and 10%+ have blue/green eyes, a few have red hair and a few have blonde hair. 

Jews are Semitic and have close genetic ties to everyone native to the Levant and Mesopotamia, so this isn't just specific to the Kurds - it even says this in both of the articles linked in this thread. The reason the Kurds are linked are because, as I said earlier, Iraqi Kurds are descendants of the indigenous Semitic populations that lived in the area plus the Iranian migrations that came afterwards. Kurds are primarily Iranian, but have mixes with other populations.

You seem pretty determined to defend the Jewish-Kurdish link, but this same link to the Israelites applies to everyone with Semitic ancestry because the original Israelites were Semitic tribes. The ""discovery"" in the linked articles aren't really new information. I don't understand what it is about Kurdish diaspora and this idea that they're some Israelite tribe.

I write all my music in my notation software (Lilypond). When I think it's useful I'll listen to the MIDI versions that Lilypond generates.

I used to be proficient at piano (but not anymore). It's a nice instrument to compose for since it only requires one performer, can do very complex music, and MIDI versions sound pretty decent (compared to other instruments). If you are completely unfamiliar with what can be done technique-wise on the instrument then just keep things simple or only write for MIDI (cf Nancarrow and his player piano).

My main instrument was classical guitar (though I haven't played in 15 years). I was very good with it. I rarely write for it but having an instrument in my back pocket that I am intimately familiar with is a nice thing. Not critical, but nice. You sing in choirs, you know choral music. That's useful.

I don't use any music-making software (other than my notation program). This is probably more of a style issue -- I want to create scores for others to perform. If I were more into electronic music or was really into creating a musical performance of a piece of mine then things would be different. For example, if I wanted to release a recording of my piano pieces and couldn't find someone to perform and record them, then I'd want to generate the best sounding synthesized version I could (which would be more than just using General MIDI). I don't know how to do that sort of thing but others do.

They also need access to sites like Youtube which have zillions of demos of every kind of thing imaginable. 

The reason technology in the West is exploding so rapidly is because people who are involved in it are increasingly immersed in information all of the time. People are all working on similar things and when one has an idea and shares it, they all learn it and the millions (literally) of little niches in the technology space are all like little villages where people who specialize in one branch of science or computing hang out *and learn by doing*.. 

**North Korea is the ultimate ""walled garden"".**  Literally. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform

Computing term for a vendor-specific prison created to imprison users on one company's products, and those that it has blessed and usually limited greatly. For example, in the US, until recently, the mobile phone platform was made up of walled gardens.  Cable TV providers who offer Internet and then try to force users to buy bundled services or useless Cable TV subscriptions are the creators and enforcers of these walled garden closed ecosystems, while- thanks to the net- the world ""is increasingly an open platform"". Control it, or deny it at your peril. Enriched environments cause brains to grow, all through life. Since economic power comes from the creation of value and value now comes from doing sophisticated things with information and math and networks and hardware, to deny access to the international flow of information is a ticket to economic irrelevance and eventually a kind of death by irrelevance. The world will just pretend you dont exist. Thats already a BIG problem for North Korea. So, by not opening up as they are. (That's what this talk shows, how little they allow, less than I thought they did.) they are still falling behind faster than moving forward. While the rest of the world truly surges ahead at a blinding speed. 

But at the age these guys are at, if they want to pursue computing, they need unfettered access to the world of information. Thats not some luxury, its a necessity. Not the limited access they seem to be given. They need to be able to use it at home, they need to be able to wake up in the morning and check their computing jobs, they need to basically live, breathe, eat and sleep computing.

During the time they are at school and continue when they are not at school. School is just the formal anointing of skills which they should have started learning as a child or young adult. They need to be able to build personal web sites to show off their software development interests and attract collaborators all around the world. That's what people do. That's happening on a major scale in China now. And its great. Chinese are joining every possible kind of global scientific and technical community on a much deeper level now than they were able to previously. 

And what's happening is the science geeks in China and the science geeks in other countries are developing both friendships and professional interactions down to the hobbyist level. 

One of my interests is electronics. A good example of a US/European/Australian maker community that has recently become involved with the Chinese maker community is ""dangerous prototypes"". 

A site for people who build electronic stuff themselves and give the knowledge away so that others who are interested in the same thing can help improve it. (""Open hardware"") The people who started the site are heavily involved in empowering people to become their own manufacturers of hardware. This is an important skill that makes all the difference for people who are working in some area where they need to build some device and its not being manufactured anywhere. They can now design it themselves, prototype it themselves and then go into small scale manufacturing and sales of it very easily.

 The $35 Raspberry Pi credit card sized computer which was mentioned in the talk is a perfect example of a successful open hardware platform.  

Being able to participate in these communities will determine their success in educating their young people to participate in the economy of the world in the near future. With this knowledge they will be able to build anything, almost, with help from their friends around the world. Without it they will be stuck when they encounter even the smallest problem, unable to move beyond it because nobody else in the country will know the answer or even where to look. 

They wont have access to the hive mind.. they cant put their minds together with others who may have already solved that problem a long time ago. So their learning along that line of inquiry will grind to a halt and end. Without access to the net they will be stuck years or decades behind others. 

A lost year is a very long time in technology.

I don't see this regime realizing any of this, though. :(  Because it would threaten their **milieu control** agenda.

Lacking that, the second best thing they could do would be to spend a lot more time teaching these students math. And less how to do fairly low level things. Look at computing as a way to do lots of calculation in a very short amount of time. There is no magic in writing tablet applications. A tablet is interesting in terms of its user interface, but lets not forget their main use for 99% of the people who have them.. is surfing the net.

They are basically an underpowered computer *for browsing the Internet*.. ;) (and use as a personal organizer, ebook reader, and phone)

 I was very surprised that they don't even give all North Koreans access to their Intranet. They should at least do that. 

Otherwise, its really pathetic. The smartest thing the US ever did was open up the DARPANET in the late 80s and early 90s to non-scientists and non-military companies.

North Korea doesn't even seem to have public libraries! Unless you are on of the tiny elite that lives in Pyongyang and has a Party membership.

I can't overemphasize how important it is for people, especially young people, to have access to the global fire-hose of information (to attempt to sip out of it).

What was the last REALLY successful US company that wasn't at least in part an Internet-driven company? My mind is drawing a blank on that one.  (Maybe drug companies.. But at a huge cost to society!) 

 See what I mean?

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth.

This game was never released in America and was not very popular in Europe or Japan makes this game pretty obscure. The style has some of the weirdest Japanese styles I have ever seen, just look at the [box art](http://imgur.com/ZVzpEDo).
When I played the game I expected it to be bad but, it was surprisingly very good. The game Follows the pervert Tingle, His main goal is to get to rupeeland but he needs a lot of rupees to do it. In this game everyone is a total dick to everyone and only do things if it benefits them meaning rupees! everything is rupees! your health, your goal, your way to progress to different areas, your bodyguards and certain dialog.  The combat isn't too great but its not really the games main focus, its also kind of hard to explain it. One interesting mechanic is when a character asks how much is the certain thing you want worth to you like say if you wanted to buy a bottle you have to guess how many rupees you think you should pay, but if you lowball they just take the money and you get nothing and have to try again with more, this makes it kind of tense and trying to predict what would be the best deal is kind of fun to me.

This games atmosphere is fantastic, it makes me feel very uneasy and makes just about everyone a bad person.

HOWEVER, over the last 10 years, starting with the Chechen war, or even a bit before, we have seen a rise of immigrant/asylum seekers everywhere in Europe of nations that aren't too popular in Europe, who have a very different culture than we do and of which a part of the community hasn't integrated at all.

Radical left is right about Europe's debt, 
Wolfgang Munchau

It is logically inconsistent for the eurozone to enter secular stagnation and not restructure.

Let us assume that you share the global consensus view on what the eurozone should do right now. Specifically, you want to see more public-sector investment and debt restructuring.

Now ask yourself the following question: if you were a citizen of a eurozone country, which political party would you support for that to happen? You may be surprised to see that there is not much choice. In Germany, the only one that comes close to such an agenda is Die Linke, the former Communists. In Greece, it would be Syriza; and in Spain, it would be Podemos, which came out of nowhere and is now leading in the opinion polls.

You may not consider yourself a supporter of the radical left. But if you lived in the eurozone and supported those policies, that would be your only choice.

What about Europe’s centre-left parties, the social democrats and socialists? Do they not support such an agenda? They may do so when they are in opposition. But once in government they feel the need to become respectable, at which point they discover their supply-side genes. Remember that, François Hollande, France’s president, explained the policy shift of his government by saying that supply creates demand.
Of the radical parties that have emerged recently, the one to watch is Podemos. It is still young, with an agenda in the making. From what I have read so far, it may be the one that comes the closest of all those in the eurozone to offering a consistent approach to post-crisis economic management.

In a recent interview, Nacho Alvarez, a senior member of the party’s economics team, laid out his programme with a refreshing clarity. The 37-year-old economics professor says the Spanish debt burden, both private and public, is unsustainable and needs to be reduced. That could include some combination of a renegotiation of interest rates, grace periods, debt rescheduling and a haircut. He also said Podemos’ goal was not to leave the eurozone – but that equally the party would not insist on membership at all costs. The aim is the economic wellbeing of the country.

To an outsider, that seems a balanced position. Not so in Spain. The establishment fears that this agenda will turn the country into a European version of Venezuela. But there is nothing controversial about the statement that if debt is unsustainable it needs to be restructured. Or that if the euro were to bring decades of suffering, it would be perfectly legitimate to question the eurozone’s institutions and policies.

The Podemos position recognises a simple truth about the eurozone in late 2014. It is logically inconsistent for the single currency to enter a secular stagnation and not restructure its debt. Since nothing is being done to avoid the former, there is a probability approaching 100 per cent of the latter happening.

Yet, for the moment, European governments keep playing the “extend and pretend” game. Where such a short-sighted strategy leads to can be seen in Greece. After six years of economic depression, the government finds itself in an acute political crisis. Syriza is leading in the polls, and stands a good chance of assuming power at the next general elections, possibly in 2015.

Spain is not yet at that juncture. Podemos might deprive the largest parties – the Popular party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and the opposition Socialist party – of an absolute majority in next year’s elections. It might force the two into a German-style grand coalition – which would establish the new party as the main opposition.

The situation in Italy is different but no less serious. If Prime Minister Matteo Renzi fails to generate an economic recovery in his remaining three years in office, the opposition Five Star Movement would be in pole position to form the next government. Unlike Podemos, this is a truly radical party, a firm advocate of euro exit. So are the National Front in France and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland.

What Podemos still needs to do is offer a coherent vision of life after a debt restructuring. It would be a good idea if the party organised itself at eurozone-level beyond its alliance with Syriza in the European Parliament, because that is where the relevant policy decisions are made. A debt resolution for Spain, necessary as it is, can only be the start of a wider policy shift.

The tragedy of today’s eurozone is the sense of resignation with which the establishment parties of the centre-left and the centre-right are allowing Europe to drift into the economic equivalent of a nuclear winter. It is a particular tragedy that parties of the hard left are the only ones that support sensible policies such as debt restructuring. The rise of Podemos shows that there is a demand for alternative policy. Unless the established parties shift their position, they will leave a big opening to the likes of Podemos and Syriza.

They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones.

Whether you think the EU is a net good aside, when people are demanding action around rising energy costs and fuel poverty Ed Miliband can only talk about freezing prices for a time, even though that will mean price increases before and after and Labour's own spokesperson having previously said it would lead to blackouts.  Cameron talks about increasing competition and hoping that will offset price increases.  Agree with his policy or don't but in advocating leaving the EU Farage can promote something the others can't.  He can scrap EU energy tariffs and taxes, scrap their carbon swaps, scrap their combustion plant directives and emission targets.  Farage can actually promise to lower energy bills and have a means to deliver on it.    

Going into the European elections Labour bizarrely decided to focus on how they could reduce the weekly grocery shop - not a traditional European talking point.  They got ripped apart on Sunday politics for the amount they were talking about saving by cutting VAT on food (with Andrew Neil pointing out that much food is VAT exempt already).  The reason for it was that UKIP were able to say that they could save 17% on food bills by leaving CAP.  Labour were trying to counter a UKIP talking point and didn't have the means to do so beyond tax less whist spending more.

What makes this politician telling us stuff different to other politicians telling us stuff is this politician has a lot more avenues open to him by advocating an EU exit.

Note that in the U.S, wild bitter almonds are generally unavailable. Here, in Europe they are used in various food products, added in small amounts in marzipan (France) to bring depth to the mixture, they come into the making of amaretto liqueur in Italy as well as in the composition of amaretti biscuits, etc.

The commonest form of bitter-almond flavour is a bottled extract, which contains the aromatic benzaldehyde without its cyanide friend. The pure almond extract is benzaldehyde that is extracted from bitter almonds only, while natural almond extract contains our ""B"" friend produced from cassia bark (also known as cinnamon tree). Finally, the imitation extract is made with chemically synthesized benzaldehyde.

This of course, doesn't explain why it tastes like Cherries. If you are specifically referring to Maraschino cherries, it's probably because they are likely made using [Almond Extract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraschino_cherry), or you've gotten a hold of some Bitter almond extract.

I have a pet-hypothesis that the reason people think they can see the inbreeding in the looks of the royalty is because it is celebrities *born into* celebrity. That means they have their attention whether or not they are pretty - so you end up with them looking on average very mediocre relative to other celebrities.

I think they say sibling having a child with another sibling carries about the same risks as a woman of 40 having a child.

Once you are a link further - like a cousin, the risk is minimal.

Of course that doesn't discount the value of genetic variation.

The Russian economy isn't strong enough for a sanctions war with the west anymore, and it can't expect allies like China to follow it into one, because it doesn't benefit them at all. It lost that level of influence when it lost the Soviet union.       
As for gay rights in Russia, it's not that they're not moving forward fast enough (although that's frustrating), it's that the Russian orthodox church and the Russian government is actively succeeding in pushing them backwards, triggering a spike in violence against gay people.  It will only be a matter of time as you claim if the attitudes are allowed to change naturally, it's not going to happen naturally if a huge propaganda machine is spreading negative views of gays.  Views in Europe improved because people were allowed to speak freely about them, and free speech is not something Putin allows on this issue.

Si el tomate transgénico ya existía antes, es evidente que no puede ser patentable ni se puede registrar. Sería como que yo quisiera patentar la rueda.

No entiendo por que en el artículo hablan que revocar una patente es un gran logro cuando cada año se rechazan miles de patentes de todo tipo. La oficina de patentes actúa como un árbitro/juez para aceptar o rechazar patentes y eso implica rechazar miles de ellas cada año por no cumplir las condiciones.

Es curioso que en ese extracto no se mencione que otra multinacional dedicada a la obtención de nuevas variedades mediante hibridación también haya presentado oposición a la patente. (No lo he buscado pero estoy seguro de que esa empresa tiene un montón de variedades de semillas registradas).

Espero que esto sirva para entender la gran cantidad de desinformación que hay en ese artículo y que mejora un poco cuando se va al artículo original (en inglés).

Because you don't know how they will, doesn't mean that they won't.

For example the first policy example in the article is energy.  Undoubtedly taxes forced by the EU on energy such as carbon swaps, green subsidies, emission targets, closing combustion plants prematurely, has caused energy prices to go up.  There might be a lot of other factors but the EU has had a pretty big role in it too.  Take that role away and prices go down from where they are.  It's as simple as that.  People might huff and puff about their green world vision or how any minute now this 18 year plateau we're experiencing in manmade global warming is going to result in a big glut as thermometers pop everywhere, but when Nigel says the EU is putting energy prices up he's bang on the money.  The outgoing EU industry commissioner, a staunch europhile, even bemoaned the same thing.

&gt;*""This is killing European economies.  Electricity costs in Europe are more than double the cost of electricity in the U.S.  High electricity costs make it difficult for businesses to operate if they need a lot of electricity.  Their cost of electricity is high, and they might not be able to pass it on to consumers when consumers are free to patronize businesses operating where electricity costs are much lower.  Many businesses under pressure are likely move to a lower-cost location, and jobs will go with them.  Antonio Tajani, European Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, warned:* 

&gt;**“We face a systemic industrial massacre.”**^1

Added to that one of the most egregious taxes on Energy for the consumer is mandatory as a member of the EU.   We allow certain foods to be exempt from VAT because they're a necessity and taxing them would hit the poor disproportionately hard, yet a similar necessity for many is taxed exactly so.   We cannot remove VAT from energy bills under EU law.  

We know this because the Chancellor was good enough to tell us.^2  

The mainstay of the article is actually more about just how the leaders of the three parties resemble tin ducks at a shooting ally.  They all look the same in their policy.  They all follow each other's lead.  And when they change direction they do so as one.  The problem is just how little they have left to decide on with every competency that is passed to the EU.  Leaving the EU would absolutely radically reform that.  On Day One of leaving the EU every party leadership that wants to stay in the EU would have to sit down and write new policy.  They'd have to write agriculture policy , fishing policy, rewrite energy policy.  They'd have to look at regulations and committees and every nuance which the European Union has taken over.  The three parties would become different again because there'd be much more for them to disagree on!  

You say 'leaving the EU won't solve any issues' and that 'Nasty Nig' (I'm just going to call him Nigel from here on in since I'm not a fucking pubescent teenager) doesn't provide any answers,

&gt;*""Yes, we want our country back. Not because we dislike Europe, but because we believe that we can run our affairs better than a distant bureaucracy. We want proper border controls, not because we dislike foreigners, but because making sure Britain can actually cater for its population is the sensible, sustainable and ethical thing to do. The others may now dance to our tune in terms of rhetoric, but none offers a policy solution.""*

                                                                    - Nigel

It's right there in the submission.  Leaving the EU means being able to introduce border controls which includes not having Freedom of Movement from all and sundry of a customs union with a population of half billion people.      

He doesn't provide any answers?     Did you read it the article.  I gather not to the end because this is in there too:

&gt;*""None of these parties now represents the ordinary working man or woman, and I would go so far as to say that the major three parties have not only made people poorer, but taken social mobility to its lowest level for decades. We want to change all of that by taking minimum-wage earners out of tax, by giving their children the chance of selective education, and no university tuition fees if they study certain subjects. We want them to live in communities that deal with the real social problem of integration.""*
 
                                                                     - Nigel

Increased personal allowance, a chance of selective education for even the poorest, scrapping university tuition fees for STEM subjects, communities based on integration not insular multiculturalism.

These are all answers.  You don't have to agree with them, but you don't get to say he's not putting any forward without a visit to the Shame Ward either.

Flat rate income tax isn't a UKIP policy for those of us that haven't been living under a rock, they instead opted for increasing the top tax rate threshold and decreasing it to 35p on the pound for those on less than £55k.   That's not helping fat cats, that's helping out Mister and Missus Workhard and Middle-Class.    The corporate fat cats?  They're the ones that want to stay in the EU.  Nigel wants to deregulate the SMEs.  Nigel wouldn't have bailed out the banks if it were left up to him.  He favours Glass-Steagall legislation.

For starters, [you could read this](http://www.tortoisetrust.org/Downloads/Taking_care_of_pet_tortoises_web.pdf). It focuses on Mediterranean tortoises in northern Europe, but contains a lot of good points that are valid for other tortoises and locations as well. First of all, tortoises require quite a bit of space, because they like to walk around. And that space should be outdoors, if possible at all (at least during summer, if the climate where you live isn't warm enough the rest of the year). If you have a garden, great. If not... well, you can house a tortoise indoors permanently, but it takes more equipment (UV lamps etc.), and ultimately isn't as good for them, because nothing beats a natural environment with unfiltered sunlight.
Tortoises also aren't really cuddly pets. Yes, they learn to associate you with food, so they come running when they notice you, and you can interact with them a bit. But all in all, they are more like fish, to be observed rather than played with. That's my opinion at least.

If you do decide to get a tortoise, you should get it from a (local) breeder who reproduces your desired species in captivity.

 [**Khazar theory of Ashkenazi ancestry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar%20theory%20of%20Ashkenazi%20ancestry): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;The [Khazars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars) ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language): Χάζαροι, [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): כוזרים *Kuzarim*, [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language): *Hazarlar*)  were a collection of [Turkic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples) who formed a semi-nomadic [empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanate) in what is now [Southern Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Russia), extending from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. At some point in the 8th-9th centuries, the ruling elite is believed to have converted to [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism). The scope of the conversion of the entire khanate itself remains uncertain.

&gt;In the late 19th century, [Ernest Renan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Renan) and other scholars speculated that the [Ashkenazi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews) of Europe [had their origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnogenesis) in Turkic refugees that had migrated from the collapsed Khazarian Khanate westward into the [Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland), and [exchanged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_shift) their native [Khazar language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_language) with the [Yiddish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_language) while continuing to practice the Jewish religion.

&gt;This theory has had a complex history, within and beyond Judaism. Major scholars have either defended it or dismissed it as a pure fantasy. It has also been seized on at times by [antisemites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) and/or [anti-Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionist) for various purposes, to argue for the idea that Ashkenazi Jews have no ancestral connection to ancient Israel. The theory is met with scepticism or caution by most scholars.

Not saying it's your fault, but if Africans are better at integrating than Arabs, then you can't simply blame racism. Like half of the Muslims in Europe are religious fundamentalists and xenophobic. This often leads to self-chosen segregation from the rest of society. Some parents seem to rather send their children into Quran school, instead of a German language course.

Of course the high amount of problematic people among Turks and Arabs may also lead to employers rather not giving a job to Turks and Arabs. It's similar if your name is Kevin. Because if your name is Kevin in Germany, that usually means you come from a lower class family, were a failure at school and make problems.

Also, we have lots of low income people in East Germany. Yet they don't have such extreme problems with crime as in West Germany. And Turks and Arabs are leading the migrant crime statistics.

&gt; The Nazi thrive in protests like these and I fear that I have to someday leave the country I love.

If you love the country and the liberal-democratic basic order, then the Pegida position paper is not against you. But if you think the liberal-tolerant values of enlightenment are crap, your daughter shouldn't marry a non-muslim, and you hate hate Jews and homosexuals, and despise beer drinkers, then you don't really fit into this country, and should search for a country where your chauvinism is socially accepted.

Otherwise: nasilsin, arkadas? Ne haber?

I'm neither Nazi nor right-wing, and I sympathize with the protesters. Though I probably wouldn't participate in a protest.

Just letting you know how the ambiguity is applied now. If the partner has not been working in the EU Britain can -- partially in thanks to the success of Surinder Singh (which is ironic!) -- argue they are not impeding the right of an EU national since the EU national has NOT been exercising their rights to have their partner in the EU. The UK wants NOTHING MORE than to deny EEA family permit applications. They despise them. The paperwork is convoluted and messy and most of them don't understand it. I was admitted with it when, after reviewing it, the Home Office said I should not have been. I basically had so much information I forced my interpretation on the Heathrow border guards who have very limited experience with the EEA permit. 

The UK will throw its hands up and say they are not blocking OP's partner from being with his partner as he has not been in the EU and is resident in the US, not an EU nation. It's the exercising of rights which is crazily applied.

If OP and partner were in the EU, it'd still be confusing because there is no guidance on what constitutes, or proves, a significant relationship. Even the two-year rule of thumb is just that, a rule of thumb. It comes down to the personal jurisdiction of who reviews your case, which is really difficult. This is why you need things like leases, shared banking accounts, joint utilities, et al, because they prove actual residing, but the longevity is up in the air.

The EU does not enact laws, but so-called directives, which are meant to be transcribed into local laws by local parliaments. There are a number of directives and treaties, such as Schengen, which detail how judicial authorities apply across member states. Typically legal decisions from one country are binding in another. 

One example I can think of is that of a French man who unknowingly impregnated a German woman. She went back to Germany, had him acknowledge being the father, and got a local court to order the father to pay child support.

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles.

Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""Beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading this comment about such a trivial band.

No, it discriminates based on geographical location. The only reason we have the free movement of people is because the free movement of goods couldn't work otherwise.

I'll probably get downvoted. But it is true, some immigrant groups (a subset, big or small, but a subset at last) exploit the system or refuse to integrate. And when you have people living in your country with either one or both feet in their old one, the consolidation and integrity of an unified desire for progress - equal progress - may suffer.

I live in the biggest melting pot in South America and most of our crime, drug trade and corrupt political support can be traced to clear cut demographics.

Applying for the visa which is needed for the same purpose but for citizens of countries not part of this agreement was probably fairly confusing for the people who had to process it since it's not applied for because of aforementioned agreement.  

She should have repeated the same process she used the first time (proved at the border that she had sufficient funds to support herself, return tickets, ties to home, etc.) if she had wanted to re-enter.

And for two of your three concerns, transparency and goals, I'd suggest you actually follow the official Starcraft 2 website for things [like this.](http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/17222794/legacy-of-the-void-multiplayer-development-update-december-17-2014-17-12-2014)",False,cnbiv1c,,3,SharkyIzrod,False,t3_2r0rzj,t1_cnbiv1c

Only issue I can see is as we have free movement with EU, they will be favouritised, but with a course like anesthesiologist I'd say they'd happily let you in!

The main issues in Northern Ireland is the cuts, although health is ring-fenced currently, so shouldn't be too badly affected. Thats short term though, long term I'd guess there will have to be some small cuts but its political suicide to go too far, especially for one of our Gov parties. If you can get a job here, prices aren't bad for housing etc compared to say, England.

If considering the South my main concern would be the rise of Sinn Fein, that is known for its left wing politics, not only with ability to cause tension with North, but their policies could have a really damaging long term economic impact. Luckily, they aren't elected yet so they may never see Government! Also strongly linked to the EU, that over the next few years will likely sort out its creases (I don't expect it to collapse). If they don't get in, great! S. Ireland is a beauty and would be awesome to live in.  If they do, your choice really. Some do like them, so I'm not going to sit here and declare it will collapse (although I think it could if they are in too long), economics is a funny thing.

Honestly, if you want to come over here you should be able to, I can't see any major issues. Just don't expect it to be perfect.

Islamophobia is often created in modern European societies by the leverage of fear of the unknown (rarely any of the people who are marching in these actually KNOW muslims!) as well as fear of economic factors that are associated with immigration in General.
Which means it's the regular bunch of xenophobes together with a bunch of gullible people who believe the inane lies of the ""hate preachers"" that these groups gather behind.

I fact the whole rhetoric they use can be turned against them when we fact-check their arguments.

For example they postulate that some cities have 25% and more ""foreign"" inhabitants, which is a ridiculous claim that is factually wrong.

They claim that immigrants do not participate in sustaining the ""social net"" (paying taxes) and instead turn this ""net"" into a hammock.

This claim was actually disproven by a German economist who calculated that every immigrant (on average!) contributes approximately 3000€ per Year to our social systems.
Their employment rates are HIGHER than the ones for Germans who have the same education.

/Frank Lampard has joined Manchester City ahead of his debut season with affiliate club New York City.

Lampard was recently unveiled as New York City FC’s fourth signing. After meetings with manager Manuel Pellegrini at City's New York headquarters, it was decided that Frank will train and play with the Premier League champions ahead of teaming up with Jason Kreis' New York City set-up for their inaugural season.

He will train with his Manchester City colleagues this morning for the first time and will be registered to the Club and be available for selection.

He said: ""Joining up with Manchester City is a fantastic opportunity for me to continue to train and play at the top level and make sure I am in top condition for New York City.

""It has been an amazing few days for me since the unveiling in Brooklyn and everyone connected with both clubs has been fantastic to me. This is a new chapter of my career and I'm really excited about the experience. 

""I met Manuel and some of the players in New York and I'm looking forward to getting into training and making a contribution for Manchester City ahead of my move over to New York.""

New York City FC Sporting Director, Claudio Reyna, said: ""This is the perfect opportunity for Frank. He is in great shape following the World Cup, and training and playing with our colleagues in Manchester will enable to Frank to be fit and ready for our inaugural training camp.

""Everyone has been hugely impressed with Frank's positivity, and 'm sure he will bring a lot to City during his stint with the club. We wish him well for his spell with Manchester City and look forward to welcoming him back to New York in the New Year.""

Manchester City manager Pellegrini was delighted to welcome Frank into his squad. He said: ""Frank is a world class midfielder and this is an opportunity which works perfectly for everyone, the player, Manchester City, and New York City.

""I'm looking forward to working with him and integrating him into our squad. New York have made a fantastic signing by recruiting Frank, and I'm really pleased that we'll be able to have him with us for the first half of our season and help prepare him for his new challenge.""

The ratio of ethnic minorities is difficult to estimate accurately as French law prohibits the collection of ethnic data for census taking purposes. However estimates suggest there are 500,000 Muslims out of a total population of 1.4 million. Saint-Denis is home to the Union of French Islamic Organizations (UOIF) in the Bourget district, which annually hosts one of Europe's major Muslim conferences, Paris-le-Bourget.

I don't think that people are really fascinated with celebrities by choice. I think it is a more of a case where they are just constantly flashed in front of us like a bright flickering light. But if you look to long and deep the facade crumbles thus the emphasis on carnality and superficiality.

As for hating the ultra-rich that is different from celebrities entirely. Celebrities along with politicians are just members of the outer party whether they know it or not.

Giant Asturias is thanks to the Umayyads de jure drifting tonnes of land into Andalusia. There was a crusade for Andalusia and I won, that really messed up my vassal structure because I stupidly made 11 dukes there but couldn't get the kingdom until I completely eradicated the Umayyads.

&amp;nbsp;

A lot of stuff in western europe is messed up because of the Karlings trading kingdoms like Pokemon cards

&amp;nbsp;

Early on my pope had a claim on France, so I made the theocracy of france and added it to the papacy. He also had a claim on Germany, but I invited another Karling to my court for that. Bulgaria is also a theocracy, but not owned by the papacy.

&amp;nbsp;

Frisia and Burgundy had some issues early on because the king of Frisia kept getting claims on Burgundy (thanks Karling vassals), and they kept splitting until Burgundy changed from gavelkind to primogeniture.

&amp;nbsp;

Nubia owns a bit of Greece because I asked the pope for a crusade for Egypt, and a greek duke won. I later fed him stuff from Nubia and he changed his primary title. I still reckon you should be able to join vassals external offensive wars (eg join your vassal pope's crusade).

&amp;nbsp;

Can't really explain anything other than that. I guess it's the result of a few hundred years with low crown authority and claims being pressed. [My eastern vassals are much nicer](http://i.imgur.com/MaZWYUX.jpg) except for the pesky Beluchistan province in Kosala and the unconquered indians.

But that's less because everyone was stupid for five hundred years after Rome, but because Europe was a mess, composed of small, fragmented polities prone to invasion by outside groups (Avars, Magyars, Norse, Berbers, etc). Traditional trade routes with the east were frequently disrupted, meaning that what goods Europeans had to trade were more difficult than ever to exchange. In this unstable and chaotic environment, with a depleted population and a culture that was, largely, far more rural than the urban-oriented civilizations of Greece and Rome, it's not surprising that stagnation occurred in certain areas. If your largest city has a population of 10,000 people, and almost all your subjects live hand-to-mouth in small villages and on farms, it's not really necessary to build aqueducts or plumbing or coliseums.

You can certainly trace improvements in military technology during the period. Off the top of my head, these include the manufacture of longer swords using better metallurgy; longer and more protective coats of mail (Roman mail tended to be T-shirt-like, rather than the long coats common by 1000 CE); dished steel helmets (Late Roman iron/steel helmets - spangenhelms - were multi-piece construction); improved high-cantled saddles; and shields better suited to cavalry warfare. Most of these are not really revolutionary but evolutionary advances.

Other, less militant innovations include Carolingian minuscule (an immensely useful standardized Latin script), the establishment of universities, and the watermill (extremely useful to agriculture). Other developments came into Europe by means of cultural diffusion; but that's not at all uncommon, and, in my opinion, shouldn't be counted against them. It's not surprising that they cribbed from the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Chinese, areas with far larger populations, stronger economies, and much more centralized government.",False,cnbler2,,5,Rittermeister,False,t3_2qzhau,t1_cnbler2

As far as Europe, 61% of British Muslims believe homosexuality should be illegal and punished.  58% believe insulting Islam should be a crime and 62% believe free speech should not be protected.  There is a clear trend of opposition to secular liberal values which makes it all the more ironic for secular liberals to jump to their defense.

Wage inequality is illegal, and some countries even mandate quota for women in certain fields/positions.

It's also gone beyond that by now.

Blaming feminism for low fertility rates in America or the EU is defensible. Japan is trickier in this regard; Japanese anchorwomen have been known to get fired because people would issue complaints about a woman holding such a position. If you take a further look at worldwide birthrates, you might find that women's rights and fertility don't correlate at all: a country such as Russia, which many people here praise as having RP values(whatever those might be) and having a masculine dictator, has some ridiculously low birthrates.

If that's not enough for you, consider that Iran, the world's only theocracy, a country headed by conservative islamic clergymen who won't allow women to walk the streets with their hair uncovered or let them publicly play sports, has a fertility rate below 2. This puts them below France, a place where paternity tests are banned, women can vote whenever, and the party set to win the next elections is headed by a woman.

Going even further into fertility statistics, we can look at Singapore and find out that despite it being ceaselessly praised by TRP and the more (neo)reactionary part of the internet in general, its fertility is the very lowest in the world, not even breaking 1.

Clearly, how feminist a country is or isn't doesn't make the best predictor for how fertile its people are. Similarly, wealth doesn't explain much either. What you probably need to look at is something like cost of living, the cost of raising a child, and hours worked.

Als je dat niet doet als bedrijf zijn je aandelen niks waard en kun je geen geld ophalen om activiteiten te ontplooien of uit te breiden.

Als iedereen jouw product wil kopen en het ook kan betalen is het niet zo verschrikkelijk moeilijk om steeds meer van je product of dienst af te zetten in de markt.

Maar nu zitten we dus al jarenlang in de situatie dat de mensen die jouw omzet moeten genereren ieder dubbeltje drie keer omdraaien en het daarna toch maar weer wegbergen in afwachting van nog slechter tijden.

Wat moet je dan als bedrijf om toch je winst op te krikken? Besparen op je uitgaven. Voor veel bedrijven, zeker die in de dienstverlening, zijn de loonkosten een relatief een grote kostenpost in vergelijking tot gebouwen, machines, grondstoffen en vaste lasten. Dus is het interressant om te kijken of je de loonkosten kunt drukken. Daarvoor moet je dus mensen ontslaan maar toch zorgen dat je productie en omzet op peil blijft.

Mensen op grote schaal ontslaan gaat niet zomaar, dat geeft maatschappelijke onrust en is slecht voor je imago als bedrijf. Maar mensen sluipenderwijs per twee of drie ontslaan lukt meestal wel, dan noem je dat een ""herstructurering"", ""reorganisatie"", ""afslankingsoperatie"" of hoe die mooie eufemismen ook mogen luiden. Je schudt de manier waarop mensen zijn ingedeeld in logische eenheden binnen jouw bedrijf op en hee, kijk nou, er is ineens geen nieuwe functie meer voor drie oude en dus dure werknemers! In jargon: die zijn ~~overtollig~~ pardon overt***a***llig geworden. 

Dat na zo'n operatie de werkdruk toeneemt voor de achterblijvers die hun baantje voorlopig hebben behouden wordt door de bedrijfsleiding meestal juichend genegeerd, of aangeprezen met newspeak in de orde van *Meer Met Minder* (hallo, Almere), *Toekomstvaste Structuur*, *De Klant Centraal Stellen* (alle banken zo'n beetje, alsmede ziektekostenverzekeraars).

Andere manieren om de loonkosten te drukken is om je lonen zgn ""marktconform"" te maken. Je huurt dan een adviesbureautje in, die schrijft in een rapport dat de salarissen in jouw bedrijf tien procent boven de salarissen van de concurrentie zitten, en hoppa, dat gaan we dus met achterblijvende loonsverhogingen corrigeren zodat we na vijf of tien jaar ""marktconform"" belonen.

Wat je ook ziet gebeuren is dat mensen steeds vaker worden ontslagen en daarna op slechtere voorwaarden weer worden aangenomen. Dat is bij de postbedrijven gelukt, in de thuiszorg net niet dacht ik, veel bouwvakkers zijn ineens zelfstandig ondernemer die op projectbasis worden ingehuurd in plaats van in vaste loondienst zoals voorheen.

Het gevolg van al dit fraais is dat de mensen die het toch al breed hebben ieder jaar tevreden mogen vaststellen dat het dividend dat zij krijgen wederom enkele procenten is gegroeid en hun aandelen meer waard zijn geworden.

Een ander gevolg is dat de mensen die uiteindelijk voor de omzet (en dus de levensvatbaarheid) van jouw bedrijf moeten zorgen, namelijk de consumenten van jouw producten en diensten, steeds minder te besteden hebben en dus steeds minder bijdragen aan de omzet van jouw bedrijf. Dit is bijvoorbeeld in Amerika heel goed te zien: mensen die vroeger met 1 werkende volwassene per huishouden redelijk konden rondkomen, hebben nu soms twee of drie deeltijdbanen verdeeld over pa en ma en kunnen desondanks nauwelijks het hoofd boven water houden. Dit terwijl je wel steeds juichverhalen hoort over de economie die het daar zo goed doet en dat de koersen op de aandelenmarkten alsmaar weer omhoogschieten.

Dat laatste willen Rutte en de zijnen ook graag in Nederland zien gebeuren, namelijk het klootjesvolk terug in hun hok en de rijken een riant en onbezorgd bestaan. Zij worden daartoe ruimschoots in de gelegenheid gesteld door het project Europa, wat in feite een neoliberale machtsgreep is van een stelletje witteboordencriminelen. Democratie in het Europese avontuur is ver te zoeken, we mogen gewoon betalen en moeten verder onze bek houden.

En als het volk het doorkrijgt en begint te morren organiseer je snel een beheersbaar conflict (De Krim, Oekraine, Midden Oosten) om met wapengekletter de aandacht af te leiden.

De enige oplossing die ik in de verre verte zie is dat de rijken op hun beurt worden teruggeknuppeld in hun hok en dat hun hebzucht en graaizucht stevig wordt beknot door wetten, de uitvoering daarvan en vooral ook een cultuuromslag. Het probleem van Nederland is dat het misschien (heel misschien, als bijvoorbeeld de SP ooit in de regering komt) die kant op zou kunnen gaan, maar dat er ook nog een grote boze wereld is die een flinke invloed heeft op ons nationale huishoudboekje. Voor een klein landje dat voor een relatief groot aandeel van de inkomsten is aangewezen op internationale markten (transport, doorvoerhaven, export) heb je slechts een beperkte bewegingsruimte. 

Voorbeeld: er gaan stemmen op op een einde te maken aan het handjeklap van de belastingdienst met grote multinationals die in Nederland hun hoofdkantoor hebben. Zodat ze eens een keertje normaal belasting gaan betalen in plaats van heel weinig. Zodra je dat in bepaalde kringen zegt roept iedereen verontwaardigd *Nee! Dan gaan ze naar het buitenland en betalen ze helemaal geen belasting meer in Nederland!* Ongeacht de vraag of dat wel of niet waar is (dat weet je pas zeker nadat je het hebt geprobeerd), is deze argumentatie een remmende factor voor een regering die haar belastingbeleid jegens grote multinationale ondernemingen zou willen herzien.

Een ander probleem is de Europese kolos die maar voortdendert, en die van onze achtereenvolgende regeringen vanaf Balkenende 2 steeds meer zeggenschap heeft gekregen over zaken die ons allen wezen treffen, zoals wetgeving, beleid, en vooral ook dat we nog steeds netto meer betalen aan de EU dan de EU aan ons.

I'm a leftist. I despise national identity, the idea that culture is a fixed set of values everyone native to a country adheres to, I despise people who are quick to assume positions despite their own potential ignorance, which includes racists and most xenophobes.  
And yet many of my fellow lefties do exactly what you're criticizing the right of: lumping all of ""the other"" together to demonize them, to discredit all of them in one stroke, creating an environment in which effective and sober discussion with differentiated analysis and nuanced points of view becomes impossible.  
You're no better than them. You're falling victim to tribalism yourself, substituting group identity for individual opinions and single issues.

You make people like me unsympathetic to you, in a time and on an issue where we should all be united against stereotyping others. This is not how you do it. You're being counter productive.

Plenty of differences between German and French and Italian and whatever cultures. And lets be real here, pretty much nobody gives a fuck if an englishman settles down in Italy. We don't whine that they hold onto some of their own cultural ideals. 

Additionally, the reason we're expecting ourselves to be multicultural because we are also the reason a lot of those people are here. I can only speak for my own country (The Netherlands) but I am certain there are similarities in other European countries.

Take after the second world war, for example. The Netherlands really needed manpower at that point. During war, many young men had died, and a lot of the survivors had gone to Canada. So we had a labour deficit. So what do we do? We invited so many young men from other countries to come work here, first from the rest of Europe then from Turkey and Morocco. We expected these people to stay here for a short time than go home when we didn't need them anymore. Which, personally, I find a pretty douchey assumption. Oh please come solve our problems, but then you do not get to reap any of the rewards, cause you should go back to your own countries and try and build up something there after decades abroad. 

As you can expect that didn't work very well.

These people didn't go. They settled down here, brought over their families or created new ones here, their children were born here, they have never known their 'home countries'. They helped us out when we needed it, we kinda owe it to them to allow them to live here as well. 

And that is not even the only way people got here. The Netherland used to be a huge colonial power. We had colonies all over the world. We forced our culture and politics on these people, not always to positive effect for the people there. Take the Maluku Islands and Indonesia. After the world war, The Netherlands was all to eager to get their hands back on Indonesia. The people of Indonesia were not very happy with this and they fought for their freedom. Of course The Netherlands were not exactly going to take that lying down. Now we had a colonial army in that time, filled with people from the region. One of the most elite corps in it were the Maluku corps.  These men had fought and died for us. But when Indonesia became independent, suddenly they were considered traitors there because they had sided with the Dutch. We couldn't abandon those people exactly so those that wanted to were brought over here 'temporarily'. So temporarily we took the liberty of discharging them from the army too. Oh but they could not work in the Netherlands either, cause no, they were going home soon, right? We allowed them to live here but only barely. We did not allow them to integrate into our society until years and years later. And now we are complaining about how they are not properly integrated.

In short, a lot of the expectations of European multiculturalism come forth from the fact that in the past we created our own problems with the politics of that day and age. ",False,cnbq9tc,,7,palcatraz,False,t3_2r22au,t1_cnbq9tc

Highly orthodox lifestyles are absolutely tolerated, and the 'rights' of the parent to determine the upbringing of the child (so long as you aren't physically violent and send your kid to school) are valued higher than the rights of children to not be brought up to be a close-minded religious puppet. Jehova's Witnesses exist (the people who teach their kids to not read any unapproved literature and reject blood transfusions) and are tolerated, as are other 'fundamentalist' christian sects, as are highly orthodox jews and muslims. 

But it's not entirely equal between religions - the mainstream in Islam (Shia and Sunni - Sufi less so) is far more conservative, anti-liberal, anti-egalitarian, anti-progressive than in the other two abrahamic religions in central Europe (in the mean and median).

Again - as long as you are not obviously mistreating your child, nothing will happen to you for requiring them to follow your orthodoxy... it happens all the time, with any religion... it's just that more Muslims are more strongly orthodox than other religious groups in Germany.

I personally think we need stricter laws protected children from the ideology of their parents where it interferes with their development of the abilities to make free and self-determined use of their constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties - but I realize this is a very hard thing to legislate without creating a slippery slope.

Of course the solution isn't xenophobia and segregation - though we can and should in general be at least somewhat selective about immigration with respect to the projected ability of an immigration-candidate to affirm the values of liberty and self-determination.

We need dialogue, and we need to help the more liberal streams inside Islam, while disincentivizing the anti-liberal, anti-egalitarian orthodoxy - and we still ought to be vocal about not approving of ideologies that oppose the values of liberty of self-determination we hold dear... against both right-wing xenophobes and anti-liberal orthodox or fundamentalist religious people.",False,cnbqmup,,6,BlueHatScience,False,t3_2r0nvr,t1_cnbqmup

Also, those solo things to do are different than most MMOs. Things like sotry run out quick, so its Housing, Costumes, Collecting achievements, exploring the little bits like lore books and datacrons.  
PvP exists but is so lop sided its not for most, but there are communities who like it.

There is a population which can support a good guild and some general LFG activities on the PvE servers in NA and EU regions.  

&amp;nbsp;

Just remember, **Population isn't the big issue. Becoming active in a guild is the big issue.**

&amp;nbsp;

While I don't recommend you go to a PvP server, there are still a few people who like to play there. Its just much harder to do things because of the drastically low population.

Not to discount your experience, but I still disagree.  Does the name Ralph Nader ring a bell?  There were a number of design cues that were outlawed as a direct result of his input.      
     
Off the top of my head, a couple design cues that I can think of which are currently outlawed (not all due to Nader):     
     
* Metal bumpers (outlawed more due to the 5mph collision requirement, but there's also a component of pedestrian safety to it)     
* Swing-out front quarter windows     
* Pop-up headlights     
* This is a European regulation, but hoods have to meet a minimum height requirement for pedestrian collisions, making the low-profile wedge design a thing of the past     

&gt; The truth is, car companies don't want to make old cars. 
      
I'm sure there's truth to this too.  Auto companies are in the business to design products that keep up with, and in some cases define design trends.  Furthermore, in most cases re-releasing old models would cater to small subsets of customers.

I agree, it's not a strong point, considering every other country outside of the EU has policies on immigration control and the reasons for justifying them, to a very high majority, have nothing to do with race. 

&gt;B) Immigration does not significantly weaken our security, contrary to what many people believe. 

Well that depends where the immigration is coming from, doesn't it? If the immigrants are coming from a pro-western liberal democracy with a similar culture, I'd agree. However, if they are coming from countries which have a largely intolerant culture, hate the west and hold views antithetical to the core values of western civilisation, then not only is this concerning but should also be deemed a security threat. Which it is. 

Unless you really want to ignore all the atrocities committed by these immigrants in the last few years.

&gt;C) Immigrants are the new small business, and in that way are the backbone of the economy. Anyone who has ever lived in central London knows exactly what I'm talking about. 

I can agree to this but I reiterate my point made to dave1233345

See below.

&gt;D) Cultural diversity is always good. I see no benefit to becoming an isolationist nation with no outside cultural influence. 

Always good? Even if the culture you are importing hates you and everything you stand for. Holds barbaric views regarding woman, gays, animals and people of other faiths? Promote a culture of violence to achieve their goals, want to implement tribal law in certain parts of your country?

&gt;E) I genuinely don't see the merit in the ""British jobs for British workers"" argument. Quite simply, if you can't get a job because an immigrant is better, then you should get better and stop complaining about country of origin. Having a job in this country is not a birthright. 

The obligation of a government is to protect their citizens interests first and foremost. If the government was managing immigration properly there shouldn't be a need for British workers to compete as there would only be immigration for markets with a shortage of labour. Importing people with skills in markets already saturated is stupid and decreases the standard of living for everyone involved.

&gt;And final reason, we have no right to deny good people access to the world on which they were born. The earth belongs to everybody. There is no such thing as illegal immigration in my opinion. 

This is just absurd.

Germany under Adolf Hitler, Italy under Mussolini, and Spain under Franco were all fascist states. As a rule, fascist governments are dominated by a dictator, who usually possesses a magnetic personality, wears a showy uniform, and rallies his followers by mass parades; appeals to strident nationalism; and promotes suspicion or hatred of both foreigners and “impure” people within his own nation, such as the Jews in Germany. Although both communism and fascism are forms of totalitarianism, fascism does not demand state ownership of the means of production, nor is fascism committed to the achievement of economic equality. In theory, communism opposes the identification of government with a single charismatic leader (the “ cult of personality”), which is the cornerstone of fascism. Whereas communists are considered left-wing, fascists are usually described as right-wing.

Additionally-- fascism is hinged on nationalism and a strong sense of national identity, opposing immigration, racial integration, and religious tolerance-- ie, conservative maintaining of the populous status quo.

dictionary.com:

&gt;any ideology or movement inspired by Italian Fascism, such as German National Socialism; any right-wing nationalist ideology or movement with an authoritarian and hierarchical structure that is fundamentally opposed to democracy and liberalism

More wiki:
&gt;Most long-standing spectra include a right wing and left wing, which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789–99).[1] According to the simplest left–right axis, communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, opposite fascism and conservatism on the right.

Don't be. We have problems with a subgroup of immigrants (not necessarily even muslims, though I believe that is the largest group) that refuses to adapt to life in our respective countries. They refuse to speak our languages (excepting those that were born here or moved as children), they are rude to others who aren't part of their own culture (often especially women), they refuse to adapt to our customs, they reject our ideas about freedoms, rights, gender equality, etc and they commit crimes at high rates.

1. Algeria and Libya *were* colonies of France and Italy before WW2.

2. No, it looks like Israel and Liban are independent countries which have joined the Atlantropic Union.

3. There's nothing wrong with the word Nordic. It means Northern in the languages of the countries involved. It's a word that to this day we use to describe Scandinavia.

4. I could easily see France joining the Atlantropic Union, having a southern border in the Mediterenean and being surrounded by Mediterrenean countries. England joining the Nordic Council seems more problematic to me. I imagine they would have stayed independent or neutral.

5. It seems like you're conflating fascism with Nationalism. I'll agree that this map hints at the success (and possibly transformation) of fascist Italy, but Nationalism, especially German Nazism, is antithetical to the kind of international alliances present in this scenario.

A few things I notice - 

a) Russia calls itself a republic. So we know there has been a Russian revolution, but Russia doesn't appear to have become the Democratic Centralist power it was in Stalin's time.

b) Russia hasn't invaded Eastern Europe. Either the alliances there are what prevented that, or the Russian Republic was sympathetic to those alliances.

This leads me to believe it's possible that the Russian revolution stayed true to Marxist principles (Maybe Trotsky was never exiled and assassinated, and Stalin never took over,) and Internationalistic Menshevism trumped Nationalistic Bolshevik policies.

Perhaps without [the phantom spectre of ""Bolshevism""](http://i.imgur.com/gpqLA.jpg), Nazi propaganda was unsuccessful, and the Nazis never took power.

The result may have been successful socialist revolutions in Germany during the 20s - hence, a sympathetic Russian Republic, and a burgeoning spirit of internationalism in Germany and its more left wing Northern neighbors.

So, it may just be the case that this map represents leftist ideals better than rightist ones, but who knows? It could also be the case that this map represents a scenario where more centrist ideas prevailed throughout Europe and Russia, with neither fascism, Nationalism, nor Communism coming to dominate the political atmosphere of the 20th century. That's kind of the point of these sort of imaginary maps - to hint at the possibilities and tease an answer out of the question ""What if?""

""Race"" the word combines two very different concepts, as I myself have shown here: ethnicity, where you're from, and culture. It's also very hard to define culture, but seeing as this place is largely populated by fascists, our definitions likely overlap somewhat. Since this is the case, it is only an illusion, yet somehow it is worth protecting as well, since both things are of incredible value.

Elsewhere in this thread, I've talked about how certain parts of American society are still ""White"", as in they're descended from European stock, but they have no culture aside from this ""American culture"". Maybe there is an American culture? but there sure isn't one in New England where I live. That's sad.

It's also depressing to see mixed kids. In a required class at my progressive school we had to write about this very topic, and I got in a little bit of trouble for talking about Hitler. The only reason I bring this up is because we read [an article](http://www.npr.org/2013/10/14/231447526/holding-onto-the-other-half-of-mixed-race) written about a Norwegian woman who married a black guy and had kids with him. Her children have been raised in Norway, but they're half-black. They're different from the ""norm"". And they're confused about who they are. One of them is even trying to get educated about his parts' cultures in college, when he should be learning it at home. Not only that, but all that genetic heritage of the Nordic people is thrown away in those two children of hers. That's been destroyed and her children are trying to figure out who they are.

So in the end, race has to be preserved because it is made up of two things - ethnicity, or blood, and culture - which both need preservation.

When color-blindness happens you enter into the potential for race-mixing, which, as evidenced by these two half-black kids, is bad.

I don't like the public opinion of how America functions globally, mostly because I don't think a majority of millennials truly understand what history went into shaping the current world, although that opinion is mostly true. They have been bashed endlessly for being the ""world police"", and yeah to sum it up in brief, overkill. 


The whole civilization has been exhausted on the expanse of excess everything, with a major driving factor being the foreign policy of its government, and the mass consumption of its consumer culture, mirroring that of the Roman empires successes and failures, and in some ways the same successes and failures of Colonial Britain. But even deeper than that, the socioeconomic changes our global civilization has enjoyed and somewhat run away with have been created by America, out of a need for the change, and a desire for progress. 

America was founded in a time of social unjust and government oppression, and they revolted for change. The whole constitution thing that has become a defining factor for why the world hates on America, but it's also why people come in droves year after year. They represented a revolution for the common man(if you were white at the time, but the western world was all about being white back then) and those ideals became the much hated ideals that the world has been driven by for the last 200 years. 


We always talk about what's wrong with America, but before America there were other countries that called the shots, and in their day, the world hated them. America vs Native Americans, Britain empire vs well pretty much everybody for a while there, Europe vs Africa(all of Europe got in on this (Belgium I'm looking at you, son). That's just how it works, we hate our neighbours. Man eats man. We haven't had a single year of world peace for the last 100, and it goes back further than that, but I'll stick with modern records. We have always hated the guy on the other side of the fence, even before America invented white suburban middle class fences to stand behind secretly hating that other guy. Case in point, Rome vs Carthage/England vs France/China vs Mongolia/Greece vs Persia, etc. We love to hate, especially if it's a rival country. America vs Russia. Prime example. Hate hate hate. 

We hate our neighbours, but yet enjoy the quality of life brought on by that culture, the improvements made in the western world were adopted/assimilated/discovered by America, for which they are praised or hated. Yet they become the global standard, or even surpassed by other countries once the influence has reached the international stage(education systems/banking policies/subsidized medical coverage/womens and minority rights).


One thing that is both really exciting and scary about modern times is how fast we communicate, our technological advances have been crazy, and the industry has been driven by America and her consumption. Yes, developers and comsci exists outside it, and computer invention is attributed to a multiple of advances globally, same with the internet, but silicon valley is the driver right now. Part of the big change technology has created has been our sharing of information, which is broad, but it has completely revolutionized how to live life. Everything in our lives is new, literally if you go back 3 generations of human life computers didn't exist, now we are landing computers on comets and trying to rope a meteor into our moons orbit. Go back 2 generations and we are sending out the deepest computer ever sent into space and mapping our universe, this generation and we have smartphones and bitcoins. Big crazy changes.

Without media sharing, we'd still be paying $29 for a CD, $29 for a DVD. How dare we pay that unjust price for something somebody owns. The need for cheaper entertainment led to media sharing, thankfully with a faster internet too, i mean could you imagine torrents over dialup? With p2p and napster, and torrents and the pirate bay, once these inventions hits the world stage, it becomes a standard. A quality of life thing. We can argue it all day, but even when it's brought down, it's absence doesn't change the world it has created, out of a need and a desire. Remove the scapegoat, keep the goat farm.

If or when America collapses under its own weight from over extending it's economy, it won't change the world it has helped create, and part of that is consumption. Part of that is a place for huge armies, large budgets, waste. We won't change because we can't live without having what the other guy has on his side of the white suburban fence. 

I personally love the world and what my parents world and grandparents world has created, although flawed as it may be. Yes, consumption is an issue, won't doubt that, I mean that's what our world is standing on now, this large artificial economic stimulus, but if America and her system wasn't in charge right now, it would be any other of the powerful countries calling the shots, and we'd still have a desire for consumption. It's a shame when people point this out and society ignores time and time again, but that's the world we live in. I don't know if we could really change that now that we have created this world, people inherently wouldn't want to give it up.

We do NOT and WILL NOT accept blame or responsibility for the actions of extremists. FUCK THAT. I'm tired of hearing that garbage. What do you expect us to do? 

You have to realize that Islam is a large umbrella term for a lot of different sects and points of view on the religion as a whole. Some of these views...are honestly just skeletons of Islam and are used to further agendas. 

I guess I'll let you in on one more thing. Arabs generally don't assimilate too well in other cultures. We like to keep our own culture, and unfortunately misogyny is seen as manliness in a lot of Arab countries (its also prevalent in a lot of Asian/Indian countries so not singling Arabs out).

It takes a few generations to drive home that particular point I would imagine, and I'm speaking as a Muslim Arab myself. Then again I come from a more liberal country and family. 

tl;dr expecting Muslims to somehow answer for the actions of hardcore Islamists is dumb thinking, they annoy us as much as they do you (proof: ISIS)...keep in mind that Arabs are not gonna move to Europe and immediately embrace your values. Not everyone moves to the West because they love you...they are forced to and will try to hold on to their culture (even the worst parts) for as long as possible.

1425104769,55,0,,,t5_2qkeh,False,0,answers,t3_2r16pn,1420178146,0,"**Executive summary:** blame ancient Roman politicians, Julius Caesar, the Council of Nicea, and Pope Gregory XIII.

The Romans started their years on Jan 1st which was also the date officials took office. The [old Roman calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar) had 12 month years of 350-some days and they frequently added a 13th month with the intention of keeping the seasons lined up with the calendar. The politicians declared what the calendar was going to look like that year. Naturally politicians would make their own years longer and their opponents' years shorter to delay or speed up elections. It was a mess and people outside of central cities wouldn't easily have been able to keep track of the date.

Julius Caesar instituted a calendar reform to keep the calendar alined with the sun and seasons without human intervention. He had a 365 day year starting on Jan 1 with a leap day every four years with the solstice on Dec 25th. Having a regular system was a vast improvement but it created a slight error so that the seasons crept forward in the calendar 3 days every 400 years (calendar year slightly longer than an actual year). 46 BC was the realignment year and 45 BC was the first regular year.

I don't know why they picked Dec 25th and not Dec 31st or Jan 1st. The actual ""solstice"" is actually only a moment long and it happens once worldwide at any time of the day rather than being a particular day or time--maybe then it could wobble around a certain date and Jan 1 is a week later so it's far enough away that it would always be clear of the solstice. Or given that Jan 1st was when people were to take office, maybe the Romans partied hard enough on the solstice that they needed a week to recover so that Jan 1 was intended to be the next available ""business"" day.

Rome went Imperial. The Julian calendar ran and the seasons occurred 3 days sooner every 4 centuries. The Christians got together [in Nicea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) in 325 to iron out the details of Christianity. The solstices and equinoxes happened to be happening around the 21st at that time. Easter was decided to be the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox.

Later Rome collapsed and everyone did their own thing for a while. In different areas New Year ranged from Christmas to the spring equinox or Easter. Byzantium used Sept 1st. Lots of areas converged on using [Lady Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Day)--March 25th--as the start of the new year which is a similar time of year as the spring equinox. 

In the late 1500's the Catholic church realized that the spring equinox was occurring nearly two weeks earlier compared to the 300's which meant Easter was probably happening on the wrong dates. The pope introduced [the Gregorian calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) which corrected the number of leap days per century (century years only divisible by 400 have leap days) and reset the date so that the seasons are anchored to the same dates as in the 300's. Also it re-emphasized Jan 1 as the start of the year. Here's a graph of the [flux in dates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Calendar_seasonal_error) of the modern calendar.

It took a while for Europe to switch over from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian. There was also the whole Catholic-Prostestant issue. Many places officially switched New Years separately back to Jan 1st before switching to the Gregorian calendar. England (and the American colonies) finally got around to doing both in the early 1750's. This is when there was that 11 day jump forward in dates.

Also, I think we modern people think about ""years"" a lot differently than the way people have for most of history. Most of humanity in Europe people were peasants. You plant your field on the lord's estate in the spring, harvest in the fall, then avoid freezing and starving for a few months, then a new year starts and you do it all again. Most people were probably only concerned with years enough to keep track of when people were born and died and how old they were. When exactly a year started between harvest and planting probably didn't really matter that much.

Lastly I know this stuff because a few months ago we had a debate at work about the days of the week and how that cycle is 7 days so I looked this stuff up. The creationist coworker arguing against us all was saying god/bible made the 7 day week. The early Romans were mostly using an 8-day cycle based on having a ""market day"" every 8 days or so. Over the course of Rome common usage transitioned from a squishy 8 day cycle to the fixed 7 day cycle we know. Our current 7 day weeks have been going on unbroken for at least 1700 years that we know of. The most likely explanation of a 7 day week to me is that it's a quarter of the moon cycle length (a little over 28 days) because many cultures outside of Abrahamic religions also have 7 day weeks.",False,cnbwytj,,55,kidfay,False,t3_2r16pn,t1_cnbwytj

In striking contrast, there was an ""extremely close affinity of Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations [Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, Druze, Saudi Arabians] observed here ...[that] supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin"" of these populations dating back about 4,000 years. The differences between the populations were not statistically significant, demonstrating once again the close genetic relationship of Middle Eastern populations to each other. In fact, the Palestinians and Syrians were so close to the Jews in genetic characteristics that they ""mapped within the central cluster of Jewish populations."" As one of the Israeli scientists on the team said, ""Eventually people will realize that they are not that different."" Peace through Genetics?

Germany adopted your side of the argument and is in debt because of it. France on the other hand is financially blooming because of their reliable nuclear energy.

As for my point on consumer use of solar/wind power, I will use Ontario's provincial energy distribution network as an example of how solar/wind power can a provide stable and monetarily beneficial outcome for consumers. They have this unique system set where homeowners can choose to install solar panels on their roof, and register their daily output rates with the province. If sufficient, the province will require the amount of energy required for use within the home, and deduct it from the total output to get the amount that they can buy from the homeowner and distribute back to the province.

In other words, Frank puts solar on his roof, his province buys the extra power from him and sells it to other people. Win for everyone.

For now, he had to settle with the drumsticks he had carved himself from the legs of a chair that someone had left outside with a sign saying: *free*. The Little Drummer boy took anything, anything at all, and turned it into a sound. The things he included in his orchestra, no one would have looked twice at, a brick on a wall, a lid on a metal trash can, a stray piece of paper.

Mae Lin woke up at two in the morning. Her mother was going to wake her up at six, but she refused to allow her mother to make her into something she wasn't: a prodigy. Since she could walk and talk, Mae Lin was forced to learn all there was to know about a violin. Her mother was determined to command and commit her child to a monotonous struggle to realize a dream that she (the mother) could not realize. Mrs. Lin was a talent at the violin, one that could put the greatest to shame, but she was never taken more seriously than the schoolgirl that could only play ""Mary had a little lamb"". She wanted to play in europe, or broadway, but never got farther from the talent show at her local community center, which she lost. Mae's mom knew she was simply too old and not pretty enough that no producer or talent scout would look twice at her. When she discovered she was with child, she swore to make sure that her daughter would realize the dream she had lost. As for Mae herself, she packed what she could into her school backpack and, for some reason, she took her violin as well. It was the only friend her mother allowed her to have, and if Mae was to run away from home and from her mother's legacy, she would need a friend to accompany her.

The old man woke up, he wasn't sure what time it was, so he looked at the note on his left: *Anton, I am you from yesterday ago reminding you that today is July the 22nd of 2015.* Anton stopped right there, the year was two-thousand and fifteen? that was impossible!  He was fairly certain he had graduated college only two weeks ago in nineteen seventy! He looked down at the note again: *I, or 'you' rather, whichever you prefer, have a disease that causes you to lose your memory after a certain amount of time. You will wake up every morning only to have forgotten everything that happened the day before. Around twelve noon, a woman from 'Greyson Family Therapy' will arrive. If she doesn't, call this number...*"" He finished the note, and went to the bathroom. He looked at himself in the mirror, seeing all the features of an old man, a wrinkled face, a receding hairline with grey spots of hair. He had no evidence to claim that this was a prank his roommates were playing. Having nothing better to do, he sat down in at his piano bench, and felt the cool ivory keys of his piano on his fingers. It seemed that, though his toothbrush, or the bed he awoke on were strangers to him, this piano, this instrument was familiar, in a way that he could not recall by memory alone. In a feat displaying the phenomenon known as muscle memory, he pressed a few keys in a rhythemic tune, and let himself get carried away.

We can start there. These organisations include the WHO and the  European Food Safety Authority. Reviews of the studies show that there is a reduction inf CVD when replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats.

You further claim that:

&gt; Plenty of civilizations exist on nearly all red meat alone, with low heart disease.

This is not true. At all. In fact, almost no civilization in history have lived on red meat alone. Most civilizations (and all major successful civilizations) have lived on starches. Yes, carbs. Name me one civilization, that is not modern America, that have lived on red meat alone. It's very hard for humans, in nature, to live on meat.

The western diet is on loaded with sugars, fat and protein. It's in fact low in carbs (not only counting sugar), compared to almost any natural diet that almost every other civilization has ever lived on. The classic counter example are the eskimos.

&gt;* Kiev (AFP) - Thousands of Ukrainian nationalists held a torchlight procession across Kiev on Thursday in honour of a 1940s anti-Soviet insurgent branded by Moscow as a Nazi collaborator whom Europe must reject.

&gt;* Bandera was posthumously decorated with a Hero of Ukraine medal in January 2010 by the then pro-Western president Viktor Yushchenko.

&gt;* Some wore World War II-era army uniforms while others draped themselves in the red and black nationalist flags and chanted ""Ukraine belongs to Ukrainians"" and ""Bandera will return and restore order"".

Avoid using ""college"" because it means completely different things in Europe and America. In the US ""going to college"" means attending university. They are exactly the same thing with no ambiguity in what anyone means.

Here's the tricky part, it's VERY expensive to study in the US, especially as a foreigner as you are not allowed to get a lot of the financial help and loans that citizens get. It depends a lot on each university though. It can be very worth the money, especially from the best universities.

I would look into the very best schools in the US in what you'd like to do. I don't know about that specialty in particular but I would say MIT, Georgia Tech, maybe Caltech or Stanford are all places that you should look into. I may be missing some or just have no idea about the field, you need to do the research. If you can get into any of those top schools, it will be very worth the money to attend and yes, I'm taking of probably around more than 100.000 USD. Once you are accepted to any school, call their financial aid office to talk money.

But a top tier education has 2 effects. People instantly know you are qualified no matter what (doesn't matter if it's true) and you meet a lot of other people that are at a top tier school and also go on to do good things. I believe it's slightly easier to get a visa as a graduate of a US school.

The word you are looking for isn't local, it's ""domestic"".  As in, within the country.  It just so happens that for the USA, the country is the same size as the entire bloody continent of Europe.

And yes, the top teams in each country (the TOP teams, not the teams in the country's second or third division) earn the opportunity to play in European competitions like the Champions League and the Europa League, but unless they are one of the best teams from one of the richest leagues, they are going to have a max of four-ish European travel days a season.  

Compare that to the huge amount of travel in the American leagues.  MLS teams have a total of 17 away games a season at the moment.  That'd be like traveling for European competition 17 teams a season.  And while MLS teams can deal with that, the lower division teams often can't.  Many lower division teams in national leagues have folded in the past several years, and while there undoubtedly several reasons for these foldings, I believe that one of them is undoubtedly the huge cost of travel.

For example, let's look at the schedule of the Seattle Sounders (whose place on the European map roughly correlates with Rennes) in September (just a small portion of their schedule).  It would be travel from Rennes to Algiers, back to Rennes, to Yerevan, to Baku, to Benghazi, and back to Rennes.  Roughly 11960km as the crow flies.  Let's compare this to the travel of Liverpool F.C. in November, their most travel-heavy month yet.  Liverpool to Newcastle, to Madrid, back to Liverpool, on to London, then Sofia, then back to Liverpool.  That is a distance of about 7850km.  Less than 2/3 the distance of the American team.  Now, these costs are not prohibitive to rich teams like Liverpool or even Seattle, but to second third tier teams like the Carolina Railhawks or the Rochester Rhinos those costs are a huge burden.

Could the USA do pro/rel if the lower leagues were regional (for example, the second tier was made up of four parallel leagues, all for specific regions)?  Maybe.  It would certainly eliminate the travel barrier (or at least greatly reduce it).  But is a country-wide pro/rel system available?  No, because the country is too damn big.",False,cnc1ho3,,5,Jdog2010,False,t3_2r29jv,t1_cnc1ho3

As J. Hawk states, Europe is once again tolerating Nazis, and it will pay dearly for this idiocy, as it paid seventy years ago.  

The aim, once again, is to destroy Russia.  And then what?  What does all of this death and destruction accomplish?  Our rulers have gone mad.

❧

&gt; French magazine Elle published photographs of Vita Zaverukha.  [Zaverukha is a Ukrainian Nazi, a member of the Aidar punitive battalion](#b1red). 

&gt; She [publicly called for genocide](#b1red) to be committed to the people of the Donbass. 

&gt; She [participated in torture and killings of prisoners and peaceful inhabitants](#b1red). 

&gt; The editors of ELLE could not have not known that she is an adherent of National Socialism and an advocate of mass murder. Therefore one can conclude that [ELLE is engaged in Nazi propaganda](#b1red). 

&gt; Is the Western community (and especially the French) prepared to tolerate the [attempts to rehabilitate Nazism in Europe](#b1red)?

&gt; ❧

&gt; J. Hawk commentary:

&gt; This is very much a real person whose name frequently pops up in Ukrainian news reports, usually in conjunction with intimidation attempts of the local population, and not only on the Donbass. 

&gt; Most recently she was seen in Vinnitsa, which is quite far from the war zone. 

&gt; The fact that the ideological affiliation of such Ukrainian ""patriots"" [is being studiously ignored by European media](#b1red) is troubling in the extreme, especially given that one does not to search very far to discover the true nature of Ukrainian nationalism -- the photos above came from Zaverukha's own facebook page, which disappeared only a few days ago. 

&gt; ❧

&gt; To cite just one example, recently the foremost Polish newsweekly Polityka carried a lengthy article on [Ukrainian ""activist"" Tatyana Chornovol who, among other things, is affiliated with the Azov Battalion](#b1red) whose symbol is the Neo-Nazi Wolfsangel (banned in most European countries). 

&gt; Yet Polityka, even though mentioning Azov, [failed to inform its readership of the unit's symbology](#b1red) or ideological bent. 

&gt; One is left with the impression that today's Ukrainian Neo-Nazis are being tolerated [for the same reason ""civilized West"" tolerated Hitler in the 1930s](#b1red). 

&gt; In both cases, [their primary declared target was Russia](#b1red). 

&gt; ❧

&gt; Europe found out to its chagrin [the high cost of coddling National Socialists in their midst](#b1red), and it is liable to repeat that lesson in the 21st century. 

&gt; After all, the West is [still paying a hefty price for sponsoring Islamic Fundamentalism](#b1red) as a weapon to be used against USSR in the 1980s during the war in Afghanistan. 

&gt; ❧

&gt; If anything, [the sponsorship of Neo-Nazis as an anti-Russian weapon](#b1red) is liable to backfire even more spectacularly, given EU's economic troubles, high levels of youth unemployment, in combination with traditional European xenophobia now being increasingly directed at immigrants and Muslims. 

&gt; And who will save Europe from its folly this time?

The Youth Pill: Scientists at the Brink of an Anti-Aging Revolution, by David Stipp
Notes:  This book reviews the many theories of allowing the body to stop aging, and live longer.  Mainly focusing on caloric restriction, resveratrol, and the bio engineers and startups that hope to create life extension for all, and to stop aging.
RR: 4/5

Rethinking Thin: by Gina Kolata
Notes: This book is an excellent discussion of the science and theories, many unproven, of weight loss.  Kolkata is a great writer, and points out that there are no weight loss miracles. As a result, and in the book she makes the studies of the last 100 years fascinating proof of this concept, there are no real solutions, but many people will find the hard reality of genetics, and the study of what works and what doesn’t, fascinating.
RR: 4/5

Happiness is an Inside Job - Practicing for a Joyful Life, by Sylvia Boorstein
Notes:  As a meditation instructor, Boorstein has a practice with a series of meditations (wise effort and wise mindfulness practices) to improve your levels of happiness and the quality and performance of all you do in life.  This is the third book I’ve read from Boorstein, who is a good, and insightful writer. 
RR: 4/5

Drown, by Jonathan Davis
Notes: Like the book “The Brief Wonderful Life of Oscar Wao” (see my 2011 list), this book takes place in the Dominican Republic ghettos of New Jersey, and goes deep into the culture and jargon in 10 short stories.  Short but a compelling read.
RR: 4/5

John Adams by David McCullough
Notes: After reading 1776, by the same author, I was ready to read more about John Adams.  This book also gives great detail about another important figure, Adam’s wife, Abigail.  This books focuses on Adam’s diplomatic tours, negotiating treaties with Europe, along with Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.
RR: 4/5

Under the Banner of Heaven by John Krakauer
Notes: I have read most of Krakauer’s books and essays and love his writing style.  This book involves the murder of a 24 year old mom and her 15 year old daughter by a Christian inspired by God within the Mormon faith to follow the instructions and will of God in doing the killing.  It goes into, in great detail, the passages of the bible and doctrines that led to the killing and extremism and violence.
RR: 4/5

I’m a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on America after being away for 20 years, by Bill Bryson
Notes:  This is a collection of columns made into a book, and talks about our highway system, consumerism, politics and culture, and sometimes it delves into the mundane.  If there is one thing that Bryson is good at, it’s observation, and his observations at the now and the past of America is brilliant.
RR: 4/5

Eat to Live, by Joel Furman
Notes:  This diet book was recommended to me, and is a six week vegan food with no booze, caffeine, salt, or fat. (No fat means no olives, nuts, avocados, etc.).  It conflicts other diets, but certainly the focus on vegetables is well taken.  I think for most, this diet is hard to stay on long term.
RR: 4/5

There's a Spiritual Solution to Every Problem, by Wayne Dyer
Notes:  People seem to love or hate Wayne Dyer, and his earlier self help books have morphed into more vague spirituality writings, but this book is short paragraph writings towards short concepts of moving towards a better self.  
RR: 4/5

Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School, by John Medina
Notes: This book was recommended by a friend, and it was both a book and DVD.  While basic if you know anything about the brain’s evolution and various functions, it does have lessons and advice for managing mental tasks, learning, optimizing, and understanding your brain.
RR: 4/5

Get Rich Carefully, by Jim Cramer
Notes: I’m not a huge fan of Cramer’s, but he does have an encyclopedic knowledge of stocks and is obviously successful.  While this is not the best written financial book, it does cover charting, finding growth opportunities, and the advantages of knowing the companies you invest in, and of the buy and hold method.  This is probably right in between being too basic for anyone that knows about stocks already, and too complex for those that prefer to just get into investing in mutual funds and in the market at its most basic.
RR: 4/5

Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology To Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment, by Martin E.P. Seligman
Notes: This book was meant to be interactive, with tests, exercises, and lessons by a world famous researcher and psychologist.  Lessons on how to improve the areas of happiness you can improve are definitely worth the read.

So if you were a writer or artist selling your work in America, you could make enough money from, say freelancing for American newspapers (as Hemmingway did) to live pretty comfortably in France and still have enough time to concentrate on your creative work, which would have been much more difficult back in the States. (Plus have time off for the occassional ski weekend in the Alps or fishing and bullfighting in Spain, etc.) The relative openess/relaxation of European culture about stuff like booze and sex, plus the great art and music scenes in Paris were all additional enticements, for sure, but the main thing was that it was a helluva lot easier on the wallet to be a starving artist in Paris than it was back home. 

Of course, the dollar going so far in Europe at the time also meant you got a lot of rich Americans spending a lot of time abroad during that period as well, buying art, marrying nobels who had their fortunes wrecked during the war, and generally partying it up....you see more of that in Fitzgerald's stuff, since he was a best selling author from a young age and used to run with a fast crowd.

Tyrande is one of the best supports in the game. However she is also one of the hardest supports in the game.

I think it also depends on what your definition of a support is. I think a lot of the average HotS playerbase believes that a support is just a healer. Whilst healing can be useful my belief is that the support isn't just a healbot role, it's a playmaking role. You are an enabler for your team. And different support enable your team mates in different ways.

So yes, Tyrande's healing is very insignificant compared to the likes of Lili but she brings a lot of other things to the table. 

* Global vision and scouting on a low cooldown, which also reveals any targets directly hit by it for a few seconds, such as stealth characters, and when talented can be used for sniping cross map.
* A ranged aoe stun on a low cooldown. 
* A trait that provides 25% damage amplification for 4 seconds on a target, perfect for bursting. AND also reveals targets marked by it, such as stealth characters again.
* Starfall provides your team with high AoE DPS and zone control in a team fight and a small slowing effect. This can also be used for effective waveclearing of overwhelming pushes. Did I forget to mention that the level 20 talented version makes it higher damage and global cast range.
* Shadow Stalk stealths your whole team and reveals the whole enemy team, including stealthed characters. Useful for scouting and ambushes. The talented version also provides movespeed and 100% damage increase on everyone's first autoattack. (Think of a Nova with Anti Armor Shells, as far as I'm aware this makes a 600% damage autoattack)
* Access to most of the strong support only talents in the game such as Protective Shield, Shrink Ray and Storm Shield


In my opinion, Tyrande is the best support for the vision game, which I believe will become a more and more important factor at least in the competitive scene as time goes on. She is also the most versatile support in the game, able to talent herself to deal with a number of situations.

In practise when I'm playing Tyrande I prefer to have another more traditional support on my team. I've found Uther and Lili to be strong pairs, as they make up for the only thing Tyrande really lacks which is healing.

I regularly find myself providing some of the highest hero damage on my team as Tyrande, whilst also scouting and providing vision for my team and regularly catching people with stuns.

**TLDR;** Tyrande is the most versatile support in the game with the highest skillcap, doesn't provide healing, but makes up for it in a multitude of other ways.

I've been thinking recently of trying to make some sort of guide for players wanting to get into playing Tyrande, so if that's something people would actually like to see let me know.

**Edit 1** I'd also just like to add that most of the other Tyrande players I come up against seem to take Shadowstalk 100% of the time over Starfall. I think that a lot of the time this is the wrong choice unless you are primarily in a group with people you know. Shadowstalk requires team co-ordination to use properly and power wise Shadowstalk is actually really quite weak until you have the level 20 talented version, at which point it spikes dramatically and becomes amazing (This is something I think Blizzard need to tweak, making the level 10 ult better and maybe the talented version slightly weaker). When I am solo queueing I tend to favour Starfall unless I see both a Nova and a Zeratul on the enemy team, as Shadowstalk can really ruin those characters days.

Only if they are wanted, not *convicted*. ICC does not try in absenthia; it is contrary to its statute.

&gt;  Whether this would happen in real life is another question since it would be a diplomatic shitstorm of epic proportions, but in theory it could happen.

I think Palestinians made a grave mistake. They have been consistently doing so in the legal landscape. First, their attempts to drag Israeli officials into prosecution have virtually destroyed whatever remnants of universal jurisdiction Europe had; now even arresting somebody from Israel would be very hard. Second, they insulted and annoyed the ICC by not doing even basic homework before applying and it had to tell them off twice. Third, they want to play ball against *Jewish lawyers* - and we have top notch, world class specialists in public international law who consistently win international competitions. Fourth, there is an affirmative defense against international prosecution - and that is credible national investigation. And such investigations are now happening; the existence of a domestic investigation is a statutory bar for international prosecution.

But the dumbest mistake so far is the assumption that they have a leg to stand on. For more than a decade now, IDF has been quietly stockpiling evidence; collection of evidence and its review has become a part of standard operating procedure. Evidence from Marmara, accounts from Gaza wars, interrogations of prisoners: all those things that have been for the most part kept under the rug are sitting there waiting for their day, and if there is ever an actual case in ICC, that evidence would be devastating.

In short, Israel is in an excellent position, Palestinian accusations are fraudulent, and as usual, they will be hurting themselves tenfold over this.

I'd consider my feminism radical, but I'm not sure if I feel comfortable identifying as a ""radical feminist"". I'm also trans so my relationship with radical feminism is a bit strained, though I like their criticisms of porn, prostitution and intercourse (Something I find a bit lacking in contemporary 3rd-wave feminism). 

I'm not against heterosexual sex obviously (an incorrect accusation often thrown at radical feminists), that would be ridiculous, I just don't think patriarchy magically ends in the bedroom with your partner (the same for any other kind of privilege tbh). 

I'm not against sex work either. But most women that can be bought for sex are literal slaves. They are prostituted women, and I am very much against erasing their struggles in favor of a few privileged women who enjoy selling their bodies for money (sex workers).

What I dislike about radical feminism is that it is often very negative of feminine women and femininity in general. Obviously femininity is used by patriarchy as a weapon against women, but I also think some femininity is just natural for some people (why else would feminine men exist?). I'd very much like feminism to attack femininity that is pushed on women but to not attack women for their femininity. 

I don't know if we have similar views at all. I guess its just nice to meet other feminists who are radical who also don't hate me for existing. It's kind of rare to be honest.

 [**Golden Rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden%20Rule): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __Golden Rule__ or __ethic of reciprocity__ is a [maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(philosophy\)),  [ethical code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics) or [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality)  that essentially states either of the following:

&gt;


&gt;* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself (directive form). 

&gt;* One should *not* treat others in ways that one would *not* like to be treated (cautionary form, also known as the [Silver Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Rule)). 

&gt;This concept describes a ""reciprocal"", or ""two-way"", relationship between one's self and others that involves both sides [equally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism), and in a mutual fashion.  

&gt;This concept can be explained from the perspective of psychology, philosophy, sociology and religion. Psychologically, it involves a person [empathizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy) with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor as also an ""I"" or ""self"".   Sociologically, this principle is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups. (For example, a person living by this rule treats all people with consideration, not just members of his or her [in-group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group).) Religions figure prominently in the history of this concept.  

&gt;As a *concept*, the Golden Rule has a history that long predates the [*term*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology) ""Golden Rule"", or ""Golden law"", as it was called from the 1670s in England and Europe.   As a concept of ""the ethic of reciprocity,"" it has its roots in a wide range of world cultures, and is a standard way that different cultures use to resolve conflicts.   It has a long history, and a great number of prominent religious figures and philosophers have restated its reciprocal, ""two-way"" nature in various ways (not limited to the above forms). 

&gt;[Rushworth Kidder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushworth_Kidder) notes that the Golden Rule can be found in the early contributions of [Confucianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule#Confucianism). Kidder notes that this concept's framework appears prominently in many religions, including ""[Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism), [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism), [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism), and the rest of the world's major religions"".  According to [Greg M. Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_M._Epstein), "" 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely.""  [Simon Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Blackburn) also states that the Golden Rule can be ""found in some form in almost every ethical tradition"".  All versions and forms of the proverbial *Golden Rule* have one aspect in common: they all demand that people treat others in a manner in which they themselves would like to be treated.

Enough what?

Let me finish that sentence:

Enough to assuage the guilt of 8 million killed.

I don't care what your excuses are, there were plenty of Germans who didn't join the Nazi party and promote their bullshit. You can justify it how you like, if you did anything to support the Nazis you were a criminal. Saving a thousand isn't enough to silence 8 million ghosts and I'm betting Karl Plagge would be the first to tell you that.

Stop defending him when the man wouldn't even defend himself, he knows what he did stop trying to justify it by posting some imaginary bullshit you just made up, you don't know him or what he did you probably didn't even read the wiki article.

E: Right downvotes because I don't support Nazis, you people are fucking insane. You need to take a trip to holocaust memorials and see what these people actually did. 15-20 million dead in 6 years, it's fucking disgusting that you are defending them.

Not to mention the fact that none of you know *anything* about Karl Plagge or his beliefs, how do you know what point was too far for him? Maybe he was fine with Jews being slaves but just drew the line at exterminating them, maybe he just thought black people should be exterminated? You don't know what kind of sick shit this guy believed so don't be so quick to defend a fucking Nazi, it wasn't that long ago our fathers and grand-fathers were dying in holes in Europe fighting these animals.

2. Yes but you have to pay shitload of taxes. You won't become rich but you won't be struggling to get by either. It will be comfortable so to speak.

3. There is usually less snow the further south you go but they can get serious snow in Spain so south of Sweden or Norway is not exactly snow safe. I'd say a typical winter there will be snow all over both Sweden and Norway. Don't like snow? go inside.

4. You can hold dual citizenship. You won't get a citizenship here right away though, you will probably have to live here for years first. 

5. The only problem I see is the bachelors in computer science. Get a master for fuck sake. No but seriously, no problem at all. You don't even have to speak swedish at all for office-type jobs if you have the right qualifications in my experience. I have several colleagues who speak very little/poor swedish. Speaking Swedish is helpful obviously and employers will likely appreciate if you are trying to learn but I think that has more to do with showing that you are serious about staying here and won't bail on them after 3 months to continue your european road trip.

6. You won't notice you left the US. You don't have to speak swedish to live here, english will get you everywhere.

Since I had no ties to home I took that money and traveled to SEA. I've been here a year and a half now, I have a wonderful job in northern Thailand in a magical town and I'm so happy that I used that money to quit my job and fallow my dreams. 

I also spent the year before leaving, living paycheck to paycheck - I worked two jobs and lived in a small apartment with a roommate - I carpooled and spent weekends at my parents (since that's where my second job was) living with my parents those few days saved on weekend beers. I also played a lot of video games and saw friends rarely. 

By the time I moved abroad I had 5000 in savings - I traveled for two months then settled in Cambodia - I got a job in less than a week and was able to live comfortably and save enough to then travel to South Africa for three weeks and then to move to Thailand. 

It can be done. If you really want it - it's all about prioritizing - you may have to find another job, or look for a less expensive apartment - maybe change your diet and lifestyle. I was lucky to have a small push in my bank - but a lot of the work to get where I am was my own personal budgeting and making my savings last. 

I am by no means wealthy currently. I'm barely surviving in the job that I have - but it's worth it because the place I am now is wonderful and like no where else on earth. I'm currently trying to figure how I can save enough to travel after my two years here - it's going to be difficult, but I'm confident I can make it work. I'm looking forward to moving to Japan or maybe somewhere in Eastern Europe - home is there for me when I want to come back - the world is open to me now.

Now I don't follow. Are you saying that when Ukraine was a soviet satellite there were western influence? Or are you talking about pre-soviet era? And what's your point? That Ukrainian wanted to be independent?  

&gt; What the fuck is that? I can't deny and can't support it, while about your freedom of speech is still limited and all your Western main Medias are controled by the big corparations who control what those medias say, everything else you call controversial and don't give much of credibility. In Russia yes I know it's even worse case, but as not as bad you call it out, we could have been better if West would have not keep their ANti-Russian policies, how should educated minority explain to Majority uneducated in Politics explain that is miss management, all west is doing giving more power to Putin, even though again he is not as bad as West paints him!

True, true. Some of western media houses are owned by the big corporations and we all know that in US the press freedom isn't something that should be looked in awe. BUT, there are independent press houses and major outlets with integrity. And there are things like BBC in UK and YLE in Finland, which are funded by tax payers money, but isn't under the influence of whatever government is currently holding the power. The point is, people here can actually choose. And you know the difference between western and Russian propaganda? We can easily detect bullshit and humiliate that dickbag who tries to put blatant lies in to peoples head. I do admit that in here it's more like what they are not telling or covering instead of plain lies. 

&gt; You are weird, again I will not argue because I see no source from you. Maybe there might have been cases, I am not supporting such rediculus facts which for me sounds very twisted western propoganda. in Ukraine I know for sure Pro-Russians are being pressured and killed in eastern Front, I lost one of my friends who went to pick up his mother. So again, stop twisting some bulshit and talk like an educated person.
&gt; You are over twisting, it is not as bad as you call it. And you can't call free press if your press is coorperating with CIA and other secret services, and besides that what about Edward Snowden, Assange, Bradley and many others that we never heard of probably. Free Press can be called only if no one has control of what they do, why doesn't your free Press cover the Nazis in Ukraine? Why does your free Press totaly ignored the Legit Ukrainian Soldier who gave himself in and revealed who shot down the plane and gave real facts of truth, and Russia never said US shot down the plane, Russia said Ukraine shot down the plane and USA is backing those Ukrainians.

Now read your own text again. Where are your sources? You are claiming that CIA controls the western media. That means everything from USA, Finland, France, Italy, Germany? That should cost shitloads of money and requires that everyone involved would stay silent about it. Quite ridiculous claim, eh? 
And you say you want sources. Well, here you go:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashi_%28youth_movement%29 

The last one is bit on the edge. I think most of these Putin jugends are just ordinary patriotic kids, but you know, there's always some skinheads involved. 
On the other hand, it's the same in Ukraine. You are condemning the whole nation as nazis/fascists by this demonstration. In fact there still seems to be people in Ukraine who wants Stalin era to come back. How retarded is that?

&gt; I am not even Russian, I am Tatar who is studying curently in Vienna, and been in past 10 years already in EUrope.

Then you should know better than saying that western media is all CIA backed propaganda, right?

Edit: And you asked about Manning, Snowden etc. Now I'm seriously doubting that you are a tatar living in Vienna. If you are what you say you are, you should know that majority of Europe is condemning the Snowden case. Assange is wanted by Sweden to answer the rape accusation (which actually might be US government ploy to get him extradited to US). Manning on the other hand made a huge mistake by leaking everything. 
You, especially living in free European country should know that Iraq and Afghanistan is not supported here. But what can we do? Declare war against USA? Ally with Russia or China? The homes of freedom and human rights...

And you can always check my posting history, where I keep bashing US government for the shit they've done.

&gt;The parade traces back to mid-17th-century roots, blending elements from Swedish, Finnish, Irish, English, German, and other European heritages, as well as African heritage.   The parade is related to the [Mummers Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummers_Play) tradition from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  Revivals of this tradition are still celebrated annually in [South Gloucestershire, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshfield,_South_Gloucestershire#The_Mummers_of_Marshfield) on [Boxing Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day) and in parts of Ireland on [St. Stephen's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen%27s_Day) and also in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador around Christmas.

I don't know what exactly you mean by a demand bubble, but asset bubbles tend to drive demand and when they burst that can lead to a demand shortfall. It seems that asset bubbles in turn can be fueled by low interest rates, the typical monetary response to weak demand. I don't know if there is any reason to think that they can be driven by deficit spending, the quintessentially Keyesian response. In any case, both policies should normally be reversed as demand returns to normal levels, before bubbles have a chance to build. This doesn't seem to be the case in the US and Europe these days, with asset bubbles, presumably fueled by low interest rates, rising even while employment and demand are weak. It is as though bubbles are actually necessary now just to keep up enough demand to keep the economy going. This is a big problem (infecting Japan for over 20 years now), and some people blame it on some combination of low interest rates, deficits or quantitative easing. But I haven't read a convincing explanation of how that works, or why we should think that hard money would improve things rather than leading to chronic recession. I'm inclined to go with the secular stagnation explanation, but that doesn't give any easy solutions.

As for long term effects of Keynesian policy on voluntary unemployment, that depends on the (disputed) long term economic effects. Inflation doesn't make much difference if it is expected. Higher taxes could put pressure on retirement, but even though it seems that deficit spending will push up long term tax rates that isn't necessarily the case if it is part of a successful Keynesian intervention. Infrastructure and education spending can lift long term growth, while mitigating a recession can avoid atrophy of work force skills and other economic damage.

What does all of this lead to?

Well their emotions become dulled. They try not to get too close to people. They prefer not to form strong attachments.

So, what is your solution?

You just need to confront her man. However, you need to do it in a calm and conversational manner. You need to tell her that you want to define what the relationship means to her. You also need to define the future of the relationship.

Do not make this overly emotional or cringey.

How so? Selling gold reserves at their lowest point in decades? PPI's, huge amount of wasteful spending?

Totally agree with you here, it stemmed from policies written in the 80's and 90's by the Tories, but Blair/Brown had 10 years in power and did nothing to prepare for or prevent the crash - and actually enhanced the risk.

&gt; Their level of public spending before the crash, while in my opinion wasteful at times, was eminently sustainable.

Possibly, but during prosperity, you save and pay back national debt, during recessions, you invest. Labour spent spent and spent more.

Quite a few times obstacle after obstacle was thrown in front of the team, fans, and city by MLS. Seemed like a never ending ""You guys are doing great, but now you need to______ to get a MLS franchise."" Countless people worked hard to get this team where it is. I know quite a few elected officials were bombarded by phone calls. During this time NYCFC was awarded the 20th expansion team meeting NONE of the requirements that OCSC had to achieve. Then it looked like we were going to be sidelined by Miami and Atlanta for a team. All that aside here we are weeks away from our first MLS game. The resentment may still linger, but we're at the point where we just want to roll the balls out and play. We're ready to back up our 4 years of declarations and show it on the field.

For NYCFC my problem lies within the disrespect the City Football Group has shown the market of New York City. I am a natural born son of Philadelphia so I have preexisting issues with New York City in my ""irrational"" sports fanaticism. However, I have nothing but respect for the New York sports market. I'm a huge basketball fan and if someone were to ever put a NBA team in London, Manchester, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Milan, Berlin, or Munich... I would expect them to go all out and deliver a team that respects their markets and the sport in general. I really wish the New York Yankees would have just taken on this team on their own.

My analysis is pretty accurate to 95%, Russia is not seeking any war with anyone, and Russia is profiting way more beyond with having Finland independent rather than occupied by Russia, and Putin is modern thinker, I watched every his conference and might sound to you unreal but he is man of his word at most cases.

It's just that as a system, it'll entrench involuntary unemployment and low growth. It can only work so long as you're the ""most competitive"" in the region and the problem is, there'll always be those that are less. And it'll only be ""working for you"" so much as you'll be bankrupting your neighbours via draining them of Euros.

It's all just too reminiscent of the gold standard. There, although money was convertible, countries tried to keep their current accounts in check via tariffs/export subsidies/quotas/etc - mercantilism. It fails hard in aggregate of course - your neighbours do the same, not everyone can export more than they import, etc.

Under the Euro, free trade prohibits the above mess. So instead we're told the answer is to be ""the most competitive"". To deregulate, to have the most flexible labour markets, etc. This too fails hard in aggregate - in general, if your solution is to export more than you're importing (and for the ""successful"" nations in the Euro, it most certainly is), it can't work for all. But I personally think they'll keep on flogging that horse for a while yet.

Problem is, because any real solution requires politicians to admit they were wrong, that the system was flawed, their remedies ineffective and the suffering was not really necessary etc.. well. It's going to take a lot of time, no matter how it plays out.

As for what *should* happen - either a govt needs to form at the currency issuing level capable of running deficits and transfers, just like in the US (with sentiment at the moment, somewhere near 0% chance of that), *or* they need to return to individual free floating currencies - something Europe hasn't had for a long time. Problem there is that there is no exit strategy for the Euro. It was never conceived anyone should want to, let alone (imo) that they all should. What do you do with existing Euro denominated debt?

So here's my plea to my fellow craft beer enthusiasts: **Give it a rest**. Let's talk about the differences between wild and cultivated lab yeast, and the weird and wonderful flavors that are created when brewers start scouring nearby trees or flowers or even their own beards for new strains. Let's geek out about local, craft-malted barley and how it compares to traditional imported European malts. And let's start preaching a new word: **Craft beer isn't always bitter**. Who knows? Maybe we'll finally win over some of those Bud Light fans.

(Emphasis mine). First off, the title of the article is much more inflammatory than the content of the article (good marketing I suppose). But her summation at the end is exactly my problem. I really do not believe that creating less IPAs would even the playing field. Reduce one style of beer, and another rises to the top, then we'd have an article saying, ""Some people don't like coffee and chocolate, so STOP MAKING STOUTS BECAUSE IT'S ALIENATING PEOPLE!"" Something's gotta be at the top, and it makes sense that it would be easy to make, cheap, and antithetical to the macro light pils most people are accustomed with.

And the audacity to say beer enthusiasts don't already preach the sentiment ""craft beer isn't always bitter"" is ridonkulous. I routinely say that to people as they tend to conflate Budweiser and Miller with beer. Giving someone like that a beer from South Tier's Blackwater Series (Creme Brulee, Choklat, etc.) or Boulevard's Smokestack Series (Saison Brett, Love Child, BA Quad, etc.) is a great way to expand their horizons, which is what I think enjoying craft beer is all about. 

Pushing away one style with the goal of increasing others is the wrong way to go, and doesn't match up with the fact that many of those styles exist and are available in most parts of the U.S.

While Xin's spear looks like a jabbing weapon, he uses it very similar to a Guan Dao (THANK YOU by the way, it's been on the tip of my tongue for SO LONG), making slashes and jabs (checked his spotlight just o be sure, his AA animation is actually very much like that) instead of just jabs like a classic spear.

So technically, he doesn't fail as a spearman, perhaps an European one, but not a Chinese one. The Chinese Guan Dao's are surprisingly short ranged, while being able to make outward jabs, they are very unstable when reaching the length of a nodachi.

And trust me, nodachi's are long, often longer than their wielder. That doesn't mean they are unwieldable, but were rather used on horseback or on the ground to take down horse riders. And again, two-handed spears, especially the Chinese/Japanese ones, have a noticeably shorter range than European spears, as they were used as much for slashing and cutting as jabbing,

That being the examples you give outline the underlying cultural issues that lead to economic inequality. Economics is a numbers game, economic inequality is a product of a collection of cultural issues.  

Sidenote: economic inequality is also inevitable in all economies(yes even communism), human nature and the will to better one's life will not allow for economic inequality to ever go away. It can however get better.  

&gt; Police brutality has proven to be among the most effective wedge issues keeping desperate black and Hispanic Americans from solidarity with slightly less desperate white Americans  

I would have to disagree with you that this has anything to do with income inequality. The militarization of the police force, the US vs THEM mentality, and the lack of accountability are the main causes of police brutality. All of which can be traced to the cultural issue of disliking, misjudging, and mistreating those that are different( The same thinking that leads to economic inequality).  

&gt; Gun control has repeatedly been blocked by desperate white Americans voting in the Tea Party, by mistrust of the government, and, as Obama pointed out in 2008, clinging to firearm ownership as one of their few sources of power. At the same time, highly-armed but equal societies like Switzerland and Iceland have far less gun violence (and non-gun violence) than the US  

I am not sure how you are connecting this to income inequality. Gun control is a very politicized issue that doesn't address the real problem with guns in America. Why are people in America killing each other more often than in other western countries? Income inequality is not an answer to that question. The hate in the country for those who are different does.  
(The Switzerland/Iceland argument is also rather irrelevant in general  considering the countries have a COMBINED population of around 8.4 million people with far less diversity than the USA).  

&gt; Education reform is futile when 20-30% of the American population is struggling to make ends meet and 70%+ are one unlucky break or bad decision away from misery. At the same time, many Americans are not seeing any return in education and are taking out tens of thousands in student loans only to work at Starbucks or McDonald's.

That is a very good point, and the education system in the US is very flawed. However fixing income inequality will do nothing to fix the school systems. Fixing the school systems, and reducing student debt will help close the wage gap and ease the income inequality. Also, with the growing technology in the country, education in high schools will (hopefully) get better and the idea that people MUST go to college or they are not smart/job capable will dissipate. Which will also ease the wage gap.  

&gt; American football will forever retain a steady pipeline of recruits so long as poor blacks, Hispanics, and rural folk see no path to college or wealth other than combat sports. Many parts of the US see gridiron football as their main lifeline and source of charity and economic activity.  

Football will retain plenty of recruits no matter what. Especially if we continue to pay athletes millions upon millions of dollars to play. If a rich white kid is an all star football player, they will get recruited, go to college, play, and make millions in the NFL. If a poor white kid is a good football player they will get recruited, go to college, play, and make millions in the NFL. The same goes with black white brown green red yellow blue and orange. The NFL, and football in general, is a ruthless game that idolizes the great players and chews up and spits out the bad. That is the culture of football. If you want to fix the culture of football, then change football, Income inequality will have no effect on football as long as there is money to be made every step of the way.  

&gt;Europe has long been spared the extremes of capitalism in the American style; however, the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in parties left, right, and center in countries with credit ratings from AAA to junk making cuts in government programs and benefits that would have been political suicide just one decade earlier.  

You completely gloss over the fact that the European economy has been falling apart. Their economic systems aren't a model of success. The European system has its flaws and benefits. The flaws cause the inequality, just like in the US. The ""Americanization"" of politics(bi-partisan extremists etc.) has been going on for years in the UK long before it was an ""American"" type of politics. Also, Europe has about 740 million people in it, which is spread out over approx. 50 countries and territories. The US has 400 million people with ONE central government. The economic scope of comparing European countries with the US is very difficult, and skews a lot of the data on a qualitative level.  The political system that is now known to be the American way, does heavily reinforce the cultural divide that produces the economic inequality.  

Lastly, you point involving Israel. The Israel - Palestine conflict has been going on since the early 60's (and before that even). I wouldn't really call that a distraction. The conflict is an extremely important cultural battle that has been raging for years globally. Yes the conflict is distracting many from the economic income problems, but to say that the conflict can be solved with economic equality makes no sense. The entire conflict is entirely cultural. In terms of ISIS, I am not sure how that pertains to your argument.  

Essentially what I am saying is that you are putting too much CULTURAL weight on Economic Inequality, when it is the culture itself that causes the inequality. Resolve the cultural issues first to ease the inequality.

Rather, I don't think true or false, or objective right or wrong, play into it at all, any more than it might be objectively true or false to say that Shakespeare was the greatest writer in the English language (or, as I suggested in a previous comment, that Beethoven was superior to Schubert). And while I happen to believe that Shakespeare *was* the greatest (and that Beethoven surpassed Schubert), I also doubt the possibility of articulating that belief in a way that surpasses mere argumentation. These are not statements of fact, but positions of advocacy, true if they are persuasive, and truer if they are persuasive to more people. And there I think it's helpful to think of ""true"" in the more practical sense of alignment, rather than in the abstract sense of correspondence with reality. (There is no underlying reality of ideal English writing, of ideal European music in the early 19th century, for example.)

In that vein, I think your argument that trinitarian doctrine is most *faithful* to biblical and early Christian ideas is a strong one: what is faithful or well-aligned to source is true to source. But ""faithful"" also imports a standard of alignment that is extrinsic to the doctrine itself (just as ""greatest"" imports a standard extrinsic to the works of Shakespeare, Beethoven, or Schubert, in my examples above), and I suspect that different people had and have different ideas about what it means to be faithful to their traditions. It's the maintenance of such a standard, rather than the contents of the doctrine itself, that seems to bear more, in my view, on Christian *identification*. From my perspective, anyone who presents with an identification of ""Christian"" and a belief that his or her practice and theology are faithful or true to whatever relevant precedent sources (e.g., the Bible, early Christianity, etc.), well, then he or she is a Christian. From other perspectives, however, namely the ones that I would recognize as ""Christian"" (like, I assume, yours), I wonder whether the same would hold. And that's all the wondering I meant to suggest by my (clumsily presented) earlier comment about whether believers without a particular formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity would still be ""Christian."" Thanks for pressing, and prompting further reflection.

It seems to me that you're saying believers before Nicaea were Christian even though they lacked the particular formulation of trinitarian doctrine possessed by believers after Nicaea, but that later believers who rejected that formulation were not, because they were rejecting the most faithful development of the earlier precedents. That's not unreasonable, and I can understand the perspective in which that would be true; but I don't think it's true from all perspectives. And I am similarly skeptical of all human identifications (e.g., ""European,"" ""atheist,"" ""Buddhist,"" ""moral realist,"" etc.); it's one thing to sort ourselves in a moment, or relative to each other in a particular context, but quite another to sort ourselves into categories intended to be universal and persistent over time.",False,cncafze,,0,ametakinetos,False,t3_2qxuk0,t1_cncafze

At best we're known as ""that city we drive through on the way to New York"" to most New Englanders, and many people outside Southeastern New England aren't familiar with Providence at all.

Similarly sized cities like Austin manage to have their own identity which isn't overshadowed by their larger neighbors (in the case of Austin that's San Antonio and Houston, in our case it's Boston and New York City) and be recognized not just by Americans, but foreigners as well. If you go to Europe, people will be able to tell you where Austin is and kind of what it's all about. If you go to Southern New Hampshire, you'll be hard-pressed to find many people who can tell you anything about Providence.

This whole idea of yours that Providence doing *city things* like allowing people to park their cars on the street overnight or allowing bars to stay open past 1am is *selling out* or *appeasing hedonistic pursuits* is pretty much what's wrong with Providence. It's not about generating a few easy bucks, it's about making Providence somewhere exciting to live, work, and visit on a daily basis. As it stands, Providence really only bustles like a city on Waterfire nights or occasionally when a big enough event is going on at the Dunk... the rest of the time it's pretty much just dead.

I covered this in my initial comment: the potential for abuse does not imply the presence of abuse. If the fact that men occupy positions of power is to be an iaauw it has to be so on the basis of unjust treatment, not simply as an implied but unsupported consequence of it being so. That would be begging the question.

&gt; These strict gender roles developed for whatever reasons, perhaps they were useful in our younger iterations, and it is because of these roles that power was passed to men

In that case I refer back to what I pointed out: it is a complete misnomer, as the simple fact that men hold political power does not inherently cause injustice. Patriarchy simply means a system wherein men hold political power, i.e. a system where heredity runs strictly on male lineage. Such a system is not inherently unjust any more than a dictatorship is.

&gt;Unless you want to argue this is biological (which I would argue it is not), then this imbalance can be attributed to a patriarchal culture that has historically valued men over women.

It's plain to see that is *is* biologically rooted, simply because everything is. After all, a culture doesn't emerge in a vacuum, and cultures separated by **vast** distances and timescales overwhelmingly came up with the same, then truly patriarchal system from China to Europe to America. You can say that it's cultural, but that just shifts the focus: whence does cultural bias come from, if not biology?

Not to mention the fact that social non-human animals have the same sort of divisions, right down to insects. If sex can affect your body in an untold number of ways why can't it affect your brain and *ipso facto* your behaviour?

Now this, of course, is entirely beside the point. We are predisposed to a large variety of things because of biology, but that doesn't mean we're slaves to it, it would however be foolish to disregard it entirely, as even minute biological differences can have seemingly large effects when extrapolated to 7 billion individuals. We can't simply discard the possibility that males and females may very well be unequal in terms of their, say, political ambitions, simply because it's inconvenient for it to be so.

&gt;Elitism and racism are also constructs of the patriarchy.

Oh come off it. Race relations and gender relations are **completely** unrelated. You might as well chalk up the Marxist political (class) struggle to this nebulous ""patriarchy"" but more and more it seems you are expanding the term to mean ""all bad things ever"". Incidentally, I hope this makes it pretty plain why people treat patriarchy theory as the man-hating it truly is: you essentially just wrote up every ill in the world to a simple, innocent system of heredity.

&gt;Look into Third Wave feminism and Intersectionality to see how feminism has worked on including other minorities into the fold.

Those two are both excellent examples of a fading ideology rapidly running out of things to be outraged about scrambling to co-opt the struggles of other, unrelated groups in a desperate bid to stay relevant. Middle class white women had to choose between further feeding their white man's burden or acknowledging their privilege, and as they say, people very much want to feel hard done by. So ""allies"" they became, because lord knows you can't let a good brand just die once it's served its purpose.

&gt;Um, what?

Pardon, in all the re-writing I garbled that sentence. It was supposed to read:

&gt;Of course the elephant in the room is that women inherently seem to relate better to men than **men** relate to women.

The rest came out as intended.

&gt;Why would this make any sense if not for a patriarchy? If women are able to relate to a man's story, why couldn't a man relate to a woman's story?

Because, surprise surprise, men and women aren't identical. Seriously, it's the most obvious explanation to everything: men and women are *different*. Occam's Razor.",False,cncbrrx,,1,TheMauveHand,False,t3_2r1qfw,t1_cncbrrx

Plus, you're overlooking the fact that the two-sentence version of how Rome actually fell would have it falling to those very Germanic tribes who nominally followed it.

It's more accurate to say that in the Germanic-controlled parts of Europe, a sort of feudal system already prevailed, with people owing allegiance to local lords who owed it to ceremonial kings, many of whom swore oaths to Rome and became part of its empire. As the power of that empire waned, the kings derived legitimacy through local succession rather than through the once-mighty empire, though they still also paid lip service to the notion that they were Imperial subjects. After the fall of the city of Rome, the title of Roman Emperor (in the west) continued for a little while, with different Germanic tribes fighting for it, but in time it stopped being relevant at all. The same proto-feudalism continued, without any empire or any relevant rank higher than that of king.

In the Mediterranean, the Eastern Roman Empire then started doing a pretty good job of retaking a lot of the former empire to the west, including most of Italy, before being undone by the Plague of Justinian in the mid 6th century. What was left of their westward expansion was governed out of Ravenna, but still included the city of Rome.

Fast-forward from there about 150 years. Arguably, the Holy Roman Empire was established in the 720s, it just didn't have that name yet. That's approximately when Charles Martel unified the ""Stem Duchies"" under one king (Theuderic IV) to rule both the historical Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria along with Bavaria, Alemannia, and Saxony, as well as bringing Aquitaine and Burgundy under nominal Frankish rule.

Note that the kings' hold on these possessions as ceremonial rulers to whom the locals pay homage is pretty solid, but by Martel's day the Frankish kings had almost no real-world power, which rested instead with the Mayors of the Palace, a hereditary title that had originally meant something like ""prime minister"" but turned into ""dictator, and king in all but name."" (Charles Martel was, himself, Mayor of the Palace; the dynasty he founded is known as the Carolingians.) When Theuderic died, Martel didn't even bother propping up a new king, and the Franks went through a brief interregnum.

Charles was succeeded by his two sons, Pippin the Short as Mayor of the Palace of Neustria and Carloman as Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, who together propped up King Childeric III. Childeric's ceremonial realm included both Neustria and Austrasia, but that's kind of like how Queen Elizabeth is the head of state in both Canada and Australia. The two were also political rivals, and Pippin deposed Carloman, sending him to a monastery while Pippin assumed the reins of power throughout the Frankish realm, also bringing the Dukes under a little bit more of his control than previously.

Meanwhile, the Lombards had conquered Ravenna and toppled Byzantine Italy, and were marching on Rome. The Pope called upon the Franks for aid. While they were working on this problem, Pippin sent Pope Zachary a letter asking him whether it is proper for the King of the Franks to have the royal title but not the power that should go along with it; Zachary took the hint, answered that it is unnatural and improper, and once Pippin's armies dealt with the threat to Rome, he crowned Pippin the King of the Franks. Pippin thanked him with the Donation of Pippin, which is where he more or less conquered Rome himself and gave it and the surrounding lands to the papacy. (This would later become the Papal States, which you'll hear about a lot in medieval and early modern Italian studies.) This broke the Papacy's dependence on the Emperor, who formerly had the right to confirm or reject anyone elected to the office of Pope.

Asserting this authority by giving Pippin a crown also enhanced Zachary's own legitimacy as an independent power, both because it meant that he was no longer an Imperial puppet and because it showed that despite Pippin having given him his land, even Pippin would kneel before him for a crown. Mostly, though, the authority to do it came from the fact that Pippin needed it to be there so he could depose Childeric, and the Carolingian empire was the superpower of western Europe at the time; the Pope power over the Frankish throne because the new king said he did, and this was recognized by others, but surely would have gone away the minute he went against his ""subject.""

Pippin's successor in this title was his eldest son, Carl (Charles), better known as Charlemagne. Charlemagne ruled an empire in all but name, established in that form by his grandfather, Charles Martel, and worked to expand its borders and to solidify royal control over the various duchies. Part of how he did that was with an even closer alliance with the Church.

Primarily, lack of competition (which I never said wasn't a problem): it's even more expensive to get into the game in major metro area than it is in a rural area, but the payoff is more than proportionally larger BECAUSE of the density of customers.

Also, in major metro areas, you'll notice that prices are often (though there are occasional  exceptions) much less extortionate because there *is* often competition, if somewhat limited due to the regulatory climate.

The reason internet access is expensive isn't JUST ONE THING.  Just because lack of population density is a big deal (and it really is an enormous deal here in the US) doesn't mean it's the only thing.

I guarantee that if you reduced the restrictions on competition and allowed more of it -- you'd see prices closer to what we see in Asia and parts of the EU... but **only in large metro areas**, and prices outside them would still be higher than in places like Busan or Yokohama (and very significantly so).

We need more competition, we need fewer artificial monopolies and more customer choice - but having those things would still mean internet is more expensive (on the average) in the US than in Japan or Korea or what have you.

We need to reduce limits on competition, but you need to also understand that population density is **directly** tied into the economic realities of providing network access; that's going to be true regardless of how much competition there is.

If you live in rural Wyoming, you're never going to get gigabit fiber for the same price you'll get it in Manhattan, even with practically unlimited competition, because reaching 1000 people in a major city may require less than 1% the infrastructure investment that reaching 1000 people requires where homes may be a mile or more apart.",False,cncdg46,,1,kymri,False,t3_2r1gl4,t1_cncdg46

I think you hit the nail in the head with this.

Whenever I hear that shit of guys being desperate for sex... I no longer believe that. They're not really craving sex; they crave female validation. For them, the fact that they have sex is their way to say to the rest of the women ""hey, look! I can have sex, therefore I'm a worthy man!"" 

A lot of men nowadays fail to realize that their worth as men is not defined by the number of women that they fuck. If all they wanted is sex they would pay prostitutes. Of course, they say that paying for it is not manly and that it's like cheating. Others would say that they don't want to engage in a obscure and immoral habit (despite the well-known fact that over here the vast majority of sex workers are doing it on their own volition and in safe conditions). I recently read Chester Brown's comic ""Paying for it"". It's a nice insight about how the absurd and groundless expectations between men and women fuck up what in other circumstances would have been fullfilling relationships, sexual or not.

&gt; On the other hand, there are women that were fed the ""every girl's a princess,"" message and look for a man to treat them like they're special. A huge concern for them is to be attractive, to matter, and to have attention.

This is very frequent over here. A lot of women believe that they're entitled to anything they want and demand everything from men. The problem is, men are so desperate for female approval that they indulge! They never stop to think ""what's in for me?""

 &gt; Tv shows and stuff make it seem like there's some special way for women to talk to men and for men to talk to women, and each side makes up total bullshit when they're just people. Men and women can generally communicate well on a casual level.

Yeah, a whole generation has been brainwashed into believeing that women don't want sex and that men don't have emotional needs. Worse yet, the belief that we're radically different when deep down we just want the same things. 

I don't like to express the following thoughts very often because I admit that they sound a little paranoid, but after seeing how much profit is obtained from people's suffering (drugs, therapists, self-help books, lawyers, judges, etc.) and how polarized men and women issues are nowadays, can't help to think that media and pop culture have a much deeper and disturbing agenda that it seems to have at first...

In short, men and women getting along well and having fullfilling relationships with or without sex is not profitable.

&gt; But there are so many demographics and stuff mixed where I live that it's pretty normal to talk to someone different from you.
&gt;There's so much variation it's kind of hard to tell what the general trend is.

Interesting. Do those cultures mix up well over there? That may explain why gender wars don't happen, I think.

There are different ethnics living on here too (Moroccan people, latin americans, asians, eastern europeans...)

Culture may determine the style of facial hair but not whether facial hair is attractive. My hypothesis is based on the authors' points that novelty is desired. Therefore, males will notice when females are selecting the facial novelty and will attempt to adapt so as to increase the likelihood of sexual selection. However once a majority of males are signaling in the same manner, a new novelty is created and becomes the target for sexual selection. In other words, the cultural facial grooming fashion is a result of sexual selection and not the director of how sexual selection occurs. I think the best way to test this is to use pictures of people with different facial hair growth from different societies (ie Western European and East Asian) and expose the pictures to test subjects of different societal backgrounds. In addition use a control group that is exposed to cognitive load while observing the pictures. Also, test whether males feel pressure to grow facial hair or shave based on female preference. I'm sure there is more to this, but I think it will show that the cultural facial grooming fashions are derived from sexual selection and not the other way around as what I understand the authors are stating is their conclusion.

The hood leading edge has dropped over time and now seems to merge with the bumper rather than appear as a distinct design element in many vehicles.  
The back of the hood, near the window, has seen a higher trend so the pedestrian doesn't ""flip"" so much.  
http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2007/12/the-truth-about-europes-pedestrian-safety-legislation/
&gt;To comply with the EU requirements, automakers are already adapting the design of their cars’ fronts— ground zero for pedestrian fatalities. Obviously, a smooth, soft front end is the way forward. That's why the styling of many European cars (e.g. Jaguar’s new XK) has already been changed, with higher, more easily deformable hoods. Much can be achieved by attention to details, within a comprehensive testing procedure.  
...  
European automakers are already taking the next step: hoods with active safety devices that “pop up” the hood to reduce the severity of an impact with a pedestrian's head. Euro-NCAP crash tests have awarded the new Citroen C6 and Jaguar XK four out of five stars for pedestrian protection. Both models were the first to be equipped with “active hoods.” Sweden's Autoliv AB is developing hood airbags to make even inherently dangerous SUVs more pedestrian-friendly.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/13/pedestrian-safety-is-key-for-mercedes/  
&gt;Mercedes has jumped the gun and introduced the first of its pedestrian safety innovations in the S-Class. That flagship sedan now has a hood with an underside that deforms to absorb impact energy if the car hits a pedestrian.  
It enlarged the deformation space beneath the hood that’s 0.87 inches higher than the preceding model. At the same time, engineers lowered the engine, shock absorber towers and other under hood equipment by up to 0.51 inches.  
Mercedes engineers give the GLK similar injury-mitigating capability. For instance, the GLK has a fairly high hood that creates a crumple zone designed to cushion a pedestrian’s head and upper body if struck by the vehicle.  
The 2-inch crumple zone is engineered into the hood to absorb energy that would otherwise be transmitted to pedestrians. The high hood position helps prevent reservoirs, control units and the wiper assembly from striking the a pedestrian.

http://www.cardesignonline.com/safety/pedestrian-safety.php  
&gt;There is some difference of opinion on bonnet leading-edge height.  
Some sources state that anything above 650mm in height is undesirable where other point out that “making the hood edge height higher is effective in lowering the vehicle-head collision speed”. It is noted though, that “if the edge of the hood is too high, it might be dangerous for children because their heads might be directly hit by the front of the car”.  
They chose 800mm as a suitable height as it is lower than the head of a 3 year old child.  
There is no defining conclusion on the subject of leading edge height; it makes more sense to look at reducing hard points, improving controlled plastic deformation to absorb energy and stiffening lower bumper structure to minimise leg injury.",False,cncf1im,,1,WillyPete,False,t3_2r15hz,t1_cncf1im

They left great monuments, beautiful art, and many are still found living in the areas they lived in before colonization.

When the Europeans arrived (mostly Spanish/ Portuguese) anywhere there was a native population saw the most action.  The Spanish interacted the most with the largest empires, and took everything they could from them; especially gold.  The Portuguese were relegated mostly to the area now known as Brazil (Catholic church related story to this).  The native population was scant; so they started up with slave trading.  
The Spanish got the most use in history from their horses, dogs, iron weapons, and armor -- technology heretofore not widely used in the Americas.  They also employed a very clever strategy to ""divide and conquer"" the native empires.  Now, these empires weren't all sweet and candy, they had to conquer, tax, and kill to attain empire status, making a ton of enemies in the process.  The Spanish exploited this weakness, and used smaller States as allies in attacks, etc.

* If the engine is running does it behave differently? It would be nice to have it work as a parking sensor too, but drawing attention to yourself while parking is the last thing on most people's minds.

* Any thoughts on a camera plugin at some point in the future? Triggering a camera if a car gets too close, or especially if the car is bumped could be useful.

* Any plans for other shapes? Although the design works well for US cars, it doesn't fit the shape of European license plates.

* What are the logistics for tapping into the existing lights? Half the point of this product is to avoid modifying the bumpers, but then LED bars are going to be placed around the car. It would be good to tap into the indicator or brake lights and use those as they're already well placed for other drivers to spot them. Since indicators are already used in many alarm systems I imagine this is feasible...but may well be vehicle specific, unless they can be controlled through an OBD-II I imagine this is a no-go.

The problem is, people attempt, and often with only a sophmoric understanding of ""institutional racism"" or ""interpersonal racism"", in the academic sense, and a fundamental misapplication of the term.  
Foucault, being French, and living in post colonial France, and post second World War Europe, very much understood the difference. You know, he saw the oppression of black people from French and former French colonies, he saw the NSDAP rise to power in German and quite probably the most institutionally racist regime on the planet, he also saw the treatment of Germans in the lands conquered by the Soviet Union.  
  
When Foucault wrote and spoke of ""Black people"", it wasn't an objective statement ""Black people can't be racist,"" it was a statement of ""Black people, in my society, are the Other, they are the ones excluded from the power structure,"" or ""Women, in my society, are the Other, they are the ones excluded from the power structure,"" and the reason for the exclusion is prejudice. The combination of the prejudice and the systemic exclusion creates racism, or, as we have already defined, *institutional* racism.  
  
Now, people have begun to take that concept from Foucault and twist it beyond its original meaning, to the point that some claim that a minority cannot be *ist to the majority. While in the academic sense, on the scale of *society as a whole* that is true, it also happens to be true in smaller groups - not just the Culture, or the State, or in Business, but also in the Community. But, people tend to overlook that - either through a misunderstanding, or through an attempt to corrupt the conversation and push an objective - and tend to use an oversimplified definition of ""$Other cannot be $ist"" (Black people can't be racist; Women can't be sexist; Gay people can't be heterphobic; et cetera). But, that's not the case, as you said:  

&gt; I have seen the white and asians bullied when I went to a majority black school.  
    
In that community, while the nation at large may have drastically different demographics, or the State may be inherently racist, the power structure and demographics of your high school were such that the white kid and the asian kid were the Other. If someone were to point out that is *racist*, along comes a group of people holding the banner of the those who think themselves the Leninist Professional Revolutionary but act more according to those who could best be described as the Professionally Offended to cry fowl, to say that ""Black people can't be racist! They can only be prejudiced!""  
Well, as I have said, that is not (in either sense):  
(1) The black kids were the ones in the community with the power to exclude and exercising it, thus they are being prejudiced + empowered - i.e. Focault's racism, or as we called it institutionally racist.  
(2) The black kids were being prejudiced, though in the greater community, the nation or the state, they are the Other they are generally powerless, and the white kid in the greater community is part of the power structure. In which case, as you say, they are being interpersonally racist.  
  
So, the problem with the usage of the word racism occurs, *not* because Academics do not understand the difference, or even those not on the ivory towers won't understand the difference if explained, it's that there is a group who attempt to make the claim   

&gt;it's only racist if WHITE people do it.

In January and February the warm-up races are run across the globe. These are not that important but good to get an idea of how certain riders got through the winter. 

In March things really get going. You have 2 stage races at the beginning of that month (Paris-Nice and Tirreno) which are very good and prestigious. They also serve as warm-up races for the first monument of the season, Milan - Sanremo. That's a big one.

After that the peloton spreads across ~~Europe~~ the World. The climbers and most Ardennes guys go to Spain for races like Catalunya and Basque Country. Although these are (again) pretty much warm-up races they can be very good even though nobody should be in top shape there yet (well maybe in Basque, which is a great race).

The other part of the peloton goes to Belgium for the best part of the season: the cobbled classics. Lots of one day races and a short warm-up stage race lead to Vlaanderen and Roubaix. These are the 2 biggest prizes for the cobbled guys (and in general). Some of these specialists pretty much fade away after these races. 

Then we go to the Ardennes! Big races here are Amstel Gold Race, Fleche Wallone and of course Liege. All those guys warming up in Spain want just one thing: Liege. The other 2 are also prestigious but have become glorified uphill sprints more or less. But Liege is the 4th monument and usually a good race (this year was horrible though) on a pretty much perfect parcours.

When that dust is settled we move into GT season (I think an American rider once called classics season the 4th GT, which is an interesting point of view): Giro in May, strength testing in the Dauphine and Suisse in June, TDF in July. 

After that it gets a bit off. August is packed with racing but everyone is already looking forward to either the Vuelta or the Worlds, which together with Lombardia make the end of the season.

Just get used to seeing different guys in different types of races.

The term you are looking for is called ""the invention of privacy.""

The works and research in this field is somewhat obscure and highly complicated. The most important book, *La Vie du privee--The History of Private Life*--is nearly four volumes long. The other major (recent) work by McKeon is about 1000 pages and very difficult to read as a layman (or even as an expert...) and is called *The Secret History of Domesticity*

Prior to the sixteenth century in most of Europe, and well into the seventeenth century, there was no particular reaction, positive or negative about semipublic sex, nudity or sexual organs. These things were common, from what we know of surviving records in London, Paris, Florence, Venice, Milan, and other city records. For example, there were Cock and Hen bars in London, which would be equivalent to a singles bar today. In these clubs, what we would call nonpenatrative sex was on more or less public display, and indeed, it was common to see it in the streets as well. 

Part of the reason for that is because there was no police force to enforce public decorum as we have today. And even if they were, they would not necessarily have had the authority to do anything about public lewdness, drunkenness, or other misbehavior as we would see it. In fact, it took nearly a half-century after the establishment of the Metropolitan Police in London for them to feel as if they had sufficient authority to punish morality offenders (see the numerous King and Queen declarations on this, esp. Victoria's relation with the Police).

The larger part of it, however, had to do with 'the invention of privacy.' What I mean by that is that in the late middle ages and early renaissance, it was quite common for households to be one room, and in particular, to have one shared bed for the entire family. This meant that children would be in bed and in all probability witness or be aware of their parents making their siblings. Here's Ian Moulton:

&gt;[Over the course of the seventeenth century] Bedchambers-and the beds themselves-slowly shifted from being common living areas (in lower-class homes) or sites for social gatherings (in upper-class ones) to being what they are today-private space for the single person or couple who sleep in them. Reading became dominantly private and silent rather than spoken and communal.

The shift happened because of two major reasons. The first is that building material became much cheaper and architectural knowledge became much more common, allowing the creation of multiple rooms, better heating, and what is termed 'the creation of the upstairs.'

The second reason is a little more complicated, and stems, essentially, from the Protestant Revolution touched off by Martin Luther.

Between 1100-1300 the Catholic Church tried to discourage concubinage and loose moral standards among the upper and lower classes, with greater or lesser success. In fact, it became one of their central concerns: surviving records of English Church courts indicate that sexual and marital cases made up for between 60-90% of all litigation. Although this was successful in many places, one of the places it was notably *unsuccessful* was in Rome, the capital of the Church and the center of the Christian world. This is something that was frequently satirized and mocked by humanist reformers such as Boccaccio and, of course, Aretino.

As Dabhoiwala notes in her Origins of Sex:

&gt;Sex was central to the Reformation’s reshaping of the world. To Protestant eyes the Catholic church’s whole attitude to sexual morality seemed pathetically lax and dishonest. Its priests were lecherous parasites: the ideal of clerical celibacy was no more than a joke. [Church] courts were not nearly fierce enough in pursing sexual offender and punishing their moral sins… Particularly scandalous was the toleration [and regulation] of prostitution. 

Indeed, Dabhoiwala continues: “[Luther and other] protestants advanced a purer, more rigorous morality. The Catholic aspiration to celibacy was jettisoned as unrealistic and counter-productive… On the other hands, God’s many pronouncements against whoredom were to be taken even more seriously: all sex outside marriage should be severely punished.”

So, the general public did not really care one way or another about public display of private organs or sex. The Church did, but was not able to control the laity, thus helping Luther in his crusade and helping to create a sense of privacy in protestant culture. Look to my quotes from McKeon [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2ebapq/when_how_and_why_did_the_view_on_nudity_and/cjxz33y) to understand more on that topic.


That covers the Protestants, but what about the Catholic reaction and Counter Reformation?

Envoys at the Council of Trent pointed out that some of Luther’s critiques were correct: “citing information garnered from an extensive visition of Bavaria in 1558, [an envoy] painted a dark picture. The vast majority of the parish clergy was ignorant and infected with heresy. Out of a hundred only three or four were not secretly married or keeping concubines, to the great scandal of the faithful.” Furthermore, it was common for upper-class men to clandestinely marry or promise marriage to women of lower station to ‘get into their pants,’ and then, if she got pregnant, to deny ever having been married. 

The result was the *Tamesti* which stated that “whereas clandestine  marriages had previously declared valid, though blameworthy, all would be deemed invalid unless celebrated before a priest and at least two witnesses.” In O’Malley’s view “No single provision of the entire council affected the Catholic laity more directly than Tamesti… The approval and implementation of Tamesti meant that in the future the church recognized no marriages between Catholics as valid unless it had been witnessed by a priest.” The intention and effects of Tamesti were, in a way, feminist in the sense that they sought to protect and enfranchise women against being abandoned due to clandestine marriages. 

This debate, probably more than anything else, has had a profound impact and influence on our lives today. For example, in modern times we often consider anything that has to do with sex or sexuality as ‘private’ and something that should occur ‘behind closed doors.’ In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even the early eighteenth centuries this was not necessarily the case (though it became increasingly so as time progressed). In fact it was not abnormal for a wedding party to watch the couple on their first night, nor was it uncommon for sexual acts to take place in a bar or in public, and witnesses would think very little of it.

**Edit::** To clarify a bit, when I meant that it was common for a wedding party to watch couples on their first night, I meant the [bedding ceremony](http://www.historyofemotions.org.au/news-media/media-releases/going-to-bed-intimacy,-community,-power-and-ritual.aspx) I have read elsewhere that earlier on it was common for the wedding party to watch the actual sex, but I need to find the source again to make that assertion. 

Again, this was a period where entire families would share the same bed and children were likely to know just how their parents made new siblings. The splitting of the private and public world that happened as a result of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had an impact on the architecture of the home and the attitudes around sex. Occurring first among the upper classes, who were likely already accustomed to formalized and public marriages. They then began to be adopted by middle and lower classes, slowly at first and then with increasing rapidity until public and private life came to be a cultural standard.

Of course, this is not to say that no one hid intercourse or tried to achieve privacy before this time period, but it was much different in cultural context.

From my experience, it's all about applying at the right place at the right time with the correct paperwork and then nailing the assessment. You need quite a bit of luck also. Some guys get a job the first month after getting their license, others take one and a half or two years until they hit that sweet spot.

One more way is of course if you know people. Especially in business aviation that's a huge factor I've noticed.

Just one thing: Don't sell yourself under price. Yes it's hard to find a job, and yes your expectations get lower and lower after every negative reply. But always think about this: You had a damn expensive training, you have the skills and your job is a big responsibility.

I was offered to go to an assessment for a shitty business aviation job on an old citation in czech republic. They wanted me to pay over 1000$ just to do the recruitment. Yes I was desperate, but I wasn't gonna support that and I wasn't gonna sell myself so low.

A lot of slaves were sold to Europeans by other Africans, first of all. Second, when did I say Africans were genetically inferior to Europeans? Or even implied that?

&gt; It's harder to be isolated from the world than by that desert, combined with poor natural harbors, so they didn't develop anywhere near as quickly.

True, but completely fucking irrelevant. 

&gt;  Slavery wasn't prevalent in Europe you chowder-head, but in European colonies.

Are you fucking with me? There's no difference here. It doesn't matter where the slaves were located, they were utilized to drive the economy of the parent nation. That is the goal. It doesn't matter if the slaves are producing goods in the home country or in the Caribbean. 

&gt;  Serfdom was much more common in Europe, and only after its break-up did Europe develop.

So you're saying Europe saw no development from the 1000s to the 1800s? Nearly a millennium? 

&gt; You really see no connection between backwardness and forced labor?

Correlation doesn't imply causation. Besides, there isn't even a correlation. Some of most powerful nations to ever exist utilized forced labor. Rome, Egypt, Great Britain, Russia (even today), Spain... the list goes on. 

&gt; You really think slavery is a way to create wealth?

You think over two thousand years of merchants, traders, economists, and political leaders would practice it if slavery didn't have some positive effect on the slavers?

&gt; Are you seriously advocating slavery in the 21st century on a DAMN computer!?

Where in my posts am I advocating slavery? I never said it was something that should be practiced. It's a terrible breach of humans rights and shouldn't exist. That doesn't mean that certain people (read: the slavers) don't benefit from it.

&gt;

&gt;__Melody's Echo Chamber__ is a [dream pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_pop)/[psychedelic rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock) project of French musician [Melody Prochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody_Prochet).  

&gt;When Prochet's previous project My Bee's Garden supported [Tame Impala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Impala) on their European tour in 2010, Prochet collaborated with [Kevin Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker_(musician\)) to produce her new solo material as Melody's Echo Chamber. The material was recorded in Parker's makeshift studio in Perth, Australia and Prochet's grandmother's seaside home in the south of France.  The [self-titled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-titled) [debut album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melody%27s_Echo_Chamber_(album\)) was released on [Fat Possum Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Possum_Records) in the fall of 2012. 

&gt;In 2013, the debut album peaked at 61 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart.  [Q Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_Magazine) gave the album 8/10 calling it an ""intoxicating listen that's well worth experiencing for yourself.""  [Drowned In Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowned_In_Sound)'s Dom Gourlay awarded the album 9/10 and stated: ""Whatever happens next, she can rest assured safe in the knowledge that together with her beau they've conjured up one of 2012's--or any other year in recent memory--finest debuts.""

1) I think they will be at least attempt to do some optimization for this game. Engine optimizations generally take place during the beta phase of games testing. The best thing you can do is post your concerns and dxdiag to the official forums so that they can further track any bugs or optimization problems.

2) Here's what we know about their stance on pricing right now:

On gold:

&gt;Technical Alpha has been great for the analysis of the data, and we feel good about where we are. We feel there are a lot of opportunities for you to earn gold and purchase your Heroes. There is player leveling, the daily quests, the 500 gold built into every hero. Since we're still in Alpha, we can definitely make adjustments, but so far, we feel that you can unlock a decent amount of stuff already. You should be able to earn enough gold to unlock ten Heroes by level 40 for Team League.

[Source](http://www.heroesfire.com/hots/forum/news/blizzcon-dev-q-amp-a-with-alan-dabiri-407)

On term pricing goals:

&gt; [...] one more thing to remember is that Heroes of the Storm is still a new game that hasn’t reached beta just yet. We will be constantly adding new content, and over time, as more and more Heroes and skins are added to the mix, you’ll see price drops on classic content.

[Source](http://games.on.net/2014/12/heroes-of-the-storm-stimpacks-gold-gain-lost-vikings/)

Short term pricing, just today they announced (for the EU at least, but likely for everybody):

&gt;players can look forward to more frequent discounts on heroes, skins, and mounts, as we’re planning to roll out weekly sales starting with Arthas, Crown Prince Arthas, and Vampire Slayer Valla at 50% off with the launch of the closed beta test on January 13, 2015.

(this was announced along with some Euro price adjustments today.)

&gt; It is safe to say that unrestricted trade has flourished in a manner heretofore unforeseen in the postwar period.

Yes, but that is not because of the US military presence, per se.  The US is preventing China from taking the island of Taiwan and is perhaps also keeping North Korea in check, but that's it.

Since the end of WWII business people in modern countries have realized that the pathway to wealth and good fortune is not through taking over territory as it was thought to be in the colonial era or in Middle Ages Europe, but through trade. You get rich by making things. China has learned this lesson very well, as we see. Japan also recognizes this. Shinzo Abe's current economic policies have been designed to rein in the value of the yen so that international trade can boost Japan's economy.  It is in the national interests of all the strong East Asian countries to maintain good trade relationships. If the US were to pull out altogether, those relationships would not falter.

Secondly, short answer: no. Long answer: it's really fucking complicated.

Now, let me preface this by saying I'm no expert, so if someone wants to correct me on any points, be my guest. Also, I am in no way supporting or excusing any of the actions taken by ISIS/ISIL.


The group that currently calls itself Islamic State (aka ISIL, aka ISIS, aka Da'ish) is really an amalgamation of several groups. The biggest group that it seems to sort of centre around used to be known as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). They were a group in Western Iraq that wanted to create a state in Western Iraq for Sunni Muslims (as oppose to the Shia Iraqis in the East and the Kurds in the North).

Of course, they weren't exactly saints and civilians as well as the military were targeted. In 2009, when the US was pulling out a lot of its forces from Iraq, things quieted down a bit. ISI was still there, but many of the more extreme members (the ones who came from other countries) had left (and the ones that stayed were now more of a minority in the organisation, so had less sway). So, for the first time since its beginning ISI was mainly an Iraqi group. They were still violent bastards, but slightly less violent than before.

Then the Syrian civil war started. ISI started to lend support for the Syrian rebels and became ISIS (Islamic State for Iraq and Syria). It was at that time that foreigners started to join ISIS again. At the start it wasn't just extremist foreigners that were joining them, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was a fucking prick, and some people who felt kinship with the Syrian people went and took arms up against him. Unfortunately, some of the people in the region that were best trained to fight against Assad were Islamic extremists. 

With extremists taking over ISIS again they became a lot more bloody and gained a many more foreign fighters (from Europe as well as other parts of the Middle East), including many more extremists. Of course, at this time people in the West still didn't care too much, it was really just a civil war in the Middle East, nothing that we haven't seen before. Then it started to get a lot more bloody, and things started to go tits up. Which is roughly when it started to be all over the news, not just a little side note.

**TLDR:** For the most part IS is comprised of people already in the Middle East, but for whatever reason some people in Western countries have decided to join them. And many decided to join ISIS before they were (rightly) demonised by the Western media.

International media have often commented on his ambiguous but non-condemnatory stance toward ethnic Russian nationalism.   The BBC noted in a profile of Navalny that his endorsement of a political campaign called ""Stop Feeding the Caucasus"" and his willingness to speak at ultra-nationalist events ""have caused concern among liberals."" He also has been a co-organizer of the ""[Russian March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_March),""  which Radio Free Europe describes as ""a parade uniting Russian nationalist groups of all stripes,""  and has appeared as a speaker alongside Russian nationalists.

I can't find the original document I had looked at to compare, but I found [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) which while an imperfect measure gives you a general sense of where things lie. Argentina and Chile are the safest regions in South America and compare very favorably to the US (though not Canada which is substantially safer). Russia has about 2 times the murder rate of Argentina and close to 3 times that of Chile. 
And yet few people go to play in South America that aren't from the region but many players end up playing in Russia (though less on average than other European nations). Besides if that were the case players would be falling over themselves to play in Scandinavia yet nobody is. This suggests your premise is incorrect. 

The point is most of this comes down to money and for that you need a substantial fanbase and to be a rich country. The average European nation has both of those things while the MLS is in rich countries it doesn't have the fanbase to support the crazy player salaries we see elsewhere. South American fans don't lack for passion and pervasiveness (football is pretty much a religion here) but there isn't enough money to support crazy player salaries. The best we can expect is to see some kid make his way through our upper divisions a couple of seasons long enough for them to get scouted then go play in Europe and then come back in their late 20's/early 30's for a couple more years.

&gt;As far as evasion goes, ever heard of Hollywood accounting? It's not just Hollywood that uses it. Accountants fudge numbers more than people think and always in favour of their employer.

So you have no information to the contrary. In 2013 the tax bought in EUR 260m and in 2014 EUR 160m. The ministry of finance admitted the revenue was paltry.  

""But, but it's not fair, they are rich, they are loaded"" - unless they've earned it in some illegal way, they have as much right to their earnings as you do. It's Europe, if they are wealthy chances are they are already in the highest tax bracket and have several wealth taxes to contend with

Just because a tax makes sense morally or in principle (according to you), doesn't mean it's practical.

Hitler's agreement to the 1938–9 Schacht Plan, and the continued flight of thousands of Jews from Hitler's clutches for an extended period when the Schacht Plan came to nothing, indicate that the preference for a concerted genocide of the type that came later did not yet exist.""


""Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 increased the urgency of the ""Jewish Question"". Poland, was home to approximately three million Jews (nearly nine percent of the population), in centuries-old communities, two-thirds of whom fell under Nazi control with Poland's capitulation.
Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia, recommended concentrating all the Polish Jews in ghettos in major cities, where they would be put to work for the German war industry. The ghettos would be in cities located on railway junctions in order to furnish, in Heydrich's words, ""a better possibility of control and later deportation.""[87] During his interrogation in 1961, Adolf Eichmann recalled that this ""later deportation"" actually meant ""physical extermination.""

Another factor was their formation of a socioeconomic bloc of Eastern Europe, the Warsaw Pact, which developed from the Red Army's occupation of the area. Further, the state's development of industries throughout the 1920s and 30s under the New Economic Plan helped spur their economy towards industrialization, by loosening the iron grip of top-down economics to a certain degree. However, this was after a huge crisis of starvation that resulted from state mismanagement of agriculture. Industrial development also steadily increased throughout the war despite massive destruction, because it was necessary to manufacture armaments for the war.

Doing nothing isn't an option anymore. People have been content to sit back and let Russian propaganda takes its toll for a while now, but it's getting to the point where the wall of public awareness has become covered with so much Russian propaganda shit that some of it has begun to stick.

You only have to look at this sub and how people have actually started to buy into the ideas that the US financed Maidan, that the CIA was involved in Maidan, that the Crimean referendum was legitimate, that Yanukovych was ousted in a coup.

None of these are true, but they all have roots in Russian propaganda. So much of the language we use and the ideas behind so many things has some links back to Russian propaganda, sometimes when we don't even realise it. 

The idea that Assad is a stabilizing force in Syria, that North Korea isn't actually that bad, these ideas have also been flowing out of Russian propaganda for years now. 

Like it or not, some kind of response is needed, and to be honest, it's not the end of the world if that response sometimes delves into propaganda itself. 

The fact of the matter is that Russian propaganda has inflicted a gaping and widening wound in our discourse, and we need some kind of effective band aid for it before the discourse becomes so riddled with ideas that have links to the Kremlin that we can no longer function effectively. 

Also remember that much of the reason that this war in Ukraine is still going on also has links to Russian propaganda. This shit has consequences, and people are getting killed. A response is needed.

Vince McMahon has died in 2018 and the company is in shock. The heritage passes to Stephanie McMahon-Levesque and Paul Levesque, with this last one making Paul Heyman the now responsible for NXT booking.

Cena has retired and makes sporadic appearances like Hogan or The Rock. He is booked to have a match with Randy Orton as his last at WM 36.

The main event scene is the best from the last years, with Ambrose, Bryan, Reigns and Rollins.

Ambrose turned heel and is now feuding with Bryan for the Intercontinental Championship. They had the match of the year on Summerslam 2019.

Cesaro is the leader of ""Europe United"", a heel stable with Barrett, Neville, Bálor, Sheamus, Paige and Regal's their manager. Neville and Bálor are currently on a feud with Zayn and Owens for the WWE Tag Team Championships. Rusev and Lana have been released from their contract.

I tracked your image with ""reverse image search"" on google and found that you didn't provided the precious information that the data were only for 2007. The thing is that net contributions fluctuate a lot and suprisingly, you picked an exceptional year when the UK was far ahead (as shown in the link I provided with the source, yours isn't one ). I guess you picked randomly right?

I opened excel just for you:

*In Euro million, average net contribution of both countries between year 2000 and 2012*:

- UK: -2.988,16

- **France: -3.754,76**

Sorry to burst your bubble but France is an overall bigger net contributor to the EU budget than the UK. Per capita as well.

If you give $50 to a middle man (the EU) and he gives you $30 back so you can give it to your famers what's the difference it makes compared to other countries where the states also protect and subsidy their own farmers but do it directly?

I already stated that all countries in the world protect their agricultural sectors (farm Bill act in the USA), with subsidies, huge taxation at the border, and all kind of different set of laws ...

If you say so.

&gt; He blamed two composers who happened to be Jewish.

No, he reduced colleagues which personally pissed him off to being jews and tried to rationalize his dislike that way. 

He also ranted about jews in general and he wrote a text about it which - if you bother to read it - leaves no doubt about it being an anti-semitic pamphlet.

&gt; but it's a criticism of Jewish music, and contributions to music, not of people.

Wagner claims that the work was written to:

explain to ourselves the involuntary repellence possessed for us by the nature and personality of the Jews, so as to vindicate that instinctive dislike which we plainly recognize as stronger and more overpowering than our conscious zeal to rid ourselves thereof.[3]

Wagner holds that Jews are unable to speak European languages properly and that Jewish speech took the character of an ""intolerably jumbled blabber"", a ""creaking, squeaking, buzzing snuffle"", incapable of expressing true passion.[4] This, he says, debars them from any possibility of creating song or music. He also states:

Although the peculiarities of the Jewish mode of speaking and singing come out the most glaringly in the commoner class of Jew, who has remained faithful to his father's stock, and though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him.[5]

The essay is riddled with the aggressiveness typical of many Judeophobic publications of the previous few centuries. However Wagner did introduce one striking new image, which was to be taken up after him by many later antisemitic authors:

So long as the separate art of music had a real organic life-need in it […] there was nowhere to be found a Jewish composer.... Only when a body’s inner death is manifest, do outside elements win the power of lodgement in it—yet merely to destroy it. Then, indeed, that body’s flesh dissolves into a swarming colony of insect life: but who in looking on that body’s self, would hold it still for living?[7]

""For what it's worth, I think that the title ""Judaism in Music"" isn't a very good translation of the title. In English that connotes Judaism as a religious ideology, but the article isn't about religion--it's about the inherent nature of Jews, which is part of why it's an example of the racial antisemitism popularized during the period.

I just meant within his team he is generally the most consistent as far as usually always being the 2nd or 3rd best on the team while players like swag and Skadoodle fluctuate. 

My main reason for bringing this up is that I see -azk +someone else all the time for iBP proposed roster changes from the community. This was silenced for abit when people had other issues with players such a steel. BUt even now that they just got their current 5 people are already calling for -azk +steel or -azk +someone before they have even really played in anything.

The fact is if you look at their LAN play on NA soil, which is where iBP has had most of its success (especially their run of back to back ESEA championships and pretty much every ESEA LAN he has played in) AZK was statistically always their 2nd or 3rd best player and in some cases their overall top fragger. He may not be flashy, but he plays his roles well, he is very versatile, and he is always putting in his ~20+ frags in for the team. 

This also carrys over to many of their EU appearances. When you look at some of their most successful international LANS such as in recent times Gfinity3 (2nd best player rating on the team) and FACEIT Milans where they took 2nd (he had the 2nd best player rating again) he has been on point. Even when they were failing in majors such as Cologne and Katowice he was still around #3 on the team and it was largely choking measure from their stars such as Skadoodle and overall bad team performance that led to their demise. 

Granted, recently, at DHW14 and ESWC 2014 he dropped off a bit in comparison to his pretty solid past for the team. So this may be something to keep an eye on going forward. Especially if chemistry and communication issues supposedly persist with players such as himself and Skadoodle.

Outside of purely numerical figures, just watching the team play, as I have said before he seems to be very versatile and stable. I have hardly seen a time where he was bottom fragging and holding the team back and everyone else was wrecking things. Like I said win or lose he sits 2/3rd on the team in almost all cases. 

So is he one of the most consistent in the world? No, but iBP as a whole has never been outside NA soil. And on NA soil he usually is their 2nd best performer statistically and from a stability stand point. I am not saying he is without flaws, but I don't think his play is deserving the the -azk +someone else mentality I have seen a lot around social media and forums. He is not the issue with the team, at least not solely. I am sure communication/chemistry issues are big and he may be a part of that. But getting rid of him and getting in someone else you deem as better individually is not going to increase the level of the team. The fact is most NA players regard him as being one of the best of NA. 

SO my initial comment was purely to the nature of the OP stating ""Problem with AZK is that his consistent level isn't very high, which is why he gets loads of flack by many people."" I think he is one of the more consistent players on the team. Sure he is rarely their best or their star, but you can always count on him to be the 2/3rd guy on the board and count on him to do his job. I really feel other players on the team have had worst consistency issues when in comes to their play on the biggest stages. 

So for me I am not arguing about overall game impact but overall performance within the range of the potential of the player. I feel AZK usually plays to his standard.

I am not trying to get him credit as a top international player. I just feel he is rather consistent for his team within his range of ability and isn't deserving of such heavy scrutiny which is what I feel I see constantly from social media and such.

&gt; considering your situation (job and insurance) i doubt this is a very normal problem

56% of the people in the poll had insurance (since it's over 12 months it totals over 100%), and 66% made more than 30k. It's not too uncommon, sadly.

&gt; the fact is that these loans are easy to change or even default on

That's not the case in the US: you can't move your loan, but the company can sell your loan and the new company can make new terms (usually worse), and you cannot default on student debt in the US, they will garnish your wages. If you miss a single payment, you're considered in default, the entire debt is now due, affects your credit score, you lose eligibility for forbearance or repayment plans for 7 years.

&gt; But maybe it was about time with a change 

Agreed! The growth of a new far-right in many European countries is worrying.

&gt; Not much influence though and most is pre determined. Local politics you know.

Doesn't feel that way in the US. I hope that's not the case in Europe. How little power is devolved from national to regions/cities, in general?

&gt; democracy is more and more useless the larger amount of people that participates. 

Like my previous reply, isn't that the point of federation, devolution, and limited local autonomy? Sometimes I bemoan the fragmented nature of US governance, since I think too much is devolved to regions, but you appear to think too little is devolved in the EU.

Here's another aspect that is reminiscent of Iraq:

&gt; In this case the “Maidan Massacre” was featured in Western media as the result of an unstable, brutal pro-Russian Yanukovych Government. You may recall Yanukovych went along with the February 21 deal with opposition parties and 3 EU foreign minsters to get rid of him by calling for early elections. The next day that deal was meaningless when well-armed, neo-Nazi radicals forced Yanukovych to flee the country with repeated assassination attempts.

In other words, Evil Empire #1 sent in the Nazis when peace was at hand.  The provocateurs are sent in at precisely the point where war is averted.

* We saw this same pattern in Iraq, of course.  Iraq was cooperating fully with the U.S., disarming, and suing desperately for peace, and the U.N. inspectors were about to report that Iraq had no WMDs.  It is at precisely that point that the U.S. attacked.
* We saw it in 1993, in the Waco Massacre.  On 28 Feb 1993, the U.S. launched an illegal military assault on a peaceable religious commune in Texas.  The survivors of the initial assault refused to leave, in part because they sought to preserve evidence of the initial attack.  After 51 days of torment inflicted by the government, the community agreed to evacuate.  It is at precisely that moment that the government attacked -- with tanks, incendiaries and snipers.
* We saw it again in 1999 at Rambouillet.  Though not at fault, the Yugoslav government capitulated to all of the U.S. demands.  At that point, Madeleine Albright added ""Appendix B"", which gave NATO free access to all of Yugoslavia, with Yugoslavia paying the cost of NATO's maneuvers.  This appendix was something that no government could possibly agree to.  The U.S. then had the pretext it needed for war.
* We saw it in 1990, when Saddam Hussein, after falling into the trap set by April Glaspie, tried to negotiate his way out of Kuwait, and George H.W. Bush offered nothing but childish taunts in response -- the ""So Damn Insane"" taunt, for example.  Again, the U.S. evaded a diplomatic resolution and locked in the ""war option"".
* We saw it back in the 1950s, when the Soviet Union agreed to an onerous U.S. ""peace proposal"" -- ""Open Skies"", I believe.  The U.S. was then forced to reject its own proposal.  
* We saw it when the U.S. was pretending to negotiate with Iran.  Iran too accepted a fake U.S. proposal -- it agreed to ship its uranium to Turkey for reprocessing, as I recall.  The U.S. was then forced to reject its own proposal.
* And, of course, we have seen it again and again and again in Israel, where a mysterious ""Terrorist Attack"" occurs every time Israel faces the threat of progress at the negotiating table.",False,cncuvej,,1,NonZionist,False,t3_2r534z,t1_cncuvej

This is not some special case, it's a simple matter of extension. The fact is, the further you go back the more likely any given person is descended from them.

There's also a seldom discussed arms embargo to China imposed by the EU and the US since Tiananmen 1989.

Honestly, I don't see China as an emerging rival to the US. Its central government has remained strong only because the provinces were equally poor. Now that some of them are rising and have growing standards of living, it's hard to imagine them keeping it together without some serious problems. Even the distribution of wealth between EU countries is more equal than the rising differences between the Chinese provinces, and the EU isn't even a country.

So let's see what I can think of. The concept seems odd to me, as I don't quite know what you mean by 2-part equip spells. And, because of the power and effect level of Burning Abyss, these cards will probably be searching a lot. This is just my take on how something like this could appear. Not sure how strong it is, but I think it could be pretty fun. 

&gt; the rune attaches as a material to the tech, and only gives effects,

&gt; the tech gives massive stat boost, and maybe a battle related effect

I can work with those 2 ideas.

&gt; 2-part equip spells that search each other

I like the search part, but I have my own twist to the Runes. I find Complimentary equip spells have already been done with Noble Knights and the Bamboo swords. So I want to try something knew.

I think a European theme would be cool here. European mages have a rich history and plenty of resources to pull from. The Runes are basically the [Futhark Runes](http://www.sunnyway.com/runes/meanings.html) and the ""tech"" (I am assuming you want these to be more futuristic-like weapons) will be based loosely on some legendary/mythological weapons.

And because of the mages being magically augmenting armor, they will be called BattleMages. And sticking with the European theme, they would have names from their history too.

-----

So let's start with the Runes. My original thought of runes used for augmenting weapons/armor would act like [Overlay Regen](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Overlay_Regen), but for equip spells. So you would need the Equip spells first to attach a rune to it, but the Runes could be discarded (probably 2 at a time) to search an equip to your hand. The 'attach' keyword will still be used because it will be the same action taken. An equip spell may only have 1 Rune/Augment on it and once one is on, it cannot come off. (If I were to make a new card type, it would be called Augment Spell, but if this is only 1 archetype, then there's no point to creating a new card type. But if this were to evolve into a whole line of card, that'd be cool.) Here is a base template.

**RuneTech Rune - NAME HERE**

Normal Spell  (Augment Spell)

You may discard this card and 1 other ""RuneTech Rune"" spell card to add 1 ""RuneTech Weapon"" equip spell to your hand.

Target 1 ""RuneTech Weapon"" equip spell and attach this card to it. Then, if you do, activate the following effect:

* EFFECT HERE

*Or*

Target 1 ""RuneTech Weapon"" equip spell you control and attach this card to it. Then, if you do, it gains the following effect:

-----

Now I'll just list the runes and their effects.

Fehu - Draw 1 card and gain 1000 life points.

Uruz - Equipped monster gains an loses 1000 attack, but may attack directly.

Thuriz (Thurisaz) - Equipped monster may attack twice each battle phase.

Ansuz - Search your deck for another RuneTech Rune. The equipped monster gains 500 ATK.

Raidho - When the attached equip spell is destroyed, you may add 1 BattleMage monster from your deck to your hand.

Kenaz - You may look at 2(?) facedown cards your opponent controls once per turn.

Gebo - You may destroy another ""RuneTech Rune"" and draw a card.

Wunjo - The equipped monster may not be targeted by non-equip spell card effects.

These look a little weak to me right now, but there really isn't any way to know without testing. They probably could be pushed a bit more because they require another specific equip spell type already on the field. But this is a nice start now.

-----

The equip spells, being the premier thing about the deck, would also have some strong effects. And, being the cool thing, they may have a variable amount of Runes Augments.

So here is a template for the equip spells.

**RuneTech Weapon - NAME HERE**

Equip Spell

May only be equipped to a BattleMage.

STUFF

-----

So, let's get some names and effects of weapons.

**RT Wep- Caladbolg **

When ~ is equipped to a monster, destroy all other equip spells equipped to it. No other cards may equipped to the equipped monster. 

Caladbolg may have up to 4 cards Attached/Augmented to it. 

The equipped monster gains 500 ATK for each card augmented to this card.

**RT Wep - Lughe's Spear**

Lughe's Spear may have 2 cards Augmented to it.

Equipped monster gains 500 ATK and DEF and piercing.

**RT Wep - Joyeuse**

Joyeuse may have 2 cards Augmented to it.

Equipped creature may attack once for each card attached to this card.

**RT Wep - Durandal**

Durandal may have 2 cards Augmented to it.

Equipped monster gains 500 ATK. Once per turn, if Durandal would be destroyed, it is not destroyed.

**RT Wep - Ancile**

Ancile may have 2 cards Augmented to it.

Equipped monster gains 1000 DEF.

When Ancile is destroyed, search your deck for another ""RT Wep"", except Ancile.

**RT Wep - Evalach**

Evalach may have 2 cards attached to it.

Once per turn, if the equipped monster would be destroyed, it is not destroyed.

-----

Now onto the BattleMages. They would be of slightly subpar stats, because they revolve around getting equipped and buffed. They would be of either Earth, Light, or Dark attributes, and probably level 4, although they could be level 2/3 for some variety. BattleMage is reduced to BM for ease of typing. And they will either be Spellcasters or Warriors.

3000/1000

This is my take on a series of cards that would look like this. I tried to make them balanced. The Runes are an inherent minus, so some of them replace themselves, and they get recycled a lot, so there is an incentive to run them. And equip spells are an easy 2-for-1, which is only exemplified here. But I am sure there is some broken aspect that I have overlooked. I also got lazy half way through as started abbreviating and ignoring good card format and PSCT.

Columbus' joy at finding what he believed to have been the East Indies is not unreasonable, as proclaiming that he had discovered a new continent would be even more absurd.

Also, who are these people who tell Columbus that he, on fact, did not find Indians?

Furthermore, you mention that these people say that Columbus found something much cooler.  While coolness is subjective, this is an interesting point.  First off, Columbus had no reason to believe that he found anything other than an island.  Ignoring the fact that he did first land on all island, let's say he did land on a new continent.  How could he know that he discovered a continent?  He would have no reason to believe that what he saw was not just a large island, unless he explored deep into the continent (which, suffice to say, would have been very difficult).  Secondly, few explorers explored for coolness.  They did so for profit.  Discovering a new continent isn't that much more profitable than discovering some islands.  The small French colony of San Domingua (butchered the name) was much more profitable than Louisiana, which was much larger.  The coolness is irrelevant, as he was hired to male a profit.

Also, did people really forget about Columbus?  Maybe he didn't have a national holiday, but he was an undeniably important figure.  He allowed for the creation of the Columbian Exchange and subsequently, for the rise of Europe as a dominant player.  The Chinese and other Asians countries were undeniably ahead of the Europeans, but the Columbian Exchange allowed for enough development for the Europeans to dominate the world stage.

Just as a throat clearing - I won't deny that America has some terrible episodes in it's history but there's a lot of misinformation spread about a lot of the details too. 

The story you refer to with America training the Taliban for example is a great example of such misinformation. America involved itself in a covert war, mainly due to the efforts of the Texas congressman Charlie Wilson. Wilson was horrified at the slaughter of Afghans and their mass displacement due to the Russian invasion of the country. He managed to get a covert war going by secretly raising funding for weaponry that the Mujahideen could use to put up a real fight against the Russians. Over time he managed to convince a lot of other congressmen to help raise enough funding that Mujahideen eventually beat the Russians, and it contributed in a big way to the downfall of the soviet union. Yes that was in America's interests and I'm sure one of the things Charlie Wilson said to convince other congressmen, but it was also in the interests of the Mujahideen and the Afghan population. The Mujahideen were friendly to America for the most part, but towards the end of the war it was becoming evident that there were more extreme elements within and with a new supply of weapons, after the war they started to fight each other. Wilson kept trying to convince American congressmen that even though Russia had lost, the fight was not over. He was very invested in the country's affairs and saw how the new extreme emerging factions could lead the country into civil war if America didn't help to sort it out, but other congressmen lost interest when they felt that the war was won and Russia was defeated.

Sure you might be thinking this somewhat furthers your point in that America as a greater whole was only interested up to the point that it's interests were realized and that it's enemy was defeated, but it's not simply a story of how America looks out for it's own interests, it's more a story of how short-sighted America's interests were in the larger political ecosystem. It's origins came from a good place, and I'm sure you'd agree that when you know the story of how it really went it doesn't read in the same way it's often portrayed i.e. America trained and supplied advanced weaponry to a group of religious extremist psychopathic nihilists who want to kill everyone, Americans particularly. Okay so maybe I dressed that up a little but as I'm sure you'd agree, not by much. Just as an extra, if you're interested in learning a little more about that whole story you should watch the film 'Charlie Wilson's War'. 

Anyway, I think it's important to point out the fact that there are a group of people who seem to think that by definition America's interests must always by definition be aligned with the immoral. That the interests are always sinister. I don't think this is this case. And frankly I think even really talking about 'America's interests' is actually way too simple a way of think about it. We're talking about whole generations of politics, through which many different politicians have come and gone. Even whole ideologies have come and gone. This makes for a very complex picture. The American government in the 1960s and 70s was a very different America to what it is now. Even the interests have changed. The interests lay at the heart of only what the people in power at the time *think* America's interests are. That's changed a number of times, and there are times like I said before where I think America's government acted terribly. 

This might lead to an interesting thought. As many people like to say, America is *responsible* for a lot of wrong doing. They supported Saddam Hussein for a long time, and he enforced a terrible regime over the people of Iraq for a long and insufferable period of time. So here comes the reason for my use of italics on the word 'responsible'. Most on the left would say, we were responsible for Saddam being in power therefore we should never have been in Iraq. Years after the intervention, all that the left wing wanted was for Allied troops to leave the country. So what the hell do they mean by responsibility? That's not responsibility. Responsibility would be America *accepting it's responsibility* and removing the dictator it once helped and aiding the country to lift itself out from the ashes and helping to begin to rebuild their society. Accepting your responsibility for wrong doing in my view, entails righting your wrongs. I personally think Blair in particular saw it this way. He always struck me as an idealist. Though that's my opinion. There people who acted terribly and really truly betrayed the people of Iraq - just look into Paul Bremer, courtesy of Henry Kissinger by the way - a real American war criminal. 

Anyway the gist of my point there is that the picture is way more complex than -America is a force that simply looks after it's own interests. The opinions on what those interests are can vary dramatically from one politician to another, and from one presidency to another. For some the interest might involve self-interest, and for other's it might involve a wider interest, perhaps including America righting it's wrongs.

This post is getting long but given that you took the time to write a response perhaps you're still interested enough to keep reading my response. Anyway I think I'll finish off on commenting about America's dealings with Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia puts quite a challenge to anyone who has any optimism for America as a global force. It's leadership and laws are detestable and I have often pondered why America has anything to do with them. Especially, as you say when they are actively funding wahhabism, a very nasty strain of Islam, and pumping it's ideology around the world causing mayhem wherever it is found. Not just that, but also the fact that it is an ideology that is very actively anti-american, right to the core. Every value that America is supposed to stand for, the values that were established by America's founding fathers are attacked by wahhabism. Why would America suffer dealing with them? The reason seems to be economic, so in that sense yes you are right. It's to do with the protection of the interests of a very wealthy minority which run counter to what most Americans might consider their interests. Not to mention to the interests of the wider populations of Europe and other national populations affected by wahhabism. 

I suspect the political class see the situation in a way that essentially there's no way to have their cake and eat it too. They can't stick up for their principles because Saudi Arabia can undermine American energy industry by having the cheapest oil going. That's a huge amount of American jobs and a significant portion of GDP. Without cheap energy America would suffer, and that means it's citizens too. In terms of it's long term power it's also important. It's an unpleasant thought that America should be in anyway sycophantic towards Saudi Arabia but perhaps they see it as a temporary inconvenience. They'll only have to rely on their oil for so long, but for mean time in this unpleasant situation there are at least benefits to be had. 

One such benefit is the opposition to Iran whose government is extremely hostile to the USA. In more recent times a very interest benefit emerged in that America and Saudi Arabia's interests aligned, along with Europe's and even the Syrian people's interests. Russia was supporting Assad, which pissed off Saudi Arabia, and annexed Crimea as well as essentially invading Ukraine. Russia's economy is primarily based on one industry - energy. Well if Saudi Arabia decides to sell oil a lot cheaper then they can massively undermine Russia's whole economy. Everyone's happy. Except Russia. And that's what they did. OPEC and America claim it's a price war - a damn convenient one at that, though it does hurt the American energy industry. But combined with economic sanctions it's caused the collapse of the Ruble and caused Russia's interest rates to soar. 

In my view, despite the terrible hurt it'll cause normal Russian people, Putin is an incredibly dangerous tyrant in control of a very powerful country and it's a good thing that they can be hit where it hurts when their leadership starts becoming tyrannical and aggressive towards other sovereign states. The person to blame for the suffering this will cause average Russian people is Putin in my view. Perhaps you see that as rather convenient, but when it comes to politics sadly I think it's about compromise. And when it comes to global politics it often comes to very ugly compromise but I think that's down to hugely complex reasons. The world is probably too complex for any one person to really understand what's going on, but that's all the more reason to keep challenging your own view right?

Anyway if you haven't agreed with even anything I've said I hope I've at least not committed the crime of being boring. I'm just another guy who's hoping to see a better world just like you after all. Maybe we have a different idea of how to get there but we have the same goal.

As Androgein1 stated, you ~really~ need to play through 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors (which is a DS game, but will play on the 2/3DS) first, as it is the first in the series. It sets up a lot of what will happen in Virtue's Last Reward, and you'll miss so many references without that background. It's also darker and more violent than VLR is.

I wouldn't say they were necessarily similar to PW, because the puzzles are much more traditional and involve examining certain rooms for clues, putting those clues together, activating puzzle 'mini-games', completing them (there's two ways to complete them, the second getting you a 'bonus') and then moving onto the next. You're not going to be pressing dialogue or presenting contradictory evidence or anything.

1. Caliexico: They have an undisputed dominance over North and Central America as well as a huge economy and a large military. They can project power anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans with ease. In combination with an alliance with the DFE and India, they are hard to beat.

2. China: They would be first, but due to their slow recovery after the big China war, I cannot justify it. However, they have far more long term potential than Caliexico, so they may be number one fairly soon. Their international presence is limited by the DFE and Caliexico, so they do not have a large hegemony. They are well connected internationally, however, and remain a key economic power in the world.

3. The Dawnfire Empire: Having arguably the most potent navy on the planet, as well as a huge high tech and basic industrial base, they are a force to be reckoned with. However, they have a limited international presence due to constant hostilities with China. Long term, if the DFE can expand into Oceania and Southeast Asia, they can become a dominant global superpower. As is, they are still an incredibly powerful nation that can project power with a massive Navy that is unrivalled. 

4. The Solarian Empire: A newcomer to the list and my nation. When it comes to developing arms, The Solarian Empire (or Solaris) is arguably the best at it when it comes to blending performance, practicality, realism, and affordability. It also dominates the global arms trade, selling massive quantities of military materiel to many nations. Furthermore, the Solarian Army is possibly the best ground force on the planet. However, its military is limited due to its smaller navy, which is still in development. This limits the Empire's force projection capability outside of Asia and Africa. Also limiting its ranking is a low GDP per Capita in Iraq and Pakistan, as well as a limited geopolitical importance outside of the arms trade. It also is relatively new to the world stage and lacks the respect of more established powers. However, with the Antimatter Foundation, this may change in the soon-ish future.

5. India: India has a huge population and large growth potential. However, due to it also being in a strained relationship with the EMU and China, it has some concerns for the long term. If it can overcome these, it can become a true international superpower.

6. The Ruthenian Commonwealth: Due to a military modernization programme and a large swathe of newly acquired eastern territory, it has a lot of potential for becoming the new premier Eurasian Power, save for China and possibly India. However, their sphere of influence is contested by Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, and the UK.

This particular preserve is 430 square kilometers of dense jungle. And by ""dense jungle"" I mean the Terai, not some pretty European forest. It could take you a few hours just to travel a kilometer, in some parts. And helicopters are ineffective with the dense canopy cover.

The poachers belong to local villages bordering the preserve. They know their own part of the jungle very well, having lived near it all their lives. They do lightning raids, going in groups of 3-4, traveling by night, grabbing the loot and hightailing it out of there. Catching them requires being at the right place at exactly the right time. It's very hard to do.

In fact, the only reason it works at all is because of informers. The guys who do the poaching become well known in their local villages, because they are flush with cash from selling rhino parts. Their neighbors know who they are. The game wardens have spent years making connections among the locals and putting informers in place. They can do that because they are drawn from the same populace, many of them have friends and relatives in those same villages.

Game wardens patrol the jungle routinely, but very very rarely come across poachers. I think in the last 10 years or so, it's only happened twice that they came across the trail of poachers and tracked them. The other 99% of the time (including all 22 poachers they killed this year), it's because of a tip from informants.

Someone tips them off that there's going to be a raid, they know which village is involved, so they can narrow down the range to a few square kilometers. They know roughly when it's going to happen, so they can sneak wardens into that area. That's how they find the poachers, and once they do, usually the poachers die. Sometimes guards do as well, because the poachers are well funded and also have the latest assault rifles, but a lot more poachers than guards die.

There's not a damn thing the Gurkhas could do to improve on that. They are not used to steamy hot jungles of the Terai, it would be unfamiliar terrain, and they would get no cooperation from locals. They couldn't even talk their language. And these Assamese guards aren't far behind Gurkhas in fighting ability, they come from just as tough an environment and also have a long martial tradition.",False,cnd0yp5,,3,EvanRWT,False,t3_2r4601,t1_cnd0yp5

1425085394,5,0,,lfcwfmm,t5_2qn0o,False,0,LiverpoolFC,t1_cncpxap,1420281951,0,"Indeed. However, there are some very clear differences, I think.

First off, I think the idea of a footballer's 'boyhood club' is often overrated, however, when a player reaches a certain point in one's career, I think the idea of 'home' becomes much more important.

For example, if you follow basketball in America, LeBron James ultimately went back home to Cleveland. To a lesser extent, the 32-year-old Rickie Lambert is at the sunset of his career and jumped at the chance to return to his own boyhood club.

Frank Lampard is a fantastic player, however, it is hard to say that Chelsea was his boyhood club - especially considering his family history (i.e. his father played for West Ham for a very long time) - even though I'm sure that he respects and is very loyal to Chelsea for all that they have done for him.

Now you take a person like Steven Gerrard who was born on Merseyside. He quite literally has the city of Liverpool in his blood; Has friends, family who have Liverpool in their blood (whether they were Everton or LFC). He had the very unique opportunity to only grow up in the Liverpool region but ultimately sign a professional contract with Liverpool FC, work up through the ranks, make the first team, and not just play football but become a legend for club and country.

There were times that Gerrard and the ugly business of football didn't see eye-to-eye but, thankfully, the club showed loyalty to Gerrard and Gerrard showed loyalty to the club.

Flash forward to 34-year-old Steven Gerrard at the tail-end of his career. At this point, I think a man like Gerrard considers much more than just money or trophies or glory. I think at this point a man like Gerrard takes into consideration his *legacy* and I think Gerrard does not want to tarnish that legacy by playing for another club or even another club in Europe.

Steven Gerrard is in an incredibly unique position to state that he was able to play for his boyhood, become a legend at his boyhood club, represent LFC as captain of England and *never* play for another English or European club other than LFC.

That is his legacy.

Five, ten, fifteen years after Gerrard hangs up his boots and we start to talk about legends and we start to split hairs about who is a legend and *why* he is a legend, I think many will point to Gerrard and say, 'Well, he never played for another English or European club other than Liverpool.'

I think that will matter to supporters; I think that will matter to Steven Gerrard.

I'm not naive about the business of football, though. Sure, Lampard said the same thing about Chelsea. Gerrard could turn around and shock us all by staying in England.

But... my gut says that Gerrard will honor his words. He will ride off into the sunset of the MLS in America, do well, hang up the boots for good and come home to Liverpool untarnished.",False,cnd1qmu,,5,joeinthebox,False,t3_2r4vdt,t1_cnd1qmu

Planetside's original philosophy was to only allow people to buy sidegrades and cosmetics.  As [Matt Higby said in 2012](http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/planetside-2/1225448p1.html):

&gt; ""League of Legends does this really brilliantly. You get IP points for playing the game. If you're smart, you never spend a single IP point on anything except runes, because runes give you a gameplay advantage. We have a similar thing set up with how our implants work. You can only buy implants with in-game resources because they're always a net power-add. So if you decide you want to get a sidegraded weapon (an equally powerful but tweaked version) you have to make that tradeoff.""

Not only can you now buy implants, but you also need to pay to keep them operating (particularly if you're a low score-per-minute player).

---

For those who aren't aware, Radar_X [recently stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/2r0o7f/smedly_comments_on_implant_changes_sorry_but_we/cnbdnzx?context=3):
&gt; ""If implants are P2W, then yes you may not like everything in the future.""

And in the context of decreased charger drops through gameplay *and* new implants that require more charge, it seems reasonable to conclude that Planetside 2 isn't making as much money as those in charge would like... at least not with the current ""only pay for cosmetics and side-grades"" model.

---

**So if the current monetization system isn't cutting it for PC, is PS4 likely to see the same system?  And if not, what is the most likely alternative?**

---

The key to answering this is understanding what the video calls ""whales"", the small proportion of F2P players who spend a massive amount of money on the game.  Under the current system, there is little incentive for whales to unload their wallets on Planetside 2.  There are cosmetics and guns to buy, but after spending a few hundred dollars, they likely have everything they want and don't need to spend more money to stay competitive.

**Whale money is being captured, just not in the US/EU market**

Enter [nanite refills](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/2awn0m/higby_says_that_nanite_refills_wont_be_available/).  This was mentioned in unofficial patch notes and quickly clarified by the Higby that it wouldn't cover US/EU, but would be available for other markets.

---

Based on developer comments regarding the need for supplemental monetization in the current system, and the fact that it already exists in some markets, **I believe purchasable nanite refills will be available on the PS4 version of Planetside 2.**  It's entirely possible that another monetization strategy will be used, but that's the most likely change to PS4's system in my view.",False,cnd29gb,,14,Sattorin,False,t3_2r73z8,t1_cnd29gb

The Japanese are less xenophobic towards whites because they've had more interactions with them (post WWII being the most poignant proximal example). They are more xenophobic towards other asians because of the inherent threat of their proximity and an incredibly long list of historical offenses both committed and received that dwarf any impression the US could make. They are more xenophobic towards other foreign non-whites because they haven't had the same centuries of interactions with them that they've had with Europe and the US. Most Japanese will never have much interaction with African or Arabic cultures (for example) and so its easy to stereotype, etc. 

Insinuating that the US somehow programmed or cultivated the Japanese into a particular xenophobia isn't just boiler-plate US-phobia  - its also pretty damn racist toward the Japanese to claim that their entire goddamn society (which has existed for generations) could be brainwashed in a few decades by a some implausibly nefarious US oligarchy.

I'm going to simplify the example in use of variables. While such an example does contain within it the underlying assumption of relational equation its use as an example will suffice,

   * [Assuming false-pretense or otherwise unjustified pretense]...state *W* acted in the wrong.

 * State *X* attacks state *Z*.

   * [Assuming false-pretense or otherwise unjustified pretense]...state *X* acted in the wrong.

      * Consideration of state *Z*'s positional, or retaliatory power in response.


[In this example, as per the argument you set up equating the two -- with which I hold contention -- *W* is the United States and *X* is Russia; or vice versa]


I can deplore the actions of both *W* and *X*. Similarly *W* and *X* can, at a later date, engage in a conflict wherein one or the other is correct, leaving the other unjustified.

Hope you've had a fantastic start to the new year and are looking forwards to another 12 months of crazy decks and fantastic Hearthstone marathons!  As for the latter, I'm beginning my first of the year right now on Twitch!  I am an EU player but have decided that there's not enough tournaments on the EU servers at the moment and I want to participate in the NA ones.  Therefore, I have started a free to play account on NA!  Over the next 24 hours I'll be showing people how I feel is the best way to optimise your first few days on Hearthstone and hopefully having quite a lot of fun in the meantime! 

So if you're pretty new to Hearthstone, a Free to Play-er or just looking for something a little different to ladder climbing alone, come join me at the link below!

Criminals should be brought to justice if they make a crime. But what is happening in this country is the sort of thinking, ""oh a Romanian stole  something, so now its ok to ban all Eastern Europeans from coming to this country incase they all decide to steal something"". Which shouldn't happen. 

I am agreeing, that benefits cheats do not resemble that most need this benefits and are not cheats, just like most EE are here to work and provide for this country, not cause problems like the media makes them out to be.

On the other hand, most Nordics know nothing about Baltic countries. Most have never been there. There is no cultural exchange.

In an EU filled with incredible contradictions, ridiculous retcons, massive universe shrinkage, and some absolutely terrible stories, having a personal canon has always been mandatory. Hell, with the many changes to (and suppression of) the Original Trilogy, the poor quality of the Prequel Trilogy and the subsequent shoehorning of PT/SE elements into everything, having a personal canon was the only way us OT purists could stay sane. We've been doing the personal canon thing for years now and it's great (for me, Filoni's Clone Wars series is all that's kept Star Wars decent in the past few years, and redeemed the entire PT era: those last few seasons were gold).

I'm fine with wiping out the EU, because most of it was awful, and I'm really excited to see what artists/authors/game makers do with the new blank slate and cohesive timeline: but that doesn't mean that you have to give up the bits of the old EU that you enjoyed, the only thing that changed was that they now have a new banner on the cover. Even if all the new EU is awful, you still have the stories you love from the old EU to fall back on, plus, there are already bits of the old EU creeping into the new stuff, so it's likely that a lot of things you enjoyed will come back in some form or another.

Had something happen that I have never seen in any of my other movies before.....a dude with a torch walked into the front of the theatre and then up the right hand side aisle and down the left, across the front and out he went.

Seeing that for the first time made me jump. For a second i didnt think anything of it,m then i realised im in VR land and nearly shat myself.

I can't wait for the day when multiplayer on this becomes available, lie a multi player PSP game where you can have other VR users come and sit in the theatre with you. Or go hang out at the beach together. Or when this turns into a facebook social media tool and you can go hang out in a park with your 4000 facebook friends. lol. 
When these get smaller and more practical, this will take over every digital social media platform we know. I aint looking forward to that really. I'd be walking along the beach on my own trying to squeeze past Ken and Barbie and their 4000 friends, or it could be 4000 seedy old men stalking them. lol.

first things first, head tracking so we can move seats.

bigger lenses
smaller frame.

P.S&gt; You know to watch your own side by side 3d movies, you have to put a seperate folder in ""My Videos"" and you have to call that folder ""3D"". In turn the VR then marks the films in my videos with a 3D box, and it plays it in 3D. Without that it wont play in 3d but only side by side. That is pretty smart so I am thinking there will be alot more other codes like this for other easter eggs.

For what it's worth wikipedia has a [nice summary as well](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahá'%C3%AD_Faith_and_auxiliary_language).

I am not sure how authoritative some scripture can be when it comes to using it as a blue print for a world charter. When Abdul-Baha made if American and European tour there were a few books that chronicled his talks. I assume they can be used for inspiration and for guidance - but considering the fact they were translated during the talks and then written down - they seem to be prone to some paraphrasing. I am not certain. But there was a time when Pilgrim notes were used during consultations of LSAs in small communities and it caused havoc so now they are read in proper perspective. I am not sure what the UHJ feels about quotes in ""Not Every Sea Has It's Pearls"" or ""Portals To Freedom"" and other landmark books of this nature where the author is quoting from memory or notes as opposed to Tablets written by the Master with his seal of approval. In Paris Talks it says 

&gt;Esperanto has been drawn up with this end in view: it is a fine invention and a splendid piece of work, but it needs perfecting. Esperanto as it stands is very difficult for some people.

But since this new language will be used in the Great Tribunal it still seems to be some years off - but we never really know. It could happen next week owing to the unpredictable nature of the changes and chances of world events.

Anarcho-capitalism, a system where there exists no state and no form of organization able to bear force upon the whole, is the brightest example of capitalism and a neo-feudalism. With no focused entity to protect the weak from the strong, anarcho-capitalism allows for the preexisting wealthy to capitalize on the common need of general welfare for the lower classes.

It is important to keep in mind that basic services must be provided by yourself and not by any sort of collaboration. In the lawlessness of true anarchy, the uneducated (remember no school system) masses will seek refuge in wealthy landowners, become their tenets and servants, with the promise of fire and police protection.

There was an anarcho-capitalism experiment right after the fall of Rome. And it doesn't take a history degree to realize it sucked to be a serf. Property-based economies don't work.

If you take perhaps a more rational approach and believe that the basic services should be banded together without centralized use of force and perhaps even more than the basic services should be united and possibly you employ the use of collaboration in the division of labor? Congratulations, you're an anarcho-communist! And also outside the realm of capitalism.

It would also be a lie for me to say I never found the idea of total freedom appealing. However, total “freedom” collapses as soon as a few bad actors ruin communities and make the masses fearful and seek out safety in a powerful figure. Individual freedom and individual success is an interesting concept, but I think mutual success with only a smidgen of freedom taxed away on your bill to be a much more appealing one.

In both capitalism and socialism, somebody is going to have give up some freedom. Compromise must be made when the community pools together. It is a solid belief of mine that it should be the freedom of the dollar sacrificed by the wealthy instead of the freedom of choice, expression and opportunity sacrificed by the working poor.

Right libertarians and so-called “minarchist” (minimal anarchism) believe they solve this deprecating image of their utopia by shifting the belief that basic services should be provided communally. It is interesting to note that these services are often demanded by those who would otherwise not be specialized enough to utilize them. Many people come to this form of libertarianism with the right intentions in mind. However, a system with a working class serving under a pool of wealth still sounds like a feudalism to me. This is only a “liberal” advance as an extra layer on-top of feudalism. 

Any additions to this “capitalism” (which is in essence just a return to feudalism), are called “liberal” advances. But where does liberalism lead? The path of modern political liberalism is not a long, winded path of reformism to a Scandinavian utopia, rather it is a treadmill that masquerades under a banner of “progress” to justify the atrocities of the State.

Most States today are some kind of liberal democratic capitalist society.

In this capitalist society, some people own the means of production (farms, factories, businesses) and the remaining majority must work for wages.

Wage slavery is perhaps even more dangerous than the permanent slavery because as a slave to your wage as a source of well-being, you are being rented instead of owned. If you are to die or be inadequate at your job, you can be easily replaced unlike the permanent slave who is much more expensive to maintain and replace. The only reason American slavery in the South was abolished was because of the availability of wage slavery in the North.

Those who run the means of production, the owners, are forced to shift costs to others. This is the only way businesses can stay afloat. By paying workers as little as possible and ignoring the well-being of the environment and the community, the owner of the business has to use cut-throat tactics. It is no surprise that psychopathic tendencies are more common amongst CEOs. In the modern stock market, the black sheep effect allows for a few more selfish and greedy individuals to act on “the behalf of the shareholders” to undermine outside concerns. Small, local businesses are of course able to ignore this due to a lack of any major competition. However, with the Wal-Martization of every business, how long “mom and pop” business mentalities will be able to last is unknown.

Historically, capitalism has relied on the unpaid work of women in the domestic setting for things like cooking and cleaning. This is of course coupled with the historic suppression of women such as a lack of voting rights. It has only been in recent decades, as the force of capital has allowed for women to go out and get jobs. This “progress” is only a mask. Before, women were treated as commodities of her father until her marriage when she became a commodity of her husband. Now, however, due simply to the demands of competition in the global economy, that the woman can be a commodity of capitalism, like her partner. How can you call yourself free, if you simply share the same shackles?

Feminism, should therefore be coupled with anti-capitalism, to advocate for liberation from the oppressor.

Some capitalists argue that capitalism is a natural product of human evolution. Capitalism is rather a continuation of feudalism by imperialism. Capitalism was established by advances in technology by taking mostly self-sufficient farmers often thought of as “peasants” into the cities and made them work in the new industries. In England, those who refused were subjected to the Vagabonds Act of 1597 where punishments included imprisonment or execution.

European competition and imperialism help spread capitalism to other nations.

Liberal responses to capitalism such as universal healthcare and social security help prevent the overthrow of the capitalism by making concessions to socialism while remaining in a capitalist framework.

Not all responses in capitalism are liberal. In the United States, the social conservative populism of the Christian Right is an important political factor. Historically, fascism and Russian “communism” were authoritarian. 

Social welfare helps legitimatize the authority of the State and thus the authority of capitalism. Social welfare which benefits the poor can create dependance on the State and is used to help appease the working poor or the unemployed poor from violent revolution. Granted the State also fails to educate the poor, the poor becomes ignorant of other options for their lives such as communal self-sufficiency which would allow for more time dedicated to art and hobbies.

It is only by the education of socialist revolution that humanity can liberate themselves from class oppression. Yes, there will always be rich and poor. Yes, there can still be financial successes and financial failures. There could even still be markets and federal governments. But what all socialists adhere to is the notion that all human beings are worthy of opportunity to pursue their dreams, live comfortably and have humanity move forward together, as equals, rather as servants of the few.",False,cnd3xbt,,2,jonathan_ross,False,t3_2r6boq,t1_cnd3xbt

Can you expand on this a bit? Does this mean that she likes making lots of algebraic manipulations? Solving hard integrals? Optimizing? Just plain old thinking hard?

In the camp of ""just plain old thinking"", you might try the following games:

* Freecell, the one that comes on Windows.
* [Dominion](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion), a (very fun) card game that has a lot of interesting math in it. Many mathematicians I know really like this game.
* Magic the Gathering, which Mensa describes as a cross between Chess and Poker.
* [Caylus](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus). A *very* european style board game with almost 0 randomness.

Alternatively, you guys could try learning a bit of [Ramsey Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory) for finite graphs. Going through the known small cases would be fun, and there are some nice probabilistic estimates known that aren't too hard to go through. The [Wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem) is a good place to start. It has some of the basic arguments and links to more.

Like others, I will also recommend Project Euler. They are mostly math problems, and are very rewarding. There is a lot of discussion possible, as thinking through a solution is 75% of the work, and coding/debugging is the other 25%.

You could go with rock art,  but there is some interpretation there. For example,  Gwion Gwion figures (also known as Bradshaw figures) are old rock paintings. They cross the county of two current cultures (with quite different religions and marriage customs). One of those tribes claims they are made by a bird spirit . The other lot just shrug and say ""they are like a diary "", depicting ordinary people going about their lives - hunting,  feeding children and dancing. It has to be said,  the costumes worn by the figures in the paintings are pretty similar to early photos of men from the area kitted out for ceremony, but there is a chicken and egg problem with that. 

The paintings are many thousands of years old though and it seems to me that they pre-date the cultures that were there when Europeans first arrived in the area.

&gt;The Life of an American Jew in Racist, Marxist Israel by Jack Bernstein http://jackbernstein.blogspot.com/

&gt;I am well aware of the tactics of you, my Zionist brethren, use to quiet anyone who attempts to expose any of your subversive acts.
&gt;If the person is a Gentile, you cry, ""You're anti-semitic"" which is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide your actions.

&gt;But, if a Jew is the person doing the exposing, you resort to other tactics.

&gt; First, you ignore the charges, hoping the information will not be given widespread distribution.

&gt;If the information starts reaching too many people, you ridicule the information and the persons giving the information.

&gt;If that doesn't work, your next step is character assassination. If the author or speaker hasn't been involved in sufficient scandal you are adept at fabricating scandal against the person or persons.

&gt;If none of these are effective, you are known to resort to physical attacks.

&gt;But, NEVER do you try to prove the information wrong.

&gt;Judaism is a religion; but Zionism is a political movement started mainly by East European (Ashkenazi) Jews who for centuries have been the main force behind communism/socialism. The ultimate goal of the Zionists is one ONE-WORLD GOVERMENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ZIONISTS AND THE ZIONIST-ORIENTED JEWISH INTERNATIONAL BANKERS.

The measures taken have been arresting the debt spiral. It is up to the Greek government to find more ways to balance their budget so that they can achieve a fiscal surplus, leading to lower borrowing rates, and the ability to pay down some debt so they have some breathing space.

&gt;The reality is that in a monetary union there are no individual debts and there are no individual countries all independent from each other.

Of course there are individual debts. I don't know why you're saying this, the consequences of Greece defaulting do not reflect on the other countries (except for the marginal pressure creditors may be able to impose on other eurozone economies to try and get them to pressure Greece into paying back some defaulted debt). The other solutions you proposed in another post elsewhere in this submission are structural changes that would require treaty change and the unanimous consent of those countries. Those solutions basically burn away any 'firewall' between one countries debt and another, and represent costs to countries that managed their finances responsibly to help out those countries that didn't. They ignore that the EU is not a single state, it is a mechanism by which multiple states can cooperate in some areas, and retain sovereignty in others - and you want other countries to give up that sovereignty because Greece fucked up. There are a number of articles in that list that are purple links for me. 

I haven't tried to explain the whole 'crisis' in these four paragraphs. I tried to give a brief overview of the system, and how Greece has fucked up within that system. Creditors are the key uncontrollable factor in any solution to Greece's woes, and Greece just needs to continue trying to fix their perception of Greece. 

&gt;There is no magical fix, sure. Did I say there was? Your eagerness to present your opponent as a populist is a sign of poverty of arguments.

Against all odds, all of the fifteen million British people now alive had survived the first post-apocalyptic winter - they all remembered the figuratively dark days of May and June and the literally dark days of November and December last year - everyone worked together to plant and harvest crops, to hunt for their meat, because not doing so would mean death. No-one knew where the government was - the first world had been brought to its knees, by a kind of *1859 part two*, just six days before a general election. The BBC was down - even BBC Radio 4's *Today* programme - yet the people of Britain, many of them rioting over a lack of food and clean water, never saw a second apocalypse in the form of nuclear hellfire raining down upon them circa May 10th.

By now there had been almost twenty months since the lights went out - the full moon had shone down upon post-apocalyptic Earth on twenty-one separate occasions - 2016 had been a lot better, on the whole, than the horrific year of our Lord 2015, but not nearly as good as 2014 had been, with its well over a thousand square meals for the majority of Europeans and Americans, and clean water you could obtain merely by turning on a tap. Two thousand and sixteen, the year of settling down and trying to rebuild, had been not nearly as good as two thousand and fourteen, a year when you could obtain information about an event happening anywhere in the world - the invasion of Crimea, the football tournament in Brazil, the innumerable plane crashes that seemed to happen within the boundaries of 2014 ...

But, every year since their childhood, they'd dutifully stayed up until midnight to welcome in the New Year. That Thursday night at the tail end of 2015 had been no exception, so why should this Saturday night at the tail end of 2016? They'd made some fireworks, their use dating back to seventh-century China, earlier on in the year. There was no televised spectacle - Jool's Annual Hootenanny on BBC One, Big Ben's twelve chimes resounding across the country - that was not going to happen for the second year in a row, but that didn't stop them having their little moment of normality in the post-apocalypse.

The grandfather clock began to chime the Westminster quarters; when the second hand reached the number ten, they both began to shout:

""Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, happy new year!""

Ok, let's get our atrocities straight: Pogroms were riots where mobs of people destroyed homes and businesses and killed people. They were directed specifically at Jews and happened under the Tzar and before the communist revolution. There were no pogroms after the revolution, including during Stalin's rule, but there were somewhat random wide-spread arrests that would end with the person being unjustly executed or sent to a labor camp. But at that point, there were no black people in the USSR. They started coming later as foreign students and were certainly not sent to labor camps. The whole point was PR and crating a pro-soviet professional class in Africa. The biracial people he went to study are the children of those students.

But, yeah, Ukraine has a weird and disturbing in-your-face racism. Though it is not really about ""black"" and ""white"" but more of a preoccupation with ethnicity. Even ""non-fascist"" people are convinced that your ethnicity is genetic and largely determines your abilities, culture, and personality, and that there is a clear hierarchy of ethnicities. If a country is poor and has social problems, it is because the predominant ethnic group is inferior and vice verse. Being black just happens to put you on the low end of the hierarchy. 

So maybe Ukraine isn't full of the kind of fascists who are fans of Nazi Germany, but it is full of people who believe this kind of stuff. For that matter, so is Russia. But Russian Federation covers a territory populated by all kinds of non-slavic cultures and as a state is forced to deal with ethnic diversity in some positive way. I don't know the details, but at least there are plenty of non-ethnic Russians in government and public life. But in Ukraine there is a lot of focus of finding the true Ukrainian ethnic identity which, for whatever reason, is supposed to be more ""European"" and civilized, and once it is found, prosperity and justice will ensue.

In the US, topless men are okay but not so with women in most places—there is even a debate on whether public breast feeding is acceptable! 

There are many more examples. But bottom line, we are not really a tolerant society and free thinking is uncommon, and we are happy to push our prejudices in the name of religion, society, public safety, etc. We confuse norms with identity, and we are very afraid to lose that self constructed identity..",False,cnd71om,,1,zenquest,False,t3_2r4rb2,t1_cnd71om

That being said, it would be extremely naive of me to say that there are no issues in this country pertaining to misogyny.

• En Suecia, el recorte de gasto y privatización de la atención a mayores fue uno de los factores que, en 2014, le costó las elecciones al Ejecutivo de centroderecha.

Any genetic material is inherently fragile to outside influences in the form of enzymes, acids, and concentration gradients.

I did not assume anything that you did not already give me. Your argument states that enzymes can destroy genetic material. I agree. But where did the enzymes come from without organisms made from the very genetic material that you said could not form? That is from your argument, not mine. 

As for the concentration gradient, the difference between the two type is vastly different. Without a physical barrier, the change in concentration is much more gradual, much like that of salinity at the mouth of a river. There is no line marking fresh water from salt water, it is a gradual increase that at some point fresh water fish will not be able to survive in. That delineation is much less of a problem when dealing with this situation than a membrane induced concentration gradient where the two distinct sides of the barrier are vastly different.

As for your question of how can they be atheists. I have read the Bible many times myself. I actually did (many years ago) my high school term paper on the Book of Revelations while comparing that to the Norse and Roman mythologies views on the end of times. The many contradictions of the Bible is one of the reasons why I am an atheist. 

As for correlating what the Bible says to the current state of the world; laughable argument. Society has fallen apart much more than it has/will today. Go back and study Christian/European history from 500 AD to 1500 AD. Are you telling me that society was in a golden age then? If the end of times was real, that would be where I think it would have happened; or, around the time Jesus was supposedly alive through the hundred years or so after his death, which is what many biblical scholars believe the Book of Revelations was describing.

History

2010-11: Peter Cehlarik played for the MsHK Zilina U18 team in his native Slovakia. He scored 15 goals with 18 assists and was +8 with 8 penalty minutes in 40 games.

2011-12: Cehlarik skated in six game for MsHK Zilina's U18 and spent most of the season playing in the Lulea club in Sweden. He scored 6 goals with 2 assists and had 16 penalty minutes in six games in Zilina. Cehlarik played eight regular season games for Lulea's U20 team, scoring 2 goals with 2 assists, and was +4 with 2 penalty minutes. He had a hat trick in his only playoff game. In 28 games for the Lulea U18 team, including four playoff games, he scored 17 goals with 15 assists and was +13.

2012-13:Cehlarik made his pro debut in Sweden's Elitserien — playing in eight regular season games and six playoff contests for Lulea — and represented Slovakia in the 2013 U18 World Junior Championship. He scored 3 goals with 3 assists for Lulea during the regular season and had 1 goal in the playoffs. Cehlarik scored 17 goals with 20 assists and was -1 with 10 penalty minutes in 38 games for Lulea's U20 team during the regular season and had 1 assist in three playoff games. Cehlarik was dominant in domestic U18 play, scoring 8 goals with 9 assists in 10 games for Lulea. In six games at the U18 WJC he scored 2 goals with 5 assists and was -2. Cehlarik was ranked 28th amongst European skaters in Central Scouting's final rankings and was selected by Boston in the third round (90th overall) of the 2013 NHL Draft.

 

Talent Analysis

Cehlarik is a big-bodied winger with a high offensive pedigree and a goal scoring release. He could develop into a top-six forward down the line.

Future

The Slovak native will continue his development overseas during the 2013-14 season after a strong debut, in the SEL, last season with six points, in eight games.  He is still years away from the NHL

Mormon answer: Well actually, there is evidence! You see, when the Americas were discovered by Europeans they found that there were already people living here!  The Native Americans are actually the Lamanites!

If you read the Bible, there's even more evidence. John 10:16 is after Jesus has been resurrected. He is giving his departing words to his beloved apostles: 

And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd


Those other sheep he was referring to were the Nephites. After Jesus ascended to heaven, he actually came to the American continents, and for a short time he  taught and proselytized and worked miracles amongst them. That's why we call The Book of Mormon ""another testement of Jesus Christ"".

The Book of Mormon ITSELF is evidence.  What it is, is a COLLECTION of HISTORICAL and spiritual records from many different prophets, much like the bible, composed together into one darned good book by the HISTORIAN Mormon. 

My favorite bible verse is James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. 

That's a promise from our Father in Heaven that if you want to know the truth about something, you can ask him directly and HE will reveal things to YOU. Personal confirmation from Heavenly Father is THE greatest evidence of all. Can we take the time to offer a prayer, that maybe he can open your heart to the truth of what I testify?

&gt; The tao which can be spoken is not the eternal tao.

The legend, which is probably embellished, has it that Lao Tzu was accosted by a follower as he was riding off into the wilderness who asked him to record his beliefs in writing. He began the writing, supposedly the Tao Te Ching, with that line, composed one of the most succinct philosophical texts in history, and was never seen again. So it goes, anyway.

The spirit of the philosophy, or religion, or whatever, is purely in its subtleties. In my own opinion, it's not something one needs to actively practice; rather, it should be *understood*. As a physics student I've certainly wondered more than once how my career and my philosophy can coexist, but as Niels Bohr would say, they're actually quite complementary. I used to consider ways in which I might practice Taoism and incorporate it into my life (groups, rituals, etc), but I soon realized that the flaws I saw in other religions arose from arguments between people about superficial differences that emerged only due to the inadequacies of language and interaction. Not only was there no need to go beyond understanding, to practice and thereby display my understanding publicly would only subject it to erosion by the misunderstanding of others. Unlike science, which attempts to *describe* in a universal language and to as wide an audience as possible, philosophy should attempt to *explain* in no language at all and only to an individual. Our vast understandings of science and, to a greater degree, mathematics have all but proven that any attempts at teleological explanation in a universal language are futile. For this reason, I hold that the greatest danger to one's understanding of the tao is to attempt to remove it from the realm of thoughts and expose it to the harsh winds of language. True adherence to the principles of Taoism, at least in my interpretation, means following the oscillations of your path, but not deviating from it sharply just to appease the false belief that a religion should be practiced in some outwardly perceptible way.

I've continued to study physics and every day I speak deterministically against my philosophical intuition. I've been looking into potential business ventures or the possibility of graduate school enthusiastically (and hey, even the Buddha was a businessman for a while!). I have one friend I occasionally discuss Taoism with, but the occasion is rare. And yet, I'm quite satisfied with the way I practice this philosophy (or don't, rather), because I've seen the Tao in magnetic fields, in market trends, and at the races, and every time it's immensely gratifying. A truly universal thing needs no particular setting to display itself.

**TL,DR:** My advice is this: do what you enjoy, live as you would normally live, and try to see the Tao without any silly ritualism or major lifestyle changes. Your appreciation of it will be all the better for having done so.

PS - If you really want to fill your time with something to enhance your appreciation of Taoism, I'd encourage you to learn about European philosophies. I've found that some of the modern (&gt;1900) work bridges the gap really nicely between Asian philosophy and the originally European scientific tradition that most of us Americans have grown up immersed in (whether you realize it or not). Look into the existentialists (Sartre, Camus) and some of the more abstract mathematicians (Gödel, Russell, et al). Note that Russell and some of the other mathematicians are more interesting to the Taoist for what they failed to do. Taoism isn't rich with literature and doesn't need to be, but there is something to be gained from the works of other, more verbose philosophies.

And as another guy mentioned, nature is not in short supply. It makes a fantastic setting for reading about philosophy.",False,cnd89x6,,3,gammalbjorn,False,t3_2r6ozo,t1_cnd89x6

The understanding that the Bible was authored by God himself came to strong prominance in the late 1800's, in response to something out of Europe called the Protestant ""Modernist"" movement. The core of that movement was basically, though some would argue that I'm being too glib pretty strenuously, to convert Christianity into a humanist charity organization similar to the Kiwanis Club, or something. Proponents frequently denied the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, etc. It got to the point where the anti-supernaturalism was so bad that there are Easter sermons from that era, from the holiest of all Christian holidays, where the preacher's sermon on the women finding Jesus at the tomb at dawn centered around the dangers of catching cold or falling and injuring yourself from taking early morning walks.

While some Protestants took a more moderate position, that the Bible was the ""inspired"" (a numinous word) word of God authored by fallible people, with errors and misrepresentations and the like, an idea which, by the way, justifies Jesus' not-infrequent correction to the OT scriptures that his Father would otherwise have supposedly handed down immutably, other Christians began to embrace the seeds of modern Fundamentalism, including making a belief in absolute biblical inerrancy a core part of being a Christian, and anathematizing any who refused to get in line.

At first, these men were scholars, and so their positions were moderate. One theologian from Princeton wrote that even those who disagree with him and think the bible is full of errors, as long as they believe Jesus died and rose from the dead and trust him as Lord, are Christians, because that is the essential part of Christianity. In a savage twist of irony, the fundamentalist denomination he helped to found now holds inerrancy as a staple tenet; the founder would be excommunicated from the faith he helped to nurture. 

All this is to say that there's a lot more going on than a simple desire to cover up the unpleasantness of the Old Testament. Jesus himself removes and fiddles with some parts of the OT, and completely neglects to mention or enforce any number of repugnant passages. The ugliness of those stories is not something humanists discovered; the ancient theologian Marcion believed YHWH, the God of the Jews/Old Testament, to be an evil being that was not connected to the god Jesus of Nazareth called ""father.""

Go read up some of the other conspiracies written up by William Engdahl. They include points such as global warming being a hoax, oil being non biologically based, and that the United States carried out the entire Arab Spring. I cannot take him seriously in this context.

The other sources I can find document a 5.1% retraction, but at the same time many of the sources are varying. 5.1% retraction would be in line with a civil war, losing a domestic region, and the costs of waging that civil war.

Missed the currency conversion, apologies. Now better question, where did that number come from? Ive found a few RT articles stating "" Kyiv estimates"" for that number, and a statement from Putin with that number. That's without considering most of the money would be invested in modernizing large portions of Ukrainian infrastructure, rather than additional loans. 

100 million Russia could and has turned off whenever it feels angry at the Ukraine, not sure that's money safe to budget up.

You sure are pushing hard on that puppet allegation, without any real proof supporting it. 

&gt;The EU trade agreement is still on hold, so the Euromaiden protests achieved nothing, except to replace one set of corrupt Oligarchs in power in Kiev, with another set of corrupt Oligarchs, saw the rise of Fascism and Bandera supporters in Ukraine as US puppets, ruined Ukraine's economy and devalued the currency, started a civil war which has wasted over $1bn so far, under the terms of the IMF loan which insisted on the maintenance of Ukraine's territorial integrity and which is murdering thousands of Ukrainians and causing misery to millions.

It got rid of one incredibly corrupt government that outlawed protesting, seems like a decent result. See my previous comment on your puppet allegation. Civil wars propped up by Russian troops and armed with Russian weapons tend to hurt your economy a bit. I don't think the IMF needs to tell Ukraine to try and maintain their territory, they'll do that without any motivation. 

I have research it, and that's why im waiving the bullshit flag on your posts here. Your economist link mostly talks about the loss of outside private investment. That's understandable when for a few months most of the Western world was waiting for Russian tanks to break the berms and push for Kyiv.

&gt; For Marion Crane, it's been quite an eventful day. The day before, she had stolen $40,000 from her employer's client, packed her bags and driven all day on her way to join her paramour several hundred miles away. Now, she is taking a relaxing hot shower after her long day's journey. The remoteness of the motel suit her purposes perfectly. The only sounds heard are the chirping of the crickets, the splashing of the water, and her humming contentedly as the hot needles of water caress her aching shoulders.

**Critical reception:**

&gt; Initial reviews of the film were thoroughly mixed. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, ""There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job."" Crowther called the ""slow buildups to sudden shocks"" reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock's psychological points, reminiscent of Krafft-Ebing's studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast's performances as ""fair"". British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer. Other negative reviews stated, ""a blot on an honorable career"", ""plainly a gimmick movie"", and ""merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours."" Positive reviews stated, ""Anthony Perkins' performance is the best of his career ... Janet Leigh has never been better"", ""played out beautifully"", and ""first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films."" A good example of the mix is the New York Herald Tribune's review, which stated, ""... rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take ... keeps your attention like a snake-charmer.""

1) Firstly, Medicaid and Medicare help tackle those most near the poverty line. The expansion of Medicaid under the ACA also has enrolled more than ever before in free healthcare or in subsidized healthcare plans. 

2)Not sure what race has to do with this, as the system is designed for everyone to enroll now. Before race was a major factor as finances played a major part, but expanded Medicaid coverage has removed that from the equation. Whatever state you're in has to have a program now. 

3)We once again, do have a system similar to Japan under the ACA. I think that healthcare should all be public, as do you, but I am sure you know nothing of the difference between the NHS, Bismark system, French model, or Soviet model.

It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France.

The key in searching the literature at this point is to look towards studies conducted in places like Canada and Europe where brand name cannabinoid mixtures (e.g. Sativex) or in the US where synthetic cannabinoids such as nabiximols have been used due to DEA restrictions on the acquisition of marijuana for research.  If you are interested, you can view our research proposal which cites the studies I am referring to here: http://www.ccc-ct.com/#!research/c1jm5

The study you linked is flawed in its methodology due to a sample selection bias on persons with ""cannabis dependence"". It would be akin to testing the efficacy of xanax in generalized anxiety disorder by selecting a sample defined as ""benzodiazepine abusers"" or chose to test a new analgesic on patients who self-described as dependent on heroin or prescription painkillers. I did not look too in depth into the study you linked, but many of them even explicitly state selecting a sample out of veterans with PTSD who are seeking treatment for substance abuse or diagnosed with a comorbid substance induced mood disorder. What kind of results do they expect? Once you eliminate the aspect that these studies have been selecting candidates on the basis of drug abuse and substance dependence, you see a significant change in patient outcomes.

Regardless, it really would depend. A board of physicians in the state of Connecticut has reviewed a majority of available literature in approving the current conditions, so there is indeed a scientific reasoning for them already. If a study were to come out tomorrow saying cannabis is ineffective for PTSD we would be skeptical for many reasons, the least of which would be the fact that we have witnessed first hand anecdotal evidence to the contrary. If the study were to prevent valid evidence that it was harmful to the patients, and was readily reproduced in another peer reviewed journal, we would have to fall in line with how the state of Connecticut responded - but we wouldn't continue to ever provide a medication we believed to be harmful to our patients. 

Ultimately, we are not physicians. We are well versed in the literature but have not gone to medical school and don't claim to have the knowledge base to prescribe medication in any form. As the program goes on, many physicians are recommending patients and using their clinical expertise and judgement to see how they respond. As we see more and more patients improve, we know their doctors do too, so as long as a patient is recommended by their physician and no absolute contraindications exist, we will follow their guide. Similarly, as long as we believe that the state's regulations are driven entirely by the interests of patients and medical expertise, we will support any of their decisions.",False,cndbz7r,,2,Compassionatecarect,False,t3_2r5wwp,t1_cndbz7r

A 50 kWh pack that can accept higher charge rates for longer periods (135 kW = 2.7C) should be able to accept a 70% charge in 15 minutes. In most cases, that will be enough to get to the next supercharger station (90 minutes of driving); a 300 mile trip would require perhaps one 15 minute stop in a Model S, or two 15 minute stops in a Model 3.

By 2017, I see one of three things happening.

1. The Supercharger network is sufficiently dense that range becomes a relatively small concern. Yes, there will be some conditions where more range is helpful, and a higher capacity Model 3 or S85 may be able to skip some stations if they are overcrowded.

2. The US, or more likely Europe, sees massive rollouts of 100 kW CCS stations. I expect Tesla is planning for this eventuality, much as they (eventually) offered a CHAdeMO adapter for the Model S. It would probably require a state-level effort to match Tesla's Supercharger network, but a well-supported CCS network would reduce the need for Tesla to roll out their own.

3. Tesla fails. The Supercharger network is relatively low cost. If Tesla can't at least maintain their current rollout pace to bring #1 into existence then something else will have gone horribly wrong and the company will have folded. IMO.",False,cndc9f7,,3,protomech,False,t3_2r7ylf,t1_cndc9f7

From what I gather (and may be subject to debate), the mariachi group has seen three stages of evolution since the French wanted to know the ensemble's name in the 1800s.

The first stage is Folkloric, usually small groups of string-based players with violins, an harp and various guitars types, with their origins in Michoacan. The skill ceiling is mostly 1 or 2 part singing, fiddler-level violin play, guitar chords and the odd harp solo here and there. Keep in mind that the trumpet use here is anachronistic, since the trumpet was added later on. As example is the old interpretation of La Negra: http://youtu.be/LX_sS8Fzd7Y 

The next stage is Traditional, mostly initiated in Jalisco. It came with a standardization of uniforms and group elements, instrument experimentation with the addition of trumpets and the integration of classical music theory. That came to be with the involvement of Mariachi music within the golden age of cinema in Mexico in the 40s/50s and preceded with the advent of radio. This is the style that most people remember in general and a backbone to any mariachi's repertoire, with legendary people which have yet to be replaced, such as Pedro Infante for singers or Miguel Martinez ""el Trompas"" for the trumpet. As an example of this is an excerpt from the movie Escuela de Vagabundos: http://youtu.be/F7i3xljYFpg

The latest stage is Modern. As mariachi started to fall in the cultural foreground of Mexico, the musicians started travelling outside of Mexico more often and established themselves further out in America, Europe and Asia. In addition of this expansion, their musical flexibility and the balance within the core elements permits them to be easily inserted into many projects, which often brings them to work with different music genres and even orchestras. As for musicians in this era, we got Vicente Fernandez with a well-aged and very conservative style, Mariachi El Bronx as one of the most progressive approaches and Luis Miguel that uses Pop culture as a middle ground.

RE: Chaka Resignation and the dissolution of FAS/WADA 

""Zululand wants a united Africa, but only if the sovereignty of all nations within it is respected. This means that we do not accept their demands - it is the right of all people to enjoy self determination. Foreign leaders, even our brother Africans, have no right to interfere in our affairs - and vice versa. When Ethiopia expelled the Muslims, we minded our business. When the Dakari invaded South America and kidnapped her citzens - we minded our business. When the people of Carthage fought among themselves, and likes vultures to a feast, the international community interfered, prolonging the war, the suffering, the death - we minded our business. 

Only when the legitimate government of a region asks for us to interfere, as our South American friends asked us to reveal to the world European imperialist treachery, do we do so. 

This extends to economic matters as well - we are against a united currency, not least because, as the largest single gold producing nation in the world, it would deplete our treasury at a greater rate than anyone else. Such deals are not in the interests of our people, and we will not entertain them.

FAS, unlike the UAS and unlike WADA, is a treaty which recognizes the brotherhood of all Africans - and their equality. This means non-interference. This means respecting sovereignty. 

There are four African states who refuse to engage with us - The Aswan, the United Republic, Dakar, and Benin. This was their choice, not ours. Ask them why we enjoy a healthy and happy relationship with the WADA member Tanzania. Our relationships with Carthage, Egypt, Madagascar, Ciyawe, and we once would have named Ethiopia, are happy, healthy, and mutually beneficial. We have no quarrel with the people of Altif, the people of Rattisan, or the people of the Congo - despite their Afrikaner heritage. This dispute and division originates from three states - The United Republic, Benin, and Dakar.

Zululand is a constitutional republic. Minority communities across the land enjoy autonomy. There was excess in our history. There was evil. The same is true of your own history, my friend. It is not the modern practice. 

Chaka will not resign, because to do so would be to recognize the legitimacy of these complaints, succumb to the terrorism of these nations - and worst of all, deny the right of the Zululander people, who support him, to elect their own leaders and govern their own affairs. 

Who are the powers dividing the continent? Is it truly us? What insult did we ever give the West African states prior to their denunciations? We embargoed their ally, Iceland? Their ally, who was complicit in a plan to conquer and subjugate an entire continent of people? Is that worth an attempt on my life?

Let's at least get the facts straight:

&gt; 1764: France arrives to the islands

&gt; 1766: Britain arrives to the islands

A somewhat misleading representation of the discovery of the islands (for a start, we established control in 1765, not 1766). 
Some Frenchmen set up a colony there, but British sailors arrived and claimed the islands for Britain so, by all accounts, the islands were either British or French before any thing else. Even if they really were French first, how does this mean they are Argentinian? I don't see you saying anywhere that the islands should be under French control (but this is probably because you seem to have some kind of phobia of 1st world countries, since you said in another comment you don't want a European country (even though 97% of [Argentinines are of European descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentines_of_European_descent)) in control as they can use is an a 'forward base' or something). 

&gt; 1774: Britain leaves the islands voluntarily because of economic reasons of the time (I think it was related to the american independance ^[sic], but I'm not sure)

No. We never left the islands voluntarily. [The Spanish invaded and captured the Islands by force.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Port_Egmont) Also, this was in 1770, not 1774.

&gt; 1832: A mutin happens [...]

It's worth noting that the[ retaking of the islands in 1833](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reassertion_of_British_sovereignty_over_the_Falkland_Islands_\(1833\)) (not 1832) means that the islands have under British control longer than Argentina has been a country under it's current [constitution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Argentina)

This whole argument of yours that whoever was there first has the right to control the islands is ridiculous in my opinion (and that of the UN). This is 2015 and we believe in democracy, so whatever the islanders want is the most important thing. *They want to be part of the UK, so they are.* If they didn't then they would most likely be abdicated, just as Ireland (and many others) was. Furthermore, the points about abandoning colonialism fall completely flat, seeing as how you want the islands to be under Argentinian control as opposed to them becoming an independent state. Argentina won't get one kilometre of the islands as long as the citizens want to remain British, yet Kirchner remains firm that the Falklands belong to 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also saw your post in /r/Argentina regarding the issue. I found the replies incredibly interesting, as most people seemed to regard the issue of little importance (as far as I could tell using Google Translate, anyway), which I would agree with. I thought Argentines would be more assertive of the government's stance on issue since there is a lot of [propaganda](http://en.mercopress.com/2014/11/22/uk-reacts-to-malvinas-are-argentine-signs-on-public-transportation) regarding the issue.
It seems to many non-Argentines that the military junta in control of Argentina in 1982 only invaded to take the attention of the populace away from the other issues in the country as the time, believing the UK would not fight back and the islands could be annexed and this would gain support for the junta. In the end this ended up backfiring as Thatcher gained support and we had to put up with her for another term.

But anyway, I'm more interested in what other Argentines think of the issue: 

* In your experience, do most people in Argentina believe they have a right to the islands? 
* Is there more support for Argentinian claim to the islands among younger or older generations?
* Can you also tell me whether they *actually* have posters up on public transport saying the islands belong to Argentina as the previous source suggests?

Obviously, fans - like all human beings - tend to be biased in terms of ascribing superior qualities (in this context, Force power) to characters they personally like, and equally obviously the characters fans tend to like the most are the ones they are exposed to first and most (and of course fewer fans will even know about these dudes in contrast to, say, Vader).

But I think those more learned of the EU, and less swayed by personal bias, tend to - however reluctantly, as, let's face it, Vader is freaking awesome - admit that Vader would certainly not be equal to these Lords. Malak and Malgus are the closest to Vader in terms of understanding of the more arcane aspecs of the Force (in other words, all of them rather lacking), and I think they'd all accept each other as much as any other Sith, possessing rather similar personalities. Still, I'd imagine they'd be rather doubtful of Vader's Sith philosophies, since they herald from the pre-Rule of Two era, and there's certainly a whole host of Force powers that we see them display that eclipse Vader's, with Force lightning being just the most obvious.

Andeddu certainly had no respect for any 'lesser Sith' - he would have berated Vader as Palpatine's dog, as you say, and even a fellow Sith Master I'd hardly see him embracing as an equal. The truth is, Andeddu achieved more in terms of immortality than Plagueis ever did; there's scarcely any method of Sith immortality that Andeddu hadn't mastered. We have examples, like Palpatine or Vitiate, of Sith being able to transfer their intellect between different bodies, thus allowing them to live on after physical death in a new host body. We have Exar Kun and many of the ancient Sith binding their essences to physical objects or locations, and thus remaining in the physical world as haunting spirits. We have Darth Sion simply *refuse to die,* with no amount of slicing apart with lightsabers preventing him from keeping his body animate, like some sort of zombie that can't even be felled with a shot to the head.

Only Darth Andeddu mastered all three, as well as a whole host of ancient Sith sorcery far more impressive than you'd ever see in the movies. There's not much of a comparison.

Revan, likewise, easily surpassed Vader in terms of knowledge of the Force, as well as a whole host of other attributes - such as not being the apprentice to another Sith Lord, for starters, as well as strategic and tactical sense. Darth Bane approaches Palpatine levels of power, and surpasses his successor in several aspects, so ditto here. Darth Ruin, we're not so sure of, but he believed himself to be a god, formed a Sith Empire so formidable it would last a thousand years and come to dominate most of the galaxy, and the character's creator believed it took all fifty of his Sith followers to overthrow him; if throwaway statements regarding Ruin being in the ""Darth Traya mold"" are taken more literally rather than less, then yes, Ruin would similarly curbstomp Vader, and he certainly wouldn't accept Vader as an equal, as Ruin actually believed he was the only living being in existence and all of the Universe was a figment of his imagination.",False,cndejb3,,1,KOTORman,False,t3_2qjlq1,t1_cndejb3

The circumstances of the Gypsies is more analogous to that of the Jews than was the homosexuals.  Yet there were also differences between their situation and that of the Jews.  The Gypsies, while never having been strongly integrated into the areas they resided in, were not seeking their own nation. Yet the situation of the Roma Gypsie today does tend to undermine your point, as relations between them and the surrounding communities, particularly in the areas where most reside, is not good and, by many measures, has grown worse in recent years.  


""...but we can draw another lesson from that than that we needed Israel. It could be that the world needs to do much more in the face of such crimes.""

No doubt the world needs to do more, but, as they saying goes, people don't eat the long run, they eat everyday.   The reality was that, after WWII, the world was not willing to do more to find other alternatives for Jews.  The only alternative, which was no alternative at all, was for Jews in Europe to return to their nations of origin--mostly Eastern Europe, or remain in DP camps in Germany.  The Jews did not want to return to these nations and they were not wanted, and in many cases, not safe  there either.  

The US also was not an alternative for most. Congress passed the Displaced Persons act of 1948, amending US immigration law to allow some European refugees to come to the US.  The President signed it, but issues a signing statement calling the law ""anti-Semitic"" in its impact--it was written so as to exclude the vast majority of Jews who survived in Europe.  Public opinion, at the time, was overwhelmingly against changing immigration laws.  In the meantime, Jewish survivors, from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, were continuing to flood into the US Zone of Germany, adding further tension and pressure.  

The real question should be not what could or should have happened, but given the realities of the time, what else could have happened?  

""The implications of genocide in the attempt to destroy an entire people are not unique for Jews, they apply to any minority that is faced with discrimination.""

A nice academic statement.  Of course, in the case of the Jews, we are not talking about ""implications"" but, rather, historical reality--not just of discrimination, or even persecution, but of mass extermination.  

""Or we could just try to improve the human rights record around the world and ensure no state can systematically mistreat any of its citizens. How about that?""

A worthy goal, but one which is, by far, the exception rather than the reality in today's world.

Well, Darth Andeddu makes most of his appearances in the *Legacy* comics.

Darth Malgus is from a quasi-sequel, the massively multiplayer online game The Old Republic, as well as its associated novel *Deceived*. You can see him in action just by going on YouTube and looking up the *Deceived* cinematic trailer.

Darth Ruin has not made an appearance yet, which is a crying shame considering his historical significance and his compelling, unique solipsistic philosophy. His existence is known from sourcebooks, chronicles and encyclopedias - Wookieepedia is going to be your best friend here.

Perhaps an ironing chair or similar to sit on. 

The aperture ratio of f/4.4 (diameter divided by focal length) is a bit critical. It needs to be collimated (adjusted, with a  simple DIY collimation cap or film can cheshire) and if the mirror is not parabolic the maximum useful magnification is limited. 

Otherwise a nice portable telescope, the mount is sufficient for it.

Depending on where you live, you could order affordable eyepieces from Seben/Orbinar (Plössl-Type €10-18,  Europe) or Surplusshed (usa, varying bargains).

Make sure your focuser has an inner diameter of 1.25"" else you will have to shop around of older  .965"" eyepieces or buy/build an adapter.

- Overview eyepiece

 - f/4.4 results in an exit pupil of 5-6mm with an eyepiece  22mm / 26mm. 

 - Cheap would be something like Kellner or Hyugens, especially a choice for 0.96mm eyepieces;  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Celestron-20mm-1-25-Telescope-Eyepiece-NEW-/231433661717?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item35e2856d15

- High magnification - Now this is tricky. Depending whether or not the mirror is parabolic, you could magnify either to around 200x, else 100 - 120 perhaps.


 - Plössl under 10mm have very short eye relief.

 - A 2x achromatic barlow &lt;$20 will get the job done, doubling the magnification,  adds chromatic aberration though, effectively lowering the contrast. www.ebay.com/itm/Achromatische-Barlow-Linse-BA2-2x-fur-Teleskope-31-7mm-/200607942106?pt=DE_Foto_Camcorder_Okulare&amp;hash=item2eb52a45da - Do not bother with cheaper plastic barlows, or more expensive Apochromatic ones (rather buy some better eyepieces or telescopes)
 
 - A 6mm gold line, perhaps modified (http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=820) to test how far you can magnify

 - A HR Planetary $30-45 as the gold line are only available in 6, 9, 15 and 20.


Be aware that all   eyepieces will suffer of coma (Longish stars at the outer field) due to the f/4.x aperture ratio of the mirror. Cheaper eyepieces will only be sharp in the center.

I would suggest getting three eyepieces or two and a barlow. Do not spend too much on these accessories, as you could easily buy a $70 114/900 - same aperture, less critical aperture ratio, some basic eyepieces included.

Firstly, you can't definitively say something is overpowered, but you can speculate and think that it most likely will be. Secondly, you say no serious FPS player would say that. I can't remember who he is, but you say he's a good Heavy player, so he obviously is a serious FPS player.

Thank you for listening to the podcast and of course I am receptive to feedback.  Marty attempted to definitively say something is OP, I was merely providing a contrary argument, as we do not know yet.  He is jumping the gun based off not even playing the game.  That to me is invalid criticism.

&gt; About Infra-Sight. I don't think it's overpowered. I think it's gamebreaking. The two things are different.
Overpowered means something is just too good in all situations, and will make the game unbalanced if it's kept in. This is why weapons like the Darwin's Danger Shield are banned in TF2, it lets you survive a Sniper headshot, allowing you to outsnipe their Sniepr unless he too equips the Darwin's Danger Shield. This is not a problem in TF2, because the Darwin's Danger Shield is just banned. However in Overwatch, if an ability is overpowered, if it gets banned than that class just won't be as fun to play because it won't have the same amount of kit as other classes. It would be like if Sniper's secondary weapons were banned, instead of just the Darwin's Danger Shield. This means Blizzard really needs to get balance right.

You have no evidence to suggest that Infrasight is game breaking, if it is, than Hanzo's Sonic Arrow is Extra game breaking?  Its not even his ultimate, and he can use it more regularly.  So I don't believe at this point in time that Infrasight is indeed unbalanced or gamebreaking.  If anything indicates the opposite, is the the showmatch that was shoutcasted at Blizz Con, where literally the attackers are a few seconds away from victory and the defense holds.  That is really the only evidence we have right now.  If Infrasight were gamebreaking then the attackers don't even get the first point, let alone almost win.  I'm not buying that argument right now

&gt; Now for Ressurect. I think you're taking that strategy too literally. Yes, if the Mercy walked in after their whole team wiped then they'd just get killed, and no it isn't a good idea to waste your ult killing one player.
But imagine this scenario: Team A has little time to push the last point, and Team B has set up a good defence. However, Team A have Ressurect up. They make a very poor push with their whole team rushing into Team B with their Mercy tagging along just behind and they get outplayed. Team B loses 2 players and takes a lot of damage, but they manage to kill all the attacking classes of Team A, and they start to focus Mercy. However, Mercy pops Ressurect and now it's suddenly a 6v4 and Team A have a large health advantage. They wipe Team B and win the game.
Team B clearly played better here, why should they lose the game? Ressurect is similar to the Ubercharge mechanic in TF2, which works very well, however it is instant, effects everyone, and gives the other team no opportunity to counter it.

Again more hypotheticals that can be countered by other hypotheticals, which was sort of the point I was making in the podcast.  We can throw hyptheticals all day at each other and still have nothing to show for it.  We need to see the game played in an organized setting to determine if/anything in the game is overpowered.

And just for arguments sake, aren't ultimates supposed to make any champion/hero/character overpowered for a little bit?  Is that not the point?

&gt;Now you say competitive TF2 is dying. It's not. Yes, top level players are leaving. But new top level players are rising up from the lower divisions. A popular site, scrap.tf, has just partened with the European Team Fortress 2 League to create a tournament with a larger prize pool than I think the last 5 seasons of the Premiership division. Competitive TF2 is not dying, Valve are just starting to put less effort into TF2. This doesn't affect comp in any way though, as Valve didn't do anything to comp to begin with. TF2 has been around for longer than LOL, and most of these players retiring have been playing since the very beginning. The LOL players haven't played long enough to retire yet.
I completely agree with you about how Overwatching needs to be good non-competitively first. You make a lot of good points here and put them across clearly.

That is what Marty said in terms of TF2 dying.  He says many top players are ""retiring"" and that they have lost their passion for TF2.  He also said that there is less competition, so I guess we have a discrepancy of the facts.  I would love to see the specifics on the growth rates of TF2 competitively.  Some TSM players have retired from comp and are still involved with LoL either Casting, Streaming, or Coaching.  It seems when TF2 players retire, they have to wait for the next game to come out and pray they can make a buck off of it.  The distinction between the two is night and day I'm afraid to say

&gt;I completely agree with you about how Overwatching needs to be good non-competitively first. You make a lot of good points here and put them across clearly

Yes I'm glad you agree, I just hope the competitive communities from other games agree as well.  Most people are expecting eSports out the game, I think that these players will be disappointed, and have the potential to become toxic if those competitive needs are not met immediately.

&gt;Uggh, I don't play comp TF2 because I saw an Engineer cosplay. Now you're saying we shoudn't criticise the game because that won't help grow it? Criticism gives Blizzard feedback, without it the beta will be worthless. Criticism may turn people off the game pre-release, but in the end it will make the game better. And it's fair to criticise games, if they're not good in some aspects they should be criticised for that.

Criticism based of gameplay feedback, not speculation.  Blizzard needs accuarte feedback and the more bullshit they get (like Marty's video) the less likely they are to take feedback seriously.  Believe me, if Overwatch is at PAX East than I will be playing that probably the entire time I am there (its usually what I do, latch on to one game so to speak) and then will give educated feedback on things I feel are unbalanced based of me exploting them personally to win, not anything used against me.

&gt;Yeah, I think Support heroes should have just as high a skill ceiling as everyone else. They'll almost certainly have a place if there is an esports scene in competitive play, but they won't be fun to play at that level if they do have a low skill ceiling.

Yes just because a support character exists doesn't mean that they should have a low skill ceiling.  I think Zenyatta will be an example of this, but we will see about that when we get more footage.

&gt;Blizzard do usually make very good cinematics, although I thought the Overwatch one was very cheesey and I didn't enjoy that much. That's just my opinion though, I'd definitely like to see more cinematics if they're in a different style though, maybe something like Meet The Team for TF2. About Meet The Team though, I'm not really sure if that would work. I just don't feel like the Overwatch Heroes have as much personality as the Mercs. You have lines like this in TF2 and then in Overwatch you have 'I will protect the innocent' and 'One shot, one kill'.

Really?  I love the story of Overwatch, I can't tell you how many times on different devices (including my TV) I have watched that trailer.  I personally find it inspiring.  Meeting individual heroes is great, but the beauty of having those individual heroes is that you have them interact better in a consistent story than just nameless classes.  I think the first cinematic is just small potatoes regarding how far/deep the storyline can go with cinematics.

&gt;I did disagree with most of your points in this podcast but still, it's good to see a differing point of view. I'll watch the next one too.

I support your right to disagree as well my right to challenge your points.  When people try to give ""valid"" feedback based off seemingly unrealistic hypotheticals than I can't take that seriously, and honestly no one else should either.

Thanks for listening again, I really appreciate it.

In other words: if the unemployed have studied subjects like sociology then you need to do government projects that required that kind of people. Building a complicated bridge won't reduce unemployment if there isn't much unemployment among architects, engineers and construction workers. In fact, it would divert their skills from the projects they would otherwise be doing.

That's also why I am skeptical about the EU's large-scale science projects such as the [FET Flagships](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/fet-flagships). In those projects, a committee decides where to invest a billion each (e.g. graphene). This amount of money is surely suited to attract the best and brightest scientists. However, there is a limited number of truly talented scientists. Thus, there is a significant risk of misallocating their brainpower. Instead, market forces or local governments should decide.

I don't blame the people. But I do think proper attention needs to be brought onto the past two grecian governments, their in-house plutocrats AND the electorates failure to keep the finger on their own government and not fobbing off every mistake to Germany or the EU as a whole.

That isn't to say the EU is devoid of all blame. It can be argued that the EU cares more about maintaining the eurozone than an individual country like Greece; so was willing to turn a blind eye to the problem for sake of stabilizing the whole.

However Greece is now like the European version of Louisiana. Taking ""federal"" handouts and putting neo-nazis into their parliament.

There's also the transfer mechanisms. For Greece to get out of its troubles, it will need economic aid, and for the debt to be cleared.

There is no consensus on that part. The English Civil War which had just been concluded by Cromwell the years before had been far less destructive on England and Scotland for example, so the Ireland campaign does stand out in comparison to that for its brutality and destructiveness.

&gt; And his treatment of the Irish was far better of anything going on in Germany.

That's genocide-olympics. The actions of Cromwell should be judged by themselves, not against other wars happening in Europe in the 17th century (I hope you're talking about the 30 Year War, comparisons to WWII didn't make any sense, so I picked the logical choice). 

Firstly the 30 year war was considerably longer than the two/three year campaign by the New Model Army, secondly there were far more individual battles, far larger armies, and just about every European power worth its crown was involved over the years. They're totally incomparable.

Section 4. [**StreetPass**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpotPass#StreetPass) of article  [**SpotPass**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpotPass): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__StreetPass__ is a [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) functionality which allows passive communication between Nintendo 3DS systems held by users in close proximity, an example being the sharing of [Mii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mii) avatars in the *[StreetPass Mii Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StreetPass_Mii_Plaza)* application, and other game data.

&gt;Trademarks suggested that this functionality would be named ""CrossPass"",  but on September 29, 2010, during the [Nintendo World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_World) conference, the confirmed names of the Tag Mode service would be StreetPass. 

&gt;StreetPass allows users to exchange software content regardless of what software is currently in the console. Currently shared content is stored in one of twelve ""data slots"" in the console. Using this data slot, Nintendo 3DS users can readily share and exchange content for multiple games at the same time, whenever they are connected.  Using the console's background connectivity, a Nintendo 3DS in *Sleep Mode* can automatically discover other Nintendo 3DS systems within range, establish a connection, and exchange content for mutually played games, all transparently and without requiring any user input. For example, in *[Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Street_Fighter_IV:_3D_Edition)*, if the user passes by someone with the same software, they will initiate a battle to collect trophies from each other. 

&gt;*StreetPass Mii Plaza* is a built-in application included with every Nintendo 3DS family device, and the primary application for StreetPass interactivity. Here, players can set up their Mii to appear on other 3DS devices that it encounters via StreetPass. Up to ten Miis can be brought into the plaza at a time and taken into various mini-games. Two mini-games, *Puzzle Swap* and *Find Mii / StreetPass Quest*, are included as standard, whilst four additional games; *Mii Force / StreetPass Squad*, *Flower Town / StreetPass Garden*, *Warrior's Way / StreetPass Battle* and *Monster Manor / StreetPass Mansion*, can be purchased separately. All games allow players to use Play Coins in place of StreetPass Miis.

&gt;*StreetPass Relay* was announced during an analyst briefing at [E3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo) 2013 Nintendo announced that it is creating thousands of new StreetPass Relay stations across the United States and Europe. Nintendo plans to turn over 29,000 Wi-Fi access points into relays in the US, while Europe is set to see 24,000. With this new functionality, Nintendo aims to vastly improve the functionality of the 3DS and could enable players to find more Miis in their *StreetPass Mii Plaza*. 

&gt;StreetPass relay points are located at Nintendo Zones all across the country. When a Nintendo 3DS user gets near a StreetPass relay point, it automatically forwards his or her StreetPass data to Nintendo's servers which stores it temporarily to pass it on to the next Nintendo 3DS user to pass by the same relay point. The Nintendo servers keep track of each relay point by the MAC address of the node. StreetPass relay points support StreetPass data for various games each time a Nintendo 3DS user passes by. This means you can get StreetPass data for several games at once.

&gt;Notes:

&gt;


&gt;* You must have your 3DS updated to system version 6.2.0- 0U or higher to take advantage of the StreetPass relay feature.

&gt;* You will not receive any StreetPass data from the relay point if you are the first person to pass with a specific game's StreetPass data or if the relay point currently has your StreetPass data. 

&gt;StreetPass Relay is powered by [Hbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hbase), Puppet, fluentd and [Amazon Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) cloud technologies.

Giving women the vote does, for example, take away from the power of the individual male vote, which suddenly automatically loses half of its impact - however, universal suffrage generally has an overall beneficial impact on society as a whole. Paradoxically less inequality is often better for those who would otherwise be more advantaged and that is why we value it.

Exact, ar trebui sa mai stie copiii si de-un Half-Life, de-un Bioshock, un Spec Ops: The Line, sa-si formeze o cultura de gameri seriosi.

Also, si eu sunt de parere ca ar trebui sa se schimbe modul in care sunt predate artele in scoli. In momentul de fata, orele de desen si muzica is in 90% din cazuri ore de laba la care nu se face nimic. 

Ar fi mult mai misto daca artele ar fi optionale si ai putea sa alegi daca si la care din orele alea vrei sa participi, dar sa le faci calumea, cum au americanii ""cluburi"" pentru orice chestie de genul (cantat, literatura, teatru, etc.).

Si eventual orele alea optionale sa fie complementate de ceva ora obligatorie de ""istoria artelor"" in care sa se predea chestii de ""cultura generala"" care tin de artele plastice, muzica, cinematografie, etc. In felul asta cei care considera ca sunt talentati intr-un anumit domeniu pot sa exerseze si sa se desfasoare, iar cei care nu-s neaparat pasionati de arte nu mor fara sa stie nimic despre subiect. 

Ar fi mult mai ok asa decat cum e in momentul de fata, cand ai doua ore pe saptamana in care freci baluba, la desen vine profa si-ti zice sa faci o compozitie cu X si Y si clar ei 9 sau 10 atata timp cat respecti vag regulile, pentru ca n-are nimeni ce sa-ti faca daca tu n-ai simt estetic si nu stii sa desenezi. La muzica am observat ca se mai predau chestii legate de istoria artelor pentru ca e mai greu sa convingi elevi care n-au voce sa cante decat sa deseneze prostii (desi, in general, notele tot de 9 sau 10 sunt intotdeauna).

So, it's about midnight on Sunday and we all know that means that it's time to jerk the gerkin before bed. At the time, I happened to be reading about a player for the Sacramento Kings and I think about the franchise and then remember that a prominent member of Howard Stern's Wack Pack was a fan of the Kings. Pretty random, I know, but that is what got the ball rolling. I remember that this Wack Packer was a Kings fan and that made me think of how the owners have thought about relocating the team or selling the team to a group that wants to bring the team to Seattle. I then remembered who the owners of the team were and remembered that one of them used to date this Playboy Playmate who was a knockout about fifteen years ago. I remember years ago that I used to go to town to pics of her when I was just a young connoisseur of internet porn and pics that I collected in what has become a world class spank bank folder on my desktop. I used to have all of her photos on my desktop but lost most of them and most of my spank bank years ago when I got a new computer. Dumb move, I know. Years ago, she was one of my go-to-girls and, incredibly, I seemed to have forgotten about her for a few years until this week.

So I remember the girl's name and Google her and find that she is about 35 - 40 now and not looking so great anymore. Lots of plastic surgery on her face, a new tit job, really skinny, and just looking like a washed out party girl and past-it Playmate. I was pretty bummed that her new material was so shitty so that made me ignore it and look for the pics of her that she did in Playboy about fifteen years ago. Now, imagine my surprise when I hit the 30-somethingish page of Google and find that her pics are nowhere to be found. I then used Bing (great for porn, by the way) and got the exact same shitty results and couldn't find squat from this girl. I then examined the non-image results closely and found that the links to the Playboy pics were clearly written on some sites but that ""broken image"" link kept popping up and this told me that the original poster of them removed the links or that she had - for some reason - removed her photos from websites through DMCA takedown requests. I figured that it was simply a case of a fellow porn connoisseur like myself who had posted her pics on shitty Geocities-looking web sites from over ten years ago that they just decided to remove or something. However, after I was about two dozen Google pages deep looking for her pics and kept getting the same ""broken image"" links over and over, I came to the conclusion that she must have put in a copyright request and taken down her Playboy pics and all of the other pics of her from years ago when she still looked like a perfect ten. When I realized this I was furious because like any other man, when I'm horny before bed and wanna jack it I fully expect to be able to Google any hot chick or porno scene that I want and have that shit flying onto my screen in seconds through cyberspace. I lived through the struggle with other kids before the Internet Age of porn. I know all of you remember how it was back then. I remember having to watch the Spice Channel after midnight and trying to make out a tit or an ass cheek in a sea of scrambled images. I remember not knowing that there was a world of Google-able tits and ass outside of CelebrityMovieArchive.com and Mr. Skin. I cannot forget having to rewind VHS tapes to sexy scenes, looking at my mom's JCPenny bra and panty magazines, and doing everything in my power to go over to my friend's house who could successfully download porn from Kazzaa and Limewire for me and my friends to watch after school when his parents were never home. I lived through those lean times and that meant that I WAS FURIOUS that this uppity, washed-up Playboy chick thought that she could simply take down those smoking hot pics of herself and deny me my first fap to her in years. Well, that was just too much for me to take and so I had my adrenaline pumping, my anger coursing through my veins, my penis raging, and my mind deadset on finding those pics that she deleted.

I started out by Googling some of the Playmates from the year that she won Playmate of the Month and found all the other Playmates of the Month for the year that she won her award. I then found a quasi-lesbian video of her and another Playboy chick on some Indian or Arabic (no idea which) website from like 10 years ago and managed to follow a link on that page to a few of the photos that she tried to delete. I was psyched. I found a few photos and then used reverse image searches to try and track down any other sites that may have been hosting those pics of hers. It took me a few Google results pages to find some erotica forums from 2006 that had like 80 pages to wade through just to find a few pics of hers because nearly every page had that goddamn ""broken image"" link. My perseverance paid off because by the time I was about 67 pages deep I hit the mother load and found about half of the pics I was looking for. It was beautiful but I wasn't satisfied because I still hadn't found the set of her sprawled out and naked in some rich guy's library/study and I just had to find that set or else I couldn't fap and couldn't get any sleep that night. Not only that, but I wasn't going to let this chick win and get away with denying me the right to pleasure myself to pictures of her all because her modeling career was dead and buried and because she was trying to clean up her image to become some hostess out in Vegas like she made it seem clear she wanted to do judging by her Twitter postings. She was trying to clean up her image and in doing so, denied me those photos that it was my God-given right to whack it to.

I tried a whole lot of shit before I realized that I should probably use the Internet Wayback Archive to try and get some results from the pages that had dead links. This proved hard to do because I had to look for archived pages from dozens of totally random, old, shitty erotica and porno sites but I did finally find that set that I was looking for. I know that I can't be the only guy to go through this when looking for porn but I wound up on one of those Eastern European or Russian porno or erotic sites that has like foreign editions of Playboy magazines and shoots in super high resolutions and big sized jpegs and this is where I found the set. Everything was in like fucking Bulgarian or some shit and there weren't any thumbnails - just links with random Bulgarian words and then what looked like the names of American Playmates - but I clicked and waded through those links like I was in a damn swamp until I found the right link that got me the set that I was looking for. I must have hit Dailymotion, VintageErotica forums, FreeOnes, Mr.Skin, Indavideo, YouKou or whatever the hell that Chinese YouTube knock-off site is called, CelebrityMovieArchive, old-ass Angelfire sites, some Geocities sites, multiple search engines, different subreddits, foreign erotica and porn forums, random YouTube videos that sometimes have jpeg slideshows, and all sorts of other shit until I found the pics I was looking for.

About two hours later - after much masturbation consternation - I had my pics, took my grand old time with them, did my business, and then retired for the night, a free and happy man in the Good Ol' U.S. of A.

Mission Accomplished.

One example is China vs. Europe.  In 1000 AD, or even 1500 AD China was superior in every conceivable metric.  Yet in a few hundred years, the squabbling Europeans not only caught up to China but passed them and humiliated them for a hundred years.

The same thing happened with the Egyptians vs. the Greeks, and many other times.

It stands to reason that since elites typically rise to power under conditions favourable to them, they will consciously and subconsciously work to maintain those conditions, and view any change as possibly destabilizing.  

For example, there were the rudiments of steam power in the ancient Mediterranean, but the entire economy and way of life was built around the institution of slavery.  Wealthy people who would have the money to invest in steam engine prototypes would also have the most to lose if their slaves were suddenly worthless.  So we didn't get steam power until labor shortages and intense competition made elites willing to experiment with them out of self-preservation.

Competition drives most innovation.  And we can debate the relative merits of a stable society vs one that is constantly in flux.  Either might be fine in isolation.  But they never are.  And even if we unite the entire world, there are worlds beyond counting in the heavens.  Surely others are home to builders and explorers like ourselves.

In the early 1400s, a Chinese Emperor built a giant fleet that explored the oceans and could have dominated the world.  But the new Emperor ordered the ships burned and shipyards destroyed.  And because all China was united, that was the end of China's exploration.  

So long as there is a chance we may come in to contact with others, I think the competitive nature of our species may wind up being one of our greatest advantages, and I am hesitant to put all our eggs in one government's basket.

Exactly- we have talked long enough about the police state Russia has become, and how an innocent man is being locked up. Let's discuss the real issue, Navalny is a **racist, anti-semitic, extreme nationalist!**  
  
&gt;Because you see, Western reports didn’t seem to think any of this was worth mentioning. Nada. Zilch.  
  
In Russia, journalists know to include at least 3 examples of racism from the official list of approved Navalny-is-a-racist talking points in **every** Navalny article.  
  
&gt;Last word: Navalny, whether innocent of the crimes he was accused of or not, is an extreme nationalist who has a history of being openly racist and has been accused numerous times of anti-semitic remarks.
Western press may be lauding him as an anti-corruption crusader now, but I have an inkling they might quickly change their mind if he were to ever replace Putin.  
  
Never listen to a word that this **racist** says, he is not trustworthy! Don't read any interviews by him, he hides his racism well.

&gt;Watching the news come out of Moscow yesterday, I saw some reports that put the protester count at 500 and others that put it at 10,000. In the end, the most realistic estimates seemed to be in the 1,000-1,500 range; not insignificant, but not “massive” which was the word used most frequently to describe them — and certainly not near the 18,000 who pledged to attend on Facebook.  
  
You can watch [3 hours of footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11-mqWeAwXg) from the protest- it's obvious that there are more than 1,000 **police officers,** and the protestor count is definitely in the several thousands. If that number of police weren't enough of a deterrent, they closed off the exits to the metro station (can see in the video) so people coming would have to go at least half a mile out of their way to get there. This entire protest was organized within less than 24 hours due to a [last minute change in 'reading' the verdict](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30623498) (which is funny because they didn't actually read the verdict, they just read the sentence).

Because of their limited franchise operation, ""other cities"" will never get a shot--is MLS ever coming to Baltimore? Not as long as DCU exists.

In an open pyramid, ""other cities"" could form a club, homegrown or sponsored locally, and (in theory) one day bust the doors down and be in the top league. Now in point of fact, that rarely happens--big clubs stay big, and small clubs stay small. But the impossible dream--that, more than anything, is the spirit of football (the only time I will ever use ""football"" instead of ""soccer"").

MLS seeks to subvert the very notion of the impossible dream and replace with a carefully managed ""entertainment experience"" based on a level of mediocrity (in the dictionary sense, not the pejorative sense) that will suffice to draw enough support so that advertisers will pay to be associated with it.

Now, I'm not an idiot--of course, every European club has a shirt sponsor, and another one that actually makes the shirts, and official-[X]-of-[TEAM] out the wazoo. Check out the list of official sponsors that Man United have some day--it's absurd.

But even a club the size of United has an ""impossible dream"" - the CL title.

Even Real Madrid has an impossible dream - a double, a treble, or a quadruple.  Or the 11th CL title (unDecima?).

My club, Spurs, their impossible dream: finish ahead of Arsenal, play in the CL. That's it. And they've only accomplished one of these goals once in something like 18 years.

A última grande transformação da Igreja antes de Vaticano II tinha sido a contra reforma no século XVI com o concílio de Trento. Os papas da segunda metade do século XX, João XXIII, Paulo VI e principalmente o João Paulo II, revolucionaram a Igreja e a modernizaram muito ao implantar as mudanças do concílio e outras no mesmo espírito. 

O problema é que é foda você pegar uma instituição semi-medieval que caminhou por séculos sem mudanças, e mandar ela a jato do século XVI para o século XX. Então por isso a Igreja ainda nos parece muito arcaica e papas como João Paulo II boa parecem pessoas extremamente conservadoras. Mas naquele microcosmo da Igreja que ele assumiu para comandar, foi um progresso gigante. 

Talvez precise de mais um Francisco ou dois pra efetivamente chegar no século XXI, mas o grosso dessa transformação foi feita pelo Paulo VI e João Paulo II.

I wasn't aware that there was slavery in the Pacific Northwest! Do you have any books or resources you could recommend on that one? I'm interested, since that goes against what I've previously been told. Super interesting. Anyway, as for slavery in your world, then that works out since your conditions are unlike Earth's past (particularly the low child mortality).

I think serfdom works out just fine for your purposes. Under this system, I guess the military class might be more comparable to European feudal lords, which checks out as far as I'm concerned.

So you're proposing that the shift from military rule to Church rule is a gradual social and cultural one, rather than an economic one? (Remember that for the Church's support to mean something for a military claimant, they need to be some sort of power broker, and they'd need to gain that power from something.) I can dig that; ultimately, both forms of political organization are capable of getting the harvest in, so it's going to work either way. Perhaps you may want to flesh out why these social changes occurred. Again, look for gradual processes. It's possible that military forces reorganized--perhaps they professionalized in order to ward off foreign invasion. I'm no expert on feudal lords, but I'm sure if you did some research on their fall from grace, there'd be a lot of good inspiration.

Also, I don't think matrilineal versus patrilineal descent will affect matters much on this level, but you may want to double-check that with others.

Given the form of the Church you have described, the Mavela's shaky hold on power makes perfect sense. Just to provoke further thought (and because I'm interested), what's the ultimate outcome of these schisms? Obviously these religious differences already have massive political significance, so they're not going to become merely academic matters. Does the office of the Mavela continue to represent only a single school? If so, political and social instability will continue until her rivals are defeated, she is unseated and the office reformed, or the office changes its character. Does the Mavela ultimately de-emphasize her role as a religious leader in favour of some sort of secular unity, instead, as a way to enhance central government power? Or does the office of Mavela, too, become merely ceremonial as the entire region breaks up politically, perhaps retaining some sense of social and cultural unity with economic ties?

I do blame the European colonials who are responsible for a large part of the contemporary mess in the middle east, but I also blame the traitorous dictators who sold the region out to satiate their greed. But, in Palestine, the British even fought with the Arabs against the Zionists in the 1948 war. The Zionists are to blame for the Palestinian crisis and they alone largely hold the responsibility for it.

The British are responsible for the Balfour declaration, yes, but they went back on it multiple times and it did not really factor into their policies in the late 40s. 

&gt; what came first, Judaism, Christianity or Islam?

What came first, European Khazar converts to Judaism in Palestine or Arabized Canaanites who converted to Islam and lived in Palestine continuously for thousands of years (other than when the Crusaders briefly kicked them out)? 

Saying that Jews were there first is nothing but a myth. **Many** of the original Jews converted to Islam anyway and are today's Palestinians. The Jews of today, especially Ashkenazim, are Khazar converts. Which makes their ancestral homeland Khazaria in Anatolia, not Palestine.

No one seems to want to talk about it but the reason for it is partially that it reduces immigration by using natural barriers and the borders.

It's a huge mess, one idea has been to set up some kind of offices in northern Africa and other places where people can apply for asylum to EU. It would be much easier to apply this way and it would likely lead to these offices being completely swamped in applications which would be a problem. The left wing is usually against this because these offices would not have any responsibility for taking care of the applicants while the application is processed.

The whole point is that saying ""Romanian people are known to commit crimes"" is a racist thing to say in isolation. Why do SOME Romanians commit crime here? Because we won't give them jobs and because we are taking steps to deny them welfare. In those circumstances what choice do they have but to commit crime to put food in their mouths? I know plenty of Romanians who work hard and try to fit in, like Poles 10 years ago, like Serbians 20 years ago, like Caribbean immigrants 50 years ago. Casting them as a generation of criminals and ne'er-do-wells doesn't help the situation and deflects attention from the real problems of tax avoidance by the wealthy and concentration of wealth within a tiny elite, real problems that do harm the fabric of British society.

Gender, species, sex, these are not *real* things. They are human words to approximately describe complex states.

Nature doesn't have a Platonic template to follow for sex or for race.

If race is arbitrary so is gender. If gender isn't arbitrary neither is race. Gender and race both correlate to a number of factors. We can say that males and females have certain tendencies, that mental illness run in certain families or that African Americans have a different heart attack risks than European Americans... but it's taboo to think that race might also affect the mind. *That* seems pretty arbitrary to me.

2) The First World is expanding not shrinking. Recently South Korea, Czech Republic, Estonia, Taiwan, Chile, Slovenia and Slovakia become First World countries with a high Human Development Index and GDP per capita over USD$25,000. In the next decade Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Turkey, Russia, Romania and South Africa will become First World countries.
