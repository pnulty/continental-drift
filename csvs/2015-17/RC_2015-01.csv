2,SovietChef,,cnasa3k,False,"&gt; Okay, well, wasn't there some sort of proclamation issued about how to regard and deal with those deemed to be heretics?

Not that I've heard of, and certainly nothing that was universally applied. While the Inquisition was present across Europe their attitudes and techniques varied drastically based on location. Just about the only universal things were the *protections* that the Inquisition promised to the accused (beyond what the legal system at the time offered) and the format of the tribunal.

&gt;Was this proclamation issued as infallible?

No. Very few things have *ever* been defined infallibly, and in order to meet the requirements the Pope pretty much has to declare to the entire Church ""this thing I'm about to say is infallible!"" ",1420070470,0,t1_cnasa3k,t3_2qyq3y,False,0,False,t5_2qi4f,,0,,2,1425124268,t1_cnas2ef,Catholicism

2,Daxlab,,cnat37y,False,"&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.

Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place.

&gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.

Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa.

&gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.


Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up.

If you get your chows, creepers, flame tongues, and early game removal you should do fine. I also feel like shaman is now favored against hunters with the addition of heal bot. Pre GvG it was a fifty fifty since shaman could stablize against them but were very low by that time since we had no healing. Shaman is decent against paladin since we can use our early game minions to contest their recruits and removal for their midrange creatures and lightning storm for muster. Shaman is ok against Druid if you can get board control and removal for their minions. Healbot can also keep you out of range of combo. Haven't seen much rogue so i don't know how shamans fare against them. Finally, priest our worst matchup as far as I know. They have so much removal and can steal most of our minions.

It's not a particularly special strip of land, except that it happens to have a lot of history for the Abrahamic religions.

A little while later, the Nazis rose to power in Germany and started taking over Europe. A large number of Jews in Europe decided that leaving sounded like a good idea. Many of them went to the United States. Many others decided to settle in that little strip of land since it has significance to their religion. Come the end of World War II and the world is trying to decide what to do with that strip of land. Both the Arabs and the Jews living there want control over it. The United Nations holds a vote and decides to split the country in two- a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state (Palestine), with the capital city of Jerusalem being jointly administered by the two governments (although it was fully surrounded by the Arab state). Immediately after the decision was made, the surrounding countries- Jordan, Syria, and Egypt attacked the two new countries. The invading armies quickly took over a good chunk of what was suppose to be the Arab state, since they weren't expecting an attack, but the army of the new Jewish state was better prepared and not only held them off, but actually pushed the attacking armies back and managed to take over a chunk of the Arab state land that the invaders had seized.

5,BlueHatScience,,cnatyf5,False,"For me it's the exact opposite.

It's not about 'dumb', it's about humans on large having realized that it's not needed to be a decent person (it can help for some, but it can easily have just the opposite effect), not rational given what we know about the universe, and - when it's in any way entrenched in society - a very very bad thing (mostly people being deprived of liberties or persecuted, but also concerning education, social actions etc).

Religion is a special kind of superstition (involving what psychology calls 'magical thinking') that entrenches itself in the psychology of individuals (emotional attachment) and the structure of societies - so that it's made pretty much exempt from the kind of scrutiny that any similarly ludicrous (less contentiously: outlandish) idea would face when anybody demanded respect for it.

Even in mostly secular western Europe, it was pretty much unthinkable to criticize the position of power of churches and the influence of religion in society until the late 60s, and even then it was pretty much only the younger generation where this was socially acceptable. Today still, religion is entrenched within so many societies and cultures... state churches, blasphemy laws and socially accepted religious indoctrination from childhood on are the norm.

We still live in a world where religion is the norm, and being in any way vocal about thinking it might not be a good thing (not just not a rational thing) will mark you as at least a bit of an outsider (unless you're below age 25, and even then it might still )... religion still demands special privileges (and society demands them for it) and gets them.

Individually believing in 'a higher power' or whatever isn't rational given what we know. If there are 'mysteries', then philosophy, science and rationality in general are what will get us thinking clearly about them, and maybe also to get some actual answers some day, but a 'supernatural' explanation isn't an explanation at all, it makes literally no sense. So it's not rational - but then neither is gorging yourself on fatty and sugary stuff all the time... in the world Star Trek, I think neither is encouraged, and if you demand applause for it, you'd probably get some weird looks and perhaps an explanation of why that's not going to happen. But nobody is going to forbid you or disparage you from exercising your liberties.

It's daring to display secular, humanist values and not just look away from the irrationality and harmfulness of religion is a huge part of what made me respect Star Trek... and it's appeasement of irrationality in DS9, even outright mysticism (Sisko coming to treat the wormhole-aliens as deities to be revered) made me honestly a bit disheartened.

EDIT: I also think that human society in the Star Trek universe, while probably mostly secular and not taken by the contents of religious ideology, still cherishes and values the positive cultural contributions made in societal and individual religiously motivated or framed efforts (music, literature, architecture etc) and is happy to celebrate cultural diversity (where the cultural practices aren't especially harmful to unconsenting individuals), which I also always found to be admirable. Be steadfast in acting according to humanitarian, rationalist ideals - and celebrate diversity - to appreciate and to learn. A captain Picard wouldn't express his judgement on the ideological content of a religion unless the situation makes it appropriate - and would certainly respect and cherish religious contributions to culture, as well as completely respect individual choices with regard to religiosity (where freely made and non-harmful).

As far as we know, she isn't immortal.

&gt; What real world time would GoT take part in considering their technology and laws?

There isn't really any directly comparable period. I'd say ""Europe between 1000 and 1500"" is as specific as it gets, at least for Westeros.

&gt; Why does everyone (in the show) say supporting Targaryens is treason?

What is and isn't ""treason"" depends on your perspective. If you're running the current regime (Lannister/Baratheon), then supporting another regime is treason. If you believe you're the rightful monarch (Stannis, Danny), supporting anyone else is treason.

&gt; Didn't aegon unify westeros?

Yes - with fire and blood. Believe it or not, a lot of people don't like being conquered. People like the Ironborn, Northmen, and Dornish, for example. Moreover, there isn't any reason to believe Westeros had any particular desire or need to be unified.

&gt; And if a king (or family in this case) rules for about 300 years then they couldn't have been too bad usually a bad kingdom doesn't survive that long. And I had the feeling that a lot of lines in the show hinted that the ruling of the Targaryens wasn't all that bad.

First, the Targaryens ruled Westeros for about 300 years, which is actually quite brief. The seven (ish) independent kingdoms lasted thousands or tens of thousands of years prior to Aegon's conquest.

Second, the 300 years under the Targaryens were not smooth sailing. For this, the prequel novellas and the *World of Ice and Fire* are worth checking out. There were good kings and times of peace, but there were also terrible kings, rebellions, and wars for succession. 2/3 of their reign was bolstered by dragons, which made for fairly horrific warfare.

The Targaryens didn't hold power because people liked them, they held power because they weren't successfully deposed until Robert's Rebellion.",1420074963,0,t1_cnau877,t3_2qwmet,False,0,False,t5_2rjz2,2,0,House Lannister,2,1425123360,t3_2qwmet,gameofthrones

---

&gt;

&gt;The __""Five Eyes""__, often abbreviated as ""__FVEY__"", refer to an [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_assessment) alliance comprising [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). These countries are bound by the multilateral [UKUSA Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement), a treaty for joint cooperation in [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence).   

&gt;The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), when the [Atlantic Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Charter) was issued by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allies) to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), the [ECHELON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc), although it allegedly was later used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.  

&gt;In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) and, to a lesser extent, the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress). As part of efforts in the ongoing [War on Terror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror) since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). The former NSA contractor [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) described the Five Eyes as a ""[supra-national](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supranational_union) intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the known laws of its own countries"".  Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive [domestic regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law) on domestic spying.

TLDR since this is reddit, macroeconomic policy is the combination between fiscal and monitory policy that can both be adjusted for different effects. Fiscal policy is how much government spends, taxes, and borrows. Monetary policy is control over money supply and how much it relates to money demand and interest rates and such.

The effects of monetary and fiscal policy are not independent of each other, think of it as a multivariable system. The ability to fine tune both as they relate to each other matters a great deal to meaningful economic policy.

When a country has it's own currency, it has monetary policy independence, when a country keeps it's exchange rates pegged to another currency or doesn't have it's own currency and uses another countries, then it does not have monetary independence. A country is incredibly limited in fiscal policy if it does not have the ability to set it's own monetary policy. Losing the ability to use monetary policy means the effects of both the economy ""heating up"" and slowing down is magnified, that means that a very powerful destabilizing element is introduced.

However, there are benefits of monetary unions, although only if they are heavily interconnected economically with the other regions *and* there is a great deal of policy coordination. Herein lies the problem.


A currency union is ""optimal"" if there is both near totally fluid labor mobility *and*, most importantly in this case, pragmatic automatic fiscal transfer mechanisms, which is sorely missing in Europe and actually much more developed and nuanced in the United States.

Unfortunately, the Euro was not born out of considerations of policy coordination or economic connectedness, otherwise it would not have existed in the way it does and developmental economies (which require very different policies) like Greece wouldn't have joined and given up it's monetary independence. It was born out of ideology, which isn't to hard to understand since many countries see the Euro as a way to get away from periods of historic dictatorships. However, the ideology aspect of it made both the west and these countries overlook the fact that policy coordination is *really really* important for a functional currency/macroeconomic union. The west doesn't like to commit to automatic fiscal transfers or reevaluate monetary policy for the sake of smaller recently struggling economies, really the root of the problem is small poor countries having the monetary policy that is ideal for rich large countries from the very get go of the union (cynically you could say that the west was never committed to the idea of a union, welcoming these countries when times were good and rejecting and refusing help when times are bad). On the other hand, it would be way to difficult for these small poor countries to regain monetary independence, that is, break away from the Euro zone, something that is difficult and damaging for multiple reasons.

Now I actually made this way longer than I was hopping to, but this is the conclusion of basic accepted macroeconomic models (basically IS-MP just put into words).

Christmas, and I struggled to find smoother words. I dislike putting down someone's ideas unless they are obviously dangerous advice. If they are merely unuseful as to be a detour, or a hindrance, and the information did not seem hazardous in this case (not sure), so I took my time. This is a response to both OP and to /u/rudirudirudi's reply.  

&gt;Blavatsky's works are one of the few unparalleled apart from the sutras.  

Says who? Her fan club? Her publishers? There's going to be bias, right? Those who haven't bothered to continue their research may believe your statement to be true, and they're welcome to it. That statement sounds like marketing hype, which is why I asked you about your relationship to the website, suspecting spam, which was made more prominent by your username having no karma, and furthered by you deleting your username and the post. Odd behaviour, that.  

&gt;Apparently she says…  

You can ignore that page and any others based on it with confidence.  

&gt;What do you think of that?  

This linked webpage falls well outside of this sub's goals for **quality information** on Kundalini and would usually be quickly removed. This time we'll use it as a teaching example.  

I would have liked to find nicer words as a response to what you linked to, but there's no nice way to put it. The words crap, BS, poppycock, garbage, off-base, inaccurate and a bunch of others apply, not a single one of them positive.  

I ran it past /u/sumpuran and he was in agreement with me, though he used more polite words of disagreement. Like in my oral tradition system of Kundalini, nothing in the Kundalini Yoga system as taught by Yogi Bhajan comes anywhere close to Blavatsky's description of Kundalini.  

Not even close. (It needed repeating.)  

While wishing my own teacher ""Bah Humbug"", which is his version of Merry Christmas, he confirmed his mocking chuckle at this *ridiculous* idea of top down Kundalini from the ""heart chamber"". Kundalini does not work that way, never has, never will.  

The opening of Chakras can sort-of do what's described in some people with the accompanying movement and disturbances of Prana. **That's not Kundalini!**  

As far as Blavatsky's writings *as quoted* in the article go, she's way off base, beyond reasonable, beyond, I believe, what makes sense to anyone who has direct experience *of* Kundalini, whìch pretty much confirms /u/rudirudirudi's opinion that she was a theorist more than someone who did or knew. /u/rudirudirudi did throw laurels at her - of course - Adida has a very similar view as her.. which may be confirmation bias. The half-fool eyes his screen suspiciously with a hairy eyeball.  

Back when she wrote in the 1800's, Blavatsky may have had no one to refute her in Europe or in America. That's changed. I don't know why she wrote such misguided and erroneous information (could her Lama buddies not have trusted her with what they *really* knew?), but many have copied her, as seems to have occured with Adida. He is as off-base as Blavatsky was, which is no surprise: The Advaitist writers consistently misunderstand, misrepresent or attempt to redefine Kundalini, so Adi is consistent to that, and to himself. I consistently state that their perspective lacks the fulness of knowledge on Kundalini, or is an arbitrary rejection of Kundalini. Live and let live, I say. To detour around Kundalini is fine. Perhaps Adi should have chosen better sources, or stuck to Advaita.  

I received a complaint and question in PM about the Adida link (and about Adida)  with a quote and link to his claims of perfection and that *all enlightenments would only occur through him*, (Hack! Cough!), as quoted on his Wikipedia page. Sorry, no offence intended. I cannot support such spiritual fuckery. That quote agrees with the 1/4 page I refer to next. It's consistent. I doubt everything that puppy wrote.  

Adida spends nearly 1/4 of that rather long webpage (linked to by /u/rudirudirudi) tooting his own horn and stating repeatedly in many different ways how wonderful and how perfect he is. Was. He's *dead*. By the end of that load of bollocks, I had to force myself to read any further. The thought *puked a little into my mouth* came to mind without quite becoming a reality. In other words, his words made me gag. That kind of talk is way outside what is appropriate for any spiritual teacher to reasonably claim, IMEO. He insinuates to take precedence over, and make useless all other living spiritual teachers. Many adjectives fit him here. You are welcome to believe and think otherwise.  

My own Kundalini teacher, whom I both appreciate immensely, and recognise as a typically imperfect human being, just like you and me, worked hard to ensure that I would not be mentally lazy and depend on his opinions for mine. He never wanted followers. Kundalini and followers doesn't work. 

/r/meditation, /r/Buddhism and /r/zen have many stories about the states and causes of (and solutions) spiritual rescue (Discovers new-for-them spiritual truth and desperately wants to inflict it on, oops, *inform* the world) and on spiritual pride. There is clear evidence in that Adida's text is of a human suffering from delusions of grandeur. Not even little delusions, but big bejeezus ones with the f-word thrown in without exaggeration.  

Worse still, he goes on and on about the *superiority* of his top-down enlightenment. *Cough, gah!*. Sure, lets play the game of who's enlightenment is best, who's guru and god are best. What a facepalm moment.  

So between Blavatsky and Adida, we have two thoroughly poor sources on Kundalini based on the opinions of three well experienced Kundalini people with over 100 years combined practice and experience. Worth listening to?  

That's why I keep saying to keep your wits about you. Keep on *thinking*, on reasoning, and also on feeling. Keep on asking the hard questions, and working hard and long at the answers. Somone helpful suggested getting links to logical fallacies into the [Wiki](/r/kundalini/wiki/index) or sidebar. We may need to do that.  

If someone claims something is dangerous, yet people have done it harmoniously for ten thousand years, what does that tell you? What did certain groups claim about others in order to justify their murders or burnings at stakes? It may have almost stopped happening in North America, but it continues in Africa and the middle East. *She's a witch. She shrunk my willy. Kill her*. And they do.  

Now I don't know, /u/blissfulencounters if you wrote those illustrious words about Blavatsky, or just borrowed them. I only disagree with her (and him) on this topic of Kundalini, and in this case I disagree most thoroughly. I won't suggest to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but for Kundalini, most *any* other sources will be better.  

&gt;This one seems to say that working that way is dangerous, and real kundalini is from the heart.  

This one is incorrect, or poorly said, or poorly translated. Improper or un-prepared Kundalini can be nasty, and drugs and Kundalini can be a very quick self-destruction, but thousands of years of experience show harmonious Kundalini awakenings are indeed doable, and not dangerous as claimed. Having a good teacher and a good student makes that harmony a lot easier.  

I have often said the Kundalini in a person who is closed-hearted or heartless (lives in their head) does not work. THAT can indeed easily be dangerous, or disharmonious,  yet what Blavatsky and Adida describe is nothing like that. I have also said that purely heart-based Kundalini will also lead one astray and sucker one in. Balance between mind and heart is pretty much an essential and basic ingredient.  

When you say ""real Kundalini"" you are using the [NoTrue Scotsman informal logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman), which does not help you or other readers to better understand. More fallacies [here]( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy), or on Wikipedia. I've intentionally avoided using them in this reply. Did I succeed? There are, however, poor, fair and good definitions of Kundalini.  

**To Clarify:**  
Our own Kundalini flows (is meant to)  upwards mainly in Sushumna, (or near, when improper or over-flows are occuring - as happens sometimes to newcomers to the energy). Sushumna is a non-physical channel or nadi mostly central in the body close to the spine. Ida and Pingala, criss-crossing caduceus-style (there is another viewpoint) on either side of Sushumna deal with the yin/yang aspects of the energy. If Kundalini is made to flow downwards intentionally or inadvertently, serious negative traits are known to emerge, like Adida' claim to perfection for example, or his atypical arrogance, or worse.  

**All mainstream and esoteric Kundalini schools I have encountered teach the correctness of an upward flow**. I have to therefore conclude that Adida and Blavatsky cannot be considered reputable sources on the topic of Kundalini. There are a lot of good writers out there. Find them. I would suggest books after 1980. Explore our WIKI for titles if you want, or Google, www.abebooks.com, www.amazon.com, etc.  

For those less familiar with spiritual concepts around Kundalini but who know cars, what Blavatsky and Adida are claiming are almost as non-sensical as being asked if you replaced your highbeams coolant fluid or if you have this year's orange powerband. Almost, only that these examples refer to innocently taking advantage of the ignorant in a joking aspect. Blavatsky and Adida did not come across as joking.   

Many varied experiences *can* occur at the heart. Kundalini does not *originate* there, nor does it exactly originate at the sacral chakra itself.

Regardless of education system, kids are kids, they are generally easygoing and really hate school.

At the same time there's plenty of people who have picked a foreign language online and are fluent. Anyway, I'd say there's a big difference between learning a language in school and picking it up live, in a real life or internet community that speaks it.

Ideally, schools shouldn't teach other languages. Schools should offer support and choice, so those who are interested could study a foreign language.

The inevitability of Colonization is something that is paraded around by your likes. Rather than arguing the would haves, it was absolutely not the ""White Man's Burden"", that led to colonization. Europeans entered the  colonies as Traders (Remember the East India Company), and their navies and armies followed. The so-called infrastructure was not to civilize the people, but to make it easier to extract the resources. Many of the Pre-Independence ""infrastructure"" was built to bridge the trade routes with harbors and nothing more.

Europeans are by no means minority in their own lands, and are not going to be, for a long time. You are deluded, if you think, democracy was ""brought"" to ""undeveloped"" lands by the Colonists.

Your ""Objectively Superior Europeans"" did not reach there all by themselves. Europeans were shitting in the streets and dying en masse, while the East was laying down the foundations for Civilization. The west is standing on the ruins of entire civilizations. I could never call it ""great history"". It was shameful, and it was exploitative, and I absolutely believe Colonialism is the cause of current Immigration to the west. I don't have an inferiority complex, no thank you, I belong to a country that is mostly non-intrusive and productive, and I am content with that. I am just befuddled that how anyone could be so smugly superior about their ancestor's actions, even though it is utterly despicable.

You should feel ashamed about your last paragraph. Please don't mouth off like this in real life.

Your advanced technology would have 'inevitably' diffused to us brown third worlders, even without the exploitative colonialism, the same way thousands of years of Eastern civilization diffused into European civilization.

&gt;

&gt;The __Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry__ is a footballing rivalry between English clubs [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.). It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalry matches in Europe.

&gt;The clubs are also the two most successful teams in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England); between them they have won 121 honours: 59 for Liverpool and 62 for Manchester United. As well as competing on the football pitch, both teams are also two of the biggest-earning, and widely-supported, football clubs in the world. 

&gt;Long-time Manchester United player [Ryan Giggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Giggs) claimed that Liverpool against Manchester United is ""probably the most famous fixture in English football"".  The fixture is usually played at lunchtime due to media interest and to discourage fans from drinking before the game. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

[New law for real estate agents.](http://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/ny-ejendomsmaeglerlov-pr-1-januar-2015)  Real estate agents may no longer intermediate loans for the purchasing of real estates, but they can refer customers to their partners. They have also changed the requirements for what information is given to the customer, so that only information essential to the purchase of a home is presented (whereas redundant information that had a confusing effect would have been presented before).

[New law for unemployment benefits.](http://star.dk/da/Om-STAR/Nyt-fra-STAR/Nyheder/2014/12/Aendringer-i-kontanthjaelpsreglerne.aspx) Previously, people who lived together without being married had a duty to support each other economically. This is being cancelled with 2015 being a year of transition. The rules also change the rules for rules concerning fortunes and deductions when you receive unemployment benefits. Young students who receive economic help from the state may now earn 24,000 DKK before tax by working without having their benefits reduced. The lowest rates for people on unemployment benefits who are below 30 (which heavily reduces the benefits you get) are removed - for those who are married or living together with someone who is not receiving various other benefits. Finally, as of today all young people under 30 can receive special help for high rental/home expenses or having a great burden of supporting wife/husband/kids/etc.

[Students receiving study benefits on ""youth education"" (secondary education, pre-university)](http://www.su.dk/Nyheder/Sider/su-reformenervedtaget.aspx) may, as of today, no longer be able to receive these benefits if they have begun more than 5 different pre-university educations.

They will also be granted the choice of another offer of treatment than the one the municipality has referred them to.

[Municipalities may now support ""art cinemas"" financially if a bunch of conditions are met.](https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=163620) The cinemas must be focused on increasing cultural diversity, must have a diverse selectio nof movies, cannot systematically compete with local commercial cinemas. The Danish Movie Institute has to assess that the cinema is clearly different from commercial ones. The municipality has to ensure that the given amount is limited to the bare necessities.

This one is for the EU as a whole, but [as of today, it should no longer be legal to sell coffee machines that stay turned on for too long, especially those that are meant to keep the coffee warm.](http://www.bt.dk/politik/eu-top-faar-kaffen-galt-i-halsen-forbyder-kaffemaskiner-som-holder-kaffen-varm) The new rules mean that coffee machines must shut down automatically after down to 5 minutes after it has made coffee.

[New law for renting a home.](http://www.carlsenadvokater.dk/ny-lejelov-pa-vej/) If an apartment has not been checked both at moving in or moving out, the landlord loses every demand for having the apartment refurbished regardless of documentation. Whereas people have sometimes been required to leave the apartment in the same condition as when they came, they are now normalizing the requirement to avoid unnecessary repairs.

5,depanneur,,cnb6tfa,False,"Some of Carlo Ginzberg's *The Cheese and the Worms* might be relevant to your question. The book is about an Italian miller named Mennocchio who was tried and executed for his heretical beliefs during the 16th century. Mennochio’s beliefs and persecution were both part of larger processes;  his ideas sprang from a materialistic peasant religion resistant to religious dogma while his persecution took place in a broader trend of the ‘reconquest’ of the masses across Europe following the Peasant’s War.

 Mennochio’s beliefs are demonstrated to have not been informed by contemporary heretical sects but were relatively widespread, however they were further shaped by his selective readings of certain books like the Travels of Sir John Mandeville and perhaps the Koran. Ginzberg implies that his essential beliefs were an expression of a fundamentally pre-Christian peasant approach to religion, shaped by the books that he read and his own use of logical thinking.

Now I won't go into details about this miller's cosmology, but the most relevant section is Mennocchio's discovery of religious relativism. Throughout his inquistional record, Mennocchio claims that he is only a faithful Christian because his grandfather was too; if his grandfather were a Jew or Muslim, he would be just as faithful to that religion, a claim that would have obviously been quite shocking during the Counter Reformation. Using the Fable of the Three Rings, he argued to the inquisitors that God loved Jews, Christians and Muslims equally because they were all his children and that all of his contemporaries believed they represented the true faith simply because they were born and raised that way. This fits into his distillation of religious dogma into what was essentially a code of morality; it didn't matter if you were a Christian, Jew, Heretic or Muslim as long as you were a decent person and didn't harm your neighbours. 

This 16th century miller from an Italian village had basically discovered religious relativism, at a time when religious denomination was the primary locus of identity. Now the interesting aspect of Ginzberg's argument is that Mennocchio's beliefs were not isolated. They were simply a recorded instance of widespread agrarian belief system that was unique in that he selectively absorbed information that confirmed his beliefs from print literature. This means that while Mennocchio certainly discovered the disturbing fact that people are only religious because they enculturated, he probably wasn't the only person in the 16th century or even the medieval era who thought that way. Now this isn't an example of 'political correctness' as we would define it, and I'm sure people will get upset that I'm giving an example of religious and not cultural relativism, but you have to keep in mind that religious identity was *super* important during this period which makes Mennocchio's claims very significant.",1420123647,0,t1_cnb6tfa,t3_2qxco7,False,0,1420124153,t5_2ssp3,moderator,0,Moderator | Pre-Norman Ireland |  European Fascism until 1945,5,1425117395,t3_2qxco7,AskHistorians

 [**Barbarian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __barbarian__ is a person who is perceived to be uncivilized. The word is often used either in a general reference to member of a nation or *[ethnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group)*, typically a [tribal society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_society) as seen by an urban [civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization) either viewed as inferior, or admired as a [noble savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage). In idiomatic or figurative usage, a ""barbarian"" may also be an individual reference to a brutal, cruel, warlike, insensitive person. 

&gt;The term originates from the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) word βάρβαρος (*barbaros*). Hence the Greek idiom ""πᾶς μὴ Ἕλλην βάρβαρος"" (*pas mē Hellēn barbaros*) which literally means ""whoever is not Greek is a barbarian"". In ancient times, Greeks used it mostly for people of different cultures, but there are examples where one Greek city or state would use the word to attack another (e.g. haughty [Athenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) calling the [Boeotians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeotia) barbarian);  in the early modern period and sometimes later, Greeks used it for the [Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people), in a clearly pejorative way.   Comparable notions are found in non-European civilizations, notably [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). In the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire), Romans used the word ""barbarian"" for many people, such as the [Berbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people), [Germanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples), [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts), [Carthaginians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage), [Iberians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberians), [Thracians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thracians) and [Parthians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire).

For me, it's all about the internal story of each leader. When my great founding dynasty member dies, I start to build a story around their legacy - often I begin with fairly peaceable rulers who focus on stewardship (for game reasons, sort of building up steam on that demesne to make later conquests more secure). I will often then sort of say that the child of that first ruler is an aggressive sort who always thought his dad was a bit too reticent with the levies anyway, or who doesn't really give a shit about dad's legacy and wants to sleep around.

I will often also justify weird succession by saying ""well he was hiding a 40 year gay affair with his gaunt faced croatian marshal, so that's why he inherited to his youngest daughter - bit of a kook"" or something like that, lmao. I always land as many children as possible to make things more interesting, so I love inheriting to a youngest daughter, just to have her slowly wage bloody war on all of her rebellious brothers, only to matrilineally marry and spread her 11 children around various royal houses of Europe before dying age something ridiculous as a known kinslayer ""the Great"". 

I don't know, it can be easy to get stuck in a rut with the way you start games, so sometimes I think it can be fun to play against type - I almost never play warlord types but it can be fun to cut a bloody swathe across half of Russia in the express knowledge that your heir is going to have a mess ahead of him, or with the knowledge that you're going to console switch to the brother with the shittest land and see if you can survive. I think in the quest to game the system you can lose a bit of the story - I quite like occasionally having kind of useless dilletante gay scholars who spend all their money on castles (the closest thing I could get to roleplaying Ludwig II of Bavaria, admittedly anachronistically =p)

It's weird, I think Crusader Kings II can sometimes be a very fun game to play non-optimally; not just in the ""not expanding too much"" stakes but in saying ""ok, this ruler is incompetent or spends all their time shagging barmaids and no time paying attention to his vassals"" or ""this ruler is a zealous prig who is going to get into wars he can't possibly win out of his own messiah complex until his vassals assassinate him for having their levies up for over ten years chasing tunisians around the sahara"", CKII is most fun to me when it goes wrong.",1420126606,0,t1_cnb7mwk,t3_2qygqt,False,0,False,t5_2tgic,,0,,0,1425117014,t3_2qygqt,CrusaderKings

And you should be wearing gloves when belaying a leader on a tube device anyways. Seriously, a significant rope burn can lead to skin grafting and loss of an entire climbing season.

*EDIT: The last couple of sentences are kind of dogmatic. Sorry about that. It's my opinion. I started off using gloves with a hip belay. Stopped when I started using a tube device. Started up again after many years and seeing what can happen. People should do what they think best.*

In single pitch/sport there are some options people have tried. Such as tying to the ground anchor with a long slack loop. The idea is that the belayer will be lifted and provide some energy absorption until her acceleration flattens - and then not so much. The goal of the slack ground anchor is to allow some dynamics but not have her smash into the 1st bolt. Others have tried some additional weight such as sandbags or a pack. Whether wearing it or tying to it.

2,InfoSponger,,cnb86cl,False,"Awww geez... you are actually going to do this?

Nuke Baghdad... after 9/11 and I bet you their ""adapting"" bullshit becomes a non starter. Now if you aren't going to read and then quote what I said, at least get the jist of it right. I never said we won Japan in any other way than dropping 2 bombs and they surrendered. THAT is the general mindset of the American Public in this day and age. Especially the ones who want to yammer on about how the US hasn't won a war since WW2.

The enemy has not adapted, we have. We adapted by NOT nuking Baghdad, not carpet bombing Mosul. When WE adapt, or acquiesce as the case may be, we are taking on the enemy on the humanitarians  terms, not on the terms in which we are most definitely capable of winning the conflict. 

This reduces our fighting forces to dealing with what you are referring to as ""enemy adaptation"" but in truth they are fighting the only war they know how and we are fighting well below our skill level to end conflicts swiftly, effectively and according to OUR terms.

Please don't think that I am unaware of the effort to try and paint me into a corner on the idea of a ""hamstrung by liberals"" military position but ti couldn't be further from the truth. The bottom line is... Wars as we are capable of winning them are distasteful and unpopular with a group of people who have never stood a post, much less experienced combat so let's stop going to war with anyone that isn't on American soil. 

I am of the firm belief that when the anti-war types are watching their own grandmas and cousins being mowed down by an encroaching enemy... they will WANT the war we are actually capable of offering an enemy, but probably not before then.

You want to say we won WW2 in any other fashion than putting 25 MILLION Russians in their grave through our own inaction in the European Theater and it is appalling as a concept. Are you of the mistaken opinion that is so common in America that the US stormed Normandy and won a war? It's a fairly prevalent opinion you know?",1420128272,0,t1_cnb86cl,t3_2quar7,False,0,False,t5_2rete,,0,,2,1425116761,t1_cnb6ytu,Foodforthought

148,KarmaAndLies,,cnb8t5r,False,"&gt; there is nothing they can do    

Sure there is. It is ""the ride.""     

For example, it is like when a cop arrests someone on bullshit charges, detains them, you have to make bail, it goes to a prosecutor, and then six months later all charges are dropped. Technically ""nothing"" bad happened as a result, but in reality tons of bad stuff happened during the ride from A-&gt;B (e.g. even the worry/stress) even if eventually there is no ""even worse"" outcome.        

Claiming ""there is nothing they can do"" because you'd eventually win in some court case maybe years later entirely ignores how unpleasant ""the ride"" from A-&gt;B is. Collections calling your phone, turning up at your door to try and seize your shit, your credit rating tanking, talking to lawyers, court appearances, the stress, etc.     

I'd honestly like to see the US, like other countries, have legally required ""cancel by snail mail."" In some other countries (mostly socialist european ones) you can send a certified letter in the post and the contract has to recognise that that is a valid way to cancel and they will have to honour it (yes, they can still hit you with early-termination-fees, and similar, but you won't have to talk to a CS over the phone). Incidentally this makes it 1,000,000% easier to cancel due to death, you just send a letter with a copy of the death certificate and it is \*poof\* done.    

I think recommending people just cancel payment and ignore the problem while it goes into the collections system is shitty advice. As much as I hate Comcast and their draconian cancellation policies/incompetence, it isn't worth the emotional/time cost to the person send into collections rather than just doing it Comcast's dumb-ass way. It isn't right or fair, but it is best medium to long term unfortunately.

The internet in our cities should be centralized, it's inefficient and waste a lot of resources, considering the alternative I'm proposing. They are prone to physical failures, many times leaving people without internet for prolonged periods of time because a single cable snapped somewhere.

That's theme of the day, I guess. I was disappointed in our effort, disappointed in how quiet the crowd was, disappointed to give up another easy counterattacking goal, disappointed not to get anything but a point from a team in the relegation scrap that sacked their manager this week.

I don't think anyone on our side played particularly well, or with any sense of urgency. Amalfitano and Sakho played okay in spurts. I suppose Collins was solid all day.

Our lone tactic today was ""swing it into the box"".... not a good tactic when Carroll is invisible, as he was today.

Cuba has the worst censorship in the Western hemishere bro.

&gt;Censorship in Cuba is the most intense in the western hemisphere. It has been reported on extensively and resulted in European Union sanctions from 2003 to 2008 as well as statements of protest from groups, governments, and noted individuals.

&gt;Cuba has ranked low on the Press Freedom Index from Reporters Without Borders from 2002 when the index was established (134th out of 139) to the present (167th out of 179 in 2011-2012). In 2006 the Inter American Press Association reported that ""repression against independent journalists, mistreatment of jailed reporters, and very strict government surveillance limiting the people’s access to alternative sources of information are continuing.

This isn't propaganda bullshit. Cubans don't get the rights that you get to enjoy. You get to rail all day as long as you want about US propaganda bullshit, but Cubans can't speak out about the bullshit their bombarded with. 

A group of people were just arrested in Cuba for having the idea to have an event where people could walk up to an open mic and speak freely about Cuba for one minute.

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/opinion/cuba-turns-off-critics-open-mic.html

It's not propaganda that Cubans can't speak freely about their government and it's not propaganda that Cubans have their media heavily censored.  

And I'm sure Canadians had a blast at resort hotels where regular Cubans weren't even allowed to go until 2009. 

As for media bullshit, show me the bullshit. Our media just talks about repression against critics, which isn't bullshit, and praises the Cuban people for their work against Ebola. Our media has also been pushing hard to end the embargo. So please, show me this horrible outlandish propaganda against Cuba.

Tem que ter cuidado com esse tipo de conselho na internet. Conselhos dados são, na maioria das vezes, baseados nas experiências de quem esta dando, não de quem está recebendo.  
Isso torna conselhos da área médica e psicológica especialmente perigosos, pois cada caso é um caso e, mesmo que semelhantes, pode ter causas e soluções muito diferentes.  

Primeiro: Procure um profissional.  
Eu recomendaria um psiquiatra (de preferencia, psiquiatra e psicólogo), um psiquiatra pode descartar ou confirmar causas neurológicas da depressão (como desequilibrio quimico e/ou hormonal) e indicar um tratamento psicológico.  
Quanto ao buscar um psicologo/psiquiatra, é bom lembrar que nada de ruim vai acontecer ao aprender mais sobre si mesmo e como a sua mente funciona, independente de estar deprimido ou não, muito pelo contrario, só tem a ganhar.  

Algumas coisas que valem a pena falar:  
Tempo livre NÃO é bom para a saúde psicológica.
Pensar em excesso, ou ""remoer"" pensamentos, também não.  
As características mais comuns entre pessoas com depressão são justamente o tempo livre em excesso e pensamento excessivo.  
Na depressão, pensar e não agir torna o pensar cada vez pior, pois os problemas não vão se resolver sem atitudes.  
Problemas cronicos, fisicos ou psicológicos estão relacionados com os hábitos, e, para ser superados, é necessário se desfazer de velhos hábitos e criar novos.  
A depressão torna mais difícil continuar ou iniciar atividades, o que agrava a depressão. É um ciclo vicioso.  
""Matar"" o tempo com atividades não produtivas (como jogar ou ver filmes), nestas circunstancias, causa mais problemas, pois existe uma razão para a tristeza ou depressão, e estes métodos se tornam fugas, mas não resolvem o problema.  
Atividades fisicas são altamente recomendadas, ainda mais se for em grupo, mas individualmente, mesmo que seja uma caminhada diaria, já é um ótimo começo. Atividades físicas regulam a química corporal.

Lidar com a tristeza e depressão exige compreensão de si mesmo. Para que alguém possa te ajudar nisso, é necessário um contato frequente, conversa e conhecimento. À internet não é o local indicado para isso. Ninguém aqui vai conseguir te conhecer bem o suficiente para te ajudar.  
Ai que entra um profissional.  

Mas, é bom falar que é sim possivel se livrar da depressão, com tratamento sério e força de vontade.  
Pessoas morrem por causa disso? Sim. (Pior caso do problema não resolvido)  
Pessoas tem vidas inteiras infelizes por causa disso? Sim. (Problema não resolvido)  
Pessoas vivem o resto da vida como zumbi se medicando, e entrando e saindo desta situação? Sim. (Problema mal-resolvido)  
Pessoas superam isso completamente e tem o resto da vida saudavel? SIM! (Problema bem resolvido)

2,JannyWurts,,cnb9r28,False,"First, thanks for your thoughtful response. We share common ground: I, too, prefer books that focus on a good story and don't seek any particular ideologies, genders, race, creed, color - whatever.

With regard to success re Martin and Tolkien - neither was 'instant' - not a bit! Both had a slow takeoff, and in Tolkien's case, a scandal that went nationwide changed the charts. I did a guest post on Aidan Mohar's blog, A Dribble of Ink, titled The Unknown Trajectory of Slow Burn Success that goes into detail. A thread posted here had a link - you internet savvies can locate it quickest. I know the Tolkien background direct from Betty Ballantine (Wife of Ian Ballantine, who published the US paperback edition, and who was eyewitness) and I know the Martin backdrop because we shared an editor/I was handed his huge manuscript ASOI&amp;F - to read and quote - (which I did, that is on record). Very likely I was asked to read because of Light and Shadows (has edges, characters die) and also for the political intrigue angle of the Empire series co-written with Ray Feist. So I had an insider view of how long it took - and exactly how many repackages ASOIAF required/with years and years of push.

I read Abercrombie and Lawrence before anyone knew who they were. Call that love of reading, and desire to be aware of my contemporaries/

For you who read for story, first, protagonists or venue second - the comment about searching under the radar may not be for you. It was directed towards folks who are everywhere complaining there is a lack of diversity - either in world view, sexuality, race, creed, color, gender - name it.

For them, you cite GoodReads and the internet as opening up the chance for unknown books to 'top the charts' out of obscurity. I would politely demolish that point for the sake of devil's advocate. Because the internet works for this ONLY if you know what book or title you are seeking. How on earth do you locate obscurity?

Take GoodReads - you hear about a book, maybe see a post in a Fantasy forum....I've been a member there for close to a decade and the books mentioned MOST if not nearly always - are the new, the popular, the already known. A scattered mention won't gain traction. Example: Rosemary Kirstein: her Steerswoman books get some mention here for having balanced characters (female) and non typical world building (she has a mosaic type world, where two very different ecologies collide - aka Stormlight archive style, but long before Sanderson's).  She is in fact beginning to be noticed - and yet - her HIGHEST RATED BOOK on GR has only 526 ratings. The rest fall off pretty fast - and the stories are EXCELLENT quality stuff....how would you find her work - she will never appear on a year's end list, or an Amazon sales ranking, or likely ever show up on 'if you liked this, try that' algorithm.

Second way you encounter new books on GR: your 'feed' - from groups you join and your friends - well if the groups never mention a title, or if your friends don't know it exists - how do you 'discover it?""

Monthly reads are popularity votes. I've been trying for YEARS to get Sarah Zettel's excellent SF books (she does hard SF, quite well) voted in, and even on a smaller, less mainstream group - she never gets the vote. Absolutely NOT the quality of her books....her best ranked Fantasy book has recorded 567 ratings; her SF books way lower. If you go to her page, how do you tell if the rated numbers reflect the quality of her writing??? How on earth do you hear of her at all? But her Quiet Invasion is just plain top notch SF....

Here's a list the results of some QUICK research on some writers who do works that fall onto the 'off the beaten path' list - for diversity...and show recorded raters on GoodReads - challenge - have you ever heard of any of them at all? These are traditionally published writers doing diverse works, yet, complainers on lack of diversity won't have checked them out. How do you 'find' a work on the internet that isn't visible anywhere?

For the diversity - ""we want to read books like us"" crowd, perhaps this list may be a gold mine....works that already pushed the envelope, years before, still totally obscure - YMMV regarding taste...I'll note 'why' I put them on the list (diversity wise). Folks can winnow according to taste.

Steven Barnes - Lion's Blood and Zulu Heart - black writer, alternate history fantasy, where Africans colonized the US and enslaved the whites....highest number of ratings: 435.

Heather Gladney - Teot's War and Blood Storm - desert setting, protag of color, blurs gender with gentle handling - excellent books!!! 90 ratings - so sad. Wonderful stories.

Susan Matthews - warning: EDGES - torturer protagonist, haunting perspectives, well worked out SF - Highest number of ratings - 143

R. M. Meluch - rounded characters, well thought themes. Her more serious work is totally unknown. Her space opera - moderately noted, and highly entertaining with some spoof on political bents. Her highest rating: 569

Kristine Smith - edgy SF/diverse cultures (happens to be SF) - her highest rating for her Jani Killian series: 438

Ricardo Pinto - diversely gendered; utterly strange mix of S American influenced culture - as richly written and realized as anything done by R. R. Eddison (thick style warning - highest rated book 692.

R. A. MacAvoy - mature protagonists, well rounded cast of characters, not medieval Europe/she wrote contemporary Ireland and UF, also Renaissance based fantasy - highest rated 2470, and that would be the one that was up for awards. Most of her list is dreadfully obscure.

Elizabeth A. Lynn - diversely gendered fantasy - Chronicles of Tarnor series highest rated book is 491, and her SF is lower still.

Sarah Zettel - Isavalta - diverse culturally - draws off Russia, China, India for her world backdrops, each book focuses on one of the cultures, all taking place in the same world. Highest rated Isavalta book is 567, and her SF is lower still.

Mickey Zucker Reichert - draws off Norse - her Bifrost Guardians series highest rated is 203.

C J Cherryh's standalone fantasy The Paladin (oriental backdrop) rated at 941. One of the best depictions of a female warrior done anywhere, anywhen.

Susan Schwartz - byzantine fantasies, centering on silk road culture - Silk Roads and Shadows and Byzantium's Crown - ratings listed are 13 and 14, respectively. If you enjoy Kay.....

Paul Park - Princes of Roumania series - highly original writer, literate ideas - rating numbers: 505

Karin Lowachee - Gaslight Dogs - EDGY, grimdark, horror - setting drawn from Alaska and NW/with a huge blend of mythologies and cavalry officer protag....totally as bloody and strange as anything out there. 306 ratings.

Gregory Frost - wrote the legend of Cuculainn (Celtic) in two volumes. Less well known than Stephen Lawhead for no reason I can see. Ratings: 391

Joy Chant - Red Moon and Black Mountain - love Narnia? Read this now....recorded ratings 272.

Now here is a long list of hidden books that have all the diversity anyone could request - made in a matter of a few minutes, hardly trying (on my part).....HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF THESE? Read them??? Aware of them?

The hardest to locate was Susan Shwartz because her name does not have a C in it. Common spelling of sChwartz won't  find her; I spent ten minutes digging for her page, despite people asking for Byzantine/Silk Road fantasy recently - she never turns up.

So internet saavy is not likely to help these books - a whit - because for the internet to work, Somebody has to know such titles exist.

There is one particular fantasy writer whose twitter feed bewails the lack of muslim perspective, POC, etc, over and over and over.... cites the sad lack - and yet, is completely unaware of Steven Barnes who does both...he has a background in script writing; tried a hand in fiction with diverse angles and totally has disappeared. I wish, now that people are writing stumps on lack of diversity - such books as his would be brought to light.

Ideally they would be.

But algorithm searches shove such titles deeper into obscurity than they ever were....electronic publishing may make them available, but....they are unlikely to surface.

Why I suggested stumping for more diversity sinks time- when diversity exists that may enrich the picture considerably.

Last thought: I read all SORTS of books, I have not 'searched' out books based on diversity, but based on story. These authors are ones that 'stuck in my head' after years and years of reading. There will be many more. My library is not a bit comprehensive, nor is this list. it was a morning's quick effort to tarnish the golden idealism: that the Internet 'discovers' everything. It absolutely doesn't.

Right after instant computer tracking - search function algorithms, which are going to shove these titles so deep into the background, who will be likely to find them?

Each one of these writers - an editor and publisher took a chance on, invested in - not to the tune of the ginormous advance given to Goodkind or Martin, no....they disappeared because the readership did not discover them fast enough; they were not centerline profile sort of books. Yet in todays blog drive decrying lack of diversity, they should be surfacing - and with the exception of Kirstein, largely are not...and even with Kirstein, mentioned quite frequently - it is not 'lifting' her out of obscurity anytime quick.

My question of challenge: how many titles would these authors have written in Fantasy or SF if they'd had moderate success? Some have quit. Some are writing in other genres. Some - still laboring in the salt mines of depression.

Stumping the cry of lack does nothing to demonstrate the truly amazing breadth the field has to offer.

Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth.

I was initially looking at the Guarder kits for the lower price and availabiliity in Europe (this is a big factor, since I live in Italy and our customs are pita).

Regarding PGC, they are so expensive for me, considering that if I buy a MBK, I gotta get internal upgrades as well; so it would be kinda heart breaking to spend that much money. 

Also I've just discovered that the Mk.25 uses a non-E2 body, the one I like.. In your opinion, if I get an E2 MBK and I have the anchor engraved, would it be too fantasy-based? Because it's just so strange that SEALs don't use the E2 version, which, imho, is more comfortable to hold

They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia""; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.
The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic.

0,scruffybot,,cnbbz8s,False,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.

Spain: Texas or USC. Once a feared contender of the world, now in a stump, but still pretty well respected. And also, ustedes hablan español que mas.

France: Michigan. Ridiculed because of a defeat that will haunt your history for ages to come, although you're still one of the strongest on the stage.

Sweden: TCU. loved by many, hated by few. Known for having very hot women.

Italy: Florida. Like Florida, you're pretty much europe's weirdly shaped penis. 

Germany: Ohio State. Everyone knows your a world super power, and you guys are pretty much everywhere. Outside your regional power, no one really minds you. That's a different story in Central Europe.

Poland: Boise State. You're always in between everyone's power struggle. 

Greece: Notre Dame. a long ass time ago, you guys where THE world. You're pretty good now, of course, but... You still rely on other certain powers to stabilize your economy.

Ireland: Auburn. You really fucking hate your neighbors. They exposed your resources and have imposed there imperialistic might on you for centuries. On top of that, you've had some shitty luck, including having the resources to be a world power only to be smited by parasitical natural forces. Ironically though, you guys are known for your luck, although in recent times, it seems that you guys do possess some luck-giving charms. Just ask Georgia fans.

Scotland: LSU. It's only fair for the sec west to complete the pure spiteful rivalry that exists in the British isles.  

Georgia: Georgia. This one's self-explanatory.

Russia: Florida State. You have a really great resume of world domination, although many people hate your guts, since you tend to make new enemies for yourself, and have some questionable people under your service. 

Norway: Minnesota. You guys are pretty low profile. People know you mostly by your bodies of water. It's also right to have a Nordic country represent a state highly populated with people of Nordic decent.

Switzerland: Wisconsin. Cheese.

Belgium: Oregon. I'm gonna make this related to soccer, where Belgium is the new hip team in town with a high scoring offence and plenty of potential for damage.

Hungary: Miami. you've produced many great people in your history, you have beautiful cities and a great tradition, but have gone through ups and downs in your history, and sadly, have been irrelevant for some time now.

GLTs came close, dropping to 750 at one point, and **mountain gorillas** are dangerously close with a total population of 880 (other gorilla subspecies are doing somewhat better). The **[European Bison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_bison)** were hunted to extinction in the wild, and all living European bison are the product of captive breeding. While they now number around 4,500, the inbreeding is starting to affect the [reproductive capabilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_bison) of the bulls. 

**Grizzly bears** hit a low point of 140 a few decades ago but I believe that was just in the lower 48 states. Currently in the lower 48 there are about 500. The **One-Humped Camel** has dropped so low as to be considered extinct in the wild, with just feral populations existing solely in Australia. The **California Condor** is at 130 in the wild but there are some conservation programs currently active.

The **Yangtze Dolphin** is believed to be extinct, and the **Amur Leopard** is down to 40 individuals. The lack of genetic diversity has kicked in and is not helping the matter. The **Asiatic Lion** is at 350 but is considered stable, but the **Sumatran Rhino** (300) isn't looking good and I think the **Javan Rhino** is (60) considered fucked.

The following tiger species are all below 500: **Indochinese**, **Malayan**, **Sumatran** and **Siberian**. The **South China tiger** hasn't been seen in quite awhile, so it is safe to assume they are under 400, in fact the assumption is that they are at 0. (China is not a good country in which to be an endangered species).

The **Northern Right Whale** is down to 350. They are under threat from a number of causes, with an 'unsustainably small population' being one of them. Changing animal species entirely, the **Red Wolf** is down to about 100, though there are captive breeding programs.

Okay, so that's all I could come up with between a scan of my old notes and good old google, there are probably others I've missed. Some species don't seem to have been affected by the diminished genetic diversity yet, but for some it is one of the reasons they are endangered (I've tried to note that).

paralyzes the social development of those who follow it.  No stronger retrograde

A blog does not need descriptive content on the homepage. What's the homepage supposed to rank for? Business Insider &amp; TechCrunch don't have content on their homepage either. Google understands it's a blog and that the value is in the actual articles.

While some on-site optimization could be done, the main reason the site isn't doing well in the organic results is because the site lacks authority. The backlink profile of the site is horrible and would be a primary target for an algorithmic penalty.

@OP, you mentioned you disavowed the 'odesk' links, are you sure you included ALL of them? Because those are some really nasty and hurtful links. In case you DID disavow all of them, there would be hardly any good links left.

Also, that seorch.eu tool is terrible... (Is that what people call an audit these days?) It starts off with ""The 4 most important OnPage SEO factors"", followed by a bunch of bullsh#t.

1. While your title could definitely be more descriptive, there is no rule regarding max. characters. I have yet to see any conclusive case study which shows that fitting your title within the given space of Google's design contributes to your ranking potential.
2. The meta description is not a ranking factor and nowhere near the most important factors
3. Content should be well written and relevant for your audience. There is no minimum text length.
4. The title attribute of an anchor does not have any effect on the ranking potential of your website.

After seeing all that I closed the page and you should too!

I didn't really read through the content, but my first impression was that it looked good and informative. You need to publish some really unique articles and/or research which you can seed on other relevant sites and start building your own audience. You might also want to try to submit your site to Google News.

Also, I personally really dislike Yoast... I know it's a really popular plugin since it's been around for such a long time, but last time I attempted to use it the UI was really bad, I could not get everything done that I wanted to do and it's full with useless clutter. (It also had conflicts with other plugins, but that could also be caused by the other plugins I was using at that time). Maybe it has improved a lot over time but I highly doubt it.

A lot of Pokemon distributed are in correlation to the anime or the movies and characters within them. It comes from Japan but a lot of people see them outside of Japan also.

In Japan, we're giving you X pokemon for Febuary 11th (national holiday), we'll distribute it in the US for the 4th of July and in Europe you can pick several dates for the whole continent.

3,palcatraz,,cnbesda,False,"No, you misunderstand me. Consumer law coverage has nothing to do with the actual repair but more of who is responsible for the repair.

In Europe (and many other countries, but I know most about Europe) we have something known as consumer law. Consumer law is meant to protect consumers (so you and me) against faulty business practises. It basically means that if you buy an expensive product like a computer or a refrigerator, you expect that product to last you a pretty long time. Nobody buys a MBP and expects it to break down after a year, for example. The EU feels that for these kind of products, just one year of warranty is too little. So under EU consumer law, customers are entitled to at least second year of warranty, and many individual countries add to this.

However this warranty is limited by certain factors. First of all, consumer law is about you being able to buy a product without faulty parts. This means that consumable parts (like batteries and HDs) pretty much never fall under consumer law. If a company can prove that the product they supplied you with had proper parts and the issue was due to your own carelessness, you cannot claim consumer law warranty, and you have to pay for a repair yourself. If they cannot prove that, you will get a repair under warranty.

Another factor for consumer law is that you must claim consumer law at the **point of sale** and not the company that makes the product, unless, of course, you directly bought the product from them. So, for me, as a Dutch person, if I buy an IMac at, say, the Mediamarket, a dutch consumer electronics store, if I want to claim consumer law, I must claim it at that store, and not Apple. If I buy my IMac directly from Apple, via their online store, for example, only then I can claim consumer law directly from Apple. As this MBP will be bought in America, to claim consumer law, one would technically have to put in the claim at the store in the states. However, because America does not have consumer law to my knowledge, they don't have to honour it and you'd be pretty much shit out of luck. 

Apple has more information about the exact consumer law rights customers are entitled to in the UK on their website [here] (http://www.apple.com/uk/legal/statutory-warranty/)

So, to sum up this dreadful boring long store - should the laptop break outside of the first year of warranty without apple care, it can be repaired in the UK, but the owner will have to pay, because consumer law only protects him if he would've bought the laptop in the UK.

Those numbers are net migration. If a million people move from the UK to France and a million people move from France to the UK, that counts as zero net migration. Most of the migration to rich EU countries comes from people outside the EU in Africa, Middle East, or Asia. Also, the economic differences between the rich EU countries and the poor EU countries is just as great as the differences between the USA and Mexico.

Not saying it's your fault, but if Africans are better at integrating than Arabs, then you can't simply blame racism. Like half of the Muslims in Europe are religious fundamentalists and xenophobic. This often leads to self-chosen segregation from the rest of society. Some parents seem to rather send their children into Quran school, instead of a German language course.

Of course the high amount of problematic people among Turks and Arabs may also lead to employers rather not giving a job to Turks and Arabs. It's similar if your name is Kevin. Because if your name is Kevin in Germany, that usually means you come from a lower class family, were a failure at school and make problems.

Also, we have lots of low income people in East Germany. Yet they don't have such extreme problems with crime as in West Germany. And Turks and Arabs are leading the migrant crime statistics.

-17,scruffybot,,cnbhbhr,False,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own.

-3,scruffybot,,cnbhc9q,False,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.
In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.
Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.
Beatles' ""Aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.
Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones.

But it is not the way to deal with problems in Western countries, no matter how the situation is.

&gt; I admit I do see the irony here but my point is that it's not political 

It is the consequence of the failed immigration policy. I want to stress that the policy has obviously failed, and that I see it as the root cause. Things should have been done differently, but they weren't. Now here's a problem from that. I think this is something which should be first and foremost acknowledged by the people on all sides.

&gt; It's a personal change. You can't force a country to adhere and change to suit other people.

And you shouldn't. I agree. And herein lies the problem. There are too many people wanting the change, they have formed their own enclaves and communities. They have been *allowed to do so*. Why? That has been the mistake which I don't want people to turn a blind eye to.

&gt; This is the most basic concept of national sovereignty of any nation and its Germany's right to run their country as they see fit. 

Sure, I personally have no problem with that, as long as they do so adhering to the laws they've made and without discriminating anyone.

&gt; Why you don't understand this is baffling. 

That I am not preaching it doesn't mean I don't understand it. The fact that I am not blaming Muslims for these problems doesn't mean that I somehow believe that these aren't real problems which need a solution.

&gt; What do you expect Germany to do to change for these people? 

I don't know. I have no solutions but I think some form of change has to take place.

&gt; Do you expect the country to go against the will of its own citizens just so they avoid offending ANOTHER country that doesn't give a fuck about anyone except Muslims? 

No. On the other hand I also do not take it as the will of citizens to blame Muslims for the problems of certain immigrant/asylum seeking groups in Germany (or elsewhere, these problems happen all over the Europe after all).

&gt; This religion is selfish and ruinous to a developed society. 

As is Christianity if interpreted literally. The same can be said about pretty much anything, when interpreted in a clever way. I personally don't bother taking part in religious discussions as I consider all of them shit. I'd see secularity as a way to go everywhere in the world.

&gt; You point to breeding hatred just because it's easy but you choose to avoid seeing the actual problem and keep parroting on that its political or that some legislation was poorly designed but you're missing the most simple part. 
&gt;
&gt; These people want to come to another country to live, which doesn't share their beliefs. They know this fully before coming - and could choose to go to another country that does - yet they come anyway. 

Yes, they do, *because they can*. I mean, *of course* they try to go to a country where they are best off, and ideally don't want to abandon their personal beliefs or culture. So tell me. Why *can* these people do so? Why *can* they cause these problems?

&gt; Then they get there and go ""hey we're here now we want you all to do this and no longer do this"" and the people living there are like ummm I'm sorry - what? And they're painted like complete assholes. 

Painted like complete assholes by whom? In which way? Case in point?

&gt; If the changes that Muslims generally wanted to make were positive then they might be well received but they're not. Time and again we see the religious ideology changing the habits and social norms in the lives of the people around them and why the fuck should Germany change? 

What are the changes you claim *Muslims generally* want? Because I don't think there are many changes which majority of the Muslim population want to see happen. Don't mix the vocal minority with the whole. The cultural and religious differene between for example a male Somali muslim and a female Indonesian muslim is so wide that there's no way to accurately generalize this over Muslims as a whole.

&gt; Stop trying to make it political. It's not. It's religious and personal. People are unwilling to compromise and just get along - as I said no law can fix that. 

The problem is certainly more religious and cultural with these problematic groups of people, I agree. However, I disagree that we can generalize from that to blame the whole Muslim population in Germany, or Europe or the whole world. Furthermore I stress that had the immigration policy been different, the problem would be far different. See the difference between e.g. Sweden and Finland as a case in point. The situation is quite catastrophic in certain areas of Sweden, however, Finland isn't nowhere near dealing with problems of that scale, namely because the scale of immigration has been much stricter. Hence why I first and foremost blame the reckless policies and refrain from blaming Muslims.",1420148900,0,t1_cnbi3on,t3_2r0nvr,False,0,False,t5_2qh13,,0,,0,1425112092,t1_cnbh11h,worldnews

3,juztewan,,cnbkkv9,False,"It's insane to a pre-vote citizen. In the early stages it was a  bizarre concept and cast aside from everyone left wing to right wing. I for one thought it arose directly from the nuclear threat of Holy Loch in 2035 - a clusterfuck surrounding the unauthorised launching of a British nuclear missile. The event culminated in fall out, death and an absurd increase in distrust towards government. After a series of nightmarish problems relating to Holy Loch, the vote was set up out of sheer worry and paranoia. It originated from a small group of European nihilists that no one considered intelligent or important. They called themselves democratic nihilists, suggesting that the population was doomed to be destroyed by its own leader's faults. The turnout was limited and the voting system was an intrinsically biased, bureaucratic mess. No one thought it would gain traction.


Thirty years on however, it is an annual vote in which all the world must take part. Over the decade after Holy Loch, more and more people took part in the nihilist's little vote. Liberals, marxists, republicans, democrats, the italian fascists and the British working class - you name it. It became a normal thing, a part of the year that revolved around a small decision on a much bigger subject. The vote stopped being third party 2045. Now it is illegal not to vote and I have voted yes to discontinuation for the last 5 years. I hear that the yes vote did well last year. It will do well this year. 


Although the vote only matters if it reaches 60%, I can't help thinking we're heading for the end. I for one would rather I went out of this world on my terms. I don't know how they'll launch discontinuation. It might be a bomb , it could be gas. The point is that I'd rather it was a population's choice and not the human error of a political elite that have become more and more cavalier and trigger happy with their nuclear technology and weaponry. Our governments are clueless and Holy Loch showed just how unsafe we are. 


What's worse?: An unknown number of days living in paranoia or the knowledge that you will leave this world as a result of human agreement and democracy. One last glimpse of a perfect working society. I voted yes last year and I'll do the same this year.

Cheaper groceries by leaving CAP. Net saving of £4bn a year minus whatever subsidies we keep.

Increased personal allowance (assuming £15k) It will cost around £12bn to take it to £12,500, so roughly speaking lets say an extra £16bn to get to £15k. This can be mostly offset by  getting rid of the £13-14bn net contribution to the EU we're making.

Legal aid- £350m to reverse all cuts.

Electoral reform- unquantifiable. Depends on what it is.

SME deregulation- no significant cost.

STEM tuition fees- no cost in the short term, long term the increased tax revenue from more STEM workers is expected to pay for the decreased tuition fee returns.

0,Nilpferdschaf,,cnbl7z9,False,"No. It's an article about a group of people who aren't happy with their quarters in Östersund. They say there are too many wild animals, too far from a big city and too cold. They also say living 8 in one room is too much (there is a huge housing shortage in Sweden). They say they want to live in a city like Stockholm or Malmö.

Yes, they are complaining about Östersund, but they were living in Malmö before and they claim it wasn't made clear enough to them that they were being moved to Östersund.

&gt;De mellan 30 och 40 asylsökande protesterar för att de tycker att de lurats att åka från Malmötrakten till ett asylboende utanför Östersund.  

&gt;De ska också ha fått nödvändig information om att de skulle bussas drygt hundra mil norrut till Östersund. Men Migrationsverket kommer ändå att följa upp exakt vilken information som gavs och om det blivit några missförstånd.

I'm pretty sure that says exactly that. Obviously this is a misunderstanding, but from their perspective they are being tricked to live up North in the middle of nowhere.

&gt;For one, thousands before them didn't complain, and they go on a hunger strike, making the jobs of migration workers, bus drivers and waste the cops' time just because they didn't get to live in a bigger city. Majority of Swedes don't live in a big city. The reporter even said ""But I live here"" and they said ""Yes but we're arabs"" like that would make a difference.

Thousands before them were told they had to go to Östersund. These people for some reason were not properly informed, so they are now feeling cheated. And them being arabs makes a difference in this case. The climate in Östersund is [much much harder in Östersund](http://www.uk.gardenweb.com/forums/zones/hze2.html). They come from a really warm climate and being in Malmö during winter was probably pretty harsh already and now they live in a region that's 20°C cooler during winter.

&gt;Sure they aren't used to it but if you flee from wars you can't exactly pick and choose a central apartment in Stockholm.

They don't want an apartement in central Stockholm, they'd just like to remain where they were before the move. Keep in mind they think they have been tricked out of there.

IMHO Washington has succeeded in taking the vast majority of the Ukraine. And Washington analysts had to know that Novorosiyya was un- winnable from the start.

Novorosiyya's use was only intended, at this early stage of Cold War 2 to be able to mobilize European public opinion to support a massive expansion of NATO and for the Europeans to pay for a lot of it.

The real question is what is Washington going to do with the rest of the Ukraine? In order secure Washington's part, (most) of the Ukraine as the speaker said, the Americans are going to have to make a massive capital investment in a country that is structurally corrupt and where that investment could easily disappear like fine wine poured on sand in the beach. 

The Europeans have made it clear they won't pay a dime.

But as I said Cold War 2 is just in its infancy. Washington has big plans for the Ukraine, as a cats paw against Russia and whether Novorosiyya is an independent country or a part of the Ukraine will be immaterial in Washington prosecuting those plans. 

Of course if Novrosiyya were to be integrated back into the Ukraine they would act as a Russian 5th column within the country, but there are far too few people there for them to make much of a difference should Washington be able to convince the rest of the Ukrainian people that it was in their interest to face Russia off in a war.

1023,Cybugger,,cnbo941,False,"The people stating things along the lines of ""As an American, this distrubs me"", can I point something out, very clearly: The Muslims who immigrate to the US are not the same as those immigrating to Europe. In particular, a vast majority of the Muslims that have immigrated to the US are relatively wealthy, well educated and moderate. What's more, the proportion of Muslims in the US is ridiculously low compared to most EU countries.

Now, I am firmly against discriminating against Muslims. They are free to come, and to integrate European society. And that's the key: integrate. The problem is the small minority of extremists that have infiltrated the UK, France, Germany, etc... They want Sharia law. They want others to follow Ramadan. They want to be able to beat women, they want to be able to force marriages. These are not people who are worthy of our defence. They simply are not. They can go back to whatever backwards society they came from, that imposes those same ""values"". Another issue is that the Islamic community, while working against extremism, is still partially to blame as a whole. There is no way to get away from that. For proof, I point to the huge numbers of Hindus in the UK who are not threatening to blow up buses, or decaptitating soldiers in broad daylight, or the vast Kosovan/Albanian population in Switzerland who are not threatning Djihad, or any other real minority. This is a problem that is nearly entirely reserved to the Islamic community. Something is failing, and people have had enough.

And all this coming from a man who knows, and is friends with loads of Muslims. However, they are people who have integrated into Western society, and espoused our values, while keeping their own cultural heritage alive. The issue is with those extremists who spit in our faces, despise us because we don't share their hatred for all non-believers, but also with those in the Islamic community who defend them through inaction and silence. They can fuck right off, back to whatever hell-hole they crawled out of. 

If they don't like our system of law; guess what, it is a fundamental right that everyone be treated equally in the eyes of the law. Not happy with that? Fuck off. Want to be able to impose your misogynistic ways onto us? Fuck off. (Note: I'm not saying that all Muslims are misogynistic: just that the extremists are). Threaten us with violence? Fuck off.

24,cdstephens,,cnboi5u,False,"That's not really what I said. At all. It's not excusable or justifiable, and there have always been critics to slavery and other contemporary acknowledged social evils. However, at certain points in time in certain places, they were the status quo, and critics were seen as extremists and often treated as such.

There is a real difference between someone arguing against those things now vs when they were popular. It's more understandable for someone in the early 1900s to not be openly supportive of gays for example given the consequences, but that also makes those who did all the more courageous and heroic. So, one should keep in mind the context of the times (what ideals were children raised under, what dangers critics faced, social pressures, lack of free public discourse) before a denouncement. Understanding why certain people held certain attitudes is not the same as excusing them. 

So, fact is, slavery was commonplace when Christianity was forming. It was also not to the gross extent of 1800s America. As such, one should not be *surprised* that one of the now dominant, global belief systems doesn't have in its documents outright denouncements of slavery given when those documents were written, distributed, and analyzed. You can argue that perhaps they should have (it would have been the better moral stance). But, you can't deny that due to the prevailing attitudes at the time and the centuries afterwards it's doubtful that such a staunch stance would have survived for centuries. Any Christian documents denouncing slavery could have easily been ignored, lost, and forgotten. It's also not deniable that our society isn't using the Bible to justify slavery and racism anymore, and the belief system around it has changed since then.

If you wanted better, you'd be better off arguing that the leaders and thinkers of Roman society should have discouraged slavery, rather than arguing a product of Roman society consumed by the masses should have. It's one thing to expect an educated, powerful person with advisors and history to rely on to know better. It's another thing to expect Alex the farmer struggling to know better. That doesn't excuse Alex the farmer of any wrong doing, and it's certainly not only society's fault for his/her moral failures. Alex the farmer after all was a free thinking actor. But, Alex was still a product of the times, and if his/her farmer parents taught Alex that slavery was fine or a necessary evil, then most likely that's what Alex will think as well.

Likewise if I raise my kids to hate gay people and live in a country where that view is tolerated or encouraged, then my children will *probably* hate gay people. That doesn't make hating gay people all of the sudden morally fine or excusable, but how much can you expect humans, dumb animals as we are, to know better in all situations? That is why education is important and necessary after all. Or, if you eat meat now, and 200 years in the future the consumption of animal life that complex is treated as a grave immoral act, does that make you an evil person? After all, there are vegetarians and vegans that argue for animal rights all around the world. On the other hand, you might have been raised to eat meat, and refusing to eat meat might be too much of an inconvenience, or outright impossible depending on where you live. Could one argue that you should know better? Are your actions completely excusable? I don't know, it's a tough question. But I do know we shouldn't be too quick to judge the actions of those before us, and it's more productive to understand why people did the things they did, what ideas and social forces were in motion, than to simply label those who came before us as good or evil.

In the case of the Civil War, I would argue that given the national debate surrounding slavery, Europe's trend away from slavery, and the rapid rate at which ideas could be exchanged due to technology, the economic and political leaders of the Confederacy should have known better. But certainly you can look into why they didn't know better, or if they did know better why they chose to do what they did anyways, rather than just placing a moral label on them.",1420161522,0,t1_cnboi5u,t3_2r12qz,False,0,1420161800,t5_2ss5b,,0,,24,1425109031,t1_cnbmu0a,SubredditDrama

And lets be real here, pretty much nobody gives a fuck if an englishman settles down in Italy. We don't whine that they hold onto some of their own cultural ideals. 

Additionally, the reason we're expecting ourselves to be multicultural because we are also the reason a lot of those people are here. I can only speak for my own country (The Netherlands) but I am certain there are similarities in other European countries.

Take after the second world war, for example. The Netherlands really needed manpower at that point. During war, many young men had died, and a lot of the survivors had gone to Canada. So we had a labour deficit. So what do we do? We invited so many young men from other countries to come work here, first from the rest of Europe then from Turkey and Morocco. We expected these people to stay here for a short time than go home when we didn't need them anymore. Which, personally, I find a pretty douchey assumption. Oh please come solve our problems, but then you do not get to reap any of the rewards, cause you should go back to your own countries and try and build up something there after decades abroad. 

As you can expect that didn't work very well.

These people didn't go. They settled down here, brought over their families or created new ones here, their children were born here, they have never known their 'home countries'. They helped us out when we needed it, we kinda owe it to them to allow them to live here as well. 

And that is not even the only way people got here. The Netherland used to be a huge colonial power. We had colonies all over the world. We forced our culture and politics on these people, not always to positive effect for the people there. Take the Maluku Islands and Indonesia. After the world war, The Netherlands was all to eager to get their hands back on Indonesia. The people of Indonesia were not very happy with this and they fought for their freedom. Of course The Netherlands were not exactly going to take that lying down. Now we had a colonial army in that time, filled with people from the region. One of the most elite corps in it were the Maluku corps.  These men had fought and died for us. But when Indonesia became independent, suddenly they were considered traitors there because they had sided with the Dutch. We couldn't abandon those people exactly so those that wanted to were brought over here 'temporarily'. So temporarily we took the liberty of discharging them from the army too. Oh but they could not work in the Netherlands either, cause no, they were going home soon, right? We allowed them to live here but only barely. We did not allow them to integrate into our society until years and years later. And now we are complaining about how they are not properly integrated.

I just started a couple of months ago. Have you been a fan of the lore in the Warcraft universe? I've been following it on the sideline and i enjoyed questing my character to level 100. I'm a Dranei Monk, and i particularly enjoyed the first levels in the Dranei starting zone, immersing myself in the world and becoming a small-pond hero, then later on i was very glad to do quests and experiencing an area called Borean Tundra (lvl 70+), also the Pandaria questing was very rich. Finally you hit 90 and you get to Draenor and enjoy the last expansion pack.

I started with a 10 day Warlords of Draenor trial (no level limit) and from there bought the game and my character.

Maybe you can find someone here on Reddit you can add, who can help you and give you tips. I play on EU-Zenedar. If you really want to hit 100 quickly consider using the ""Refer A Friend"" 300% Bonus XP. I believe you need to be playing in group with someone who has a wow account, so you could find someone who wants to level an alternative character with you (they also get the bonus).

**Monks, from the PoV of a new player:**

Can tank, deal damage and heal!

For solo questing you want to be a Brewmaster (Tank) or a Windwalker (Damage). Later on you can search for dungeons with people of your own lvl, and that goes much quicker if you have a tank or a healer specialization. You can have two specializations at one time.

They are mobile, quick, have a daily 1h 50% xp boost and free teleport to a major city (on top of your heartstone, which you bind to the area you are currently questing in). They can also look very charming:
http://i.imgur.com/gg73R5j.png

Later on you hit endgame content such  as PVP (haven't spent so much time here), raids where you optimize the way you play your own role and perhaps you start soloing old content just to experience those storylines and get some cool-looking gear. Don't be afraid to jump around guilds until you find a place you like being that suits your way of playing - I've learnt a lot from my more experienced guildmates.",1420166795,0,t1_cnbr9ek,t3_2r272v,False,0,1420166980,t5_2qio8,,0,,3,1425107526,t3_2r272v,wow

5,red_dakini,,cnbrtyx,False,"I gave up my 'normal' life and worked and lived at a Buddhist temple in Europe for two years. I originally went to visit someone I knew who lived there, and intended to be there for just a few months, but I enjoyed it so much I decided to stay. My time there was life changing. I became part of a wonderful community of like minded people from all over the world. It was amazing to be completely surrounded by the dharma, practicing and receiving teachings every day. I also worked hard and was challenged every day (both spiritual work and practical work, living at a Buddhist monastery will definitely involve some practical work). I contemplated making it my life. 

What made me decide not to though was relatively practical, a lot of the others who lived there full time were much older than me. They had had careers, saved money, owned property that helped keep them afloat. They could afford medical bills, or to fly home suddenly if a loved one was ill. Working at the temple covered my food and board, but it didn't provide anything else. For me personally, I felt I needed to finish my qualifications and build a safety net for myself, with the aspiration to return to that life later. It's easy to say money doesn't matter when you have some, but in reality having enough to take care of yourself is important.  

Looking at the others who were with me at the temple, it was different for everyone. Some have stayed, making it their life entirely. Others (including a very dedicated friend who was a monastic aspirant) stayed for many years longer than myself but also eventually decided to return to a more regular life. Some have a found a balance where they live and work in the surrounding area but make time in their lives to do retreats etc. 

So reflecting on my experiences and those of my friends, my advice to you would be to give it a go and not have expectations about where it will lead. People who thought it was exactly what they wanted and they were in it for life are now back at home married with kids, people who thought they were just passing through for the experience have given up everything to stay, and everything in between. You never know if it's right for you unless you try it. 

I also definitely recommend finding a teacher,  I think long periods in retreat without proper guidance might feel nice but probably won't get you very far.

There were a lot of tensions in New Orleans between Creoles and Americans in the direct aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase. The reason the French Quarter is called ""French"" is that when Americans began settling in New Orleans they didn't intermingle in the city with the Creoles but instead started their own settlement in what is the CBD, Uptown, and the Garden District today. 

Rural areas tended to be similarly segregated, partially because different ethnic groups tended to settle together (see for instance the ""German Coast"" in Louisiana), and partially because of religious and cultural divides. Americans tended to be Protestant and established Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches where they settled, while residents from the colonial era tended to be Catholic. I grew up in a Louisiana town founded around the time of the Purchase and it's immediately apparent just looking at the geography of how the town was laid out that it wasn't exactly a group effort.

I would say OCFC is getting a little more benefit of the doubt because they are an established team with an actual successful (albeit short) history in the US soccer landscape.

It seems less like mercenary hires and more like mutual respect. Also they have a set plan for a Soccer specific stadium.

NYCFC has almost none of the above. It's fan base is growing but based off nothing but the idea of a team. They have never played a game, never had an amazing comeback win and never gotten to trot over to their fans after the game and applaud them and thank them for their support.

It is a reminder of older years of the league and goes against the business model MLS has been working towards. Specifically, that teams need their own SSS to build revenue.
The biggest issue I believe however is ownership. The Yankees involvement comes across as nothing more than an investment with them showing no real interest in the club. Manchester City's involvement comes across as making a breeding ground for their club in England. NYCFC, along with Melbourne, feel like they are going to be used as feeder clubs. This compared to, being taken seriously as their own free standing organizations. With this, it feels like NYCFC will be pushed around and at the will of Manchester City. The Frank Lampard fallout is coming across as a scary realization of this though process. 

Also as much as this statement is beaten to death, sports in New York, specifically NYC, is always under much more scrutiny than other cities. Regardless of ""fan base size"" or ""fan intelligence"" that is often used to explain it their is more information coming out of NY daily than in Orlando. All the magazines, newspapers in NY outweigh everywhere else. Therefore little things that happen are scrutinized on a wider scale. With this, little things are also glorified on a larger scale. You get information about Jason Kreis, Claudio Reyna, David Villa and Frank Lampard shoved down your throat for long enough and you get tired of it. It is easy to hate New York teams because they are always being talked about and glorified. 

In short I would say NYCFC is slowly being built as the villain of MLS. It has done everything in a way that MLS fans and supporters fear; Using big money (bringing up fears of the NASL days of old), not building their own stadium, conceding to european clubs as inferior (or at least giving the image they are) and the last is New York is obviously going to have one of the best teams in the world some day. Granted it could be decades. But once MLS gets to a point where there is no DP spots and free cap space a New York based team will always have more money to spend. They will always be able to attract international players because of the name ""New York"". It is the Milan of Italy, the Madrid of Spain, the Paris of France, the Munich of Germany, the Manchester of England. Players will always want to play their. So eventually everyone is going to hate them some day. Why not start now :)

tl;dr OCFC is building an organization the MLS way (SSS, Owner, Fan connections). NYCFC is doing the opposite (no Stadium, Owned by European club who seems to not respect them, growing fan base with no history). Also New York is a market with a lot of money which is something to be feared in a future without cap space or DP restrictions

&gt;__Lipedema__, known as __lipoedema__ in Europe, is a [chronic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_disorder) of [adipose tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue) generally affecting the legs, which causes the legs and sometimes the arms to accumulate fatty tissue.  It is distinguishable by six characteristics: 1) it can be inherited; 2) it occurs almost exclusively in women; 3) it can occur in women of all sizes, from the seriously underweight to the morbidly obese; 4) it involves the excess deposit and expansion of fat cells in an unusual and particular pattern – [bilateral](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bilateral), symmetrical and usually from the waist to a distinct line just above the ankles; 5) unlike normal fat, lipedematous fat generally cannot be lost through diet and exercise; and 6) a [pathognomonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic) indicator of lipedema is that the feet are spared.

Don't be. We have problems with a subgroup of immigrants (not necessarily even muslims, though I believe that is the largest group) that refuses to adapt to life in our respective countries. They refuse to speak our languages (excepting those that were born here or moved as children), they are rude to others who aren't part of their own culture (often especially women), they refuse to adapt to our customs, they reject our ideas about freedoms, rights, gender equality, etc and they commit crimes at high rates.

What's most astounding is that the U.S. regime has used this trick time and time again of shifting weapons transfers to other jurisdictions away from legal ramifications or public scrutiny only to have nothing but this whining ""Who me? We don't control what they do!"" lame attitude as an excuse.

Let's not forget it was the exact trick they pulled in the 1990's in the Balkans, in which former Warsaw Pact/East German (GDR) arms were funneled by the now pro-U.S. united Germany into north Albania and the Serbian province of Kosovo to the heroin-trafficking mafia known as the KLA. This was done with U.S. covert direction with Germany being a de facto occupied country and the largest American military base in Europe existing there, but because it was shifted to a third party jurisdiction it removed some of the heat from Washington. 

""We aren't arming anyone! It's the European countries on their own accord and we can't stop them! In fact, they're mad at us for not doing enough!"" How many years on and still spouting this absolute drivel? 

The same exact trick was used a few years before that when the U.S. Congress declared it illegal to allocate any more federal funds for the Contras death squad fighting the FSLN government in Nicaragua. Selling weapons to Iran and using the proceeds to fund those terrorists in Central America was how they did it, but after the '79 Iranian Revolution and the terrible state of relations with Khomeini even that would have looked atrocious, so they told Israel to provide them the weapons and subsequently replenished the Israeli stockpile with more U.S. arms.

14,Lrellok,,cnbxmhi,False,"Replace ""Christianity"" with ""Feminism"" in [On Liberty](https://librivox.org/on-liberty-by-john-stuart-mill/) and you have a clear explanation of EXACTLY why this occurred.

*Now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrews into the religion of the Roman empire. When their enemies said, ""See how these Christians love one another"" (a remark not likely to be made by anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause, probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still nearly confined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines, and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively active in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, or some such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland. There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognized sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers. Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there is no enemy in the field.*

*The same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional doctrines--those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of morals or religion. All languages and literatures are full of general observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which most people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally of a painful kind, has made it a reality to them. How often, when smarting under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person call to mind some proverb or common saying familiar to him all his life, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, would have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this, other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the full meaning cannot be realized, until personal experience has brought it home. But much more of the meaning even of these would have been understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply impressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it argued pro and con by people who did understand it. The fatal tendency of mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer doubtful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has well spoken of ""the deep slumber of a decided opinion.""*

1,heyjoe21,,cnbxsgk,False,"&gt; Are you sure? Let's call out a single example: there have been people living in the Sahara Desert (the Berbers) for at least 12,000 years. They have made a living trading across that sahel for most of that time. I don't think there is any European climate that nearly approaches that in terms of harsh environment and limited resources.

Yes, Berber face a harsh climate and limited resources.  But Europeans have faced harsh climates on the opposite end like extreme cold, much more exposure to disease and violent conflict, and while not a limited resoucres, a lot more people competing for them.  I guarantee you that Sahran populations have remained relatively stable through out history while Europe has experienced huge population swings as the norm for all it's history.  In the last century alone, Europe has experienced more death and destruction then most of the rest of the world in it's entire history.

2,atlasing,,cnbz96n,False,"&gt;Just saying, a ""workers' state"", or a degenerated one for that matter, could be a perfectly descriptive noun, and not be an oxymoron. It could degenerate by no longer being a workers' state (so, if a person were under the impression it were indeed a workers' state, it could easily degenerate from such - I'm sure there are arguments that the ussr was not, or... was, for lack of a better term, a DWS).

Yes, but we aren't talking semantics here. We're talking the actual meanings of these real, objective things that exist in the history of bourgeois society, and all class societies for that matter. The whole notion of a 'workers' state' is just as ludicrous as a 'peasants' state', and the reason why I have such a problem with it is because it's a fundamental revision of the Marxian conception of the state (not that one has been comprehensively laid out, say, as much as the governing laws of capitalist production for example, but you know what I mean), which has always been and always will be a body that exists over a society completely divided upon class antagonisms and their symptoms, which always exists to perpetuate this kind of society. It doesn't matter what the legal documents enshrine or what the bureaucrats proclaim, because as materialists we don't concern ourselves with such matters. The idea of a workers' state is absolutely not identical to the theory of the revolutionary proletarian dictatorship, it was something that came about to justify the dictatorship *over* the workers that was found in the bolshevist bureaucracy in Russia. Sure  this bureaucracy degenerated over time, but that doesn't change the historical fact that it was an organ of capitalist industrial development in eastern Europe, something that completely transcended the consciousness of the 'professional revolutionaries', their ideology, or their ideas about brining 'revolutionary consciousness' from outside of the proletariat into it  from the top down. This idealist utopianism is not revolutionary, quite the opposite. The same goes for the defunct relics of failed 20th century communist revolutions known as 'workers states'.

&gt;I'm curious to see learn where ""states and societies mean the same thing"" comes from... maybe the phrasing isn't clear here and i'm missing something that should be obvious, but i mean, obviously a lot of areas overlap, but not all. I'm sure a Venn diagram could help.

I was referring to the implication that the trotskyite above made, the idea that the mode of production present in Russia from 1917-1991 was a 'degenerated workers state' and not in fact capitalism with red flags, and that before this period existed a nascent capitalism with a rapidly growing working class and afterward a deeply reactionary capitalist society. It's ridiculous. Some stalinists try to weasel out of this by claiming that the glorious communism is one country was lost to 'revisionism' after Stalin choked on his own vomit, but all they're doing is trying to cover it up. States are very clearly bodies that exist outside of and above civil society,  this is pretty basic Marx. mhi has a pretty good article on this.


&gt;State's, as we have now, didn't really exist up until the treaty of Westphalia, at which time they began to be... and speaking of now, with globalisation, sovereignty means much less, with each new FTA the meaning of our borders diminishes, Marx would appreciate that.

FTAs are necessary agreements between bourgeois states and bourgeois institutions, that exist to try and counteract the ever falling rate of profit. I'm sure Marx would appreciate the decline in european nationalism that we've had in the last few decades, but it's rising again just as it has in most crises of global capitalism. FTAs only hurt and divide the international working class even more. They're awful.

And why are you taking about the treaty of Westphalia? The ancient kingdoms of what is now the 'middle east' were all states, the Roman Empire was a state, the anglo-Saxon kingdoms were all states, and some very early capitalist states existed well before Westphalia in places like italy, mercantilist type stuff.

&gt;Do people only vote for candidates from their home countries?

Yes.

&gt;Are the political parties different than those in the respective countries?

Many local parties are in some pan-European party, f.e. [ALDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe_Party). Note that they have member parties outside EU too. 

So, parties who belong to ALDE form a political group in the Europarl, [adding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Liberals_and_Democrats_for_Europe_Group#Membership) few independently elected MEPs, and centrists from EDP.

Why EDP centrists join the ALDE? Cause they have similar views, but cannot form the political group in Europarl on their own, because they are too few or they do not represent the required amount of countries. IIRC political group needs to have representatives from 7 different EU countries, and have at least 15 members. 

So, if some party doesn't join or form any political group, they become non-inscripts, just like [National Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_(France) ).

*  With a lvl 90 toon you can farm grim batol easily.  One hour with potion of treasure finding will give you 1k+ liquid gold as well as a bunch of stuff that will sell fairly quickly.  Even without being a tailor and/or enchanter you can net about 2k per hour from grim batol.
*  85 raids are good as well as naxx 25.  naxx 25 is about 1k+ liquid gold if you vendor anything and everything.  
*  Enchanting is a good option as it will give you the ability to transform a luminous shard into Temporal Crystal each day and this should net a few hundred gold per transmute.  For second prof I suggest tailoring (for making bags) or jc (ore shuffle). 
*  Once you have a bit of capital you could look into ore/dust shuffle.  For this you need to have jc prof or jc building in your garrison as well enchanting prof or enchanting building in your garrison.  This also depends on your server economy.  I am in EU-Twisting Nether.

&gt;

&gt;__Childhood cancer__ (also known as __pediatric cancer__) is [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer) in a [child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child). In the United States, an arbitrarily adopted standard of the ages used are 0–14 years inclusive, that is, up to 14 years 11.9 months of age.   However, the definition of childhood cancer sometimes includes young adults between 15–19 years old.  __Pediatric oncology__ is the branch of [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine) concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in children.

&gt;Worldwide, it is estimated that childhood cancer has an [incidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology\)) of more than 175,000 per year, and a [mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate) of approximately 96,000 per year.  In developed countries, childhood cancer has a mortality of approximately 20% of cases.  In low resource settings, on the other hand, mortality is approximately 80%, or even 90% in the world's poorest countries.  In many developed countries the incidence is slowly increasing, as rates of childhood cancer increased by 0.6% per year between 1975 to 2002 in the United States  and by 1.1% per year between 1978 and 1997 in Europe.

like banning head scarves and beards in govermental areas, schools. by banning mass animal killing in open areas. by banning curcimcision. by banning  quran schools for children, unofficial ones at least but that will do. and punishing jihad bullshit, even in words. and also punishing who talks against gender equality, hardly punishing families of forced married girls(whoever done that). doing these strictly without political correctnes bullshit will very much do the job. i believe European society will come to that conclusion as a whole in not many more than half century. the transition will be traumatic for some of muslim population but their grandchildren wont give a fuck to their ancestors.

Not-being-shit is not the same as being great. For a food, to not be literally poop doesn't make it great, it makes it *normal* food. For a country, to not be a stereotypically horrible dictatorship doesn't make it great, it makes it *normal*.

Supports the argument I'm not a leftist, because this allows for the expansion of state power.

&gt;I know we're on the same page, but you have to change your wording. Remember that youre preaching to the choir here. Multiculti is not a failure. It is working exactly as intended. 

I see what you mean! The state desires to grow because it is a social organism...therefore, multiculturalism is a tremendous success in their eyes?

&gt;Allow each culture to live its own way.

Absolutely not. You simply cannot have a these two cultures intermingling. Islamic culture is highly authoritarian based, and there is a complete lack of challenging of authority, or even a separation of church and state. Western European culture, on the other hand, is the exact opposite. This is largely because circumstances in both geographic areas influenced the culture (Industrial Revolution, Enlightenment, **Protestant/Catholic wars, a big one in Germany**) and thus influence the genetics of the population. On the other hand, the Middle East has never gone through the sort of instrumental changes required to compare with Western European culture. 

Now, I'm not saying that we should enforce cultural acceptance...simply restriction immigration to filter out all those people who are predisposed to the type of ridiculous behavior we see throughout western europe among some muslims (harassment, violence, rape, etc...indicative of low IQ...so have potential immigrants take an aptitude test or something of that sort). Now of course, most of these muslims vote for the left which grant them benefits, so obviously the left is bringing them in to enrich their tax farm and their voter base.

I also think it's really unfortunate that the Argentinian government is so obsessed with this instead of focusing on more important matters and that they are using this to damage Britain's relations with other South American countries.

29,redditho24602,,cnc24zw,False,"I'm struggling to find a useful cite on the web that covers this, but from what I recall from my college courses on the lost generation, the impetus for Americans emigrating to Paris during the 1920s was less prohibition and more the fact that France underwent a peroid of steep inflation in the aftermath of WWI, meaning that anybody being paid in dollars could live much, much more cheaply in Paris than they could in say, New York. So if you were a writer or artist selling your work in America, you could make enough money from, say freelancing for American newspapers (as Hemmingway did) to live pretty comfortably in France and still have enough time to concentrate on your creative work, which would have been much more difficult back in the States. (Plus have time off for the occassional ski weekend in the Alps or fishing and bullfighting in Spain, etc.) The relative openess/relaxation of European culture about stuff like booze and sex, plus the great art and music scenes in Paris were all additional enticements, for sure, but the main thing was that it was a helluva lot easier on the wallet to be a starving artist in Paris than it was back home. 

Of course, the dollar going so far in Europe at the time also meant you got a lot of rich Americans spending a lot of time abroad during that period as well, buying art, marrying nobels who had their fortunes wrecked during the war, and generally partying it up....you see more of that in Fitzgerald's stuff, since he was a best selling author from a young age and used to run with a fast crowd.

1,silence_hr,,cnc29cm,False,"&gt; Što se tiče poljoprivrednih poticaja, nije problem naše nekonkurentnosti u poljoprivredi taj što je teško proizvoditi i prodati proizvod (iako je i to u pitanju), nego zato što sve ostale zemlje u EU potiču svoju poljoprivredu kako bi bila što konkuretnija na inozemnom tržištu, to se isto radi i sa drugim proizvodnim sektorima, tako da si praktički prisiljen poticati svoju poljoprivredu da držiš korak.

Znam to, naravno.

&gt;On je naprosto predložio da se ne čini ništa po tom pitanju. Niti da se potiče domaća proizvodnja ni da se carinama poskupi uvoz. Da, domaći proizvođači će vjerojatno na žalost propasti, ali cjelokupna država ima benefit zato jer ne mora poticati ni plaćati ništa, a izvana joj dolazi čelik po cijenama nižim od tržišnih, praktički na poklon zemalja koje su to subvencionirale.

Moj stav je sličan, makar ne potpuno. Ja sam protiv poticaja, barem u sadašnjem obliku, jer su totalno krivo osmišljeni.

Ono što treba napraviti je infrastruktura, a to je stvar države, kao recimo navodnjavanje, pa da se poveaćju prinosi, te s druge strane, da se smnji opterećenje na inpute, od gnojiva, pa na dalje. Napraviti faking Excel tablicu kolko košta proizvodnja litre mlijeka ili kile krumpira i vidit koji inputi se mogu smanjit da proizvodnja pojeftini.

Hrpa problema kod nas je kaj se zbog skupog inputa ne isplati proizvoditi, a input je skup jer je država skupa. Porezi, carine, trošarine, doprinosi, sve to opterećuje input poljoprivrednog proizvoda. Naravno da se seljaci bune ako mogu žito prodati po 1,1 kuna, a košta 1,2 da se proizvede (karikiram ovdje). Da ih proizvodnja košta 0,8, a da prodaju po 1,0, niko se ne bi bunio jer bi dobro zaradili.

Sad uzmi povećane prinose (zbog navodnjavanja i zaštite od tuče) i smanjenu cijenu proizvodnje i voila ..... najveći dio problema je riješen.

Ne sumnjam da bi za neke stvari i dalje trebalo poticaje, ali daleko manje nego sada. Isto tako, ovakvim pristupom bi se vjerojatno osiguralo i da se počne sa uzgojem kultura koje su profitabilnije.

You can always get a masters degree in Europe (or Canada, Australia, etc.) and this will allow you to get a student visa for a year or two. Then during that time you can try to find work that will allow you to stay on a work visa, or you could always meet a nice guy/girl to settle down with and your visa problems would end.

But if you are not thinking of working in a field that really interests you and has job prospects, then there isn't really a lot of sense in taking out additional loans (20,40,60,80k+) for a masters degree if you will be in the same boat in one or two years (depending on length of degree). If you can think of a degree you are interested in, and will get you a job then I would say that this is your best bet. If you just go to do a masters abroad because you want a student visa, then when the program ends you will run out of money and have to go home, but you will now have an additional five figure burden of debt to think of.

If you just want to take a few years off to figure things out, then I would suggest teaching ESL in China, Korea, SE Asia or somewhere else. Hopefully after a year you may have more concrete ideas in mind and then you can apply to work somewhere new, or apply for that graduate degree, etc.

Very close to other hubs like London, Paris and Berlin.

^* The loan has incredibly low interest, is paid back based on income (low income means you'll pay back slower) and after 15 years, any remaining debt is erased.

Same goes probably for the US, where most of the food there wouldn't be allowed/ liked in Europe due to excessive usage of chemicals, artificial flavours and colouring, high fructose corn sirup instead of real sugar and other things (like e.g. chlorine chicken), which cut the prices of living.

Also the houses in Europe have to be build very solid due to regulations and not like the wooden houses in the US, making them more expensive, but also more sturdier and sustainable.

*""A European Union investigation claimed that ""open hostilities"" began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against Tskhinvali on 7 August, but noted that ""a violent conflict had already been going on before in South Ossetia"" and Georgian offensive was a ""not proportionate"" response to pre-war South Ossetian attacks. The commission could not confirm the claimed attack on Russian peacekeepers. The commission further stated that Russian citizenship, conferred to the vast part of Abkhaz and Ossetians can not be considered legally binding, and as a result, the defence of Russian citizens living abroad should not have been used as a reason for starting military action by Russia. The report stated that further Russian advance into Georgia proper was unjustified. The report found that all parties involved in the conflict had violated international law.*

*Other reports and researchers (including independent Russian experts) concluded that the conflict started much earlier and Russia was responsible. The relations between Georgia and Russia deteriorated since Vladimir Putin's rise to power in 1999-2000. South Ossetian separatists began attacking the Georgian villages in early August 2008, in order to force Georgia to respond militarily, thus giving a pretext for pre-planned Russian invasion. Russia was preparing to go to war with Georgia for years before 2008 and intended to achieve geopolitical goals. Some researchers paid attention to the military exercise ""Kavkaz 2008"", which concluded in early August. During this exercise a written notice entitled ""Soldier, know your probable enemy"" (the enemy was clarified as Georgia) was circulated among the Russian participants. Russian journalists began arriving in Tskhinvali on 2 August to cover a war that had not yet begun. Some Russian regular troops entered South Ossetia before the Georgian military operation against Tskhinvali began on 7 August.""*",1420209495,0,t1_cnc59i4,t3_2r3gza,False,0,False,t5_2qh13,,0,,2,1425100828,t1_cnc55fl,worldnews

1,ararelitus,,cnc5c6g,False,"By demand recession I just mean a recession driven by a shortfall in demand, characterised by weak consumption, unemployment and low inflation (I know some people argue that this is a misunderstanding of causes). I don't know what exactly you mean by a demand bubble, but asset bubbles tend to drive demand and when they burst that can lead to a demand shortfall. It seems that asset bubbles in turn can be fueled by low interest rates, the typical monetary response to weak demand. I don't know if there is any reason to think that they can be driven by deficit spending, the quintessentially Keyesian response. In any case, both policies should normally be reversed as demand returns to normal levels, before bubbles have a chance to build. This doesn't seem to be the case in the US and Europe these days, with asset bubbles, presumably fueled by low interest rates, rising even while employment and demand are weak. It is as though bubbles are actually necessary now just to keep up enough demand to keep the economy going. This is a big problem (infecting Japan for over 20 years now), and some people blame it on some combination of low interest rates, deficits or quantitative easing. But I haven't read a convincing explanation of how that works, or why we should think that hard money would improve things rather than leading to chronic recession. I'm inclined to go with the secular stagnation explanation, but that doesn't give any easy solutions.

As for long term effects of Keynesian policy on voluntary unemployment, that depends on the (disputed) long term economic effects. Inflation doesn't make much difference if it is expected. Higher taxes could put pressure on retirement, but even though it seems that deficit spending will push up long term tax rates that isn't necessarily the case if it is part of a successful Keynesian intervention. Infrastructure and education spending can lift long term growth, while mitigating a recession can avoid atrophy of work force skills and other economic damage. A stronger economy can easily pay for the debt incurred during the recession.",1420209712,0,t1_cnc5c6g,t3_2qyej9,False,0,False,t5_2qhpn,,0,,1,1425100794,t1_cnb0gbx,economy

All the while our government is dead set at bringing in more asylum seekers and immigrants every year, which isn't helping the issue. I'm sure you know that Sweden has some of the largest immigration numbers per capita in Europe. This leads to them putting the immigrants in ""homes"", where they have to wait months, in some cases years to be able to live in apartments and so on. On average, it takes a total of 7 years for immigrants in Sweden to get a job, due to the state of the job market and so on.

I think it's important to think about *why* people are so stuck on making this comparison. It's not to say that the same events happened, it's not to say that early Americans are worse than 1930s/1940s Germans or natives. It's to point out that history is complicated. 

You can't deny that overall trends indicate that European settlers killed natives and pushed them off their land in numbers that far outweighed whatever natives did the Europeans. You can't deny that Europeans believed that natives were racially inferior. A system of suppression was set up aimed at destroying native culture, particularly when it stood in the way of the settler.

Does this mean that natives were ""noble savages?"" Absolutely not. My aunt was doing research on our town's early history. We found out that natives had attacked a family in the middle of the night, scalped the mother and daughter, and enslaved the men. This wasn't Disney's Pocahontas. As a society, we should openly discuss the fact that natives had their own forms of warfare, slavery, hierarchy, etc. They weren't saints. No one is saying that they were. However, in a short discussion on early settlement, this discussion is likely to get cut - after all, its importance shrinks in comparison to how settlers destroyed native culture especially in a discussion regarding *how settlers destroyed native culture.* 

I don't feel guilty about what happened before I was born. I didn't personally commit acts of genocide. But you know what? I learn from it anyways. I learn from what happened between the early settlers and natives. I learn from what 1930s/1940s Germans did. I learn from what the Romans did, and the Japanese did, and the USSR did, and from what North Korea is doing. I am not an outside observer of history, detaching myself from the pages of truth.

1,satansbuttplug,,cnc87zx,False,"That is *one* possible theory with little evidence supporting it.  We shoudl remember that the escalating crime of the 1960's, 70's and 1980's accompanied a number of external factors.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 saw a major backlash against minorities from traditional white power structures.  Just because it was now illegal to discriminate didn't make it nonexistent.  Since it was now illegal to ban black people from living in whatever neighborhood they could afford, insurance companies began to ""redline"" whole neighborhoods, refusing to write policies in areas above a threshold minority ownership.  This, coupled with acceleration of the postwar sub-urbanization saw massive ""white flight"" from cities.  The inner core of cities became abandoned and generally only the poorest minorities moved there.  Minority populations tend to commit crimes at a higher rate, but that is primarily because they are also the poorest populations.  Rich people don't rob liquor stores.

Couple this with the economic conditions that presented themselves at the end of the 1960's to the mid 1990's.  Most of the world had had its infrastructure destroyed during WWI, and those that did not fell into revolution as European colonies freed themselves and other countries fell to communist takeover.  The major exception was the US, which essentially had free reign over economic production in the 1950's and early 1960's.  But as the rest of the world recovered the US faced competition from a reemerging Europe and new competition from Japan.  At the same time, the expansion of production that had begun in WWII began to slow down by the end of the 1960's.

By the time the early 1970's rolled around, the US was under major pressure from Europe to uncouple the dollar from the British Pound and French Franc.  The US had been printing dollars to pay for the Vietnam Ware among other things but did not acknowledge the inflation implied in this increase in money supply.  Nixon decoupled the dollar from gold and allowed it to float.  The pent-up inflation hit all at once at the worst possible time.  The stock market was in a major slump, Detroit auto production was severely down, the US was getting serious competition from Japanese imports, and the first of several oil embargo's and crises hit.

NYC was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to furlough or layoff thousands of police officers and other civil servants.  Much of the city was abandoned by suburban flight and everyone in the US though that cities were dead (it didn't help that Robert Moses wanted to pave over every neighborhood in NYC with Interstate Highways - most notably and infamously the Cross Bronx Expressway).  The city was broke, those who could afford it began to move out and the city overall became poorer.  It was a recipe for crime in any environment.  We can look at Detroit today to see an analog.

Simultaneously we had the Baby Boomers.  They began to come of age in the late 1960's and because of their numbers began to force political discussion and debate.  They generally disagreed with the ware in Viet Nam and other US political policies and in their youthful exuberance made it felt (think Occupy Wall Street in far greater numbers).  This ignores the fact that young adults tend to be more boisterous, experimental and tend to commit more crimes than those in middle age.  As this large generation matured and had families and careers of their own, their politics and values evolved toward the center (and even to the right).

The early 1980's pretty much saw the worst of it.  Interest rates were in the double digits, inflation was high, unemployment the highest since the Great Depression, homelessness was widespread (because of economic conditions and because of the closing of state mental hospitals), and now we began to see some new, highly addictive cheap drugs come on the scene.  In NYC it was a virtual war zone that made the authoritarian use of police power an attractive option.

The heavy handed use of police authority has been credited with NYC's turnaround, but it is only a small part of the equation.  The economy of the 1990's saw the transition to an information economy, and emergence of the re urbanization of the US.  Times Square returned to a tourist trap, gentrification took place all over the city, and the overall wealth of the city soared.  It has come to the point that poor people, the people who tend to commit crimes, cannot afford to live anywhere near public transportation.  

TL;dr - backlash to the Civil Rights act of 1964, major economic turmoil in the 1970's and 1980's, and the gentrification of cities has more to do with the drop in crime than aborting unwanted black babies.",1420216348,0,t1_cnc87zx,t3_2r2cti,False,0,False,t5_2cneq,,0,,1,1425099448,t1_cnbxva7,politics
4,hughk,,cnc8aqb,False,"&gt;First of all, when you have an amazing amount of raw materials, it actually makes a lot of sense that they make up the lion's share of your exports even if you're technically advanced.

Not unless it can employ most of your people. Raw materials do not last and dependence on them has screwed with Russia's economy before in 1998 and they were a major factor in bringing down the Soviet economy in the eighties It was the failure of the military security establishment that came to power with Putin to further develop the economy. They chose a short-termist crowd pleasing solution and did not seek to make long-term use of the incoming oil and gas funds whilst they were there.

&gt;Um, if that was the case NATO wouldn't have expanded, and anti-Russia insurrectionists wouldn't be supported in countries close to Russia.

You have to remember that it wasn't a case of active recruitment rather than  a passive drift towards a mutual defence club. Although the US still spends significant money on defence, the rest of NATO tries to avoid it. The Baltic states felt vulnerable almost immediately with an attempted putsch in 91 (interestingly with the involvement of one of the same characters from the DPR, [Antyufeyev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Antyufeyev)). The Baltics decided they needed a roof. As for the other countries, they just saw more return through increased links with the west particularly with respect to the rhetoric heard. Probably this was only intended for domestic ears (the usual scoundrels attempting to rabble rouse support), but as ever, others heard and were worried.

Nope. Not in Europe. Every time there is a war nearby, there is a massive surge in refugees and even if they eventually are productive members of society, in the short term there are costs, both financial and political.

9,TheMania,,cnc8m3g,False,"They can keep it going as long as there's willpower. It's just that as a system, it'll entrench involuntary unemployment and low growth. It can only work so long as you're the ""most competitive"" in the region and the problem is, there'll always be those that are less. And it'll only be ""working for you"" so much as you'll be bankrupting your neighbours via draining them of Euros.

It's all just too reminiscent of the gold standard. There, although money was convertible, countries tried to keep their current accounts in check via tariffs/export subsidies/quotas/etc - mercantilism. It fails hard in aggregate of course - your neighbours do the same, not everyone can export more than they import, etc.

Under the Euro, free trade prohibits the above mess. So instead we're told the answer is to be ""the most competitive"". To deregulate, to have the most flexible labour markets, etc. This too fails hard in aggregate - in general, if your solution is to export more than you're importing (and for the ""successful"" nations in the Euro, it most certainly is), it can't work for all. But I personally think they'll keep on flogging that horse for a while yet.

Problem is, because any real solution requires politicians to admit they were wrong, that the system was flawed, their remedies ineffective and the suffering was not really necessary etc.. well. It's going to take a lot of time, no matter how it plays out.

As for what *should* happen - either a govt needs to form at the currency issuing level capable of running deficits and transfers, just like in the US (with sentiment at the moment, somewhere near 0% chance of that), *or* they need to return to individual free floating currencies - something Europe hasn't had for a long time. Problem there is that there is no exit strategy for the Euro. It was never conceived anyone should want to, let alone (imo) that they all should. What do you do with existing Euro denominated debt?

The action is a wz.29 **Polish** rifle.

The stock is likely from a **German** Kar98k. 

The handguard is hard to tell but it sure looks **Dutch**.  

I'd be curious to see more of the handguard actually.  


edit:  All right here is my take:

This stock is a later-style Kar98K and is unlikely to be fitted to the wz.29 during the war.  wz.29 stocks were just cut for Kar98K-style slings when taken into service by the Germans.  Even if this stock was on the gun when Grandpa found it, it's dead now. 

The handguard is off a Dutch Mannlicher.  The hole is cut for a long rifle, the Model 1895.  But notice the length.  This is actually correctly proportioned for a rare Dutch Municipal Police carbine.  There are two variants known, this would fit the ""Pattern A"" variant with bayonet fittings.  Not a lot is known about these guns but if there is one out there in the US that needs a handguard, I think you should keep this at the ready for trade.  It definitely doesn't go on this gun.  I'm not sure where Grandpa found it but I doubt it was with this rifle to start with.  Sadly, the only website I know of that had photos of this gun went to log-in only.  I have a book with the image here in my lap, but that's no good to anyone.  

**If I were you**:

Note serial numbers / markings on all small parts.  See if the bolt is Polish or German.  Same with magazine, trigger guard, barrel band, etc...

Find a Polish wz.29 stock.  This will take some searching but shouldn't be horrible.  Plenty were ground of all markings and sold to the Spanish so SCW wz.29's are common.  Stocks would be easy to get off these for cheap.  

Photograph the handguard to confirm what it is.  Then ask around Gunboards if anyone needs it for a Mannlicher rebuild.  I don't even know of anyone in the US with one of these police carbines though.  /u/oelund might know a museum or two to ask in Europe if they need it.

2,cheaven,,cncab94,False,"A bench press assist tool can most certainly help your form and prevent shoulder injuries, or allow you to work through minor injuries. They also have value for overload training which helps condition your CNS and improve your lockout strength.

Mike Womack started making bench press assist bands in 2003. He did so to alleviate the load on his shoulders from being constantly placed under heavy load on the bench. He trained Mark Bell in 2008/2009 and introduced Mark to the concept of using a bench press assist band. After Mike moved to Texas in 2010 Mark took his idea and peddled it to Rudy Rosales at Overkill Strength Equipment who was Mark's sponsor at the time. Mark wanted Rudy to manufacture his SlingShot idea (that he essentially took from Mike) and also wanted Rudy to put up the money to market the product as well. While Rudy was considering the idea Mark hooked up with a low grade manufacturer in Pakistan which is where the SlingShot is still made to this day. They cost ~$4.00 to make and ship to the U.S. and are a very low quality material that fails under load. Especially after repeated use. I have training partners who have shredded SlingShots and blown them out under heavy iron.

At the end of the day the SlingShot is not a great product for serious lifters who move big iron. There are much better products on the market such as Mike Womack's BenchDaddy. And, contrary to Mark's public rants he does not have a patent on bench press assist bands. He has a utility patent on angled sleeves for a bench press assist band and he has a trademark on the SlingShot name/brand. There was a guy in NY who patented the idea of a bench press assist band back in the 70s which has expired. You can't re-patent an expired patent. There is also prior art on the part of Mike Womack and some European lifters who have videos on YouTube using bench press assist bands long before Mark ever announced the SlingShot just before the Arnold in 2010.

Brian Dobson (the founder of Metroflex and the guy who discovered Ronnie Coleman) is a personal friend of mine. His shoulders are beat up to the point that he wasn't able to do heavy bench or dips until I gave him a BenchDaddy. He feels like a new man being able to bench full range and crank out dips with chains over his shoulders again. His chronic shoulder problems no longer bother him and he still trains with a bunch of IFBB pros on a daily basis even though he's 58.

For the sake of disclosure Mike Womack is also a close personal friend of mine and training partner. With that being said even if you think I'm blowing smoke up your ass on the quality of the BenchDaddy versus the SlingShot go buy another product like the Titan RAM or Metal Catapult. They're both better quality than the SlingShot and will serve you better in the long run.

I covered this in my initial comment: the potential for abuse does not imply the presence of abuse. If the fact that men occupy positions of power is to be an iaauw it has to be so on the basis of unjust treatment, not simply as an implied but unsupported consequence of it being so. That would be begging the question.

&gt; These strict gender roles developed for whatever reasons, perhaps they were useful in our younger iterations, and it is because of these roles that power was passed to men

In that case I refer back to what I pointed out: it is a complete misnomer, as the simple fact that men hold political power does not inherently cause injustice. Patriarchy simply means a system wherein men hold political power, i.e. a system where heredity runs strictly on male lineage. Such a system is not inherently unjust any more than a dictatorship is.

&gt;Unless you want to argue this is biological (which I would argue it is not), then this imbalance can be attributed to a patriarchal culture that has historically valued men over women.

It's plain to see that is *is* biologically rooted, simply because everything is. After all, a culture doesn't emerge in a vacuum, and cultures separated by **vast** distances and timescales overwhelmingly came up with the same, then truly patriarchal system from China to Europe to America. You can say that it's cultural, but that just shifts the focus: whence does cultural bias come from, if not biology?

Not to mention the fact that social non-human animals have the same sort of divisions, right down to insects. If sex can affect your body in an untold number of ways why can't it affect your brain and *ipso facto* your behaviour?

Now this, of course, is entirely beside the point. We are predisposed to a large variety of things because of biology, but that doesn't mean we're slaves to it, it would however be foolish to disregard it entirely, as even minute biological differences can have seemingly large effects when extrapolated to 7 billion individuals. We can't simply discard the possibility that males and females may very well be unequal in terms of their, say, political ambitions, simply because it's inconvenient for it to be so.

&gt;Elitism and racism are also constructs of the patriarchy.

Oh come off it. Race relations and gender relations are **completely** unrelated. You might as well chalk up the Marxist political (class) struggle to this nebulous ""patriarchy"" but more and more it seems you are expanding the term to mean ""all bad things ever"". Incidentally, I hope this makes it pretty plain why people treat patriarchy theory as the man-hating it truly is: you essentially just wrote up every ill in the world to a simple, innocent system of heredity.

&gt;Look into Third Wave feminism and Intersectionality to see how feminism has worked on including other minorities into the fold.

Those two are both excellent examples of a fading ideology rapidly running out of things to be outraged about scrambling to co-opt the struggles of other, unrelated groups in a desperate bid to stay relevant. Middle class white women had to choose between further feeding their white man's burden or acknowledging their privilege, and as they say, people very much want to feel hard done by. So ""allies"" they became, because lord knows you can't let a good brand just die once it's served its purpose.

&gt;Um, what?

Pardon, in all the re-writing I garbled that sentence. It was supposed to read:

&gt;Of course the elephant in the room is that women inherently seem to relate better to men than **men** relate to women.

The rest came out as intended.

&gt;Why would this make any sense if not for a patriarchy? If women are able to relate to a man's story, why couldn't a man relate to a woman's story?

It would be even worse, if a company's fortune in Estonia suddenly started to worth half of its original price ... then the owner company would worth less, perhaps not being able to pay its expenses to a third company which wouldn't be able to pay his raw materials and it would go on and on and on till everyone has lost a bunch of money.

So in order to make business safer and easier in Europe, the EC has decided to create a common currency, the EURO. Everything is dandy, right, NO.

Unfortunately, free floating currencies balances under or overperforming economies by either increasing or decreasing. The Estonian currency lost its value when the risk of estonia defaulting was high or it has also depreciated when Estonia's wages were high.

With the Euro, there is no such thing as self balancing flee-floating currencies for these economies, so in order to stop widely different economies being artifically hamstrung together with a currency, the EC - the governing body of Europe, basically artificially enforces that the economies don't put pressure on the Euro by staying relatively close to each other.

We can't just measure a country's hypothetical currency because we don't have one left. So what the EC does is that it just goes back a step and defines a bunch of criteria for the measureable economic indicators which would determine the value of the currency. 

these are: Inflation(consumer price index)
Budget deficit
total debt

We are a casual guild, aimed at enjoying everything the game has to offer from both a PvE and PvP perspective.

**Our Culture**

Reddithium is a guild aimed at providing a platform for any gamer to enjoy the Elder Scrolls Online without the need to commit to a hardcore regime. We are a social PvX guild, who hold regular PvP and PvE events for our members to enjoy.

We have no entrance criteria, so regardless of level or class you can join the guild and participate.
When we hold events our focus is involving everyone. We don't force participants to run with certain builds - our primary aim is enjoyment of the game! Every member should ask themselves how to best support the group!

**PvE**

Many of our members focus heavily on the PvE and activities within the guild reflect this. We have a core membership who regularly run dungeons together, as well as guild run events completing dolmens and world bosses on a regular basis.

Our ultimate aim is to develop a strong membership base so that we are able to mount regular end-game PvE runs, including Trials. For this, we need you!

But fear not, our guild will always be open to all members whatever their level, and events will be held regularly for members of all levels. Guild activities are driven by our members, and so anyone can look to arrange an event if they would like to form a group.

Here are some examples from our latest PvE achievments:

- [1st Santum Boss down - R.I.P Manticora](http://i.imgur.com/2DnwK0I.jpg)
- [2nd Santum Boss down](http://i.imgur.com/b8SfQso.png)
- [Hel Ra Hardmode](http://i.imgur.com/Ne06UbL.jpg)
- [Dragonstar Arena Veteran, first Reddithium Group](http://i.imgur.com/iOVbsbs.jpg) ~ Pinky, Ra, Azarath and Dymence

**PvP**

*Current Campaign: Wherever the action is!*

PvP is one of the main focuses for Reddithium and we try to have regular events to form PvP groups for our members to participate in. In addition to this, all of our members are free to form groups themselves in the name of Reddithium, and many do just that. There are always guild members ready to fight for the Dominion!

As the guild develops and our membership increases, we aim to be more active in PvP when Imperial City is released without the need to apply undue pressure on our members. For that we need you!

**What you can expect from us:**

- A friendly environment, accepting of all members, whatever their disposition either IRL or on ESO.
- Regular PvP events held by our Officers, or from within the guild community itself.
- Regular PvE and PvP events held by guild Officers, or from within the guild community itself.
- An active Teamspeak server, for friendly chat while gaming or to coordinate and organise PvP and PvE events.
- Active guild chat, with fellow guild members always willing to help.

**Guild Spotlight**

You can read a little more about the guild and its history [here](http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/news/post/2014/09/17/guild-spotlight--reddithium)

**How to join**

If you would like to join Reddithium, simply send me a message on here, or message @Meey or @Ra_Himself in game, with a brief explanation of why you want to join. We will then send you an invite. Or even better post on our [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ESOGuildEU/)

*Note that it is not a caveat of joining to be a member of reddit, but we would encourage guild members to join so as to participate in our subreddit.*

1,Ry333,,cncdpw4,False,"&gt; Getting laid is a big deal to a lot of men. Some wave it around as a status symbol.

I think you hit the nail in the head with this.

Whenever I hear that shit of guys being desperate for sex... I no longer believe that. They're not really craving sex; they crave female validation. For them, the fact that they have sex is their way to say to the rest of the women ""hey, look! I can have sex, therefore I'm a worthy man!"" 

A lot of men nowadays fail to realize that their worth as men is not defined by the number of women that they fuck. If all they wanted is sex they would pay prostitutes. Of course, they say that paying for it is not manly and that it's like cheating. Others would say that they don't want to engage in a obscure and immoral habit (despite the well-known fact that over here the vast majority of sex workers are doing it on their own volition and in safe conditions). I recently read Chester Brown's comic ""Paying for it"". It's a nice insight about how the absurd and groundless expectations between men and women fuck up what in other circumstances would have been fullfilling relationships, sexual or not.

&gt; On the other hand, there are women that were fed the ""every girl's a princess,"" message and look for a man to treat them like they're special. A huge concern for them is to be attractive, to matter, and to have attention.

This is very frequent over here. A lot of women believe that they're entitled to anything they want and demand everything from men. The problem is, men are so desperate for female approval that they indulge! They never stop to think ""what's in for me?""

 &gt; Tv shows and stuff make it seem like there's some special way for women to talk to men and for men to talk to women, and each side makes up total bullshit when they're just people. Men and women can generally communicate well on a casual level.

Yeah, a whole generation has been brainwashed into believeing that women don't want sex and that men don't have emotional needs. Worse yet, the belief that we're radically different when deep down we just want the same things. 

I don't like to express the following thoughts very often because I admit that they sound a little paranoid, but after seeing how much profit is obtained from people's suffering (drugs, therapists, self-help books, lawyers, judges, etc.) and how polarized men and women issues are nowadays, can't help to think that media and pop culture have a much deeper and disturbing agenda that it seems to have at first...

In short, men and women getting along well and having fullfilling relationships with or without sex is not profitable.

&gt; But there are so many demographics and stuff mixed where I live that it's pretty normal to talk to someone different from you.
&gt;There's so much variation it's kind of hard to tell what the general trend is.

Interesting. Do those cultures mix up well over there? That may explain why gender wars don't happen, I think.

There are different ethnics living on here too (Moroccan people, latin americans, asians, eastern europeans...)

At this point, I really shouldn't have to list the various trailers and previews and images and etc. of pre-release media for Destiny to show you why people might have had different expectations of the game. It's a point that's been hammered down enough. 

So, getting directly into the game itself, I'll be the first person to tell you that quite honestly, I enjoy destiny's combat quite a bit. The reason **ANY** of these arguments even happen in the first place is because destiny has such a strong foundation in its most important aspect (shooting, in a shooter) and so many people are willing to overlook the flaws to keep playing. 

However, let's not kid ourselves here, the story is....well, *there's no time to tell you why there's no time to tell you about that.* It's awful. Like, these people made HALO, and while Halo may not be a greatest story gaming ever told, it's 500x whatever the hell we paid for.

The v60 brew was light, extremely clean, and laser focused, allowing great visibility into the coffee's every flavor nuance. I think this is one reason that the v60 is so popular among coffee enthusiasts. On the flip side, the Melitta brew took quite a bit longer to finish, and the brew was heavy, rich, very sweet, and maybe even a little bit over extracted. If I may generalize extravagantly, the v60 produced a very ""American"" coffee, versus the Melitta's ""European"" profile.

That's were social programs come in.

What sounds more ideal. Starting a business in a country with a strong social floor that will catch you if you fail, or starting one with no social floor that will let you fall through the cracks?

That's why Sweden has one of the highest small businesses per capita in the world.

&gt;Also, what about people that receive the redistribution, but do not start any new enterprises, and only spend their good fortune on the same number of goods, or fewer? 

The fact that they're spending money means they're creating capital for people that WOULD start businesses

It would only have to be done once because a socialist society would not suffer from vast wealth disparity because wealth would not be concentrated to a capitalist class.

1,WillyPete,,cncf1im,False,"I'm talking about the very front of the hood is generally lower to comply with EU regs.  
The hood leading edge has dropped over time and now seems to merge with the bumper rather than appear as a distinct design element in many vehicles.  
The back of the hood, near the window, has seen a higher trend so the pedestrian doesn't ""flip"" so much.  
http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2007/12/the-truth-about-europes-pedestrian-safety-legislation/
&gt;To comply with the EU requirements, automakers are already adapting the design of their cars’ fronts— ground zero for pedestrian fatalities. Obviously, a smooth, soft front end is the way forward. That's why the styling of many European cars (e.g. Jaguar’s new XK) has already been changed, with higher, more easily deformable hoods. Much can be achieved by attention to details, within a comprehensive testing procedure.  
...  
European automakers are already taking the next step: hoods with active safety devices that “pop up” the hood to reduce the severity of an impact with a pedestrian's head. Euro-NCAP crash tests have awarded the new Citroen C6 and Jaguar XK four out of five stars for pedestrian protection. Both models were the first to be equipped with “active hoods.” Sweden's Autoliv AB is developing hood airbags to make even inherently dangerous SUVs more pedestrian-friendly.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/13/pedestrian-safety-is-key-for-mercedes/  
&gt;Mercedes has jumped the gun and introduced the first of its pedestrian safety innovations in the S-Class. That flagship sedan now has a hood with an underside that deforms to absorb impact energy if the car hits a pedestrian.  
It enlarged the deformation space beneath the hood that’s 0.87 inches higher than the preceding model. At the same time, engineers lowered the engine, shock absorber towers and other under hood equipment by up to 0.51 inches.  
Mercedes engineers give the GLK similar injury-mitigating capability. For instance, the GLK has a fairly high hood that creates a crumple zone designed to cushion a pedestrian’s head and upper body if struck by the vehicle.  
The 2-inch crumple zone is engineered into the hood to absorb energy that would otherwise be transmitted to pedestrians. The high hood position helps prevent reservoirs, control units and the wiper assembly from striking the a pedestrian.

http://www.cardesignonline.com/safety/pedestrian-safety.php  
&gt;There is some difference of opinion on bonnet leading-edge height.  
Some sources state that anything above 650mm in height is undesirable where other point out that “making the hood edge height higher is effective in lowering the vehicle-head collision speed”. It is noted though, that “if the edge of the hood is too high, it might be dangerous for children because their heads might be directly hit by the front of the car”.  
They chose 800mm as a suitable height as it is lower than the head of a 3 year old child.  
There is no defining conclusion on the subject of leading edge height; it makes more sense to look at reducing hard points, improving controlled plastic deformation to absorb energy and stiffening lower bumper structure to minimise leg injury.",1420228757,0,t1_cncf1im,t3_2r15hz,False,0,False,t5_2sokd,,0,,1,1425096197,t1_cnbot2a,explainlikeimfive

The primary reason that Europeans were able to conquer the African continent is a result of the sheer number of different cultures within Africa. Africa had a vast myriad of highly complex Kingdoms such as Ethiopia.  During the time there was no concept of an African identity. People from different tribes saw other tribes as enemies, not fellow Africans. Tribes and Kingdoms often engaged in large scale warfare. This intercontinental conflict enabled Europeans to pit warring tribes and Kingdoms against each other; a strategy used for slaves. Weaker Kingdoms were easier for Europeans to conquer and extract wealth from. Once Europeans were able to treat malaria and yellow fever they began to access the interior of Africa in the 1800's. Even after Europeans began colonizing, African Kingdom's with stable leadership such as Ethiopia began acquiring European weapons for defense.

In addition northern parts of Africa were large scale centers of trade, science, literature, and art. Northern Africa was technologically more advanced than much of Europe until the enlightenment. Muslim traders  were a strong influence; bringing philosophy, and mathematics among others. Prior to European encroachment into Africa, African Kings were seen as equals by many European Kings.

edit: also Africa didn't undergo mass agriculture due to differences in terrain. African soil has a lot of clay, limiting the effectiveness of a plow, in addition to poor rainfall. In contrast Europe has great soil, and ample rain.

By the way, just like a native speaker can learn a foreign language (fair enough, although relative to people in the EU for example, not many do), a non-native speaker can learn cultural background (especially pop culture thanks to TV shows and movies). Still, a native speaker isn't a better teacher than non-native speaker and vice versa. It all depends on experience, training, education and personal traits of an individual, not on the country where he/she was born. 

Edit: Also, take ELF for example. The cultural knowledge is meaningless; people who are learning ELF want to communicate, not subsume the culture of the language into their personality. I'd argue that many people speaking and learning English have no interest in learning for example Australian culture. They want to speak the language to communicate.

The quest itself is actually the equivalent for horde and ally. 

The rest has plenty of horde equivalents of downsides. And yes, I have played all of it on alliance. I played horde through wrath and Cata, with a period of alliance in wrath, then alliance AND horde in mop. It feels a lot better from alliance side. 

For Togc, if you're talking about the faction Pvp fight, Varian says the same thing when you're horde. It's just reversed. 


You never got second hand content any more than the horde did. Alliance players just convinced themselves they did. And even then, the complaints were mostly lore related, which aren't nearly as problematic as gameplay issues. 

As for Racials, humans have been, hands down, the best Pvp Racials since WRATH. In Cata, everyone was ally, wrath was a mix, Mop us was horde because people preferred the horde and the Racials at that point were comparable, but ue was ally. EU has been like 90% Pvp ally for like 3 expacs now. Us just went horde because they liked UD more (most of them started horde back in the day) and the fear break was good last expac. But in blizzcon, it was alliance a majority f the time. Now in WoD ally Pvp Racials are even further ahead than horde ones, and it's absolute bullshit. 

And for why alliance complainers usually got downvoted: it's because most people did not agree that the alliance were shafted (and I, someone who played both, do not think they were shafted either.) The complaints weren't even tangible reasons. This garrison thing though, and Racials, are concrete examples.

He got into it by doing a bit of boat safety training here and then just went for it by moving overseas and finding a boat. He started in Nice where he got a job on a reasonable sized boat for a while and eventually moved to a much larger one (the guy who owns Kingfisher beer I think).

It was all good and well, he saved a lot of money and saw a lot of Europe but for him the partying was not what you might expect. It was long periods of working with very little breaks and when you did end up on a break on shore it wasn't always at the best places. At one point the boat went on for some routine maintenance that took longer than expected so they were given residence in Bruges for a couple of months which was a bit shit but by that time I think he was ready to settle down a start a family anyway.

Some other people speak more highly of it, but I think a general rule might be to plan to do it for a year and see how you go as it's not always for everyone and does help to be on a 'good' boat with staff you get on well with.

Golden rule though: don't screw the crew. I don't know anyone with a good outcome from that.

2,gkunkle,,cncgxpg,False,"I'll copy paste a comment I left for somebody who asked a similar question a few months back:

There exist a number of beers that truly define their style and those are where I always recommend people start. These are simply perfect beers:

Weihenstephan Hefeweizen - the grand-daddy of all wheat beers. Perfectly balanced and displaying a plethora of great yeast driven flavors.

Pilsner Urquell - this was the first and still the greatest of the European lagers. It is incredibly simple and it is beautiful in its simplicity. I believe the recipe uses only Saaz hops and pilsner malt. Urquell exhibits the characteristics of The noble Saaz hop well but what it truly does best is demonstrate the difference that what're chemistry can make in a beer. The water natural to Pilsen is very soft with minerals, this creates unique mouthfeel and causes the hops to come through in a specific way. To learn more about water chemistry and hops look up brewing in Burton-on-Trent.

Saison DuPont - DuPont is a fine example of the saison style but also the wonders of yeast driven beers and the unique flavors they can create. The recipe for DuPont is rather simple but the yeast creates an incredible depth of character. You'll find notes of pepper, lemon and delicious funky weirdness.  If beer like this intrigues you I'd implore you to investigate brettanomyces and sour beers.

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale - the classic American pale ale. Look for great caramel malts in the body that set a great stage for bitter, spicy citric American west-coast hops.

In addition I would follow the advice of /u/Plutarch_Rine who had some pretty solid beginning beer suggestions.",1420232102,0,t1_cncgxpg,t3_2r47nz,False,0,False,t5_2qhg1,tulip1,0,,2,1425095314,t3_2r47nz,beer

2,pyridine,,cnch92y,False,"I'm giving prices for the Copenhagen area as a whole - strangely it's not really more expensive in the inner city vs. many of the suburbs (just 10X more difficult to actually find any housing period), although I think you can find some burbs to the west/southwest of the city for perhaps more like $1k/mo.  Depends what you're willing to live with.  I live on the north side which is the most expensive.  You can get a basic idea about rental prices by searching in different regions here (note that a 1-bedroom = ""2 værelses"", 2-bedroom = ""3 værelses""):

http://www.boligportal.dk/

You can get around locally just fine without a car.  You probably didn't need a car to visit those castles for instance (in Helsingør and Hillerød?).  However as is probably always the case with public transport, you sorta have to arrange your life around transit lines.  It'd be quite fine downtown and in the innermost burbs, but if you have to transfer 3 buses to get somewhere, it's still going to take 2 hours to go 10 km.  My workplace is 30 km north of the city and the only way you can get there is a handful of bus lines, so I had to find an apartment off one of the lines.  As an example of traveling further afield, I've been wanting to go to Møns Klint for a couple years now - it's only 140 km away but would take over 3 hours by transit, and rental cars here all have 100 km maximum with insane per km charges beyond that.  So screw that - it's easier and cheaper for me to take a flight elsewhere in Europe than spend a weekend in Århus or to go to Spain or Italy instead of visiting the patheticness of a Danish sea cliff.

Well, just letting you know that Denmark is the unhealthiest country in Scandinavia.  You'll see people running and biking everywhere, but I'd say it's still less healthy than the US West Coast or Colorado.  They consume more meat here than anywhere else on earth (mostly pork products, the export of which is the main reason Denmark joined the EU - pork products are abundant and cheap compared to all other meats), alcohol is cheaper here than the other countries, and cigarettes are cheaper than in the US.  Tons of chain smokers here, it's hard to get away from the smoke.  It's also got the worst healthcare system in Scandinavia, and I think they have the highest rate of cancer on earth and one of the highest rates of diabetes (some of this probably genetic), also a pretty mediocre life expectancy compared to other European countries.  And Danish is the most unpronouncable Scandinavian language.  So Sweden's looking pretty good to me!

I don't think Israel ""uses"" the Holocaust in order to play politics, domestically or on the international scale.

Until the Holocaust, pogroms and expulsion for Jews were the norm across the world. Living in ghettos was just part of an Ashkenazi (European) Jew's life. 

Do I think the UN would have voted for Israel without the Holocaust? No. But do I think that matters anymore? Definitely not.

9,aleglad,,cnchxx6,False,"&gt;  I'm more worried about the lack of racial and gender diversity among Asatruar. 

I'm not. We need to be honest about something here, and it is an uncomfortable thing for most liberally-minded Americans to handle (and one of the reasons a lot of Folkish Heathens end up coming off as pricks when they talk about it) is that we are not ""a religion for everyone."" Most of us are not inclined to be racially exclusive but there is a reality that needs to be understood, Scandinavian and Germanic religion and culture is not particularly appealing to people of non-European heritage. We will always be far more interesting to people of Germanic origin than we will be to African, Amer-Indian, Asian, and other ethnic and racial groups. Being a fundamentally ethnic religious group we are going to attract a majority of people that come from that ethnic background. This isn't to say that we should turn away someone who is Chinese, that's stupid, but there aren't exactly a lot of Chinese people knocking on the doors to come in. Universalism, the idea that we are something for everyone, is as destructive to who we are as racism is. 

As for women, I can tell you that the state of things now is a great deal better than it was when I started. It as a serious sausage fest back then. We have developed a lot since then and a lot of the foolish ""I'm a big scary Viking"" crap has really started to drop away. This has helped the appeal for women. We are seeing a revival of women's roles in Heathen circles. What must be understood, however, is that we are attractive to certain types of women. You're simply not going to find the Wymmynists hanging out with us. We appeal to folks, male and female, that have a more traditional sense of gender roles. We aren't limited to the 1950's Leave It To Beaver ideal of conservative America but we are much more traditional in this regard. With that said, ""traditional"" in this case is pretty damn liberated when you look at the social freedom enjoyed by women in Germanic society. We've only gotten better about that. Still, women who want to be wives and mothers are more likely to be found in our ranks than Single Female Lawyer.",1420233892,0,t1_cnchxx6,t3_2r4nnx,False,0,False,t5_2r5lh,,0,The Cranky One,9,1425094844,t1_cnch1c7,asatru

I've been to quite a few countries, but those were when I was a kid/teenager and was on my family's budget. If you're travelling alone, it's better to hit the cheaper countries or to find someplace where you can get temporary work.

I know of lots of people who had great times in Australia and Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand), and earned money while they were at it. As for cheap destinations (where you might not earn money), South America, most of Asia, and some of Europe (especially the Eastern parts) are affordable, especially if you're backpacking.

South Africa (my home!) is also great for solo travellers, and is really affordable. There's great stuff to do/see here, and the backpacking scene is really big.

I recommend trying to find cheap flights.

31,riggorous,,cnci583,False,"I don't think you understand the immigration process very well.

There are 3 ways to become a permanent resident of the USA: 

1. Work: be hired by a company in the US, which has to prove that you have skills that they can't find on the domestic labor market, or invest $1 million dollars or more into a business in the States.

2. Family: have immediate family (children, parents, spouse, or siblings) who are citizens or permanent residents and who are willing to sponsor you.

3. Extenuating circumstances: refugees and O visas (which is a work visa for ""exceptional"" people like athletes, musicians, writers - Iggy Azalea, for example, is in the US on an O visa).

4. (sneaky tee hee) win the visa lottery, where you have about a 0.1% chance of winning and which is being phased out soon. This is actually the main ""control"" for unskilled migrants - you give people a minuscule, unrealistic chance to become lawful immigrants and thus prevent them from running the border.

As you can see, none of these options have anything to do with ""patience, strength, and will of heart"". How somebody ""deserves"" to immigrate to the United States is entirely based on the needs of the United States: either you have the skills or the money the US needs, or, yeah alright, you can reunite with your family. European countries, for instance, which have an even bigger immigrant problem because they don't only border Mexico, have much more lax migration laws: you deserve, for one, to claim citizenship to an EU country if your direct ancestor for up to 2 generations back was from that country. And people on student visas are able to turn those visas into residency cards, which international students in the US can't do.
