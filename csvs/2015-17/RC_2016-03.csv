I worked drugs in Central Asia for a few years after doing the submarines thing. Submarines were cool because we played the cat and mouse game with China when they would want to start shit with people in the Pacific. Not too satisfying in the end though.

I ended up in Afghanistan working heroin for a while. The UNODC Rainbow Strategy was the name of the game out there because ISAF and the coalition DILLIGAFed the whole thing about drugs funding the insurgency. Most of the work was alternative livelihoods for the locals to sway them from growing poppies for opium/heroin wholesaling to Europe and Russia. Got some saffron outfits running with all woman operations which was cool. Hooked up some grape/raisin farmers with importers in Europe. Managed to get some chicken/egg farms installed (cool until they ate all the chickens and sold all the equipment).

Went back as a contractor after that for a few years to keep up the heroin thing in a broader scope across Central Asia. Small wins here and there, but ultimately a drop in the ocean compared to the flow of heroin/opium coming out of there. I won't run out of fingers counting the number of people (seriously) working narcotics in Afghanistan. Really tears apart the region.

Premium Tempered Clay Refiner is profitable-*ish* assuming that you don't need to pay market price for White Cedar Sap (you can craft it yourself but it takes 20 hours per unit as opposed to only 12 for the refiner itself, so you're gonna have to go slow or make up for the deficit somewhere) but to craft it you need to first cough up 20-30g for a secret technique skillbook (or however much it is these days).

There are other guilds which will make you more money much easier. [You do the math](http://www.bnscraftcalculator.com/).

e: ok fine I'll spoil it for you: join the Radiant Ring and the Stonecutters. Polished Granite is trivial to craft and bizarrely profitable on its own (it costs ~50 copper total to craft a stack of 5 that sells for 10-12 silver; that's a profit margin of over 2000%!), but instead of selling it you can keep it, buy pentagonal gem fragments and some other mats on the market and craft Sparkling Pentagonal Diamond Pouches for an easy ~1.5g profit every 12 hours. No secret techniques needed, all you need is level 2 in the Radiant Ring and mats that cost about 4g total. The Hexagonal pouches are not profitable at the moment, though, and you can't really craft anything else of value with the Radiant Ring.",t5_2skd6,

EDIT:  Because it's interesting, I'll explain the details.  The point of divergence is during the Norse exploration of Vinland.  A couple Greenland hunters kill a mother black bear and bring home her cub, which gets traded to someone in Iceland.  It's historically documented in real life that tame polar and brown bears were kept in Europe (and Iceland) at the time as occasional pets for the wealthy, so this isn't a totally implausible idea.   Black bear goes to Iceland, and more are imported.  It becomes a cottage industry for Greenlanders to import them, along with the historical importation of timber, from Vinland, as they are fashionable signs of wealth (but handily less expensive to keep than a polar or brown bear, because they eat less meat in proportion, and are smaller, and less dangerous).  For a while they are merely captured as cubs and imported, as has been done with bears since at least Roman times.  But as the weather worsens and the Greenland colony collapses, this supply dries up.  So people start breeding them for the first time.  About this time, people start experimenting with using them to pull plows and carts or sledges.  They are strong, don't have the best stamina, but on Iceland they are actually not the worst domestic work animals...the Icelandic diet is relatively high in fish and whale or seal, so there's more offal around for them to eat. And they can hibernate during the winter, avoiding the need to feed them as much when a horse might still require hay.  Anyway, they are just barely useful enough, and fashionable enough, to hang on as domesticates.  During this time they get smaller and more manageable due to human selection.  Eventually someone gets the idea to ride a bear (tradition states that his bear cart was broken, so he just hopped on the back).  Bear competitions (riding, cart pulling, plowing, etc) are a thing at fairs and get-togethers.


Eventually Denmark acquires Iceland.  And some King (forget which one) comes to the throne as a youngster.  Iceland donates a domestic bear as a coronation gift, along with an Icelandic keeper.  The king is really impressed and immediately sticks on the idea of a bear cavalry.  He's impetuous, young, and the king, so the courtiers let him have his way just to keep him happy.  Iceland gets the request and has no idea what to do because bear cavalry isn't a thing.  But they scrape together 100 bears and riders who go to Denmark, get outfitted with some armor and trained by an army officer.  Nobody really knows what to do with them militarily speaking but they _do_ look very impressive on parade and other ceremonial visits.  The generals are hesitant to deploy them because they don't want to get the king's pet project killed, but perhaps because of the large amounts of training and high quality equipment (yeah and maybe the bears too), when they are finally deployed they do pretty well.  And become a small-scale Danish Military thing for a couple hundred years until advancements in guns make them obsolete.  But by that time, the _idea_ of bear cavalry is very famous and culturally entrenched, it's just not really ever used elsewhere.  However, the Icelanders do keep their bears around as domestic animals, and later on Teddy Roosevelt is popularly thought to have charged up San Juan hill on a bear, but that's actually a myth propagated by a movie from the 40's.",t5_2rd6n,

Asians are put on the same level as Black people sexually in the West, hence the tagline ""No Blacks, no Asians."" White guys do not care about how pale we are and gaysians do not have any more dating privileges than gay blacks. You don't want to accept it, but it's true. By the way, I made another thread about this and I got a lot of personal messages from gaysians confirming that the bottom of the gay totem pole is any non-white guy. 

Where's the personal attack? I brought up the fact that you are depressed and shouldn't be giving dating advice to anyone, which is the truth. Would you be taking dating advice from someone who admits that they have ""insane amounts of depression""? You wouldn't.

The truth is that you have European bone structure/facial features, people will find you more attractive, regardless of your skin tone. It applies in both the Western and Eastern worlds. In the Western world, look how men like Nathan Owens (half black/half white with brown skin and white facial features) are considered more attractive by gay men of all ethnicities than gay Asian guys, who are on average much lighter skinned. On the flip end, being very pale is simply not enough for South Korean and other Asian celebrities. They have to get double eyelid surgery, nose jobs, change their facial bones to get an oval facial shape and various other surgeries to ""westernize"" their features, and even after that they still look Asian, so they dye their hair and wear colored contact lenses. If that's not insecurity, then I don't know what is. Asians and Blacks, on average, have the least European looking facial features, hence the discrimination. 

It is fine to say that black men face discrimination in the dating world, but to act like Asian men have it so much better was a lie and something you said to feel about yourself. It's ""No Blacks, no Asians"" for a reason. And I don't believe that you have traveled all over the world btw. ",t5_2tg5w,

I think that most reasonably developed, stable countries follow a similar pattern during profound economic or governmental crises. They have docile populations who have a strong interest in preserving their way of life and who are hoping for things to get back to normal soon. The society doesn't suddenly unravel into some sort of a Mad Max fantasy; you probably won't be needing 50,000 rounds of ammo, and chances are, even if the currency becomes worthless, hospitals will stay open and nobody will be dying of hunger or thirst. Widespread corruption and petty crime will be more of an issue than murderous mobs.

The best result would be a long-term build-up of U.S.-based manufacturing plants producing almost exclusively for the domestic market, as on the world stage they will be out-competed by similar goods manufactured in China, where as you rightly point out things like low environmental standards and beyond bad treatment of workers ensure that product prices are significantly lower.",t5_2cneq,

If Russia followed the footsteps of China today and linked itself more with Europe and the US, making any economic move against them significantly more self-harming, they would have more options right now. However, this is a decades-long plan and NATO will continue to provoke Russia by expanding. Putin obviously could not tolerate losing the port in Ukraine, everyone knows this. That's why the US funded people to topple the pro-Russian government in Kiev.

bonus points for the otters.

**first thing first: forget about junglers. although it's technically a possibility, it's a bad habit to take.**

now that i got my hate for junglers out of the way, back to your questions.

so in order: there is no ""return"" button, you gotta buy an item called a **teleportation scroll** that lets you either go back to base or tp to any outer buildings. there is also boots called boots of travels that fills the same purpose, but they're expensive and don't give dmg, so as a noob you should forget about it for the time being:

DOTA rule number one, always carry a teleport scroll, [else this happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dSekeO5zvU)

now, some early game **HEROES** (doter got a superiority complex over loler, so if you give them some reason to believe you're one you're gonna get trashed) can keep some impact late game, but dota is usually about power spike:

your hero peak on the early game, mid game, late game, push composition, etc etc. so if you really have an early game hero, the game SHOULD FINISH EARLY. else you probably failed somewhere and the game is slipping from your grasp:

dota rule number 2: if you got an advantage, push it. just sitting back and farm is the best way to give you opponent a chance to turn it around, since they're not officially allowed to concede.

toxic heroes: currently techies, invoker, OD, earth spirit should fit the bill, but none of those are even remotely close to what i'd advise a new player to play, so stay the hell away from those.

same with chen, meepo, ember/storm spirit... tu hard 4u kiddo. (jk you're older than i am)

as for youtube series, [i advise you to go check in here](https://www.youtube.com/user/PurgeGamers)

also, currently, the shanghai major are going on, so consider watching the VOD if you wanna have an idea about how the game is played professionally. 

i wont ask you to watch live, unless you've got trouble sleeping at 2 am: http://www.twitch.tv/dotamajor

as for playing with you, i'm on EU, so although i could probably handle beginners with 200 pings, it's neither enjoyable for me or them. so gl hf

People don't seem to feel the same way about theism (and organized religion as a whole), and that's what intrigues me. 

It's actually a very interesting question. But the thing is, the story of Santa Claus is not qualitatively different in nature from the story of Jesus. If anything, the story of Santa Claus is *less* absurd, and makes much *fewer* extraordinary claims.

Here's the real difference: No one has ever gone to war for Santa. No one has ever kicked their child out of the house for questioning whether reindeer can fly. No one has ever kidnapped thousands of aboriginal children and forced them to go to Santa School. No one has ever thrown acid in their own daughter's face for refusing to wear a pointy elf hat. 

A few parents (especially those in Eastern Europe) actually *have* told their children that Santa [will let them be tortured by monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus) for not believing in him. This no doubt traumatized many a child, and caused them to keep desperately *trying* to believe out of fear, a year of two after they had figured out on an intellectual level that Santa Claus couldn't possibly actually be real, caused them to make up all sorts of desperate justifications of the inconsistencies in the story.

Imagine if the threats and promises were proportionally greater. Imagine that the desperate ad-hoc justifications were dressed up in poetry or in clever-sounding arguments too verbose and circular for an average person to follow. And more importantly, imagine that there was heavy social pressure, up to and including the risk of violence, against those who went around talking about who the story didn't make sense. Imagine that, and you'll understand why many adults keep believing the ""Jesus"" story after figuring out the ""Santa"" one.",t5_2qh2p,knight

Would be nice to get: Right-footed CB, Central midfield depth

Given the difficulty it is to scout and invest wisely in CB's (hard to recall after getting so lucky with Dier, Toby and Wimmer), and with the future of Carter-Vickers, I would be surprised if the CB is anything other than a bargain bin buy. With the knowledge that they'd be playing behind perhaps our best player in Toby and would hopefully eventually compete with CCV down the line, it would make sense to go the proven PL-league cheap depth route (Trippier) if that exists because we already have a bright prospect in line and Poch loves proven PL players.

Mason and Carroll have definitively carved out spots for themselves in the squad in central midfield behind Dembele and sometimes further up the formation when needed, but Bentaleb (partially due to injury, but not completely) has not been able to spell Dier given Poch's reluctance to ever rotate him out. We need to get someone in who can spell Dier for the weekend turn @ West Brom after he plays in Europe mid-week or someone who keeps us solid if Dier accumulates yellow card suspensions like he does now and we have to shit ourselves at times in fear that he misses fixtures like the NLD. Obviously this would require splashing a bit of cash on because good DM's that slot right in don't come cheap, so I think this would need to be the one Son-level purchase if one is going to be made.

Some will say the big splash should be Batshuayi, and I don't necessarily disagree. Depending on his price, or someone similar, and the midfield target that the club is interested in, I don't think it's that crazy to think we could pull off 2 purchases in that price range with potential CL allure. Yes, we have the stadium project to fund, but even for a businessman like Levy, I think he will feel the added incentive to try and improve the squad further so this new CL level of success (knock on wood) is maintained. While it's true that we aren't the type of club that has traditionally made big purchases for these aspirations (without a huge Bale fund) and that the club should be confident in the youth movement due to recent results, it's also true that Spurs never really have had *this* much appeal to other bright, young players around the world.

Well, there are a few reasons this is a ""cartoonish"" view of history. First off, your time period is the incredibly vague ""before ultrarich people"". I have to assume this is also ""before agriculture"", because pretty much simultaneously with agriculture cities formed, and along with cities came ""ultrarich"" people, at least ""ultrarich"" by the standards of agrarian societies.

But sure, there are lots of cases of communal projects, usually in the form of mutually obligated labor (the entire town might turn out to raise your barn, but there's an expectation that you'll be turning out at the next barn raising). There have been multiple stabs through history at at communal ownerships, with varying degrees of success (and ownership- technically, public parks are communally owned, for example, but no citizen could say they ""own"" it).

In general though, when people wanted to get big projects done, they just invested money in doing it. The Roman aqueducts weren't built by a motivated community. They were built by money. For most of history, big things were only done by the ultrarich. *Banking* was invented in the late medieval/renaissance period as a way to allow the not-so-ultrarich to undertake big projects- the European colonization of the world was made possible more by banks than it was by gunpowder. This is also the period where companies start selling shares.

The idea that, ""hey, regular folks can pitch in and do cool things,"" is a fine idea. The idea that this was at any point in history the default mode for projects, predating some mythical ""ultrarich people"" is a farce. It's a cartoonish view of history.",t5_2qh2s,lfg

It's always been equal opportunity. Opportunity just favored the enslavement of Africans by other Africans who then sold them to Europeans and the US. 

Ironically, the outlaw of the slave trade by the US and Great Britain actually *increased* the rate of slavery in many African nations, as their economies shifted from churning out slaves to producing labor-intensive products like Palm Oil and Yams - which required more slaves to produce. Great Britain of course looked away from this, because *they* weren't doing the slavery, oh no. Their hands were clean. ",t5_2qh3l,

&gt; A shift away from co-operative defense based on traditional alliance structures towards a self-defense deterrence model requires significant expenditure in order for the deterrent to be effective. Note the example of the Swiss Army, or in more recent times the attempts of North Korea.

This part has a few issues; firstly it's not clear why you are talking about a move from co-operative defence towards self-defence. If you still want to make this point, maybe it should be moved to the discussion of the AU-US alliance. Secondly, you claim such a change would require ""significant expenditure"" but don't provide any evidence to justify this or put an actual or approximate value on ""significant"". Finally, the two examples you provided are a land-locked European country and a extreme communism-based dictatorship; maybe not the best place to start a discussion about Australian defence politics.

&gt; The reasons conflicts typically arise between sovereign states are ideological differences or resource discrepancies. For instance, Hitler persuaded the German people to go to war with Europe in order to gain lebensraum, or living space, a resource the rest of Europe had which Germans perceived themselves to lack.

1930's German politics is not exactly a useful place to start a discussion of modern Australian politics either. While it's true that Hitler used the promise of ""living space"" as part of his rhetoric that lead to the German invasion of Poland (and thus the start of WWII), it was only one part, in a much larger set of goals that the German's had.
According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#War_breaks_out_in_Europe_.281939.E2.80.9340.29) the reason Germany used for the initial invasion of Poland was ""the false pretext that the Poles had carried out a series of sabotage operations against German targets"". 

&gt; China is an energy-intensive economy whose Government is primarily concerned with social and economic stability and long-term growth. They are heavily dependent on Australian coal to achieve their most important goals. Artificial spikes in the price of coal, and therefore energy, would affect prices of heat and electricity in China, not to mention the manufacturing and construction industries, and therefore jobs and the economy. It is one of their most important resources, like lebensraum was for the Germans.

Like most developed economies (read: not Australia but pretty much everyone else) China is moving away from coal and towards renewable energy sources and energy targets.
So the following section;

&gt; Now, consider the Greens' policies on Coal as stated in their ""Climate Change and Energy"" policy document found on their website:
 
&gt;Principles (11): Energy prices should reflect the environmental and social costs of production and use.

&gt;Principles (12): Subsidies to the fossil fuel sector, including funding for research and development, should be transferred to the renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transport sectors.

&gt;The Greens appear willing to fundamentally and drastically affect the price of producing coal in Australia. They list no timeframe for the changes they propose, and the language used does not give the impression their desire would be to act slowly and cautiously.

&gt;I don't think it is a stretch to say that ordinary Chinese might perceive, with little encouragement, to view the actions of an overly enthusiastic Greens government trying to save the environment as acts of war, if they are cold and out of work and the lights won't turn on.

is based off of a flawed assumption and is completely irrelevant. That's ignoring the fact that it is an exceedingly dumb idea for any developed nation to attack another developed nation in the 21st century.

&gt;Now, consider the Greens' policy in relation to the American alliance. Nowhere do they say explicitly that they wish to end our treaty, but policies found in their ""Peace and Security"" document found on their policy website illustrate their attitude:

&gt;Aims (14): Closure of all existing foreign bases in Australian territory and an end to foreign troop deployment, training and hosting on Australian territory.

&gt;Aims (17): An end to training and joint exercises by the ADF with armed forces known to have committed human rights abuses.

&gt;Given the Greens' known attitude towards recent American military activities, especially during the Iraq war, we can be sure that (17) is explicitly referring to ending the currently close co-operation with American forces. When coupled with

&gt;Aims (24): A renegotiated defence relationship with our allies that promotes Australia's independent role in our region.
the policy position of the Greens towards the American alliance becomes more explicit.

You draw several conclusions about the intent of these sections of the Green's policy without really justifying those conclusions. Additionally, you are taking 3 points from a page with 13 principles and 24 aims. You acknowledge the fact that ""Nowhere do they say explicitly that they wish to end our *[US/AU]* treaty""  and yet you go on to conclude, or at least insinuate, that the Greens intend to do just that. The Greens are not exactly known for the silence on controversial issues and if the did want a complete end to the AU/US treaty I think they would have said just that.

&gt; Leaving or renegotiating the American alliance would leave us with a yawning gap in deterrence power, but the Greens don't appear to be willing to balance this gap by providing extra funding to defence. 

You provide no actual evidence to backup this claim that we would be left with a ""yawning gap"" if Australia changed it's position with regards to the AU/US alliance.

&gt;Consider

&gt;Aims (4): A reallocation, and where possible, reduction in Australian military expenditure consistent with the defensive security needs of Australia and the peace-keeping role of Australian forces.

&gt;The Greens' policy here is consistent with their policy of minimal militaristic intervention, and ""where possible"" is a welcome concession to reality, but the emphasis on reduction reveals what I am concerned is an ignorance of the vast expenditure required to maintain an effective military deterrent against our neighbours given their other policies.

Again, you provide no evidence to backup your claim that Australia would need a ""vast expenditure [required] to maintain an effective military deterrent against our neighbours"".  Additionally, the Greens don't advocate for no military spending; rather that we use the military budget wisely and in a way that benefits Australia's goals and security needs.

&gt;Without an American alliance to protect us, and without adequate defense spending to provide an effective deterrent, could we really be confident the Chinese would not see our resources and our weakness, and act? I went through the Greens policies tonight and noticed this, I want to see how people justify it.

The assertion that Greens policy would lead to inadequate defence spending and no US alliance is not based in fact and thus the conclusions draw from it are irrelevant.

I've tried to comment on just what you've said and to leave my positions on the matter aside. However, it's probably clear that I don't agree with you on any of these points (which is fine, people are entitled to their opinions) and from what I've read in the last 24 hours from you it seems as if you are more interested in attacking the Greens in any way rather than actually discussing their polices.",t5_2snwr,

Right now it's crowds trying to surge through fences, in a month or two it's going to be vehicles ramming through fences and walls (and running down anyone who happens to be on the other side in the process).

The EU needs to stop the flow at the earliest point in the EU. That is Greece, where the government is overwhelmed by the wave of migrants. With proper resources (such as EU countries sending contingents of military and police), the migrants can be screened upon interception in Greece and either allowed to seek asylum or detained while awaiting deportation. The more migrants that are stopped at Greece means fewer people who are trying to get into the Balkans, and fewer still who are getting into Germany and Western Europe. 

The best place to fight off an invasion force is on the beaches, and so fat there has been very little discussion of helping Greece restore order. Without any changes, the migrant populations will be able to grow in number on whatever border that you decide to build a wall on, and they will eventually breach it. 

The best solution is to intercept them either at sea or upon landing, when they are still isolated and few in number; it's easier to stop and deal with 100 migrants in a boat than an encampment of tens thousand.

For many liberals the line was the rape culture narrative and 3rd wave feminist ideologies. Report after report of college rape accusations pushed by the media lonely to be debunked, but not until innocent men were smeared and exiled from campuses. Those who dared call this out were labeled sexist rape apologists. 



Or the biased and false coverage, division, and resulting violence created from Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown was a line. Anyone who watched the cases with an open mind saw that Zimmerman and Office Wilson used justified self defense. But those liberals broke from the herd, and were labeled racists


Or the gamergate fiasco where a large chunk of traditionally liberal millennials we're demonized by modern feminists because they didn't want identity politics being forced into video games. Wage gap myth was spewed and stem people were blamed for more women not wanting to go into stem. Those liberals who once blindly followed liberal media indoctrination now found themselves being demonized by the liberal media. Those liberals drew a line and as a result were called racist, Mysoginistic, bigots

&amp;nbsp;


Now the (arguably largest) red pill is the refugee/economic migrant crisis and blind protection of Islam. This is the issue that seems to be killing liberalism. Those who saw the issues a mile away begged, pleaded with liberals to reconsider open borders for muslims who would refuse to integrate. For muslims from countries that believe women are slaves to husbands, homosexuals should be executed, and anyone who dares to oppose Islam be put to death. Liberals responded by calling them racist, Islamophobic neonazis. 

For years, liberals have been conditioned by the media and celebrities on what to think. How to feel. They've been constantly told that the patriarchy is the greatest evil alive. That rape culture is real and to be despised. Than even the simplest things like ""manspreading"" is oppressive and not to be tolerated. That women should be free to wear what they want without fear of Harassment. That LGBT groups should be free to express themselves. 

... But now the narrative says that's only the case if the people aren't muslim. Muslims have now been placed at the top of the oppressive totem pole. European liberals are now being confronted with REAL patriarchy. REAL rape culture, and they're being labeled neonazis for calling it out... Liberals are now telling women to cover up and stay at arms length of men. That they shouldn't dress how they feel, and that they shouldn't blame the men if they're sexually assaulted because they're the ones that dressed slutty. 

Liberals are now giving up the  protections they once enjoyed to help pay for ""refugees"" where 80% of them aren't even from waring countries. They're being told to think of the ""poor women and children"", yet when they look around, they see mostly young immigrant men. They're hearing of atrocities like Rotherham UK and Cologne Germany, but the media and government they blindly trusted is abandoning them to push the multiculturalism narrative. 

&amp;nbsp;

This... THIS is why people are shifting to the right in droves. THIS is why conservative parties are gaining power in Western Europe, the liberal bastion of the world. THIS is one of the reasons why Donald J Trump is bringing in record numbers of supporters to vote for him. 


So no, it's not just because of the alt-right. It's because regressive liberalism has spun out of control and alienated more and more people who refuse to cross a certain line. It's because regressive liberalism is killing society. ",t5_2qzb6,

That's a completely arbitrary statement : we are all biologically related. By the way, what does ""biologically related"" is supposed to mean, actually ? Is your familly a race, since you are ""biologically realated"" ? Asians are ""biologically related"" too. Consequently, is ""asian"" a race (and then is ""korean"" a subrace) ? The fact is, there can be more genetical difference among two koreans than among a korea and a european*

I have no idea how you're getting the idea that a group of people biologically related to each other is a race.

""Korean"" is an ethnic group. The concept of race doesn't make sense when apllied to humans since we are all part of the same subspecies.

Fair enough. As for me, I'm almost entirely of British extraction and can't stand the Union Jack. It represents a monarchy and a class system that stands against the egalitarian nation that New Zealand prides itself on and the nation that my ancestors chose to leave because of those values. Many of the 74% of New Zealanders who identify as European aren't British and many also don't identify at all with Britain. Furthermore, it doesn't at all represent 26% of the population who are non-European. I don't think our flag should represent one aspect of our history for one ethnicity.

And the reason for that is that they treat driving as a passive action.  This doesn't make sense because driving is always an active action.  But the tendency of local drivers is to do the most passive thing possible.  This is things like moving to the left lane regardless of whether they are going faster than someone.  They just move over because they are avoiding the merging traffic.  

Make sure you friend knows that driving in traffic is always an active action.  Move to let faster traffic move by.  Move to let yourself by if you are faster traffic.  Do not judge others on how they drive unless they legitimately endanger you.

This is a similar collection I am building of Boris Vallejo album art covers. Vallejo is another one of my favorites in the fantasy art genre.

What's pictured:

**Flotsam and Jetsam - No Place for Disgrace:** My favorite out of the bunch. This is a solid thrash album throughout, and features a thrash cover of Elton John. Now I've heard everything...

**Ted Nugent - Penetrator:** I hate Ted Nugent. I'm actually kind of mad at myself for even owning this album, but the cover art is still pretty sweet.

**Molly Hatchet - Take No Prisoners:** More good old Southern rock. It sounds like there should be a barfight in the background.

**Ozzy Osbourne - The Ultimate Sin:** This is the better of the two Ozzy albums pictured here, both in terms of cover art and the music. Enjoyable even if you're not an Ozzy superfan.

**Ozzy Osbourne - Bark at the Moon:** Vallejo did the background painting for this album, so it counts for the collection. But I think this album is kinda goofy. I probably wouldn't own it based just on the music.

What's missing: 

The only other LP album cover art by Vallejo that I am aware of is Bran Van 3000's album ""Discosis."" I think I would enjoy the music very much, and the cover is definitely slick. BUT, I do not enjoy the prospect of $50 plus shipping from Europe through discogs. :/

I understand that it's partially because the scale was so different, but most of the native deaths occurred do to diseases that the Europeans didn't even realize they were transmitting at first.

Personally, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I've always felt there is something oddly patronizing about the way the US, Canada, and Australia refer to their original inhabitants. I honestly think the ""noble savage"" stereotype persists to this day and has a lot to do with why we tend to think we need to continue to ""make amends"" for actions taken in the past.

I'm actually not saying that I don't think we should because I do. I think Andrew Jackson's forced march of Native Americans was tantamount to cultural genocide.

Different cultures in Europe and around the globe have had different names and ranking systems, but I think it's fair to say in general that you have the hierarchy in the correct order, at least. The duke is below the king, and the king is below the triumvirate (presumably representing an empire). So the duke's duchy is part of the king's kingdom, which in turn is part of the emperor's empire. (Except in place of an emperor you have a triumvirate, which is fine as long as you understand that historically such governments have been unstable.)

But Duke and King are terms that come from a specific cultural context (Medieval Western Europe), so it's possible you've violated the expectations of that context in other ways. You mention the king marrying the widow of the former duke, and in some places and times that would have been totally fine, while in others, completely ridiculous. 

More problematic, in my eyes, is the use of the term ""triumvirate"", which reads Latin to me and from a very different place and time than the others. So, in short, I think your use of ""duke"" is fine, but it's your use of ""triumvirate"" that's questionable. However, that said, it's a fantasy, so who cares? Using a term from a different time and place is by no means unheard of in this genre. 

If you posted some writing where it shows up and asked people what they thought of how you handle such matters *in the story*, you'd probably get some more specific advice :)

back to Ti 1-3 and before，The China Dota is still very hot,
When Dota 1 time, Like 2008-2010 this period, The bonus of big contest is far from Ti or other big contest nowadays, But the China Dota team still took flight to Europe to participate, Even the Champion team bonus is like just 30,000-50,000 $（In my memory) besides China team won this bonus they had to share it with club, After the hotel and flight etc fee, the china player actually didn't earn much, So what is the motivation that they would still flied to foreign country to participate?
I think  it was the great dota environment in china and they really love it, and they are the pro players they would like to prove to the would they were the best, Also they made livings on it.
As to MVP team, i think they really trained hard and humble to learn, They deserve this and i respect them.",t5_2s580,

No it isn't.

He was Rank 2 EU at the time of death. Clearly he knew what he was doing. When you have a cheat death passive, you know whether or not you are able to take the risk of attacking. Indestructible also is a choice of proccing given that it gives a damage buff when it procs.

Therefore, if fatal damage bypasses cheat death, it is clearly a bug. His death shouldn't have happened regardless of what flawed logic you want to use. It is factually bugged. What ridiculous argument are you going to use for the reason for the existence of a cheat death passive if it doesn't work arbitrarily?",t5_2qore,

Also, fyi, we don't have free speech, never said we did - e.g. it's illegal to have Soviet or Nazi flags without specific reasons (education, art). 

&gt; and blindly following your nationalism are not requirements of being a full pledged citizen in a modern European nation.

There is a difference between blindly following nationalism and being paid taxpayer money for your job, while you on-camera shit on the military of the land you live in. As I said in another post - shit on the government, nation, all you want - but the military are those who are willing to die for you. Hell- criticise them, but calling them ''SS Nazis'' as some Moscow parrot WHILE BEING PAID BY TAXPAYERS is absolutely not okay, and if I have to be called racist, a nazi or a xenophobe for refusing to cheer for ''free speech'' in a case where the loyalty of a state worker to his own nation is in question?

&gt; short sighted, oppressive, uneducated, xenophobic, nationalistic, hateful

Now you're just spouting insults at me one at a time.

How was it short-sighted? How was it oppressive? How was it uneducated? How was it xenophobic? I get nationalistic, and this sub has made me way more than I would have allowed myself to be in the recent years. And I can even get hateful - because I genuinely do dislike the man in the video.

I am for integration of the society long-term where men like him are called out by the ethnic-Russians beside him and silenced not because of governmental threats, but because it is fucking stupid. Not under the threat of violence, but under the shame of being a fucking cunt. Yet nothing of that happens - he continues to rave his idiocracy, while those standing beside him don't even beep. 

Part of integration is feeling at least positive emotions to your country. The vitriolic hate he has, and the lack of empathy the bystanders have, just shows what kind of integration problems we have. And if you think it's xenophobic to have a united, strong society, well, I don't really understand then what you want.

A lot of people really enjoyed them and some of the articles I had written got me a temporary job as a historian for Deadliest Warrior. Didn't get to use many facts because the producers were mostly dense as all hell. Walking right onto the explosives set like they own the place, moments before the explosives were about to go live.

I did that years ago for maybe a year or two, but there was always a very vocal group of younger wannabes who didn't like that I was, what they thought, belittling Muay Thai and MMA, I really wasn't, but some of the things I said contradicted what they were told about Muay Thai and MMA. Even when presented with sources, images, and personal support from fellow martial artist, these idiots still didn't let up. So I always make sure to teach only certain people, and only what they need to know, because people really aren't ready to learn about a lot of things.

I would like to do that again. I'll have to get in contact with my old buddies and get some updated sources.

&gt;And it's very true what you say about these things and martial arts disappearing, which to me is sad because this is human history. Stuff we can learn from and keep in our books and history classes. 

It is sad, but it is the way of life. Things come, then they go. They make it easier for the next generation to grow. Unfortunately, the next generation is mostly strawberries.

&gt;The Maori and Pacific warrior culture is another one of those that only relate a few things of the history of war and fighting. But the benefit of their cultures is that they have a strong young population in touch with their roots and heritage and keep most of it alive. 

They're probably lucky to have been treated so well, than compared to other cultures, and you're right. The youth have a closer connection to their roots, likely because they were westernized just over 150 years ago.

&gt;My own historical studies on warfare were too Western based so I missed on learning stuff from Africa, Middle East, Pacific Islands, Mongolia, and India. Heck, even in armies based on a faith or religious angle never get talked about. We know of the Crusaders, but what about the training? What of the forces under Saladin? How did the Jewish tribes of ancient times fight and train. 

I was the same way. A lot of people who take an interest in classical studies, usually end up learning about the classical age above all others.

About Africa. The northern parts are very much well recorded thanks to the Golden Age of Islam and the European missionaries. So you will have very little trouble finding information on say the Numidians and the Egyptians. As for Eastern and Western Africa. A little harder to find information that holds some accuracy due to oral traditions.

The Middle East should also be quite easy. They went through nearly 1,000 years of golden history that was recorded, printed, and protected. It's actually amazing how advanced they became in such a short amount of time, and after about 500 years they were technologically ahead of many other civilizations. Also being at the center of the world at the time, they had access to every culture available.

Religious factions are a difficult subject to talk about, but also great. Religious warriors were some of the best fighters because they so believed in their cause. Even if they weren't trained to use such weapons, they would still go out and give it their best. I think the Rajput did the best job in ancient history, and the Picts and Celts were a very spiritual people who believed that they were protected and empowered by the elements.

Hey, I like talking about history. Most of what I had learned is about the personal combative issues between individuals and entire cultures.",t5_2qh53,

I wonder if the right way to leave the EU is under the direction of a government that didn't expect to lose a referendum and didn't actually want to leave? Perhaps there should be a campaign ""vote yes to leave - but not right now"". On the assumption that the UK op-outs and our non-membership of the Euro cause a deepening rift between the UK and the ever-closer-union states, perhaps we should wait until we can elect a government which is keen on leaving the EU and until we have blatantly obvious arguments for leaving that will, for instance, show that the EU is an unreliable trading partner if it choses to penalise us in subsequent exit negotiations.

Isn't it? Is there no cultural problem with terrorism in French culture, specifically in French Muslim communities? Couldn't there be some reason why [almost half of the positively identified Europeans who have gone to join ISIS](http://www.ibtimes.com/islamic-state-french-jihadists-nearly-half-european-extremists-joining-isis-are-1874892) are French, despite the French making up less than 10% of the population of Europe?

&gt;Anyway, I think that is the entire point. The argument is that Western culture is tacitly pro-rape.

I don't think you're quite hitting the nail on the head with this one.

&gt;Rape culture is the ways in which a society trivializes, rationalizes, or even condones rape and other acts of sexual violence. Rape culture includes a variety of issues from the way raped individuals are treated by police to the way rape is portrayed in fiction and by the media.

*Pro-rape* is painting with too broad of brushstrokes. Rape is illegal in every country in the world; what constitutes rape and what is considered rape is different.

&gt;They apologised profusely.

&gt;  Much of what we know and feel about the First World War we owe to Vera Brittain's elegiac yet unsparing book, which set a standard for memoirists from Martha Gellhorn to Lillian Hellman. Abandoning her studies at Oxford in 1915 to enlist as a nurse in the armed services, Brittain served in London, in Malta, and on the Western Front. By war's end she had lost virtually everyone she loved. Testam...

&gt; Baffled by ordinary Western-style flush toilets, refugees nationwide have squatted on toilet rims or the floor of the bathroom when nature called; others have relieved themselves in the shower stalls, leaving behind human excrement on the floors.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s been on the market for just a few days, company head Peter Fliegenschmidt told DW. His company has sold squat toilet units for years, he said, but in the wake of the refugee crisis in Germany, the challenge was to come up with a combined Western-style/squat toilet.

&gt; Toilet routines differ, and Islamic culture has detailed toilet etiquette.

&gt; French bulldozers began demolishing shacks in the &amp;quot;Jungle&amp;quot; migrant camp in the northern port city of Calais, though some communal facilities were left standing The Dutch government said there were 30 war crimes suspects among migrants who claimed asylum in the Netherlands last year - 10 from Syria and the other 20 mostly from Eritrea, Nigeria, Sudan and Georgia.

&gt; On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Europe to help Greece in the current migrant crisis.

&gt; In a TV interview she said: &amp;quot;Do you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone, and we were the strictest, can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos?&amp;quot;.

""Arabic"" ,in layman term, mostly refer to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is more or less modernized version of Quran's language, and MSA' influence in Arab world is similar to what Latin had in medieval Europe.

To say everyone in Morocco and Egypt **speak** Arabic like Arabia did is like saying everyone in Medieval France and Medieval Sweden speak Latin like Papacy did, and saying everyone in Arab world speak the same Arabic is like saying everyone in Europe speak Latin (which is not totally wrong, but still very far from correct)

Moroccan Arabic have very strong Berber influence, as Morocco is a melting pot of Berber, Arabic and others. While Egyptian Arabic influenced by Coptic, Arabic, Turkish and others. They won't be counted as a same language without MSA, and Moroccan wouldn't understand Egyptian Arabic if popular movies and songs in Arab world didn't used them.

**TL;DR** : Without Modern Standard Arabic, Moroccan, Egyptian and Arabic would be different language, and there's little similarity between those language.

Though I think South America takes the cake when it comes to people just getting wrecked.  Lots of very violent thieves and murderers, even ""safe"" areas aren't really safe.

Turkey in my opinion is very much like America or Europe when it comes to backpacking, cities and towns are good, but middle of nowhere is horrible.  Then there are places like Thailand where the tourist infrastructure is so good that wandering is encouraged.

I will keep trying until I find a doctor who respects my ability to choose my own path in life, and who believes me when I say that no, I will not throw all my ideals overboard when I meet 'the one' who wants kids, that 'the one' could actually never want kids (and that is, if my current SO is not actually the one, which I sure hope he is). They all seem to think this decision is based on situational factors, like the relationship or the current financial situation. All that can change! I know it can, but for me this decision is based on my personality, on things that haven't changed in the past 15 years and will not change ever. I understand they have to tell me about the risk of regret, but why deny the procedure? Why not let me weigh the psychological risks and decide, like they let me do with the medical risks (which are actually their specialty - and there I CAN make my own decision. It's weird.)

Anyway, sorry for the rant! Are you on the childfree subreddit by any chance? There is a list of doctors there who are willing to help people without asking too many questions, so if you ever wanted to go through with the sterilisation, that may help...

You shouldn't have much of a problem with English on EU servers, there will be plenty of British players and lots of other people speak English well even when it's their second language.

Speaking as a fellow Brit who has lived in America I can tell you that I have always had FAR more fun in European guilds in games than American ones.

&gt;  Description book **War with the Newts by Karel Čapek**:

&gt;  One of the great anti-utopian satires of the twentieth century, an inspiration to writers from Orwell to Vonnegut, at last in a modern translation. Man discovers a species of giant, intelligent newts and learns to exploit them so successfully that the newts gain skills and arms enough to challenge man's place at the top of the animal kingdom. Along the way, Karel Capek satirizes science, runaway ca...

As for your hypothetical example of an order owning say southern Iberia (Andalusia in CK2 if I'm not mistaken) this did in fact happen. The greatest example would be the Teutonic Order which at it's apex controlled significant lands in the Baltic and pursued wars against not only pagan Lithuanians but also came into conflict with Christian Poland. Other examples include the Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John) who owned Rhodes and later Malta (after losing Rhodes to the Ottomans). The Knights Templar owned Cyprus  for a time as well. I suppose these are some of the best examples of ""Holy Order States"". In my opinion, the real area of success that the orders had were donations from the nobility and from the Church in the forms of lands and wealth. These donations would span across Europe so that these orders became examples of Pan European entities. To provide an example, you could deposit ""x"" amount of wealth in a Templar priory in France and receive a certificate. You would then reach Jerusalem, provide your certificate and receive the goods of equal value there. The orders had significant business interests and financial infrastructures along with their military arm. While controlling duchies and kingdoms looks cool in game, I would argue that their smaller holdings that dotted Europe and the wealth they accumulated were just as important factors in their influence.",t5_2ssp3,

eh fuck it, just for you:

&gt;This strategy made us give away Darmian, Verdi and Ganz, now searched from many teams in the whole europe.

Verdi and Ganz.  Searched from many teams in Europe.  Pmsl.  Verdi and Ganz are serie B quality players. Darmian is also just a case of hindsight and revisionism, showed next to nothing until his final 2 seasons under Ventura.  Nobody was upset with his sale at the time.

&gt; but Verdi is a good CAM giving him on loan with option to buy is just strange considering how we are in the midfield.

Verdi couldn't make the grade at Empoli or Eibar.  In what way would he ever help out our midfield (which has been performing well for a large portion of the season as it is). He was your second example, along with Ganz.

&gt;We needed a quality midfielder, and nothing, Inter got Banega, Napoli got Grassi, Juve got Mandragora and Sensi, why do you keep ignoring our biggest problem Galliani, this is just being blind, we have none able to do a good forward pass in the midfield. Montolivo is playing well defense wise, but any pass he made forward was a pass to the gk.

I'm getting off track, but here you're criticizing Galliani for not moving in the January market and then go to use Grassi, who is nowhere near good enough to make a difference for Milan right now.  You then go on to somehow put the blame solely on Galliani for not bringing in a midfielder this January, acting as if he's completely ignored it when it's very obvious he doesn't have the financial freedom to commit 6m+ for a player who will make an impact 2-3 years in the future.  

Overall this post, and those comments, are the quality i've come to expect from you.

(Example: Show and Display permit, or if foreign visitor brings in his personal car from Canada, Mexico, Europe, etc)

First and foremost, there is nothing on the books, nor in process, both with the EPA and DOT, banning R32s or R34s. Show/display is not granted to these cars ever.

Second, importation can only be considered legal if gone through an RI AND there is data that the DOT has to show HOW to comply with the FMVSS with crash worthiness and safety and there is data at that the EPA has on HOW to comply with the EPA required emissions. You can find the data for the R33 specifically as it is public info. It talks about how the B pillar needs to be modified, etc. This same kind of testing was NEVER done by Motorex. This testing needs to be done for an R32 or R34 to be legal in the US barring you don't wait 25yrs from date of manufacture.

&gt;Motorex originally was able to modify GTRs to meet US crash standards and emissions standards

Only the R33. The reason the completed and delivered R34s and R32s were grandfathered in, was because Motorex fraudulently claimed that they were functionally identical and can be treated as the same car for all intents and purposes. After the legal woes, this was rejected. Clearly they are not functionally identical and as such cannot be expected to perform the same.

&gt;however there were issues with OBDII compliance.

Before they could even get the OK from the EPA and DOT, they had to prove that this was possible in the first place. So your ""information"" is patently false.

&gt;Your ""information"" on the crash testing and emissions processes are also not correct.

Really? Where did I specify the crash testing and emissions process. It was a ""this is the most basic things that have to be done"" sort of thing. You going to get pedantic now? Oh wait, too late.

&gt;Any car that does not have a US issued VIN is considered grey market.

VIN issue location is irrelevant. In fact, all VINs are issued in the same manner globally for over 20 years now. The 17 digit VIN has been the standard and in use since the very early 80s. Look at the Porsche 959 for fucks sake. Or ANY BMW, Ferrari, Mercedes, Lamborhini, etc. Look at VINs from the late 80s. They are the same. VINs in the current 17 digit format are not new. Nor are they location specific. They do not specify where they are intended. The equipment does. And the feds don't consider it a grey market vehicle once it has been federalized.

You clearly do not seem to actually know things that you profess to know. ",t5_2qhr3,

I think maybe you are saying in the middle east, terrorism is committed by Muslims the majority of the time. Maybe this is true, and I'd imagine it to be so, however religion itself does not account for the majority of terrorism in the ways terrorism is defined. All of these wars we have waged in the middle east have surely increased the number of acts.. but we also have to start defining 'terrorism' more clearly lest we include ourselves and the indiscriminate bombing we so happily sent in *bilderberg* to fix up later.

&gt;Money is only indicative of there being someone who has the power to issue a promissory guarantee of value - it says something about the complexity of the economy in a given region, but it in no way determines society as significantly as Preston implies.

Money is absolutely indicative of the significance of a society. The Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Roman, Greek, Ottoman, Persian, Mongol empires all had coinage or money, including many of Chinese Dynasty's.  Almost all great empires and societies throughout history have had coinage or something developed past commodity money since about 1000 BC. I really don't see how you can claim it doesn't determine the significance of a society. It is clearly an indicator. 



&gt;Oral traditions are not inherently inferior to written language!

You must be joking me? This is an absolutely ludicrous claim and I'm surprised that no one has mentioned before I started writing this post. Your claim to back it up that illiterate bards can recite complex stories with little mutation, basically ignores the tremendous implications of having a written language; making records, cartographic advances, the ability to preserve a language, not to mention advances in math, science, engineering, literature, philosophy basically everything. Written language is so obviously and apparently superior to exclusively oral language that I'm stunned you'd even try and say otherwise. 

&gt; Oh god, not again. The 'so called' Middle Ages (Note; Middle or Medieval Ages and the Age of Migration are terms used by historians precisely because the common moniker 'Dark Ages' is inappropriate) were not an utter collapse of technological know-how. They did lose some things, like how to use concrete, but in most fields technologically the supposedly ignorant, shit covered peasants and lords of Europe actually improved upon technology in Roman times. 

While this is true, but you still have to concede that between about the fifth century and 1000 AD, there seems to have been little in terms of technological advance at all.  Although to claim that this lasted well into the Renaissance is a complete over-simplification. 

&gt; Nothing we've seen in Westeros so far, bar Dragonstone and the structure at the base of the Hightower, would be impossible for its current inhabitants to construct given the motivation and the manpower. The later structure would actually have supported his argument quite well, as it's pre-Valyrian and utterly inexplicable in the current chronology, but for some reason (I suspect based on this video that Preston didn't read The World of Ice and Fire) it's left out. 

There is nothing in recorded history that comes close to the walls apparent 700ft being built until well into the 1800's and even the they were towers, not 300 mile long walls. More importantly than the Wall being logistically impossible for the current citizens of Westeros to recreate, I doesn't thematically makes sense for it to be able to built again by normal means. I think this is apparent from the all the myth and legend surrounding Brandon the Builder and it's construction, and I'd say the same for Storm's End.  And at the very least, both the Wall and Storm's End have some serious magical power that is by and large not at all understood by a huge majority of the Westerosi population.


&gt; Considering that recorded history in Westeros supposedly dates back 6000 years to the Andal invasion, there's little to no reason to expect records from before the Long Night to have been preserved in their original forms up to the present day. 

Don't see why not, to be honest. Sure, you wouldn't expect the original text to survive, as parchment is frail, but for there to be absolutely no copies or reported copies or any reports of texts surviving from the First Men does seems bizarre if they had a full written language. 

&gt;As an archaeology student let me tell you that the only way nobody has attempted to steal grave goods from a burial site over an eight thousand year period is if it is utterly inaccessible nor unknown to them. Heck, countless sites similar to the barrows have been dug up and destroyed 

Actually, in the context of Westeros' feudal system it could make sense that many old barrows and graves might not have been dug up. If you consider that many of the Great Houses have been ruling for thousands of years, and would revere and bury their dead close to home, it wouldn't be surprising for a lot of graves to go untouched. The old burial grounds we hear about the most of in Westeros, Winterfell's crypts, are the best example of this I think. Really, who would dare exhume the old Kings of Winter when the Starks are still in power? And even now, when there is no Stark in Winterfell, those bodies have not been dug up, yes a few swords have been taken, but no bodies have been dug up or coffins or whatever examined. I can imagine it would be the same for many of the greater and lesser houses who have endured throughout Westerosi history. 


**SIDE NOTE**

I don't believe in Preston's theory of a previous futuristic civilisation in Westeros, so I won't argue with you there, I was just playing devil's advocate. But it's important to note that GRRM is not an archaeologist, he's not an anthropologist, or a scientist.  GRRM is a writer, so considering whether or not something in his world might be possible or impossible based on scientific or historical accuracy, without giving any thought as to whether it makes sense *thematically* or not, is pretty pointless.

The Government has been scruing with Healthcare for decades now. The whole system is bloated and inflated with costs.

&gt;There's examples of Privatisation done really well, and there's example of privatisation done really badly

Only if you look at it in a boolean way. If you analyze the situation economically, privatization never harms the economy. Often harms people, but that is usually inevitable. 

&gt;There's a lot of economists that argue governmental monopoly in certain sectors results in a better outcome

And by a lot you mean a select few whose arguments get destroyed by critics. By all means, provide me with an example of these ""economists"".

&gt;A lot of which end up with the same or better levels of care for overall cheaper societal cost

Those ""Government"" run healthcares of other countries are less restrictive than the US's ""Private"" healthcare. We are also talking average. If you look at healthcare for the upper middle class and wealthy, US crushes everyone like no tomorrow.

&gt;A private monopoly seeks to exert control over pricing to maximize profits, often at the expense of the consumer. A government monopoly can, but doesn't often have that primary goal. It's primary goal is to lower costs, which may sound similar but is entirely different

Very flawed. I will give you a basic example.

I want to start a pharmaceutical and develop some drug. This drug will cost a lot of money to produce and i will need to sell enogh of the drug to break even and make profit in order to expand my wealth. 

In a private system, i will start my company, charge a lot for the drug to break even at some point. I am happy with the money, the customer is happy to be alive (Though they might not be happy with the price). Eventually competition sets in, and i have to lower the price of my drug.

In a government run healthcare, i will never develop the drug in the first place, as the government will force me to price it very cheap and i will never make any money. The government will instead import the drug for the private healthcare country for cheap, which the company would be willing to do for side money. After all, those countries are not their target market.

In your fantasy scenario i still start my company, am forced to sell for real cheap, and still somehow stay afloat. This simply does not happen in reality. 

All these unjustifiably high prices are always solely due to corruption. A company will buy some decades old drug that had it's license extended and charge stupid money for it. If not for that license extension, others would produce that drug for a much cheaper price.

&gt; It acts to set the standard, this is what society is expected to provide regarding your health, if you want more then you can definitely pay for that, but if you can't then you're at least given a good level of care.

While i completely agree that it hurts virtually no one for basic health care, what happens if everyone goes on basic ""free"" healthcare? The whole system collapses unless you start to tax more, at which point people are paying for it in essence anyway.

On a side note, you are completely ignoring population. US has 350 million people. EU has 500 million with almost 30 separate healthcare ""monopolies"" that are extremely close to each other and do compete. It is pretty misleading to say EU countries are a proof that government healthcare works very well.

It took me over a year or may be two. It started from that I would not read Ayn Rand from ideological stand point, and ended with me wondering that may be I should give it a try.

**Distrust in Communism and communists:**

My main beef with communism, and I was not anarchistic, was that too many people have died and to many comrades were bloodthirsty, the standard of life was always to low. Not enough, I was believing, still do, that Stalin was a despot who stole his power and that USSR was not a communism. I started hopping for USSR 2.0, searching for people with high morals and good ethics to make a syndicate and start growing communism inside current structures. The problem with that was that people in general were starting to fight in between them petty power and control.

*Joke: A team of 500 is sent to build a kolhoz in far corners of Georgia, after few weeks they send message: colhoz is built, systems and bureaucracy set, moral is high, you can send us workers.*

Then I began doubting: 

1. many communist all around the world, all receive paycheck either from capitalist institutions(like Lenin did), from tyrants;
2. people do not seem to be receptive to the idea of work and responsibility for  communal property with Colhoz as the most glaring failure of USSR;
3. sadly capitalism was doing exactly that what I wanted but actually succeeding...

**Distrust in capitalism and keynesians:**

I did not knew any economy, but had a course of economics in university. Keynesianism was full of dumb notions though, like shovel ready projects that in a communist society were unacceptable, because they were just wasting precious human resources. This staff would be the reason why I would never become Keynesian. But I very like the staff about supply x demand, because it seamed very true at pure instinctual level.

**Distrust in goverments:**

So I became a moderate capitalism with strong social leaning and a desire to keep govt and capitalist in check as much as fucking possible.

Then I started learning history of US. And I tell you in where I am from every one believes that 9/11 was real, but every one also knows that USSR would have taken USA long long time a go if we believe the media narrative. Main argument was  about USA war machine incapable of defending Pentagon and NY. Complete joke. Those are passenger planes and they are very easy to pick off, so they were let to fly all the way to there destination and kill thousands of people more. This is semi official theory where I lived.

The saudi origin of terrorists and Saddam, as was Mubarak, a USA imperialist tool was unknow to people only in the USA and EU and their vassals. Notice that jet fuel was ""NEVER"" an argument outside of USA. I do not understand or can explain why people bring it all the time, but do not go for plain and easy explanations: you think Russia was capable, or any other country, of crushing it's two super sonic jets into twins and pentagon? No way.

So at the end I was left with semi working capitalism system, govt's that are equally murderous **everywhere**, USSR == USA.

**Afterword**

Then I found libertarianism and finally read Ayn Rand after that. I dived into Austrian economics at the same time. The rest of the journey is much less interesting.

My morals have actually stayed the same all this time: all live is precious, humanity needs to prosper in order to save itself. The question was ""which tool is more effective"". So the the main argument that make me switch actually was not a moral one, but utilitarian one the served my core morals, because at the end of the day capitalism and communism are tools/utilities and I wanted to ""get"" a good result.

**TL;DR: until you learn basic Austrian economics it is not possible for you to like capitalism, as it was impossible for me.**",t5_3cct3,Anarcho-Capitalist

&gt;  Nightwood, Djuna Barnes' strange and sinuous tour de force, ""belongs to that small class of books that somehow reflect a time or an epoch"" (TLS). That time is the period between the two World Wars, and Barnes' novel unfolds in the decadent shadows of Europe's great cities, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna—a world in which the boundaries of class, religion, and sexuality are bold but surprisingly porous.

To my knowledge, the EU has an embargo against all of Syria in regards to weapons, so France sending weapons to rebels would indeed by a breaking of that embargo.

As an European from a fairly ethnically homogenous country (= never really had to deal with minority identities) I'm often baffled at the amount of ethnic essentialism purporting to be answers to these questions.

""Asians"" repress their feelings, ""we"" are not storytellers...I mean, if that's your answer, it's not really a surprise that the roles assigned to Asian Americans are stereotypes, then, is it?
For an outsider it's difficult to understand the degree of significance racial identities holds in the US. Ta-Nehisi Coates took me a bit of the way, but I guess I'll never understand how a third-generation Asian American would feel somehow deeply connected to Korean or Thai cinema or why an African American would be *a priori* emotionally connected to Africa.

&gt;The UK has been bitching and moaning about the EU since forever, blaming it for everything they didn't like, making scenes and getting concessions at every step. You don't get to say: ""Fuck you! You're the devil! Go die in a fire! We're gone!"" and then turn around and say, ""But we're cool when it comes to the stuff that actually benefits us, right?""

I get that it's just hyperbole but its still a gross exaggeration of the situation here. 
I'm actually voting to stay in (as of the moment at least) but this attitude of 'if you don't like it, then fuck off' is a massive put off. We're all members of the EU, and while I'm certainly no fan of politicians, if they didn't try and get the best deal for their country then they'd be remiss. 

And please don't talk like the UK is the only country that has a problem with the status quo, maybe we've been the most vocal, but the idea that we're the only country that has a problem is as disingenuous as the people in the UK that think every problem can be solved by us leaving. ",t5_2qh4j,UKGB

I'd scrap D-day, though. The lack of heavy weapons on the Reichs side means we can do much better. How about landing in Denmark, or directly in Northwest Germany?

Because this would mean shorter supply lines, the western allies might actually Reach Berlin first this time. ""invading in winter"" jokes aside Russia is fucking huge, and not having access to Trains makes it a slow undertaking to push eastwards.

--------------------------------------
There is no way to hold the tide for long. tanks and machine guns are too big advantages. Armour will lower casualities by a lot, too.

1) This late in the war, I don't see what the Reich can do. Even when listening to your generals, it is too late for anything to turn it, especially considering the massive tech disadvantage

3) Grenades and mines would slow the allies down slightly, but it is not a viable counter for tanks and machine guns.

4: The Allied air force would still outnumber the luftwaffe, and because of their range, they can launch from Britain, which would be wise condidering the supply issues. Forward air bases will likely not be worth it with such an old school supply system.

5): This one is nasty. The allies will be almost defenseless against the luftwaffe, who will bomb Britain and everything else with impunity. It is doable, but would require massive fleets to keep the supply lanes safe and Heavy Investment in AA-weapons to keep the luftwaffe away. It would be slow, it would be bloody, but The allies still have absurd manufacturing advantages, and i would see them prevail sooner or later.  
The german ground troops are basically irrelevant in this scenario. It will be luftwaffe who does all the lifting here.

------------------------------------
What do you mean about 2)?  
Do the rest of europe lose their guns and vehicles as well. or do they not? France and czechoslovakia had some of the worlds best tanks at the start of WW2, and czechoslovakia made lots of tanks for the nazi forces. not sure about them, but France had a large, modern army, at the start of the war, Germany basically defeated them through near-suicidal reclessness and risktaking, combined with a French millitary who did not get good enough orders to take advantage of this.

This split he’s slightly above average at 24.9, but his damage share has risen drastically, despite his KDA falling from 10.7 to 4.3. Fnatic’s problems are pretty clearly demonstrated just looking at Rekkles’s stats.

This is a prime example of why the stats you are using are just stupid.

It's not like suddenly Rekkles is getting more gold or that he suddenly realised how to CS properly. Same, goes for the DMG % rising. First of all in this meta ADCs have a higher % damage dealt, then you take into consideration that Rekkles was the 3rd carry for Fnatic(sometimes 2nd) now he is always either 1st or 2nd priority carry and top lane is playing mostly tanks as opposed to huni playing mainly carry champions.

""drastically increase damage deal and gold share; last split he was last in team gold share"" . He was already putting up the numbers last split and was 2nd on damage dealt just 10 DPM below Hjarnan. And, just fyi even with the lowest gold %, he had the most gold out of any ADC in EU. He still had the most EGPM even by being last in in gold %. That's why the stats you are using are just not optimal. Either use both so that it actually means something or use only the DPM and EGPM. Team % DMG means nothing without seeing DPM also and you've included both, why would you decide against it for the gold? ",t5_2rfxx,

 I could have conflated the situation in [Marseilles](http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/214086/french-city-40-muslim-population-most-dangerous-daniel-greenfield) with France in general. Mea Culpa 

Regardless my point still stands simply 

&gt;A nation is an extended family of people with similar genetic heritage and a common language and culture, a tribe but larger,

Its possible that European immigrants who are genetic kin could over long periods of time, maybe a century or so become French but non Europeans fail the genetic requirement and Muslims mostly the genetic  (some are European) and always the cultural one. They are mostly not compatible with Western values. Even if they assimilate to a degree , we don't gain much of  anything of value for it. I'm not seeing huge numbers of Nobel Laureates  or really anything that could not be done as well  by the locals. Immigration flunks costs benefit analysis 

In any case whats wrong with France for French, Africa for Africans (divided by ethnic origin)Portugal for Portuguese , Spain for Spaniards and so on anyway ? 

This builds peace, actual diversity instead of an enforced mono-culture and allows healthy homogeneity.

The people pushing immigration  are mostly just sick and obsessed with money and manipulating peoples lives and at bets they create a gulag-shopping mall society. Its a sort of nation scale case of [Munchhausen by Proxy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchausen_syndrome_by_proxy)

Nobody needs what they peddling and if they and the well meaning ""refuges relief"" morons were made to shove off, everyone's lives would be better and safer.

 Now before the racciist chants start, race hate isn't what this about. Hate is trying to make someone into you or to destroy them in some other way.  

I don't want that. I find many cultures and races and such quite interesting and worth of respect in their own lands and contexts or as visitors when reasonable.  
 
 Simply, people ought to be allowed their own nations among their own people and their leaders more than anyone ought to be supporting this 

Clearly they aren't and they need to be doing that  before more  people get hurt and have have dozens of Charlie Hebedo's or  Bataclan tragedies. ",t5_2qh3l,

From there originates the paradox mindset of not being really part of anything and being part of nordic states. Other Nordics don't really see finns as part of their family, as fellow Nordics. I think there is this collective shame of our roots, and we're pretty much incapable of feeling unity with, nor otherwise reach our past in emotional level.

Swedish immigrants started developing the area where we now live into a nation, but the division was harsh and hostile. Later, Russians took over the land and once again the original people (now with slight mixture of nordic genes) were depressed by foreign occupation.

The fabrication of collective cultural and national identity started here and it went on in fast pace up until the nineties and stopped at the EU-membership. Since then division inside the nation has been waking up again, as the country has been robbed from its collective accomplishments by it's political and business elite in the past 20 years.

Finns are one of the most youngest western countries with very short history and a very artificial cultural identity.

So if you ask a Finn about his or her cultural identity, you'll get an answer thats a lie. He or she simply does not know. There may be desires belonging to the admirable collective of Nordic nations or maybe even foregone conclusions that we're Western Europeans, but we're not. 

We are primarily our own nation, a very recent social experiment with lots of good intentions originating from self loathing and shame. We're Finns.",t5_2qlq3,

My fiance is white and I'm black and we live in Europe. We get lots of dirty looks from people. Lots is a subjective term  of course but in my books, one dirty look is one too many. We've also had people loudly whispering stuff that we were clearly meant to hear. So I understand your situation.


How do we deal with it? We don't.

As you pointed out, people backtrack and get defensive.

So what do we do? We go about our business giving no fucks to negative energy. Literally just let it roll off your back. Don't let strangers stop you from dining out with your father or going shopping with him. So what if they whisper or stare? They're wasting their breath and you have no reason to focus on how they are reacting to you.

My advice is if it's random people on the street staring, ignore them. It's background noise. What matters are the father daughter moments you're sharing with your father in that instant. If people providing you a service are giving you weird looks, you ask them if there is a problem. If they say no then you say good, and move on. 

You do not owe it to the world to explain or justify your interactions to the world.

People get looked at for being really tall, really fat, really skinny, for being ugly, for being beautiful, for having a disability, for their fashion choice, for being different. That kind of unwanted, often misguided attention isn't going to stop. So don't let it hold you back. If you let it bother you, you and your father are the only ones that get hurt. Everyone else forgets about you after 2 minutes. You just have to avert those judgemental looks without breaking your stride or letting it affect your mood.

You and your father have a good relationship. He went to great lengths to have you in his life. You've suffered great losses together and you support each other. That is beautiful and something to take pride in. Don't let passers by detract from that. You have a great father, don't hold back from making the most of it ;-)

Before i was lukewarm about IP because I feared that there would always be an avenue in ancapistan for trademark law.  Someone convinced me otherwise, I'll try to reiterate what that person said.

My basic assertion was that trade secrets could never be taken away.  This seems to be a natural consequence of either contract law or privacy, depending on your liking.  My further assertion was that trademarks tend to arise from fraud litigation.  I believe the first instances of IP in the western world were ""trademark litigation"" through tradesmans guilds in europe.  Basically some glass blower was selling superior product for maybe 3X regular pricing.  A fraudster came along and would stamp the superior glassblowers stamp (counterfeit) on his inferior glass and sell it as such.  The original glassblower was given recourse.

So, this being an iteration of fraud litigation, it would seem there is some reasoning behind asserting trademark law would exist in ancapistan, if not codified into law, at least in practice.  Further I asserted that this is a slippery slope as trademark is much more clearly IP than trade secret.  For example, even the barcode is a trademark.  If something like that which is more theoretically an idea (closer to patents) than a brand can be covered by trademark law, then why couldn't all patents be considered trademark?  If ancapistan allowed for trademark litigation but not patent litigation it would seem an easy leap.

So that was my basic fear about why IP might be an inevitability.  Particularly if ancaps were as afraid of disregarding property rights as they always seem to be.  Though many don't disregard the inherent violence in property claims, intellectual or physical.

Now what this other redditor was saying was that trademark is not necessary as law to litigate the fraud that trademark litigation, as I had framed it.  That is to say, fraud is ""illegal"" even in ancapistan.  You can't sell things that aren't yours and call the money you ""make"" yours.  It is stolen and the victim has recourse from you before they have a claim to the property you pretended to sell.  Likewise if you sell someone a 1oz gold piece which is actually hollowed out and filled with something else, then unless you had sneakily contracted away any liability, they would have recourse to get the same, their money back, or a replacement by your hand.

In this way, if someone was actually tricked into buying something unknowingly, that is they buy a NukaCola bottle from me thinking it is CocaCola, then they have recourse if I were unfair about being obvious it is not CocaCola they are buying.  This does not mean we need CocaCola to have rights over the term CocaCola.  It is the act of fraud and impersonating an other that I am taking part in that is litigious.  In this way we make room for parody and art that utilizes things that are otherwise trademarked or brand names without fearing that the ""owner"" will call the new thing his because he ""owns"" the brand.  Further this ""protects"" all things like information that is derivative (say the reddit scandal over /u/NIGRIPLEASE thinking she owns a reddit community that is about her as a person and their user content) without having to create an explicit protected class.",t5_3cct3,squidward

The error is attributing ""70% of all EU directives"" (EEA) in that time frame = ""70% of all EU Legislative acts.""

&gt;*However, the report then goes on to observe that EU had 7,720 current regulations, whereas the EEA Agreement comprised 1,349 applicable regulations, approximately 17.5 percent of the EU regulations. When both were taken together (directives and regulations) – 2,718 adopted by the EEA compared with 9,685 in the EU EU acquis, amounting to about 28 percent.*

&gt;*Interestingly, when the comparison is made on the same basis that we have used (with 24,061 EU legislative acts), the actual percent comes to 11 percent – a far cry from the ""three-quarters"" claimed in the introduction. This persistent myth has been [widely discredited](http://www.aecr.eu/less-than-10-of-norways-laws-emanate-from-brussels/).*

So it's changing regulations and directives into ""all EU legislative acts""

ie:-

* Regulations: 1,349 EEA : 7,720 EU  = 17.5%
* Regulations and Directives: 2,718 EEA : 9,685 EU (regulations and directives) = 28%
* Full Legislative Acts: 4,957 EEA : 23,076 EU (full legislative acts) = 21% 
* Full Adoption Rate EEA : EU = 9-11% (see below for 9% workings for that time series)

&gt;*The study found that, annually, the EU adopts about ten times as many laws as are introduces in Norway through the EEA Agreement. During the period 2000-2013, a total of 4,724 acts were incorporated into the EEA Agreement. Over the same period, the EU simultaneously adopted 52,183 directives, regulations and other legal instruments. Only 9.05 percent of the new EU laws were thus incorporated into the EEA Agreement.*

Some people can't grasp or pretend not to grasp that. ""Dutch"" can be used both for the nationality and the ethnicity. When people say these people weren't Dutch they mean they weren't ethnically/culturally Dutch, which is true enough. 

Some Western Europeans subscribe to the idea that citizenship is all that's needed for ethnicity. Which is stupid as self-identification, ancestry, cultural background matter much more. In America where everybody is 1/8 this and 2/9 that nationality may be the strongest point of identification, but not so among populations with a homogeneous ancestry.

Eastern Europe is much different, everyone there accepts that culture and ancestry are intrinsic parts of ethnicity, and are often called racist for it. The reality is that there's no national culture, and that the different ethnic groups within a country carry their own cultures. I'm Jewish in Bulgaria (Sephardic, which is distinct from Ashkenazi and Romaniote Jews, let alone Bulgarians), and I don't represent Bulgarian culture, nor do ethnic Bulgarians represent my culture. That's perfectly fine as long as people respect their differences, and they mostly do here.

I doubt that even the gym maniacs and people practicing regular sports would be able to oppose those savages.

You don't get to do emotionally charged speeches, you don't get to speek your mind and expect no consequences. 

The principal European vice is pride. When others talk about the EU being bad the powers that be can choose not to listen, but you don't have that option. 

People have been listening to your politicians running on platforms that boil down to sticking it to the rest of us. Others do it too. No one cares.

for the most part pretty accurate predictions imo, with a few that I disagree with a lot:

puCK (20%) VS MarineLorD (80%) - I don't think many people are aware how good puck has gotten in lotv. He's never been able to crush the live tournaments, but he's been crushing the KR ladder with 250+ ping maintaining top16 gm. I'd say more like 45-55 in favor of marinelord.

HuK (75%) VS PiG (25%) - I think this comes down to who has been practicing more lately, which im unaware of. Neither have been dominate foreigners in lotv, but I think you might underestimate how solid pig is when he's in good form. Id give this matchup like 60-40 in favor of huk.

MaNa (45%) VS PiLiPiLi (55%) - This one probably confuses me the most. Did PiLi do something incredible that I missed recently? Mana had been streaming consistently until I think a few weeks ago so he could hide his builds. Mana hasn't been crushing koreans or anything but I still think he's top 5 eu protoss. PiLi's live tournament results are almost non-existent while Mana's have been exceptional. I'd give this one to Mana 75-25

Kelazhur (20%) VS Neeb (80%) - Neeb has been a monster in lotv, but the same can be said about Kelazhur lately. Neeb is still favored, but I think it's more like 60-40.",t5_2qpp6,

Tell me where I said anything close to that. I didn't make excuses for what either of these people did. In fact, I am quite disappointed whenever I hear a story of domestic violence because I grew up in a house hold with plenty of it. It doesn't matter if it happened once or a thousand times; it's still wrong. 

&gt; I wonder why that is... What race are you by the way? I'm German so you can't claim people of European descent aren't white. 

I have no idea what you are trying to say here. It doesn't matter what race I am. In my original comment, I was trying to explain why I thought your analogy was odd by pointing out the difference in the time eras where they took place (as well as trying to learn more about the situation myself).

And not because of American exceptionalism (well, maybe a little), but because western civilization as a whole is actually under siege and just like we're all falling like dominoes at the same time, maybe we can all begin to reverse the domino effect.  All of our countries are waking up to some extent, but there's no precedent.  One country, one man defying all of the odds, being bombastic and unapologetic and calling the EU crisis exactly what it is could cause a domino effect in the exact opposite direction.

I'd like to believe we'd come to our western allies aid as well (AFTER they take care of their own Merkel's and such) even though I am firm nationalist, western civilization has to stick together.  If we can start a revolution here, maybe it spreads.  We can get our power back and tell the establishment, the globalists and the economic migrants to get fucked.  The word racism has no meaning anymore.  The media and their zombie horde may be having their time now, but eventually we will develop armor and take back what's ours.

Między innymi to, że Unia Europejska jest bytem wspierającym demokrację, PiS i Orban w jasny sposób od demokracji ochodzą. Nie chcemy być w Unii, to nie, tylko dlaczego niemieccy podatnicy w takim razie na nas muszą bulić?

&gt; Soros przeznaczyl 150 milionow Euro (nie jestem pewien jaka waluta) na walke na rzecz demokracji. 

Między innymi efektami Fundacji Batorego było Partnerstwo Wschodnie, reformy w Mołdawii i na Ukrainie. 150 milionów złotych otrzymał chyba program SPLOT, wspierający lokalne NGO, to są też ""dofinansowania unijne"" dla spółdzielni i kooperatyw.

&gt;Ciekawe czy Niemieccy obywatele np. maja swiadomosc tego co robi CIA na terenie ich kraju :)

Nie. I my też nie mamy. I nie uważam, żeby proatlantycki PiS specjalnie dążył do ograniczenia amerykańskich wpływów w Polsce.

Freedom of expression is perfectly fine, the entire country was full of huge sarcastic anti-Orban/Fidesz billboards and none of them got taken down. We are free to protest, no police brutality ( the leftists used a lot of police brutality during protests, but they are the ones crying that Orban is destroying muh democracy and liberal values ). You can say anything, and get any news you want. From far-right newspapers and news portals to liberal-leftist ones, we have a lot, and they are not restricted at all. Yes, the state TV is propaganda, but this applies to most countries.

Quando você traga um cigarro você sente o pulmão ""encher"" de um jeito diferente de respirar, e para algumas pessoas dá uma caidinha na pressão. Eu acho essa queda na pressão péssima, mas há quem goste.

Parei de fumar em casa porque percebi que deixava minha boca com uma sensação de ""suja"" e por isso eu sempre que fumava precisava beber alguma coisa, sorte minha que minha opção era água, diferente do meu irmão que ainda fuma tomando refrigerante e virou uma bola. Além dessa sensação da boca seca, sempre acordava com um pigarro nojento no dia seguinte. Mas acima destas coisas negativas o pior de tudo é que percebi que não estava tirando nada de positivo em fumar sozinho em casa, era só uma forma de prevenir o tédio. Eu pegava um cigarro e assistia um vídeo no youtube (de 8 minutos ou mais, que é o tempo que eu levava para fumar)

Originally published in Romanian in 1933, this semiautobiographical novel by the world renowned scholar Mircea Eliade details the passionate awakenings of Alain, an ambitious young French engineer flush with colonial pride and prejudice and full of a European fascination with the mysterious subcontinent.

Lol. 

I've spent years in Europe, they are just as addicted to cars as Americans. Just smaller ones. 

Germans, Italians, French, etc, all mostly drive to the store. The few exceptions would be in the major cities and they have to shop every day because they have no way to transport their goods other than on foot. There is a reason half the people you see in Paris are walking around with a loaf of bread. They just shopped for food.",t5_2t7no,

Yes the UK will continue with numerous collaboration programs with the EU and of course has it's own domestic law and other international agreements. But it's important to establish the difference between the political union and the single market:-

&gt;*So whilst it might only be 21% of specific legislation because of the EEA, it will be much, much more because of all the agreements (and how many of the other 79% they implement anyway because different regulations across borders is a trade barrier is another matter).*

Irrespective that's not the focus:-

1. Comparing like for like to produce a useful comparative legal figure avoids unwarranted scaremongering from Pro-EU liars.
2. Highlighting the Single Market acquis legislation specifically which is mainly technical standards which is important to trade and that is what is highly relevant to the UK both to access the single market AND for global trade. The Political Union legislation is embryonic with respect to A Fundamental Law of the European Union which is something the UK will never likely join.
3. It makes it clearer: The legislation is equivalent to the units in the argument for or against EU Membership. Combining domestic law and EU law is a lot of law to bear for the UK. Replicating political and other legal intricacies as well as additional layers to other global and international law has negative effects for sound policy making by our own political institutions.
4. Secondly these ""units"" are important for considering the full impact of return of policy control in various such areas as Fisheries, Agriculture, Environment and Energy and so on. It's ultimately a way of measuring policy control in the EU vs not in the EU and on the road to ever closer union as per the Treaties. Hence policy legislation in tandem with execution for more effective policies for the UK's own competencies in an increasingly globalized world and hence origin of legislation ""above the nation"" is a positive realignment for the UK's politics.

As said, on leaving the UK will adopt 100%. But over time that gives large scope to modify, remove, update according to global standards and separating the technical provisions from the political agendas of the EU, which I think in  nutshell is a good thing in itself, given so many politicians who are Pro-EU enact a Great Deception over this reading of EU Treaties, the rules we were signed up to and are expected to ""go along with"".

Eles têm cerca de 50 mil vistos para dar todos os anos então dos milhões de pessoas que se inscrevem em Outubro, são escolhidos cerca de 120 mil aleatoriamente por um software.

Em Abril/Maio (se não me engano) saem os resultados. Vais ao site consultar e se tiveres ganho vês uma mensagem do género: ""you have been selected for further processing in the visa diversity lottery (...)"". Tecnicamente o que se ganha é um slot para de pedir o Green Card porque dos 125 mil só 50 recebem mesmo. Há pessoas que desistem, outras são desqualificadas.

Depois desta mensagem tens uma longa espera pela frente. De setembro a agosto do ano seguinte eles começam a agendar entrevistas nos consulados pelo mundo fora. São por ordem do número que te calhou na lotaria. Eu só fui em Junho do ano seguinte. Há pessoas que nem sequer chegam a ser entrevistadas se lhes tiver saído um número muito alto, pode acontecer preencherem a quota de vistos para aquele país antes de chegar o número deles.

Até à entrevista tens de preparar toda a documentação que pedem (é mesmo muita), passar o background check das

most countries disconnected their universities and pro-sport ages ago. their leagues have divisions. if you play sport - you play sport, schools have nothing to do with it.

i don't even know how to respond to it. of course teams in amateur and semi-amateur teams pay next to nothing, it's mostly recreation, like amateur leagues in USA, but obviously you are missing professional divisions.

NATO keeps European nations in line with one another while also protecting them from outside threats, meaning that nations can focus primarily on themselves without having to worry about protecting their own borders.
Most of those governments, especially Western European governments, built their current systems with massive loans from the US under the Marshall Plan.

Breaking news - Marshall plan money ran out decades ago, Europe is running on its own money now. Germany has primary surplus, despite being a big country (80 million people), with ""free"" healthcare and low cost of education. US's significantly larger military contribution surely has easened the burden on EU's budgets, but again, we already have a much larger military budget combined, compared to our only relevant rival - Russia. 

&gt;European politics have always been dominated by centralized authority structures, which are reviled in the US for entirely valid reasons
Compared to the US, each nation is ridiculously monoethnic and homogeneous, and many of them are extremely small. The drive between Paris and London is shorter than the drive between Houston and Dallas (which is in the same region of the same state), and the Greater Houston Area has almost as many people as the entire country of Sweden. Texas is also nearly three times the size of Great Britain in land area, and yet has less than half the total population spread out across a very wide area, meaning resources are more dispersed and more difficult to consolidate. Combine with the diversity of political climates and circumstances as well as the radical differences in demographics in different states, it's going to be extremely difficult to attempt to compare national politics to much more centralized and unified systems in any fair way.

Are you Africa or something? Besides the couple million people that live in the middle of nowhere (not that we don't have millions of people living in geographically disadvantageous regions - Alps, Iberia, various islands), you have most of your population located either at the East Coast, or West Coast, packed tightly into megalopolises that developed (south of New York and east of Los Angeles are great examples). If you tax per capita, then provide x services per capita, that won't be significantly affected if you have a 5 race community, a two race community, 10 political landscapes or 1 political landscape. You severly underestimate the power that your governmental institutions possess, while comically inflating the difference of established (de)centralisation between EU and the US.

&gt;European nations continuously benefit from the ruthless exploitation of many nations (including those in Latin America and the Caribbean) even decades after the end of Colonialism, and have generations of accrued wealth because they took that wealth from other parts of the world at the point of a sword. Even nations that did not directly participate in colonialism still benefit indirectly by centuries of doing business with/raiding those who did, and establishing lines of trade and socio-political traditions in a similar manner. The United States is significantly newer, and while also doing business in Africa and South America, never had the centuries of ruthless exploitation (nor the desire) to subjugate other nations and conquer territories to feed their political machine, growing their wealth beyond what it naturally would have been.
Many European nations still cling to the remnants of royalty. Even though they are almost completely neutered politically, the fact remains that they still recognize entrenched societal elitism. This type of thinking is anathema in the US.

Haha, its not like the US didn't have its significant share of colonialism and neocolonialism (corporational one), which contributes to international inequalities. But guess what - any bonuses that came from the colonies, were burned up in the last 50 years since the vast majority of colonies (which Germany, Italy, Scandinavia didn't possess, mind you) became independent. Its not like Merkel goes into a large treasury depot and takes another box of golden necklaces to pay the ""german socialism"" with.

&gt;The United States has nearly 330 million people in it, living in radically different political and social environments. Political and cultural norms vary widely across the nation, to the point where different states sometimes feel culturally closer to other countries than a different specific state (Texas feels culturally closer to Mexico than it does to Maine, for example), and have different histories with other cultures due to the nature of those who settled each region (and the fact that they were largely different from one another).

So does Europe. Yet Europe, from Portugal to Poland, from Finland to Slovenia, has sustainable low-cost healthcare and education available for each and every one of its residents. That's over 400 million people living in countries with affordable Healthcare and education.

Unless that two year period is extended by agreement (and the UK would probably have to buy that agreement with concessions), then at the end of it no agreement means quite simply that the UK is out of the EU with no arrangements - in the interim, on the other hand, the UK will have to continue to implement all EU law without having a say in it.

""*You will be able to freely create Events, which will be easy to participate in with friends through the party. In addition, friends are notified, even during gameplay, if a event has started.*"" (Not too sure about this sentence)

This looks like the Events menu, with two new tabs added on the left. The first one could be *Now Playing* or *Invited Events* or something. The second one is most definitely to Create an event.

http://imgur.com/J9hB6by
As you can see, the party layout has been slightly altered. Invite/join is now at the top and a new option has been added which I presume to be for quickly seeing your friends' events that are joinable at the moment.

http://imgur.com/YiG3s0X This looks to be the details menu of an event created by a friend.

http://imgur.com/CHeE7py http://imgur.com/eaC09my This is definitely the menu for creating an event. You can set a name, description, date and time, a game title I presume and what looks to be selected participants.

http://imgur.com/4tILBom I assume this text says something similar to: ""Do you want to participate in this event?""

# Notifications

http://imgur.com/RWndd9B ""*You will receive a Notification when a friend comes online. Also, when you want to enjoy playing alone, it enables the setting to show to other users as offline.*"" The friend online notification, pretty self-explanatory. Also notice the blue online status icon next to your profile picture and name.

That said, crime can still happen and you should employ common sense like hiding you valuables and avoiding potentially bad crowds.

&gt;Would I have to worry about walking around by myself/at night?

Absolutely not.

&gt;Is there any political unrest in the country?

There have been some protests related to the migrant crisis lately, but they haven't been violent so far. Avoid them if you happen to bump into them.

&gt;I'm going at the end of this month around Easter so is there some celebrations or stuff I should be aware of 

Easter (28th March) is a national holiday so you can expect many places to be shut down on that day.

&gt;Anyway what are some suggestions for Slovenia

You can find more suggestions elsewhere, but I'll just say this: Don't skip our caves! Škocjanske jame and Postonjska jama are a must see.

&gt;Food-wise, i cant eat pork or beef

Slovenian food is just a typical Central-European food with a few local dishes thrown in. It does tend to include a lot of pork and beef, but you shouldn't have any problems finding other kinds of meat.

&gt;Could I try getting around by public transportation if I don't have a car or is it best to stay just in Ljublijiana. 

Public transport in Ljubljana is good, elsewhere it depends on your destination. Buses are usually better than trains for moving around the country. All major sights can be reached by bus, so there's no need to stay in Ljubljana for 5 days (if I understood you correctly there).

&gt;Are there some useful phrases that are easy to learn that i can try to say to show more of an effort talking to locals?

Thank you = Hvala;
Please = Prosim;
Good day = Dober dan;
Good bye = Nasvidenje.

For example I live in Germany which isn't considered the best EU nation when it comes to connectivity. But still nearly everyone can get 12-16 mbit/s here (there are of course exceptions to this). I would dare to say that the majority off people are even able to get either 25 mbit/s via VDSL or  50 - 100 via cable.And like many nations we have plans to guarantee higher bandwidth as a default in the future (50 mbits by 2018 I think). Those are of course though only the speeds available and while the connections that user really have at the moment are on average much lower about 19% of all users in Germany have already more than 15mbit/s right now. In the US it's even 24%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds

It's clear to me that gamers who require a fast connection to even get the games will opt in above average to get a faster connection if available.

For my personal experience using various ISP over the years I never had problems with being throttled by the ISP's backbone and I download a lot of stuff that isn't cached by the ISP either. I think this us more of an US problem (ISP fucking with users to keep them from using competing services like Netflix). Mobile consumption is IMO a separate problem and I'm nations were data caps are common I doubt that mobile users use even 1080p that often.

But yeah, offering additional higher bandwidth option won't help everybody (I dare to say the majority of for example TB's audience though) but that is far from your original statement that there is little YouTube can do.

&gt; Not saying lower fidelity but considering it as part of the game design. For instance a game as fast as Dirty Bomb could get away with an art style that work suit itself better for video compression. Farcry for instance could benefit from well placed motion blur etc.
You will notice that footage of recorded video from the real world generally works much better with compression even if recorded at 60fps and shaking around wildly.

I agree that adding motion blur would help and it's a good option to offer in general IMO but many people really hate it. I still think changing the art style to allow better videos on YouTube is nonsense.

And if course real world footage can be less effected thanks to its natural motion / shutter blur, but I'm general I would say is even worse there thanks to more moving elements and stuff like noise. Just look at GoPro videos.  

From my personal experience transcoding movies, you need above 10 mbits for acceptable quality 1080p24. There is a reason Blu-ray uses up to I think 34mbits for the video alone.

Edit: This is a YouTube problem, no other than nut having 60hz until recently or only having 480p in the past (both included raising the bitrate). If YouTube wants games as the audience they should improve their services to be game friendly. I also don't understand why better video quality isn't available as part of the (still US only) YouTube Red subscription.",t5_2qhwp,

If this is correct then this should also apply to Swiss and Norway, both Non EU European countries!
EDIT: To clarify, Iceland is also a non EU country like Swiss and Norway, so the same tax issue remains.""~~

~~The link in the comment goes to this comment from another thread:~~

~~""Icelander here, I emailed Shen Ye.~~
~~""Tax is included, our courier will pre-pay import tax. But can’t guarantee there won’t be any additional duties or handling fees. Do let us know if there is""~~
~~From what I understand the VAT is included in the price and is not related to the European Union. However I am also worried Tollurinn(customs here) are gonna slap it on again but then we have this confirmation from Shen and I at least will fight it. Then there's the issue of the duties. If the Vive is classified as a computer screen there will not be any additional charges, but if, unlikely, it would be classified as a TV there would be additional charges. I am gonna be contacting tollinn later today, I'll update this afterward""~~

~~So basically what I said earlier. You give extra money to HTC and they give it to the toll people. Or how it seems to work is that HTC gives it to the courier and they give it to the toll people.~~

~~Hope this helped. Sorry if the formatting is a little on the terrible side, I'm at work and can't spend to much time on it.~~


Edit: Seems like people are going all over the place about this. It will all be cleared up within a few days. I'm confident that we won't have to pay anything extra, since that would be ludicrous, but if turns out that we have to pay extra, we can just cancel the order. Should be at least a month before they charge your card.

Edit2: Editing my posts, it seems that it does not work the way I was assuming or the way that follows logic. In another thread a guy from Switzerland had inquiries about the VAT and how it would work. Now it seems that we are paying Irish VAT of 23% and then we have to pay Norwegian MVA of 25% when it comes. But he has updated his post saying that if you want, and have a legit reason to remove the VAT the accountants at HTC will remove it from your order.

His last edit as I'm writing: ""** UPDATE 4 ** Got a call from HTC, they have agreed to pass the message to their accounting office regarding cancelation of the VAT. They told me that ANYNONE that wants (and has the legitimate right) to cancel the VAT should contact them. My order still stands, but the Irish VAT of 23% will be detaxed (we got taxes and duties of our own, thank you). Do not know when I will get the confirmation for the completion of detaxing, the ecommerce customer support employee did not have this info.""

&gt; The American institution of slavery is what defined the very concept of race for us.

&gt;I'm not saying that slavery is the only factor in what race means to Americans. 

Further, the distinctions you are drawing regarding race existed before slavery came to North America. As the African slave trade existed for nearly two hundred years before it was implemented in the American South. The perceptions of race you are referring were cultivated just as much on imperialistic delusions of racial superiority of the time. Which were not even specific to the Africans, but were applied to most non-Western, non-christian societies. The short list being Indians, Native Americans, Latin Americans, Africans, Chinese, and any other ""non-Christians"" ""races"" of the period. I think you've lost sight that ""Americans"" started as Europeans which had their own set of beliefs and biases before an ""American perspective"" ever existed. Making your narrative about racial conceptions in America being based on slavery both true and false.  Of course, slavery effected and still effects racial conceptions in America, but they certainly are not built upon them as some of those conceptions existed before America was even America.

Like sticking to the poor white man example, it could be argued that though he's underprivileged in many respects, he still has a luxury that his situation is not likely to be viewed as a consequence or reflection of his race, and he's not likely to face any ostricisation in his community specially because of it.

But in this context the theory is based on weighing up relative privilege. To call an impoverished man privileged because 'he's not likely to face any ostriciation' because of his race is absurd. It assumes non-white races *will always be ostricized for their race and/or assuming white races will never be.* Because as you noted, even if its 'not likely' he'd still be called privileged as if it could never happen. It's even more absurd as he is not at a level in society where that 'advantage' could be felt, and that 'advantage' even if it existed [we're being *very generous* to just assume it does de-facto] would be so insanely small, esp. compared to not being trapped in poverty. The context is that the man is potentially dying, or otherwise struggling with his life and teetering near homelessness, and people are pointing at him with academic theories and calling him privileged because he's white and so are many CEOs in America and therefore he must be privileged. 

But as you should well know, 'white' isn't really a meaningful term. By white they never specify, but likely mean White - Western - American. They don't mean White - European - Polish. They don't mean White - European - French or White - European - Russian. 

The issues are multiple. Not only does it actively punch down due to a lack of nuance, it assumes its own subjective validity without ever proving what it supposes. How can you possibly even know every possible non-legal societal advantage [that will only ever be recognized by certain individuals, not group-wide and therefore never universal in any case] or disadvantage across a massive geographical area? Even doing so in a smaller place like the UK would be insane, but this theory is usually applied to America. How could you possibly weigh them up accurately and compare them? How could you possibly apply whatever you found to all individuals, when your entire theory is supposedly based on collectivizing an entire sub-set of humanity into a group, therefore guaranteeing many people will significantly deviate from it even if collectivized you were correct. 

I mean it can't even manage to accurately weigh up which 'privileges' and 'oppressions' are better vs worse, so people with a straight face point can to homeless straight white men and say they are privileged, whilst [rich women in TedX talks speak of their oppressions and how a man cheating on them is patriarchy in action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oOevLDtPJo)

Content where you don't have to make the game into a second job (and WvW for that matter too).

The acid test of whether people actually like raiding, fractals etc. would be to equalise rewards against other content. But, we don't need to ask really what would happen if they did that do we? Some people it seems would bang their heads against a brick wall all day if they got a few more coppers from doing that, rather than play the best content that anyone can produce for less - after all that simply would not be ""efficient"" would it?

Also if Arenanet want to know what people who actually play games rather than farm them are looking for, they only need to look at the hype surrounding Black Desert right now. That is an open world sand box game with no raids or dungeons (not dissimilar to an open world like Tyria is/was). Now I'm not flying a flag for Black Desert as I fully expect the EU/NA publishers, DAUM, will screw it up (however decent the underlying game may or may not be), just like Trion did with Archeage. In fact they already made a good start at that with absurd cash shop pricing even before launch date.

P.S. Thanks for responding by the way!

It is much easier and non-controversial for the UK to take a position like Norway or Switzerland. What already exists is obviously precedented and thus more easily achieved.

For the UK to have trade access, without freedom of movement and with the ability to trade without restriction with everyone else will be by far the most resisted path. Maybe the EU will be forced to accept this but it would require force (at least political and economic). Trade blocks are rarely happy with groups saying ""we want access without compromise on our part, also we're going to trade with people you don't"". It allows third parties to bypass the customs zone through this special partner in the middle. Agreeing to do this effectively disbands the EU customs block.

The other thing completely missed in the debate is not having freedom of movement screws our services sector. Given this is far more important to the UK than finances, agriculture and manufacturing put together it seems like the one thing we wouldn't want to lose. Arguably the ideal trade agreement for the UK is no trade access but with freedom of movement rather than the other way around.

Honestly, if you want to go pro it's probably best to practice really really hard, and get in on the ground floor of a newer game. Overwatch seems like the most likely candidate for the next big FPS esports title. Getting from SE to a pro at this point in the game is unrealistic unless you're the most talented guy in the scene.

I explained it in another comment, but here's the TL;DR: when New Zealand was first discovered by Europeans, they introduced tons of invasive species, some of which were animals (cats, ferrets, pigs) that hunted or over consumed the local flora and fauna, some of which were plants (which, in their defense, are not typically invasive, such as potatoes and wheat) that either overtook the local flora or proved toxic to some of the local fauna with more narrow dietary ranges. 

In 1971, two previously-believed-to-be-extinct species (the Kiwi Finch and the Kiwi Marmot-- I know, we're really creative with our naming conventions) were discovered on an island off the coast from the main islands. The government passed a ton of legislation to make the main islands safe for these creatures again, and one of those pieces of legislation was a ban on personal gardens in order to remove harmful foodstuff. There is also a campaign (ongoing) to kill the heck out of stray cats and ferrets and the like. 

Anyway, the ban is draconian as hell, but the farmers have realized that it removed a significant amount of competition for them. It's quite expensive to ship anything to NZ given that it's kinda in the middle of nowhere, so it's worked out quite well for farmers, and they consistently pressure the government to maintain the ban, under the guise of protecting the wildlife. Nevermind that most of the species it would affect are dead and they just want an excuse to charge more for beets than they have any right to-- save the nature!",t5_2qh13,

Also note the other way: best observed with mechanoids, they still deal damage when dead, either by beam-weapon or ground-aoe.  

In either case, the damage is already done and accounted for, only the actual animation - including health bar update - is still playing.  

Other examples are multiple finishers flying and going on CD, but only one guy getting the kill's benefit and counter - the target was alive for all involved players, who might differ around 200 ms from each other (which is really observable).

I felt the exact same way.

However I do think there is a lack of self-concern in Japan (and similar East Asian Countries).

It feels like people are much easier swayed by group pressure, and there is also a certain amount of taking things for granted mentality.

As in, there is very little skepticism and standing up to authoritarian forces.

Japanese notice this as well, which reflects itself in usually right wing ideologies. So call post war loser mentality. Being pushed around, not speaking up and for the lack of a better expression ""having no balls"".

I talked to women in Japan and some of them mentioned how they have no interest in Japanese men, because they have no spine.

While it is certainly not a good representation of japanese culture in general. A lot of themes in Japanese pop culture like Anime/Manga and Visual Novels are about shutting up when injustice is happening because you don't want to disrupt the social order.

A strong hierarchical order is instilled from small on with Kohai and Senpai, Sensei and other honorifics and positions. 

As a highly anti-authoritarian person, these seem like very weak points of Japanese society, even though I enjoy the peace and quiet it has.

But it feels fabricated. People greet you, are nice to you and respect you, but they do it out of pressure and not necessarily because they think it is the right thing to do.

&gt;Methods and definition

&gt;Eurostat produces harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These
unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The
measurement is based on a harmonised source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).
Based on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:

  *  are without work;
  *  are available to start work within the next two weeks;
  * and have actively sought employment at some time during the  previous four weeks.

&gt;The unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.

&gt;The labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based
on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.
&gt;The youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the
same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth

The 3DS version adds a few silly features like figure collecting and streetpass functions (which just provides tokens for the figure collecting thing), but I don't honestly think anyone used those features a lot. They're entirely separate from the game, and sort of just tacked on at the end.

The main differences are in terms of graphics, but I honestly didn't mind the 3DS version at all. I really like it. I sort of prefer the 3DS graphics in a way because of my expectations of the two mediums (handheld vs. home console). I have no problem playing a handheld game with graphics like Xenoblade 3D, because the game itself is impressive for a 3DS game in terms of world size and content. However, on a home console, Xenoblade graphics feel outdated by now, and I've found that Wii games have this weird ""cloudy"" look on modern HDTVs. It might look better connected to a CRT TV, or maybe if you used component cables, but I don't have either option, so I'm stuck with the cloudiness of Wii games. 

Then there's price and availability. You can get typically get Xenoblade 3D anywhere from $30 - $35, and it'll almost always be available. For the Wii version, right now, your best bet is the [International versions they're selling on Amazon](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RNWUC4/ref=smi_ge_rl_btns1_setch?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=xenoblade%20chronicles&amp;pldnNewCustomer=1&amp;qid=1456844587&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;s=videogames&amp;sr=1-1) if you're in the US.

And they are bypassing already safe countries to impose upon only countries with the highest civic entitlements that only work with lower native population totals.

This is incredibly far from the truth. Refugees from Syria are very clearly refugees. Others, who try to apply for asylum but come from countries which are deemed ""secure"" are send back (though this is obviously a difficult process).

I invite you to speak to any of those refugees. The majority of refugees are young and males - but they didn't *leave* their families. They were *send* by their families. The route is very dangerous, tough and costly. They are also not ""bypassing already safe countries"" but many of them already stayed in ""safe countries"" for a while. E.g. the Syrian family that I'm helping in my free-time stayed in Jordan for two years. The majority of Syrian refugees found refuge in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. But they don't have the right to work in those countries and are second class citizens there (meaning they are subjected to extortion and profiteering in those countries). This family lived of their savings for two years in Lebanon but with no prospect of any future income because they aren't allowed to work and no end of the war in Syria in sight they decided to leave for Europe. 

&gt;The Kosovo war refugees were both predominantly family units and actual refugees. Not to mention they were exceptionally more similar culturally and socially, even (especially) the Muslim populations who fled their homes. There is no real comparison beyond a superficial wrapping of labels.

Of course you can compare it. The relative burden is completely comparable (number wise). I'm not trying to say that it will be easy but just because it's ""hard"" isn't an argument against it. The Afghan refugees (that fled Afghanistan after the Soviets left) that arrived in Germany 20+ years ago are now an integrated, very successful, valuable part of society - many of them were culturally as distant as the Syrians that now arrive in Germany. The number is now much larger, but we have also learned from the past on how to improve integration. I am sure that Germany will handle the refugee crisis. ",t5_2qh13,

On ""West"" side of things, you obviously have America and it's nearly empirical approach to geo-politics.  Europe doesn't do much of this at the moment, simply because they lack the power to do so.  England ran an empire that did just this, right up until WWII basically finished killing it off.  Europe as a whole did this basically from the time Columbus discovered the new world, until it was no longer possible for them. 

Meanwhile on the ""Eastern"" front, you've got Middle-Eastern countries spawning a lot of terrorism to try and impose, or at least punish other nations for not believing in, their religious beliefs.  Meanwhile China attempts to stop any internal thoughts don't line up with the governments beliefs, and would be more than happy to spread their influence and control, given the opportunity.

What Europe gained through colonialism during one time, was considered too small to be worth the trouble by the mid-20th century, that's why apart from France's and Portugal's colonial wars, which were more the consequence of political agenda, there was no great interest in preserving much of the colonies. They simply weren't giving out enough revenue to be bothered with. EU may not be a country, but most of its countries have managed to run ""free"" healthcare and education without going bankrupt.

There is a huge campaign of deceptive propaganda being waged all over Reddit. In the posts, in the voting, in the comments, and in the moderator groups.

Devout Muslims have infiltrated the moderator groups of several large subreddits, including those mentioned above and r/pics, r/Atheism, r/exMuslim and several others. They are using their position to censor news, self posts, and comments that are detrimental to the image of Islam and Muslims.

After you read this comment, Muslims will reply with questions and comments, saying that this is a conspiracy theory, and asking ""where is the proof"", as if definitive proof could be found about the identity of the users of an anonymous website.

The proof is all over this subreddit. Just look at the blatant censorship or r/Europe and r/WorldNews.

I'm going to start with the TL:DR version, which is Not Going To Happen, Stop Worrying.

The second, slightly longer DR version is - That's technically incorrect in that yes, it could happen.  However, given the time it will take for that to happen, if you're worried about that and not climate change, pollution, long-term damage caused by mountaintop removal mining, deforestation, the seemingly indefinite lifespan of plastic products, fossil fuel consumption with not enough work being done for replacements and so on, you've got your priorities way out of whack as all of those are going to be problems lllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnggg before those of European Descent are extinct (assuming those aren't the causes of said extinction)

Moving on...

You may recall a few years ago some ""news"" organizations (and I use the term loosely) reporting that Redheads were going extinct [and years before that, Blondes] and would all be gone by some shockingly short amount of time, something like by the 2200s or something, often attributing it to climate change and increased sunlight or some bullshit.

[Complete and utter poppycock](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/redhead-extinction.htm).  And that's a breakdown on fucking HowStuffWorks, which is about as scientifically sound as a 3rd grader's textbook.  Granted, that does rely on the premise that redheads will continue to fuck.  I'm pretty sure that's a solid premise.

You can also look at other groups that have or are facing extinctions, and look at what happened to them.  

First there's the Parlevar.  From what I'm seeing, the estimates on their numbers vary greatly (as in, 3 to 15 thousand), so I'm going to even overestimate it more and assume 20,000 existed at the time the British made contact.  As was often the case, diseases took the greatest toll before we get in to good ol' fashioned Colonialism took out the rest.  And even still, there are today people who can trace their ancestry to the Parlevar, though nothing today exists of their language and culture.

Next are the Native Americans or First Nations or Aboriginal Americans or, if you want to be accurate, we can list the tribe names.

Estimates for the pre-Columbus numbers there vary wildly too - you can find anywhere between 10 million or 100 million.  There aren't any universal figures for how hard diseases hit, but there are indications that many places had a 90% reduction in population, so even if we weaken that, we're still looking at something like a 40-60% reduction of population which is going to be devastating for a group as lots of knowledge and experience is going to be lost, not to mention the impossibility of future generations if enough children die (or later die due to there not being enough adults to care for them all).

A 40% reduction today can easily become a 100% reduction in a few generations.

We can look at other extinctions of human groups, but they all pretty much carry a common theme - disease takes out a sizable chunk of the population, leaving the civilization in chaos before an outside force overtakes it.

Extending that to White People.....

Depending on how racist your definition of White People is, it will vary between People With Predominately European Ancestry, or English and English Only [Fuck the Irish!].

I'm going with the first definition there.  Greek, Spanish, Scottish, Finnish - all white.


So, to start, we've got fantastic healthcare systems compared to earlier.  Pretty much every nation runs some CDC-comparable organization that tracks outbreaks and sets up quarantines and so on and, quite frankly, if worst came to worst, they'd have no problem literally sealing a city off and letting everyone inside it perish if it meant keeping the rest of the nation healthy.

You can look to the Ebola situations and how they were handled, too.  Disease is easy to spread, spread was almost nonexistent.  I know of one case in the US of it spreading, and that was locked down pretty quickly.

Given the ease of travel these days, even if we had a 40% reduction in population, populations would be able to move and rebuild far easier than the 1500s.  Right now, from almost anywhere on the planet, you can check traffic cams in California and determine that, yes, people live there.  While we'd have some breakdown, we wouldn't have total communication failure, so we'd communicate how well a place was doing and migrate around after the pandemic had ended, maybe before [which could cause problems admittedly]

Point being that, while I am not saying outbreak of disease isn't possible, I am saying that it's effects even with similar population decline would not be as harsh as in earlier centuries due to our increases in communications.

There's also the issue where, thanks to the British Empire, white people live goddamn everywhere.  You would need a global disease to affect all of the white population, and that would in turn affect all populations.  Outside of shitty sci-fi, there's no real way to develop a pathogen that only targets people with a particular ancestry.  Everyone would be in the same shit creek as white people.

Moving on from there...

You'd need an outside force to invade.  For Europe, no one nation is going to fall to an outside invader after a disease-driven population decline, as there are basically rules about that sort of thing at this point.  Same with the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and so on.  You'd pretty much have to weaken all of them at the same time to keep them from interfering and invade them all in a short timeframe (decade or two) so they could not recover via ""Uncle Sam's gonna pay YOU $10,000 a year to have a kid!"" or similar programs.  

So that's the historic methods.  They wouldn't exactly work in the modern age without being both deliberate and extremely obvious.

So what about a ""new"" method, either out-breeding or interbreeding?

The thing about families that have a lot of kids is.. they tend to be from places with high mortality rates and low quality of life and so on.  You have six kids in the hope that four of them make it to adult hood and those four can split the costs of keeping you comfortable in your old age.

That's not really the typical in Europe, Australia, The US, Canada, New Zealand, and so on.  Even families that migrate in and continue to have large number of children... those children tend to not have a large number of children, they tend to have the culturally expected number of the area.  

And for interbreeding... while interracial coupling isn't really seen as a big deal anymore, it's still greatly in the minority of couples.  Most people marry people with similar skin tones.  I don't really see that changing too much in the future, as even today there are plenty of nonwhite people who have dated outside of their group and ultimately reject it as they get tired of not being seen as an actual person, but a fetish object - ie, Sally stopped dating white guys because she's never a black **woman** to them, she's always a **black** woman.

So... yeah, my first **TL:DR**  - Don't worry, it's not going to happen.",t5_2xinb,
7,mcantrell,1456850813,d0ji13i,,0,t3_48fjn1,1460362918,,t3_48fjn1,7,0,False,False,KotakuInAction,"They're talking about pointers and text field sizes, alongside SJIS vs UTF8/Unicode/ASCII.

Pointers:

If the game is programmed in a certain way, it always looks at a certain spot in memory for a certain length for the dialogue text.  In this instance, you'd be limited to keeping the text fields the exact same.  You have to waste the rest of the text field sizes with empty space or null characters and they'd have to always, ALWAYS be the exact same size.

Except one of the first things a localization does is figure out how to modify these pointer tables.  And one of the main benefits an official localization has over a romhack team is that they'll have the help from the Japanese devteam to edit and rebuild this table on the fly.  It's one of the reasons the older a game is in Japan the less likely it is to get localized, because the devteam is increasingly less able to offer this support.

Text Field Sizes:

Assuming that we're not talking about a glorified rom hack being done by Treehouse, the next thing that comes up is the size of an individual text field.

The system is almost definitely not dynamically set up.  That is to say, if the text gets too big to display, it almost definitely does not automatically pause or something similar.  Going over this predefined size can cause the game to crash, or if the programmers were smart, it will scroll the text off the screen or otherwise have SOME kind of error handling.

As a thought experiment, think of a 140 character tweet.  Now take Lorem Ipsum:

&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
 
It's supposed to cut off at:

&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

So what happens when this hypothetical game sees the ""veniam, quis nostrud"" coming without pause?  In a perfect world it just scrolls the text past the top, or ignores it, or something similar.  In an unperfect world it tries to write off the bottom of the screen and crashes hard.

So what to do?  Well, game engines will be set up in one of two ways.  If they're an old 1980s game, the game displays Block 5134 then pauses, goes on to display Block 5135, and continues as such.  If they're a 1990s or beyond game, the game reads the text scanning for certain codes.  When it sees $#, for example, it might pause for user input dynamically before continuing on.  So editing the text for size would just involve making sure you include $# in the appropriate locations.

In short, yes, the text fields have a size.  But the first thing that a localization team does is figure out how to edit or work around this limitation.

Encoding:

Japanese text is typically encoded in Shift_JIS, games often use this or a variant of it to store the text.  This is changing towards UTF and other Unicode encoding systems, which encode Japanese as well as every other language in the world.

If it is Shift JIS this can't really easily be changed, although the font table can be -- you can replace the Kanji with symbols and letters that make things easier.  This is why some RPGs had symbols for Sword, Shield, Armor, White Magic, etc.

Now, the word density of Japanese (where 1 symbol can represent an entire word) vs English is a problem, but as mentioned before any editing of the game is going to entail changing the way the text flows to make sure these issues do not come up.

As an aside, another concern is usually the font itself.  Japanese fonts typically are monospace.  Almost any readable English font is not.  One of the first changes any localization does is setting up VWF support, if possible...  but that's another story.

Final Thoughts:

The comparison pictures of Japanese vs Treehouse Rewrite vs English Localization suggests that they might have just kept the exact same number of text fields and dummied out the ones their hack job didn't need.

To this end, their sin might not just be pushing their political agenda -- make no mistake, even with these potential constraints they are political activists -- but rank incompetence and sloth.

It might just be that we're not just looking at a bad localization -- but a fucking lazy amateurish one, too.",t5_33726,

What I'm trying to say is - if Germany would close it's borders, others would follow, and flow would slow to a trickle, if that. ",t5_2qh4j,MONT

Along with any other Korean team. He tends to think even mid-tier Koreans will shit on the rest of the world. Stuck in the past probably.

On another note, literally NOBODY predicted China would shit the bed so hard at worlds. Before October in 2015 if you asked anyone who knew anything about the LPL or just Chinese teams in past international events, nobody would say that they wouldn't make it out of groups. Every analyst thought LGD/EDG were a favorites for **at least** semifinals. 

C9 with the same lineup wasn't even supposed to go to worlds. Their Rush power up hasn't even been their greatest win condition, and no one has seen Hai play support.

I can't support his stance on Crumbz because I think he's extremely overrated. I don't even know how he got signed onto a new team (granted it was a challenger team). Alex Ich on the other hand was a phenomenal player when he played in the EU LCS. Its hard to gauge a player's skill when you haven't watched them play in years.  ",t5_2rfxx,rengar

Go back and look at the major newspapers and political books of the time.  War was impossible because it would mean economic suicide.  On the run up to World War Two everyone thought daylight bombing would do damage equivalent to nuclear war.  Yet over the cliff they went.

I hope with all my heart that you are right, and that cooler heads in China will prevail, but the Chinese military has been telling itself for a decade that war with the US is inevitable.  They are convinced that if they deliver a hard enough blow at the opening, backed up by area denial missile systems, that we will throw in the towel and surrender Asia to their domination.

What is totally fascinating is that this was the strategic conclusion of the Japanese military prior to World War Two as well.  And this kind of thinking could easily lead to another Pacific war.  Hopefully, if that dreadful prospect comes, it will be limited to a sea/air battle over the South China Sea.",t5_2qh13,

RUSH LIMBAUGH: Did you see what Bill Gates did? See what Bill Gates said? This is one of the craziest, nonsensical things I have ever in my life heard. I understand why he said it. But it is just over the top unbelievable. Bill Gates says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change. Bill Gates says that socialism is the only thing that can save us from climate change. The world's richest man, Bill Gates, has said that the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. While announcing his plan to spend $2 billion of his own money on green energy during an interview with The Atlantic, the founder of Microsoft called on fellow billionaires to help make the U.S. fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy.

[..]

[Gates] said, ""the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else."" China? China and the U.S. and Europe? Europe's being overrun at the moment and I doubt that they have much on the mind over there, other than self-preservation. But, nevertheless, CO2 emissions are a straw dog anyway. CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas, all of this is made up phony-baloney, good time rock-and-roller hoax material. Why is Bill Gates signing on to this? There is an explanation for this. But man, oh man, he has so signed on -- he goes out and makes these patently ridiculous statements? Let me share with you a theory that I have, ladies and gentlemen. It could be wrong. I think every person who has earned or has inherited or who has acquired, whatever manner, immense wealth is scared to death of losing it. The entrepreneur who slaves away and eventually hits the big payday, one of the first thoughts is, ""gosh I hope somebody doesn't come along and take this away from me."" And the fear manifests itself in the form of government. ""Gee, I hope they don't come up with a wealth tax. Gee, I hope they don't start confiscating everybody's money because they've so spent themselves into debt."" I mean these are ongoing, constant fears. ""Gee I hope the peasants with pitchforks leave me alone and don't storm my castle."" I don't care what it is, these super-wealthy people have a fear, or did at one time, of losing it -- having it taken away, have it taken from them. It is that belief of mine, in that theory, which I have come up with to explain why people like Gates and Buffett and a number of these other super billionaires talk like Marxist liberals all the time. It is to keep people away from their money. It is to send the message, hey we don't threaten you, leave me alone. I'm spending all my money on philanthropy, I'm giving money to AIDS, I'm giving money to Africa, I'm giving money to global warming, I'm giving money to this, I'm giving money to the arts, I'm giving money to support gay marriage and transgenders, leave me alone. It's about assuaging the fear that somebody's going to come for their money. It's about adopting a public persona that makes their wealth OK and the peasants with the pitchforks will leave them alone and not come for their money because they're good people and they care about people. Like Gates is building mosquito nets for malaria. You want to wipe out malaria? Bring back DDT.",t5_2qh1i,

TTIP doesn't seek to change standards, it seeks to do things like dual certification - where negotiators from each group go through their various regulations, see which ones are *different but functionally equivalent* (that is, one isn't empirically better than another) and say ""OK, in this area we'll accept your certification as long as you accept ours"".

As to the NHS, you can see there's [ample protection](http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/Health/Health-Committee-TTIP-correspondence.pdf) in this letter that Cecilia Malmstrom (dudette in charge of the whole TTIP thing) wrote to the House of Commons about how the NHS isn't going to change thanks to TTIP.",t5_2qhqb,australia

The illustrations really are wonderful (attention to detail, captured movement, realistic expressions), and the simple combination of white, black, grey and orange shades works surprisingly well. The illustrations notwithst...

Unfortunately not. Great games for sure ( Uncharted should be when its out to know) but don't exactly wreck them. That is not the reason for the massive difference.

This is a tacit admission that British voters can't be relied on to vote for things the left wants to do, and that the EU can be used to force things on them that they'd never vote for if they had full national sovereignty.

I don't understand this about the modern left; is their contempt for the British people and our country so great that they literally can't believe it could measure up to the EU (an organisation made up of countries with histories within memory of utter contempt for the rule of law, democracy and human rights, as well as genocidal slaughter from both extremes of the political spectrum.

You had me thinking I had a lapse of memory or something but you quoted someone else or something you intended to type, however true it may be though that wasn't my words.

The people being offended in this thread by a couple marrying under the guise of FSM is proof enough people care. And the whataboutism is the notion that you should expect European and American atheists to care just as much about Islam but our biggest threat tends not to be Islam yet you want to divert debate there; that's whataboutism.

Your last statement is also proof you care. You mention it being a private act yet people have an issue here, largely religious, with that ""private act"". To me, it's people getting married. It's a non-issue to me but the fact that people have an issue with it is troubling in itself and signifies the legacy of religious infestation in the populous. ",t5_2qh13,

Nominally fiction but more rightly called ""creative confessions,"" they told of the author's childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles.

They really need to look at more than latency. They need to look at packet loss, and determine who is wired or wireless. Basically add a flag for wired or wireless, then determine host based on that first. 

Or maybe better, do a quick packet loss test while loading the game. Send a bunch of UDP packets to a server in each region, and make sure the count lines up with what was sent. Keep track of it client side and allow the match making to use historical packet loss data for determining host reliability.

&gt;  Description book **It Can't Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis**:

&gt;  The only one of Sinclair Lewis's later novels to match the power of Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith, It Can't Happen Here is a cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America. Written during the Great Depression when America was largely oblivious to Hitler's aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political ...

&gt; Afro-Portuguese songwriter Sara Tavares was born in 1978 and brought up in Lisbon. Second-generation Portuguese of Cape Verdean descent, Sara was brought up by an elderly matriarch in her community after her father left for the States in search of a better life, her mother having traveled south in pursuit of the same ends. Sara showed great musical promise from a young age, a potential that was cultivated and bore fruit while Tavares was still in her teens. Winning the Endemol song contest Chuva de Estrelas, followed by a victory at the Portuguese Television Song Contest in 1994, earned Tavares a slot on the Eurovision Song Contest, all at the age of 16. Her winning song, ""Chamar a Musica,"" was featured on her debut single release, Sara Tavares &amp; Shout (1996), where Tavares mixed gospel and funk with her native Portuguese influences. Performing and writing songs in a mix of Portuguese, Crioulo, and English, Tavares spoke to her own lost generation of Cape Verdeans and Afro-European immigrants who searched to define their unique culture. Her sophomore effort, Mi Ma Bo, released by RCA in 1999, marked a noticeable change in direction toward Afro-pop. The record went gold in Portugal, announcing Tavares' arrival as a national star. After a five-year wait, eager fans were treated to Tavares' third album, released independently in 2006. On Balancê, Tavares penned all of the repertoire and added percussion to her list of credits, in addition to guitar and voice. Full of messages of hope and self-worth, Tavares' Balancê established her as one of the diaspora's most distinct and influential artistic voices.

Entry for Portugal

&gt; Performer: Sara Tavares

Song composer(s): João Carlos Mota Oliveira 

&gt; Sang in Position:  8
Final Position:  8
Total Points:  73

&gt; For the second consecutive time, Ireland hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, this time in its capital Dublin. Due to the fact that so many countries wished to participate in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union decided to adopt a relegation system. For the 1994 contest, it would mean that the seven countries that finished at the bottom of the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest were relegated and couldn't participate in the 1994 edition of the show. Instead, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia made their debut. However, Italy and Luxembourg withdrew voluntarily, so only the bottom five countries of the 1993 contest in Millstreet - Turkey, Slovenia, Israel, Denmark and Belgium - were relegated. That meant that the total amount of participating countries was 25, just as in the preceding year.

&gt; Poland's debut at the Eurovision Song Contest was very successful when their representative Edyta Gorniak came in second with 166 points. However, the Polish song was almost disqualified as Edyta sang her song To Nie Ja! half in English in one of the dress rehearsal which violated the rule that every entry had to be sung in the native language. Nevertheless, even the talented Gorniak wasn't even near to this year's winner, which once again, was Ireland.
About the winner

&gt; Never before in the history of the song contest, a country had won three times in a row. The Irish entrants Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan sang Rock 'n Roll Kids, which in the end was 60 points ahead of the runner-up and was the highest score ever at a Eurovision Song Contest to date. This overwhelming victory for Ireland would not be the last in this century, as just two years later in 1996, Ireland would win again.
Facts &amp; figures

&gt; The biggest commercial success of the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest was none of the songs though, but the interval act Riverdance. The Irish danc sensation went on to be a world famous stage show, which would be seen by millions of people all around the world. Read more on Last.fm.

But the way we see doctors, lawyers and engineers are different from how Americans see them. We don't see them as better than anyone else. We value artistic and non-scientific jobs, too, which is something that is not valued in US (and I'm not talking about being a Hollywood star, which I know is pretty much valued where you live).

I agree with you that many doctors can be scumbags (like any other professional). The problem with medicine is that if the person doesn't have integrity her/his job will be a HUGE stroke in their egos. They will easily become entitled, arrogant egomaniacs.

I am really glad its just a well kept ""secret"", and that most Indians or Chinese are more attracted to the glossy cultural hub of the world, no matter how fucked up healthcare and education system they have. Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway.. all of them seem like a place that dreams are made of.

&gt; they have much more refugee immigrants from middle east

See, apart from the bone chilling weather, that's my major concern. So far they have done a terrific job of transforming that region the closest representation of utopia a human being can imagine. But considering how a nearby war has managed to fuck up Syria/Iraq and then the recent infiltration of extremists in France and with resources replenishing in few decades and ME countries running out of oil, I am afraid of what impact it will have in the European countries in the long run. 

A place like Canada seems like a better/safer alternative in the long run, because it already has most of the perks you mentioned, and nothing dramatic going on nearby. What do you think?

No Brasil, imposto é visto como meios de pagar a estrutura do Estado, quando na verdade deveria ser um investimento da população para que o Estado cumpra os seus serviços. Uma tributação justa e bem pensada é onde se deveria focar e não em cobrir intermináveis rombos causados pela ação irresponsável que todos os governos brasileiros cometem.

Terceiro, a idéia do *supply-side* economics, vulgo *trickle down*, é falha desde o princípio e vem sido aplicada não só nos EUA, sob uma fachada 'neoliberal', mas também tem sido sistematicamente adotada no Brasil travestida de 'desenvolvimentismo'. Meu ponto é não há prosperidade duradoura que se baseie na idéia que a fortuna tem que *trickle down* em direção aos mais pobres. Prosperidade vem quando os pequenos podem produzir a sua fortuna, o que consequentemente reduz o poder relativo dos grandes. Por isso as políticas no Brasil, onde se contraditoriamente aceita que os seres iluminados do governo têm a resposta para tudo, e nos EUA, onde supostamente os bilionários gerariam prosperidade aumentando a oferta de emprego para todos, não funcionam. Essa conclusão deveria levar a uma reflexão quanto ao futuro das políticas públicas.

&gt; Há quem retrate o Estado como um agente mau, corrupto, que deveria interferir o mínimo possível, mas ao mesmo tempo exige, do próprio Estado, interferências como a criminalização do aborto ou a adoção da pena de morte.

Essa contradição é o que me irrita mais. Como alguém que defende intervenção mínima do Estado pede por criminalização do aborto e pena de morte é algo inconcebível para mim. O direito a vida e o livre-arbítrio são pedras fundamentais do liberalismo. Quando se fala liberdade sob o império da lei não está implícito que o Estado tem que regular o que cada um faz a si mesmo ou as escolhas que cada um faz. Diz respeito a vida em sociedade.

WW1 tactics had advanced far beyond the 1880s. (besides which, tactics from the 1880s were pretty modern anyway. Look at the Franco-Prussian war of only ten years before)
Soldiers didn't march in lines across no-man's-land willingly into machine-gun fire. The only times where they were ordered to walk and not run was when their advance was behind a creeping barrage of artillery fire, and running would put them in the path of their own sides shells. 

Finally, the Americans were actually pretty green when they first arrived in Europe. It was the Germans who had injected speed back into the war with their stormtrooper tactics, and had punched right through the trench lines and were heading for paris when a combination of starvation, economic ruin and ever-increasing allied presence forced them to sue for an armistice.

WW1 was not the Napoleonic Wars.

The trends of people wanting to move to places where they have a better chance to a good life existed long before current migration politics. The region between South Africa, Indonesia and Morocco has about 500 million people who wish to leave their countries for better places.

No, replacing a stock trigger box would be useless. No sniper rifle is good stock and all of them require extensive upgrades and tuning to perform well. You will be best off using an AEG for a bit as you find your preferred play style and learn the ins-and-outs of airsoft. If after a bit more experience you really want to be a sniper, go for it but make sure you understand how to tech and tune everything you purchase as a sniper.

Okay, protection. In the UK/Europe the most common protection is shooting glasses. In the US, because of both our love of litigation and higher FPS limits on average, full-seal eye protection is required at 99.9% of fields/arenas. Mesh eyepro is used sometimes, but they risk being dented/broken and BBs can send paint chips from the mesh into your eyes. On top of that, weaker BBs like .12s and even some .20s can shatter and send shards through the mesh. That said, a mesh mask is the best form of protection for your lower face where paint and BB shards won't so much damage, but a solid BB impact could cause a ton of $$$ worth of dentistry (or ruin your lovely complexion if your face is your money maker).

That depends on the stock AEG. A $60 umarex M16 from Dicks sporting goods is technically an AEG but even upgraded it's not worth it. On the flipside, a stock $325 Krytac doesn't really require anything besides regular maintanence. The cheapest AEGs worth it are the ~$150 G&amp;G Combat Machines and the CYMA Ak line models CM030 and higher. These will perform just fine stock for quite a while, or with minor QoL upgrades.

I'll add some more to this in a bit, or as a reply to any other question you ask.",t5_2qi2x,

Que se passerait-il sans ce paragraphe? Sans lui, toute industrie polluante (par exemple une usine faisant des rejets dans une rivière) devrait dédommager les personnes lésées. C'est ça le principe ""pollueur-payeur"". Et quand on y pense, c'est pas un mauvais principe: le pollueur est surement un des mieux placés pour évaluer les conséquences de ses rejets et pour faire le calcul des couts entre les dédommagement et une production plus propre.

Mais ok, ce paragraphe *semble* ajouter la possibilité de fournir des droits de pollution, de par exemple définir des rejets considérés comme normaux, même s'ils endommagent l'écosystème, sans garantir de dédommagement aux personnes lésées par la pollution. C'est, en effet, la création de ""droits de pollution"".

Et en plus de ça, je pense que c'est plus retors. Ce paragraphe est à mon avis volontairement flou. Ils ne précisent pas que l'atteinte doit être autorisée explicitement pour être non réparable. Note la formulation «autorisée par les lois, règlements et engagements internationaux de la France **ou** par un titre délivré pour leur application». L'obtention d'un titre n'est pas obligatoire. C'est quoi une atteinte autorisée par les lois? À mon avis l'astuce est là: c'est une atteinte qui n'est pas interdite. 

Avoir un accident en pleine mer, c'est pas interdit. La preuve: on peut acheter des assurances pour ça, l'état les reconnait, il est donc clair que avoir un accident en pleine mer fait partie des aléas autorisés par la loi dans le cadre de cette activité, ce qui implique que les atteintes écologiques qui en découlent sont légales.

C'est beau, c'est fin, et bravo aux associatifs et journalistes qui ont levé ce lièvre. 

Si on remplaçait le ""ou"" par un ""et"", ça donnerait au texte le sens qu'il semble avoir l'air et créerait un permis de polluer plus classique. Perso ça me semble le minimum mais ça me semblerait être le minimum pour une gouvernement qui prétend gouverner avec des voix écolo de supprimer ce deuxième paragraphe totalement.",t5_2qhjz,ZZZZZZhacker

Do you expect South Africans to peacefully exist during apartheid without resistance? 

There's a power dynamic here. One of an occupier, and one of the occupied. And it is a brutal occupation.

You know during the holocaust those living in the now Israel actually were highly critical of European Jews for failing to fight back. There are studies demonstrating that there would have been many less deaths has the Jewish leadership in Europe not worked with the Nazis in a lot of ways. We can see this in *Night* where they ignore Moshe's warnings, and the Jewish police rounding up members of the community, the unwillingness to leave when there was the opportunity.

That's part of the reason Israel's so militant now, ""never again"" and all that. Never again will they allow themselves to be subjected like that. Do you think it was at all good for the Jewish people to let this happen during the holocaust? I should hope not. 

So they've turned that into subjecting a different people. A people who were largely peaceful under occupation, but after 60+ years of occupation are turning towards more consistent violence because nothing's changed and this is what happens when you occupy a people for an extended period of time. Let alone what Israel's done. 

You're treating this like two nations at war, duking it out.

This is an occupying force and an occupied. Not a war. These are not equal or even comparable combatants. It is a mouse to a cat. 

You cannot ignore that. ",t5_2qh0u,

I am not worried about refugees and immigrants going to Europe as long they have their borders intact and allowing immigration voluntarily, but I am worried about middle east holding them as hostage, once the oil runs out, climate change hits and battle for resources and survival begin. Canada is so far away from the chaos in middle east, even the world's biggest nuclear bomb imploding wouldn't be heard over there.

All of the progressive places you mentioned are definitely something I admire a lot about USA, but they still are restricted by the center, and will take a long time to reach their aspirations. But as someone who aspires to work in the film business, I do find them more appealing than Canada. Being career driven and settling for an awesome life with no fucks given is a difficult choice to make.

The insecurity and identity crisis of Canadian Indians is very fascinating. On 1 hand they have a better life than most Indians would ever be able to achieve, on another hand they want there fair share in the spotlight and all the ""wealth"" being distributed. But even Scandinavian countries aren't that big on career or pop culture either. We can always leave them and go to U.K. for that. 

Btw, how long does it take for Canadian Indians to go from ""This is awesome"" to ""Awww Shucks. Should have settled in U.S."" according to you?

It's really easy to take a train from Paris to Brussels. Good food, lots of sightseeing. From Brussels, you can take another train to Bruges which is like a fairytale in a Disney movie. The train system is very easy and if you have a phone with a working GPS it's quite easy to get around to wherever you want to go. Bruges is small and can be easily walked from one end to the other in a couple hours. Some other cities in Belgium are also very beautiful and easily accessible by train, like Antwerp and Ghent. 

Simply walk to the train station and ask any train attendant selling tickets when the next train leaves for your destination of choice and which platform to stand on and he can sell you the tickets right then and there. There are tons of trains so I don't think you need to worry about purchasing tickets well in advance. 

From Belgium, another easy train ride would be to go to Amsterdam. Beautiful city with canal tours, anne frank house etc. 

Of the 4 trips I've taken to Europe, I was least impressed with London, as the food was just ok and I felt like it was just like any other big city in the US. They pretty much have all the same things you'd find in Seattle in my opinion. We spent a week in London, but I felt like 2 or 3 days would have been plenty to see what we wanted to see.

Unlike most people, I like the timers. It adds a huge gameplay constraint forcing sub-optimal strategies. That's the point, you can't make the best decision 100% of the time. If you can, there wouldn't be any challenge.  It adds to the feel you are genuinely fighting a guerrilla war. 

XCOM 2 doesn't have the depth LW had. There are a few OP combinations that make it too easy. Mimic beacon effectively guarantees that your soldiers wont be hit this round. 

A few of the class abilities just are not that good. Like Reaper, Reaper's only good if damage has been done to every single unit beforehand.  Compare that to the much more versatile rapid fire, and it really isn't a choice at that point. It should be a genuine choice.

There should also be multiple ways to effectively research. Autopsy's aren't nearly as important as they were before in EU. 

I have mixed feelings about the fact when you create a new weapon, it's available for everyone.  Doesn't make you feel the research crunch anymore.

There is a protestor area outside each venue where they can protest ""peacefully"". Some people want to be edgy and sneak into the rally to create drama among Trump and his supporters. Every rally the announcer tells the supporters to not engage and allow th protestors to be evacuated by security personnel. Some protestors like to intimidate the individual supporters nearby and it is the protestor's fault if knowing everything he goes in looking for a fight. If you are going to protest ""forcefully"" and push and shove the people who want to escort you then you are going to roughed up. I don't blame the protestor or the supporter. It is going to happen.

You have no idea how the federal government works otherwise you wouldn't ask the question regarding internment camps. The president cannot pass bills and laws without support from congress. There are checks and balances in the constitution for a reason. Also, executive actions are very limited with respect to what (social  policies they can enforce. USA immigration department already conducts visa interviews for many people wanting to come from places india, asia, europe etc. with a lot of muslim population. They are routinely processed based on the background checks and verification processes. This is happening currently. What Trump is opposed to is unrestricted entry of muslim syrian refugees when european and our own intelligence agencies have warned about ISIS operatives within the refugees. Check sources online and make your mind regarding this. His plan is to create safe zone in syria , establish peace through coalition with gulf states and russia eradicating ISIS. Then, It is much better to allow the syrians to elect their own government and aid them through rebuilding all the wartorn cities. It provides them livelihood and contains the terrorism situation. You are however free to believe whatever hitler comparisons that mainstream media pushes.

&gt;When U.S., French and British commentators reacted negatively to the bill, leading Danish politicians alleged that people weren't only misunderstanding the law but also the nature of the Danish welfare state. In a welfare state, they argued, everyone needs to use up their own resources first in order to receive benefits.

&gt;**Similar rules are indeed in place for Danish citizens** (although police officers do not search clothes and luggage).

The ""minimum amount exempt"" from your quote refers to the currently in-place law that [applies to all Danish citizens receiving welfare.](http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/empl_portal/SSRinEU/Your%20social%20security%20rights%20in%20Denmark_en.pdf) Assets under 20000 kroner total are allowed to be kept. Others must be sold or given to the state.

Relevant quote (page 28):

&gt;No assistance is granted if the applicant or his/her spouse own sufficient property to
cover their financial needs, including real property and movable assets. Any amount
up to DKK 10,000 (€ 1,260), for a married couple up to DKK 20,000 (€ 2,521), shall
not be taken into account.

Additionally, welfare recipients must participate in job retraining and accept job offers when given:

&gt;Recipients of social assistance (kontanthjælp) or starting allowance (starthjælp) must
accept appropriate offers to participate in activation measures or in any measure
aimed at improving the possibilities of the beneficiary or his/her partner to integrate in

There are those that believe that they do bring justice, justice being death, there are others that want to have justice brought against their enemies through other means than death.

I don't believe the bombing of civilian targets is ever right. Why should a child be sentenced to death for the actions of his father and mother? As rational people we shouldn't be so willing to kill innocents. 

&gt; Not much I can do about this. You think Trump is a psychopath, I think he's a pragmatist who is sick of pussyfooting around the issue. I believe that if you think Trump is going to setup deathsquads you're watching a bit too much fantasy television, I might be wrong. 

I don't believe he is a psychopath, i just believe he is not as smart as his supporters thinks he is. He is a very emotional man that lets his pride get the better of him, and he is quick to make a solution without looking at the options. A leader of the most powerful nation needs to have a cool head, especially in these times because how far does someone need to go with their ""say it like it is"" attitude until they get in trouble around the world. Choosing your words effectively is NOT pussyfooting around the issue, because cooperation and discussion solves problems. and to cooperate you need to be respectful to your peers, so someone who has no filter is going to offend someone. Trump is defiantly the type of person to go to China and make ""ching chong bing bong"" talk. 

&gt; you need to keep in mind we live in an incredibly liberal time, even the hardline conservatives come from things from an angle of equality and fairness.

But these are the same people who advocate carpet bombing before diplomacy, its a part of their world view. The Iran deal is something to be proud of, it is a solution to a problem that did not lead to bloodshed. If it was up honestly to the republicans Iran would be a smoldering waste.

&gt; Trump's media strategy is to never back down. This is the only way to deal with the modern media machine because it's obsessed with shaming tactics. Appologies don't lead to forgiveness, they lead to doubling down.

If Trump doesn't back down why did he have to say what he really meant if that wasn't what he really meant? If he does not back down then why did he not own his broader statement without having to clarify that he meant participant families? I'm just challenging this notion that he never backs down and is not playing the media's game. 

You can fight the media, and i am a supporter of it, but there are far more effective ways of doing it that both insults the media, doesn't pussyfoot around the issue AND doesn't make your candidate sound like an idiot.  

&gt; Just look at your own behavior. Trump clarified his statements and your response is to not believe him. What could Trump possibly do to escape your prejudice exactly? I'd imagine it would be to repeat the same empty universalist platitudes that have led to problems getting progressively worse.

I don't believe him because i don't think he really wanted to adjust his statement, but he had to because of how awful it is. Everyone says he is saying exactly what he means so when he says something how am i not suppose to take him at face value with his first statement?

As for my prejudices, it would be very hard for me to change them honestly, there is not much of anything that i can support with Trump. None of his policies i feel will solve any issue and will instead cause far more problems in the future. 

&gt; The border can't be discussed because it'll offend Mexicans, terrorism can't be discussed because it'll offend Muslims, 20% of men are now considered rapists and the 2% rape rate is evidence that the system is sexist because otherwise it'll offend women, suggesting that surgery might not be the best solution to gender disphoria makes you a monster.
&gt; When does this end? Your issue with Trump is that he's speaking about subjects that are impossible to talk about. There is no possible way to discuss these topics without triggering an avalanche of bullshit.

My issue is not with Trump speaking about those subjects but instead that his solutions to those subjects are wrong. I don't want those issues to be swept under the rug but that maybe, just maybe, Trump's plan to build a wall and make mexico pay for it or bombing a muslim's family is a tiny teensy bit racist. His supporters jump up and down saying he is not racist, showing photos of him with civil rights leaders and the likes, but when KKK grand wizards are endorsing you then there something to be worried about. I don't care if he is accepting those endorsements or not, but isn't the fact that they feel as though he is the candidate that speaks for them a little bit telling of his polices? 

There is a solution to all of those issues that can be brought to without succumbing to racist or sexist rhetoric. Many American's do actively blame Mexico and Mexicans for the boarder issue without even considering what they had done or are doing that is making the problem exponentially worse.

&gt; So when Trump said he wanted to bomb families how are we guaranteed that these families wont be included?
&gt; Because European countries, and Canada, are not hostile regions that cannot be accessed by it's countries military. Bombing non-hostile nations is ridiculous. The reason middle eastern countries are bombed is because the regions are hostile.

&gt; Obama already bombs families. Your issue seems purely about irrational feelings. The question you should ask yourself is why Trump being open about actions is more deplorable than Obama who does the same but talks nice.

You are assuming that i feel as though Obama is one who is infallible, no he is far from, but Trump wants to bomb more and kill more. Thats why i feel its more deplorable. Trump has the opportunity to end the bombings and lose of innocent life, but no he wants to do it more.",t5_3cr3o,

Most of the bad loans were securitized by private lenders, primarily investment banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, etc. (such investment banks were never subject to Glass-Steagall because they did not hold deposits), and other private finance firms like hedge funds. This is why those types of financial firms had the hardest time during the crisis.

Fannie and Freddie have limits on how ""low they can go"" in terms of issuing and securitizing sub-prime loans. In fact that is the definition of ""sub-prime"": generally speaking, it means loans that Fannie and Freddie will not buy to securitize. 

Where Fannie and Freddie got into trouble was that they bought a lot of the highly-rated private securities that the private banks and funds offered. So when it became clear that those securities were not actually worth rating highly, Fannie and Freddie lost a bunch of capital and had a liquidity crisis. (Which just means a bunch of their savings disappeared and all of sudden they were in danger of running out of money.)

One of the easiest-to-understand points of proof that Glass-Steagall repeal didn't cause the crisis is that Europe never had a similar regulation, yet they didn't cause a similar crisis.

Another point of proof is that firms that would have violated Glass-Steagall generally did OK during the crisis, while firms that did the worst would never have been covered by Glass-Steagall anyway.",t5_2sokd,

In the UK, barring the most remote rural areas, you can find multiple taxi company's that will travel to where you are, with at least one being situated within small villages themselves.

On to how we differ in our defining of 'suburbs'... you will find that, generally speaking, in the UK anywhere bordering an urban area attached to a city or large town will be classed as that. The general characteristics are obviously more greenery, better kept, rowed housing that is larger and more expensive than its urban counterpart. As you reach the outskirts of those suburbs (and by extension, the city), going into the countryside, as well as small villages or hamlets is what we class as rural. As I imagine you do too. So basically, when I say 'suburb' I mean the inhabited area between the outer urban areas (CBD is inner layer), and the farthest outskirts of a city or settlement. 

On to what you said about Europe, I hadn't thought that was the case in many places? I've travelled to a few places in France, Italy, Spain etc and it seems that, like here, the wealthier people still live further out (i could be wrong though as a few holidays here and there doesn't mean I'm a socio-economic expert on the region). In the UK especially. Our poorest live in inner city areas or in terraced housing which is usually situated just outside the urban sprawl. The wealthy &amp; the middle class live in the suburbs and in more rural villages. (This isn't accounting for the luxury inner city apartments etc)

Because the original argument was that it'd be cheaper to build new cities instead of retrofitting existing ones in order to deal with climate change?

&gt; Towns can simply be integrated into the new city.

Not if you want to design an efficient city from the ground up.

&gt; The original statement said there is no space for new cities in Europe. 

It did not. It stated that there wasn't a whole lot of undeveloped space. Which there isn't. 

In *theory* there's plenty of space. In practice, that space has limited availability and is too uniformly distributed to allow for vast new cities.

&gt;  I say you could easily build here

I'm pretty sure we can't, since it's not our territory. There also isn't even remotely enough space there to build a new metropolis without bulldozing valued nature and privately owned farms. 

&gt; especially if the alternative is everyone in Amsterdam drowns. 

Which I already said isn't going to happen.

&gt; Besides, cities have been growing since they've existed, it's not like they are constricted to town walls.

Which is kind of besides the point when the argument is to build entirely new cities to house the population instead of protecting existing ones. The fact that cities have room to grow, doesn't mean there's enough space for enough *new* cities. 

I might own 10 tiny houses across a country, each with about half of the space needed to house the world's largest ball of yarn. In theory, I have enough space to house the ball 5 times over. In practice, I am unable to house it.

&gt; Are you under the impression every farm on the continent needs to be removed?

Are you under the impression that you can just destroy the massive amounts of farmland needed in order to build the kind of mass urban centers that'd be needed to house all the people who would be made homeless, and not have that cause huge disruptions?

But you'll eat up the stories of European Muslim women running to be gang banged by ISIS members.

No one is joining ISIS that already isn't in ISIS.  It's being padded and funded by mercenary groups hired by the Saudis (an example being a dead ISIS member having a huge back tattoo, or pictures of ISIS praying in different directions).

Glam had already shocked with gender (David Bowie), so punks had to step up a bit and hit the establishment were it hurt the most – flaunting nazis emblems. A typical situationist way of confusing your environment. Vivienne Westwood and Siouxsie Sue had no problem using the swastika. And their main aim was the older generation, the establishment. Some punks immediately showed their disgust of this tactic, like The Clash and Alternative TV (How much longer?). Bad taste or not. None of these persons were seriously nazis. It was a fashion stance. 

For me punk rock music covers the whole political spectrum. I would agree it being more left than right and argue more middle class than working class. Late 1977 a term called street punk came up. It was more directed towards the working class kids than the art student punks or the suburban punks of the middle class. Sham 69 and Skrewdriver were main drivers of this scene. Their concerts were more rowdy and violent. Partly because they had a fondness for talking or agitating in between songs and partly because of the public they attracted. These two bands handled the right wing gatherings on their concerts differently. Sham 69 tried to keep away from it, but would at the end of the day be so disillusioned and tired of it all that the band had to stop. Skrewdriver absorbed it. Street punk was the precursor to the Oi movement. The Oi movement were basically a punk and skinhead movement. Skinhead culture came originally from the ska and reggae scene. Skins were considered more true to the cause. The cause being against commercialism and establishment. The skinheads were pretty varied politically back then. Remember the Redskins? Right wing groups adhered to the skinhead energy and anger and with help of bad journalism of the establishment skinheads were synonyms to nazis. It wasn't meant to go that way.

Dans toutes les matières, à tous les niveaux. En grande partie parce qu'on se concentre sur cette idée grotesque et criminelle d'envoyer 80% d'une classe d'âge au niveau bac, avec pour résultat que ce dernier ne vaut rien sur le marché du travail.

Tu m'excuseras mais le rôle du lycée c'est pas non plus de préparer la population au monde du travail mais de fournir à tout le monde un bagage culturel et académique de base.

Je pense que ce genre de réflexions fait (entre autres) partie du problème. Lorsque l'on s'acharne à vouloir faire de l’école une formation ""pratique"" au ""monde réelle"", on scinde la population en deux: ceux qui ont hérité du patrimoine culturel français, de ses codes, de ses richesses et les autres, qui pataugent, se retrouvent constamment en échec scolaire car à force de vouloir baisser les exigences et les grilles de lectures des professeurs, on finit par faire passer des personnes qui n'ont pas du tout le niveau.

Il faut vraiment voir certaines copies de philosophie au bac... j'ai eu l'occasion de jeter un coup d’œil, c'est effrayant (ou devrais-je dire, ""efraiyan""). C'est pas juste des ""petites fautes"" d'accord, ou de conjugaison, beaucoup ont des difficultés majeures mal avec la syntaxe même de la langue française.

Un des meilleurs aspects de notre système est, à mon avis, qu'il permet à un fils d'ouvrier de lire du Descartes en Terminale, ou de connaître Prévert et Verlaine et toutes ces grandes figures de notre littérature. Plutôt que transiger la-dessus, je pense qu'il faudrait plutôt faire en sorte que la discipline ne soit plus vue comme une violence des ""enseignants"" sur les élèves (on se lève quand le professeur entre, estrade, punitions, uniforme(?) etc...), que l'on augmente progressivement les moyens attribués à l’éducation nationale (au lieu de dépenser 7 milliards d'euros par an pour construire de nouvelles infrastructures en Pologne tiens !) et comme quelqu'un d'autres l'a souligné, valoriser les formations techniques spécialisées.",t5_2qhjz,oss

Unfortunately I cannot provide a sourced example for Hungary, and anecdotal 'evidence' is not allowed. I would suggest research in the field of pre-war Hungarian developments in the field of power electronics and railway, which were impressive (private opinion, of course). This is now largely gone. 

Summary: Eastern Europeans remember and compare their countries before and after Russian involvement. This comparison isn't favourable for Russia.

Really clones are exactly what they say they are - there shouldn't really be any deviation in the basic design. The main difference is usually what's bundled in the kit, as I mentioned the [banggood.com deal](http://www.banggood.com/Pixhawk-PX4-2_4_6-Flight-Controller-NEO-M8N-GPS-Radio-Telemetry-PPM-OSD-3DR-p-977597.html) (915MHz telemetry - not suitable for EU) is one of the better out there in terms of a bundle. Otherwise I've had good success with RCTimer.com 's clone boards, however the website is currently down so I'm not able to give you a link.

FPV over 4 miles is tough (not to mention illegal in a lot of places...) you'll likely want to go to a 2.4GHz or below frequency in order to get as robust of a signal as you'd need which leaves you less options for control - most likely something like ImmersionRC EzUHF or DragonLink etc. Because I fly in the UK our limits are a bit stricter and tbh I don't have any interest in flying my extremely expensive craft and camera kit out of my visual line of sight, regardless of how great my FPV link is.

Another option for gimbals is the Gremsy line up, although I would recommend using a DJI flight controller with that as they integrate well nowadays with the CAN-Link system they have set up to offset your gimbal pitch and roll.",t5_37gqp,

Her mother was also testifying to that effect.  They were clearly upset that the video that was out there was of nudity in particular.

Again, I am not criticizing her feelings.  She has the right to feel that way and I'm not minimizing them.  I just think that our Victorian nudity taboo can increase the stress level in a situation and perhaps unnecessarily so.  

As another example, if you walk in on someone accidentally and they are clothed, it's not a big deal, but if they are nude, it could be a big deal.  I think that in some cultures, the extra stress from the nudity is not as much.  Not even restricting it to cultures that are commonly nude, but to cultures that just don't have as strong of a nudity taboo, like some European countries.

Two things happened.

1.  The Arabs living in the area were told to leave because very soon all the Jews would be killed in the war.

2.  Starting in the 1920s the Arabs started moving people into the area so they would have a greater claim on the land when, as all could see was going to happen, the British gave up control.

I have done a lot of study on this and both sides have things to atone for.    It used to baffle me at how anyone could read this history of the region and not agree that the Jewish people who had lived there for 1000's of years did not deserve their own homeland.   It also baffled me as to how anyone could read the history and place so much blame on the Jewish people.

I finally started looking into how and who started making false claims about the history.    You would expect it from the Muslims in the area as their book orders them to hate Jewish people.   But why so much in Europe?    

I had to come to the conclusion that it was  antisemitism that was hiding behind the attacks.    It was a way people could the Jews but not be called out on it.   To do this though they had to use false histories and get those histories accepted.

Tres ciudades madrileñas -Pozuelo de Alarcón, Las Rozas y Majadahonda- son las más ricas de España, hasta el punto de que el nivel medio de renta de los hogares de la primera de ellas (54.543 euros) multiplica por ocho lo que percibe un hogar en Torrevieja (Alicante), que no llega a los 8.000 euros. Esos datos se desprenden de los Indicadores Urbanos publicados este martes por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), que recoge datos de contenido socioeconómico para conocer y medir la calidad de vida de 109 ciudades españolas dentro del proyecto europeo Urban Audit.

Ăsta e mai degrabă un argument pentru limitarea întinderii epiziotomiilor.

Într-adevăr este discutată și vindecarea:

&gt;In the episiotomy group 7.7% of women experienced delayed healing versus 2.2% in the no-episiotomy group (P &lt; 0.05). The difference persisted when women with intact perineums (53% of the no-episiotomy group) were excluded. None of the four third-degree lacerations that occurred without episiotomy exhibited delayed healing versus 18.5% of the 27 deep tears that occurred with epsiotomy.

Trebuie să recunosc că sunt surprins. Chiar și după eliminarea pacientelor cu perineul indemn vindecarea e mai rapidă în grupul non-epi. Pe de altă parte, vindecarea unei plăgi nu înseamnă doar închiderea ei cu țesut ci ia în calcul și funcționalitatea țesutului respectiv. De aici și ce am spus eu - o plagă ""curată"" e mai ușor de suturat strat la strat și pune tensiune uniformă pe suturi, pe când una neregulată necesită de obicei debridare și va prezenta scarificare și deformare mai pronunțate.

We have the economic sector, and in particular banking and finance--special interest--subordinating the political establishment through lobbying and campaign finance.  

This Act was creating some sort of an Obstruction that limited gains somehow.  You don't need a PhD in economics to understand the basic function of regulatory legislation.  

Now I appreciate your lengthy reply, and you appear to be highly knowledgeable about the particular details and structure of the Act itself.  Much more so than I.  

And yet, what I find troubling is the apologetic tone--that old neo-liberal sympathy for carefully watched self-interest, gone awry.  ""We didn't MEAN for it to end up this way, you know?  It's just that some people, x, and some institutions, y, are making the whole system bad.""  

Which is complete bullshit, of course.  The problem of capitalism is systemic.  And while this Act is one small piece of the puzzle for our current state, it is a significant one and it reflects the nature of the relationship between our current government and the economic interests in this country, i. e. the function of concentrated wealth to sustain and grow itself.  

Maybe do your homework sometime and recognize that Sanders' platform of Social Democracy is not hard Socialism, and it's been in practice in Europe since the end of WW2.  Which is why they live longer and happier lives than we do, with a different value set.  There is a distinction between Socialist parties and Social Democratic parties who make reforms and apologies for capitalism.

I am neither.  Personally I would love to see Trump get elected.  But it's probably not for the same reason as most of his supporters.  

Enjoy your Starbucks and a nice vacation.  Hunker down!  Let the establishment quote the first few passages of Adam Smith for you, and not actually explain his fear in unchecked greed and the nature of capitalism to turn men into brute machines, that ""vile maxim.""  No, the distinction between true liberalism and this American brand of consumer selfishness and imperial neo-liberalism can all be fused into the same hollow ideology, conveniently packaged to fit into your 4000 lb SUV.

Every other country is subpar or average. 

The Commonwealth has the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, Nigeria and India has the biggest players. Canada is the closest to the UK, so Canada will be able to send the most to the UK the soonest.

The EU on the other hand is economically stagnate. It has a refugee crisis to deal with. There is plenty of political instability within the EU. Not to mention the fact that Ireland is off the table for a route into the UK.

Your toolkit in the early months is ridiculously small, between having only 4 soldiers and so few classes and equipment to choose from. Also having only 4 soldiers means that if you lose one due to mistakes or RNG shenanigans, you're basically screwed. You just lost 1/4 of your options to finish this mission with. Especially if you're going to bump the difficulty any more, the game really needs to give your low-level troops more options to deal with that difficulty.

2: Fatigue. Not only does this make sense and make the game longer and more difficult in a pretty reasonable way, it also fixes one of the biggest traps of the base game. In XCOM 2 and EU, there's no real incentive not to take as much of your A team as is available on every mission. Which leads to having 6-8 colonels and a bunch of rookies. So losing one of those high-value troops can be an instant game over. Now, in order to avoid this, you can and should take lower-ranked troops and train them up to have a deeper roster that can actually recover from losses. But apart from ""avoiding a game over 5 hours down the line"" there's nothing in the base game to encourage that. The altered wound system kind of does it in XCOM2, but not nearly as effectively as Long War's fatigue system.

3: Basically everything dangerouspuhson suggested about making the geoscape more proactive.

My favorite thing about Long War is that it makes the game a lot more difficult, but actually less punishing. You have more tools to deal with the challenge and a lot more ways to recover from mistakes or setbacks. And in a game with as much RNG as XCOM, you really need mechanisms like that to make sure that a few bad rolls don't wipe out hours of smart play. ",t5_2si6x,

Think of the way, though you may be not familiar with it, the Catholic Church had (up until the 1970s) performed the Mass in Latin. Let that sink in.

I don't know how it is in Islam. I would think the majority of Muslims speak Arabic or have learned to speak Arabic. However, Islam is a perfect example here. Indonesian Muslims have the Koran written in Indonesian, yes? Malay have Korans written in Malay, yes? In the US and UK there are English Korans. Europe must have many translated Korans. Heck, there must be Korans in Turkish too! Both in Latin script and in Arabic script. Same would go for Persia, I assume.

Now, if you search among these - the Catholics and the Latin, the Muslims and non-Arabs, Armenians and Turkish - you will find (particularly in the Asian and Western cultures) Holy Scripts written with the native alphabet phonating the Arabic words.

This prayer book is an example of that.

Armenians couldn't read, or didn't learn, Arabic script (Osmanian). But they sure has heck spoke Turkish.

They could read Armenian perhaps, but they couldn't understand the old (""like Latin to the Catholic Church"") Armenian (called ""Krapar"").

So, the solution found by some was to print out the prayers in Turkish but with Armenian letters.

Interestingly, I can read these prayers and wouldn't understand a thing I'm saying, though I know it would sound faintly Turkish. And someone who really has an ear for this could actually understand the Turkish (realizing that they're listening to Christian prayer).

&gt;I see your own idiocy, but not hypocrisy 

Translation: You have no argument.

&gt;and aniecdotal evidence or theories are just that. For example, I know 5-6 or people from the zone. One in particular a young woman in University who only speaks Russian. Can you guess her stance as well as her families? They pretty much hate the DNR and LNR. 

[The votes say differently.](http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/02/world/europe/ukraine-rebel-elections/)

&gt;LOL the only deployment of soldiers is in active military formations fighting in the east. You have one or two guards at polling stations if thats what you. And shame that multiple organizations and groups beard witness to the elections such as the osce who only confirmed this. The only limit to the election was the separatist refusal to allow it in there areas. So much for freedom and self determination. 

I already showed evidence of them killing civilians, If that isn't voter intimidation then nothing is.[More Evidence soldiers using live fire to disperse civilians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLRJX5BngT0)

&gt;and many countries ban radical parties. Would you say then it's undemocratic that Germany has banned the Nazi party? 

Yes it is undemocratic, the US has had a communist party since 1919 and thats exactly what was banned. Not only that but these were parties that had elected representatives. Communist or other donetst synpathetic parties are not the same as Nazis and even then all parties should be allowed to run.

If Ukraine were to ban extreme parties and still be inline with your comparison, they would also be banning Svoboda party who uses an [SS symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/IN_%28yellow_background%29.svg) and Right Sector which have NAZI ties and origins associated with Stepan Badera. 

The hypocrisy is just so blatant.

&gt;LOL where have I said this? I guess you've been smoking again?

[I'm going by what I sources you probably subscribe too like the state department.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOM43r5MQc). What you say is that the you can't determine who shot the civilian in the video even though the only ones who could be responsible are the Kiev Junta Battalions. There are only 2 parties the protesters and the soldiers you say you can't determine who shot the protester and basically allowing for the option that the protesters shot themselves in the middle of the head leaving no weapon behind.

&gt;LOL look at the methodology behind it. They interviewed a thousand people. Which is great, but then again the country is made up of millions of individuals. Thats pretty unrepresentative. ......again, pretty flawed methodology of interviewing a 1000 people to get the opinions of 45 million. I'm finding it hilarious you didn't do your homework on that one. 

So your response to my evidence is no evidence.

[Gallop posted previously and Pew here are establishment sources](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/3-ukrainian-public-opinion-dissatisfied-with-current-conditions-looking-for-an-end-to-the-crisis/) and exclude Donbass which should make it more favorable to Kiev Junta Regime and still it is low approval.


&gt;There would be not ATO if heavily armed groups started popping up along with Strelko and other Russian bands. 

Ukraine would have been better off if Maidan composed of Right Sector Nazis and a later Nuland appointed Yats, hadn't occurred.

If the Nazis wanted a new leader they could have waited for an election. Instead they oppressed the region who voted overwhelmingly for the leader they forced out and then banned all sympathetic parties.

That is like the tea party throwing out Obama, then sending the military to suppress Blue states while banning all Left leaning parties followed by having a ""fair election"" in which the blue states can't vote due to war.

Engenharia Informática é o curso que decidi seguir também.

Efectivamente sem Matemática A não vais fazer Análises Matemáticas, lamento mas é a pura e dura verdade. Com Humanidades podes esquecer esse teu objectivo certamente, mesmo que possas entrar com os exames certos.

Eu no 10º ano segui logo um Profissional, e segui logo à primeira, contra todos os avisos que me foram dados. Hoje em dia posso-te dizer que ..... Não me arrependo.

Acontece que o pessoal que chega a Engenharia Informática geralmente ou é mesmo muito aplicado ou demora quase o dobro a acabar o curso, não sei como é possível mas olho para a generalidade da malta e é mesmo isso que acontece. Posso-te dizer que também sou um caso especial, pois eu não fui para o profissional com uma postura de quem não quer saber do secundário para nada e está ali para acabar o curso e logo se vê, eu fui efectivamente para a área que gostava numa decisão que esperava mais tarde valorizar-me em relação aos outros Licenciados/Mestres (ainda está em cima da mesa o Mestrado e Erasmus para enriquecer ainda mais), é uma experiência profissional extra (estágio curtinho, é verdade, mas está lá) que só por si me mete à frente do resto do pessoal que tenha acabado de sair do seu curso, e os três anos extra de pedalada (fraquinha, diga-se passagem, mas mais uma vez está lá). Acontece que eu pesquisei bastante por mim por casa, e me interessei bastante pela área, e é uma área que favorece bastante o pessoal auto-didacta digo-te já, a Internet é o melhor recurso que tens para aprender sobre a área, melhor que o curso por si posso já dizer-te. Investi milhares e milhares de horas em trabalho por mim que neste momento posso-te afirmar com toda a certeza que me metem acima de praticamente qualquer licenciado ou qualquer outra pessoa ""com o papel"" em termos de capacidades, claro que continua a ser bastante restrito à área em especifico da programação, quando o curso de longe não é só isso e te dá outras capacidades fundamentais, e não é reconhecido, para além das dezenas de projectos avançados que tenho em repositórios online.

Posso-te dizer que cheguei ao primeiro ano e decidi que antes de mais ia logo cortar as Matemáticas a 1 por semestre, isto pode parecer estúpido por estares a cortar nas cadeiras que estás a fazer mas é bastante benéfico se pensares bem. Permite-te ter mais tempo livre para te aplicares a sério naquelas que estás a fazer, ter muito melhor média que de outra forma, já para não falar que tens cadeiras que vais ver que para ti são peanuts, portanto com o tempo livre extra que tens acabas por ter muito tempo para te aplicar a sério na cadeira de Matemática que estás a fazer. O resultado prático disto acaba por ser que fazes todas as cadeiras para as quais te aplicas-te, com melhor média que os outros geralmente, enquanto que os outros se for preciso acabam por fazer ainda menos que tu, mesmo cortando as matemáticas desta forma.

Nunca fui mau a matemática, bem pelo contrário, contam-se pelos dedos das mãos os testes que fazia antes do 10º ano em que não tivesse pelo menos 90%, mas isso é ridiculamente simples comparado com o nível do ensino superior ou mesmo secundário, de qualquer modo as bases triviais e o raciocínio lógico está lá, e bem apurado, o que me permite apanhar as coisas, mas não te vou mentir, também tive de recorrer a explicações para o fazer, apesar de acreditar que com o esforço devido através de sites como khan academy lá chegaria.

Se tu estás certo do que queres seguir e se é uma área que te desperta interesse acho que deverias pelo menos ponderar esta possibilidade. Não te vou mentir a dizer que vais sair de lá preparado para a vida profissional, porque para além de exercer como técnico de informática e resolver os problemas dos outros não há muito que vás fazer, nem que de facto os cursos são bastante básicos, mas no meu caso deu-me aquele empurrão necessário para me motivar a começar a aprender por mim muito mais e aprofundar a um nível ridiculamente superior do que o que era suposto as coisas.

Boa sorte.

Sunt fan al fotografiei, deci mi-a placut ca l-au pus pe Miluta Flueras acolo(pentru cei ce nu stiu, el este fotograf de concerte, supravietuitor al dezastrului din clubul Colectiv).
Mi se pare interesanta ideea documentarului, ceva asemanator nu a mai fost facut, iar acel moment de 30 octombrie este deja ceva consacrat in istoria post-decembrista, momentul ce a dat startul protestelor anti-coruptie. Ok, ideea este interesant, e realizat frumos, va respect munca, numai ca nu pot spune ca au adus foarte mult continut nou fata de ceea ce era pe internet, au fost anumite persoane prezente care au vorbit, doar ca prea multe nu prea au spus(poate nu-si amintesc, nu sunt in masura sa le judec).
Daca tu ai fost oarecum la curent cu Colectiv si ai citit mesaje pe net, ai mai citit ce au scris supravietuitorii, cam tot ceea ce se spune in documentar ti se va parea familiar.

De ce sa te uiti la documentar?
Informarea e esentiala, iar acest documentar este o cale de informare, pot spune usoara, nu prezinta informatie greoaie, doar la final te ataca cu o sumedenie de nume de oameni cercetai, inchisi, oameni ce au avut legatura cu clubul, doar ca ideea generala a creatiei Digi24 poate fi urmarita usor. 

Ce-as fi vrut personal sa vad, as fi vrut sa se vorbeasca si de banii pe care victimele i-au primit(nu ca sa-i atacam apoi ca-i dau pe prostii), ci doar ca sa ne facem o idee de cat de implicati au fost oamenii aici. Ar fi fost ideal sa ne spuna si cat costa acele manusi(stiu ca nu sunt ieftine deloc) si sa ne descrie oarecum mai mult si chinurile prin care ei trec acum in acest proces de recuperare, dar poate toate astea intr-o editie viitoare.

Mie mi-a placut, e regizat frumos, oamenii se vede ca nu au avut ceva livrat pe care doar sa-l citeasca, ci au zis totul din suflet, iar pentru asta a fost o placere sa vizionez documentarul(sa nu se inteleaga gresit, sunt trist din princina evenimentelor petrecute, am avut tovarasi ce au fost acolo, acum ma refer strict la actiunea de-a viziona ceva calitativ), m-as mai uita inca o data, poate mi-a scapat ceva, poate am deschis de prea multe ori telefonul, cine stie, dar pana atunci sa vedem ce face si Discovery.

Aren't you defeating your own argument at least on this one point to allow players like Hydra into WCS NA then? By allowing Hydra to ladder on EU and participate in WCS NA, he has no incentive to practice on NA which further disables potential talent in NA from growing. In what way doe that possibly help the NA scene grow? 

2. I understand that you've developed a personal relationship with Hydra and that he is helping the team out by practicing with one another, but i can't help but feel it has blinded you to some of the other concerns. While Hydra makes an effort to learn English and communicate with his fans, sometimes that's just not enough. The language/culture barrier is a very real thing for me and i believe for many others as well. It's really hard to watch someone like Hydra because the most important part about viewership is personality/communication and without a similar background nor the ability to communicate well, the interest to watch just isn't there. 

3. Without the ability to ""home grow"" foreign streamers as you mentioned in 2013, the viewership and money won't be there. You were right. There is not incentive for foreigners to get better or to provide new content when the outcome of winning something like NA WCS is slim to none. But if NA as a community sees the opportunity to make a living in SC2 b/c the competition is less fierce, perhaps a new drive and hunger will come to fruition and from there, NA pros will feel more competition between  one another. The drive to practice hard and be better than the other NA player will be there until we can finally compete on the Korean level. One of the best Zerg players of all time, Life, developed from this simple domestic hunger: the drive to be better than his friend. Right now it's okay to lose to Polt, to lose to Hydra there is no shame to it. Nobody can blame you for it. Now if i lose to a friend or someone closer to home i'll want to work harder. For example, Polt beat me in WCS no problem, but if someone like Avilo beat me in WCS NA I'll be practicing 10x harder because ill think, man i can beat this guy. Once i beat him, he'll think man i can beat this guy. The cycle of getting better between both players will continue until finally one or both can compete with Koreans.  With the right motivation, it seems that players will get better on their own. Without a complete region lock, the hunger and desire to get truly better isn't there. You said it best. Why try. 

Edit: Polt was a bad example, it seems the general consesus is that it's fine for him since he's committed to living here and attends University here, but I trust you understand where i' going with this. ",t5_2qpp6,T

Indonesien, mit 300 Mio grösste muslimische Nation auf dem Planeten.
