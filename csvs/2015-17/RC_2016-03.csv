So I decided to travel to Bamboo Village and behold bots everywhere, but not just any bots no Cerulian bots. Basicly because Crimson was filled first when the game came out, all of the bots didn't have any other choice but to choose Ceru, so now even though we are outnumbered there are a bunch of new players entering Crimson because of the bots. 


This problem will only increase when Warlock hits, I can't see many Cerus making the same mistake twice. (I know I wont be). 


But a nice short time solution would be to have a reduced cooldown on channel switching for the faction that is outnumbered in areas around faction quests (misty woods, scorching sands etc.) having to wait 10 minutes just to find a channel where the NPCs you are trying to get the quest from are still alive is kinda annoying.",t5_2skd6,1460349655,t3_48d10q,1,t3_48d10q,

The Greeks themselves will get fucked but they'll keep the money flowing until the bitter end.

The really tragic part of this is that Greece was the origin of all Western thought.  A few guys in a few cities a long, long time ago took a radical turn to thinking rationally and changed the world forever.

And the country of origin of those exceptional men is going to be consumed by the radically stupid Muslim world.  Even if they could close the border today they'll be bred into minority status.

It's like any other population model in biology.  If you give ravenously reproducing people unlimited funds and resources to do it their population will explode.  With unlimited Western welfare and safety from all the sectarian violence Greece is particularly doomed as the country of entry and the whole of the EU may be seriously imperiled in especially 30 years time when most of the insane baby boom that stems from this immigration will come to fruition.  Especially with a culture that says all women are fuck-cows put on Earth to make as many fighting age men as possible that kind of social pressure can radically explode populations.

I recommend this camera for its headphone jack (missing from the A6000 and A6300), unlimited continuous recording and built-in V-LOG.

This is the only still/video camera in your price range without a 30 minute continuous recording limit.

Here is the image quality this camera can produce with V-LOG:

- [""spin, drift"" in 4K by Bryan Harvey] (https://youtu.be/ilLzfTcFSdQ)

- [Colors of New Zealand | A Road Travel Film in 4k | GH4 Vlog L &amp; Phantom 3 Professional S Log by Thomas Schweighofer] (https://youtu.be/s2HxP7j0TM0)

- [BAG MEN - A DSLRPros GH4 4K Anamorphic Short Film - Shot using early V-LOG L firmware] (https://youtu.be/7VRtoRt6b8c)

With V-Log, the GH4 is also somewhat better in low light than with the 
original firmware and can get clean results up to ISO 5000 (or even 6400), as seen here:

- [V-LOG L VS CINE D - Low Light Test - Panasonic GH4 by Mitch Lally] (https://youtu.be/n97zc5zIA70) (please note the lack of noise at ISO 6400 in the V-LOG shot)

- [GH4 // V-Log // Low light test 5000 iso by Play Reel Productions] (https://vimeo.com/142443785)

It is a pretty good still camera as well: https://www.flickr.com/groups/2659264@N23/pool

In my view, this camera will give you the best value for money in your price range.

Hope this is helpful and good luck replacing your gear!

I feel like a lot of the comments I see speaking out against Muslims in both American and especially Europe are very racially charged. From an American perspective, there have been hate crimes committed against Muslims which receive little attention, when they would make national news if it was a Muslim committing a hate crime against a Christian. I feel like a lot of people also ignore the fact that actual refugees really are desperate - and just because they might be men doesn't lessen that (it's funny seeing a lot of MRA-type people suddenly use the ""but they aren't women and children, so they don't need help!"" lines).

That being said, I also know (and have experience with) that lots of Muslims can be, speaking frankly, misogynistic and chauvinistic. This doesn't just apply to Muslisms, of course - indeed, I'd say that these attitudes are just as prevalent amongst the predominantly non-Muslim population of India. My family isn't like this, and most other Muslims I've known in America aren't like this, but I'd say that a Muslim immigrant or refugee *is* more likely to be misogynistic than the average European. A lot of these countries on the Middle East and South Asia are really several decades behind the ""west"" when it comes to these issues.

As a result, this topic does make me feel rather conflicted. I know that a lot of refugees are good people who just want to live somewhere where they are safe and have opportunities, but I also know that a lot of them (both men and women) are very culturally conservative and will definitely have issues living in Europe.

You combine 2 things that I never thought would be high-paying jobs [at least for me, 100k even per year is very high-paying]: 
1) using online marketplaces to sell your freelancing services;
2) working with PHP and more specifically with WP.

1) I sometimes look around sites like upwork, freelancer.com, fiverr and peopleperhour and it seems it's always a race to the bottom, with several really cheap bids because of competition from people in 'cheaper countries' (no disrespect, it's just a matter of fact, in some countries $5/hr is a very good salary, I also live at a country much cheaper than the bay area). At most I was thinking of establishing myself with a $40/hr rate [western europe country, senior level web experience] but even that seems very hard / next to impossible, to achieve on these marketplaces.

TopTal seems different since it advertises as top 3% talent. 

Care to comment on your views on this? It looks codeable is very different but maybe you still have a feeling on the differences of the codeable marketplace against all the 'other ones' ?

2) I learned PHP before college and I've been working with it but going through college and a 'normal' enterprise software development job I was always under the impression that PHP is still viewed as a 'kids' language, for beginners, etc. Even worse than that, WP development is viewed as for people who just learned a few things online about programming and not 'real' software developers. [I like WP and PHP, it's just the perception I get from my fellow software devs]

Anyway, I always use PHP on my side projects but never used at my 'real' job. WP development and PHP experts are viewed, around here, as low paying jobs with a huge competition from 3rd world countries. 
Even more if we are talking about remote freelancing WP jobs... Most of the marketplace I see are just low-budget clients that want to pay 'peanuts'.

Seeing someone get paid $60 and $100/hr for PHP / WP development is really eye-opening for me.

Do you think you are an 'outlier' on this payment scale or is that something experts on PHP / Wordpress doing remote freelancing can achieve (my 'dream' target is 100k per year) ?

I never hoped on the WP train as a career and I never thought about it again because I thought the market was just 500% overcrowded with all 'newbies' reading up a few tutorials and telling everyone they can build a WP website.

Do you still think WP / PHP is a good market to invest learning to get consistent remote freelancing jobs at $45~50/hr ?",t5_2qs0q,1460351604,t3_4852il,2,t3_4852il,

First question: UGoS is the Iskar trinket?

Now my guild is just at Gorefiend at the moment (we brought the sucker down to 30% this week, i hate this progressblocker boss :D) and im really interested in the Mannoroth fight, since i really do love demonology.

Sooo im planning to replace Affliction with Demo as soon as possible (basicly i planned on doing so when were on Mannoroth progress, but if i could do it earlier without hurting my raid by doing way less than i should),at which point would it be okay to switch to demo?

Last question for now: Would you keep the Crit/multi mythic warforged neck due to just high itemlevel or try to get the Mastery/Multistrike heroic neck, even though it will be quite some itemlevels below mine?

Again, thanks a lot for reading this and helping me out, if you find the time to do so, its really appreciated! I allways try to be as useful as i can for my raid, so i do really look forward to do the imp part at Mannoroth!",t5_2qio8,1460352180,t3_48dwzd,2,t1_d0iv9lp,

Article 50 provides for a two year maximum, so the negotiations can end sooner, but if no agreement is reached the country that has pressed the button leaves regardless.  

Some eufederalists will want to try to draw out the negotiations for a UK-EU relationship and even draw them out to the point of two years and have them fail. However the pragmatic politicians will crush these nutters as soon as they start getting phone calls from all the industries currently selling billions into the UK with no tariffs for whom tariffs will mean the end of their business, a blow to their profits or massive job cuts (five million jobs on the continent are connected to trade with the UK). The Germans are highly protective of their export industries and will not tolerate meddling from europhiles. So there will be a bespoke UK-EU FTA that's more or less the same market access, both ways, as we have now.  

Parallel to this the UK will negotiate to replicate some of the FTA deals the EU has with other places, which do not require freedom of movement or a common parliament funnily enough. For example there is the Mexico-EU FTA, and the South Korean-EU FTA. I don't think the electronics manufacturers in South Korea are going to want to hold up a deal with a country they are already trading with, so when foreign office officials turn up with an agreement that has the same terms as the SK-EU agreement they are just going to sign it. The deal we will be offering each of these groups is the status quo. Anyone who tells you they will take years to negotiate is trying to compare a ""duplication"" to the difficulties required in forging a totally new agreement. Arguing for large changes in a new FTA, which often involves sacrificing industries, is totally different to signing a deal for the status quo which changes nothing.  

You are going to hear lies over and over on these points. But remember this, nobody has explained from the remain camp, at all, why a German car manufacturer would want to stab themselves in the face to the tune of billions. There are domestic car manufacturers in the UK, there are car manufacturers all over the world. Why would the German guy want the price of his product in the UK to increase for no reason? He'd be mad to want that, and he's going to be hopping mad on the phone to Berlin if some politician suggests it. There is no logic at all to the remain lies on these points, we will find it very easy to sign deals replicating the existing ones.  ",t5_2qhcv,1460352283,t3_48ards,1,t3_48ards,

But the thing is, the story of Santa Claus is not qualitatively different in nature from the story of Jesus. If anything, the story of Santa Claus is less absurd, and makes much fewer extraordinary claims.

I definitely can see where you're coming from. Quite an interesting parallel indeed. 

&gt; A few parents (especially those in Eastern Europe) actually have told their children that Santa will let them be tortured by monsters for not believing in him. This no doubt traumatized many a child, and caused them to keep desperately trying to believe out of fear, a year of two after they had figured out on an intellectual level that Santa Claus couldn't possibly actually be real, caused them to make up all sorts of desperate justifications of the inconsistencies in the story. 

Funny, I did think that the whole concept of Krampus was relatable as well. I knew what that was linked to before I clicked it. Quite bleak irony, but irony nonetheless. 

&gt; Imagine if the threats and promises were proportionally greater. Imagine that the desperate ad-hoc justifications were dressed up in poetry or in clever-sounding arguments too verbose and circular for an average person to follow. And more importantly, imagine that there was heavy social pressure, up to and including the risk of violence, against those who went around talking about who the story didn't make sense. Imagine that, and you'll understand why many adults keep believing the ""Jesus"" story after figuring out the ""Santa"" one.

Do you know why Arab slave trade involved Africans (which was the start of the global African slave trade)? I'm guessing not. It's because the Quran allows slavery, as long as the slaves are not Muslims. Arabs were allowed to own slaves as long as they weren't Muslims, themselves. So they got their slaves from Africa. Muslims considered African to be subhuman, because they weren't Muslims, which means they are allowed to own then as property. 

If you don't think that's accurate, if you don't think Arabs considered African subhuman, I'd suggest you read 1001 Nights, and see how Africans are referred to in that. Slavery inherently creates inequality, which is justified by (and consequently perpetuates) ideas of superiority/inferiority and human/subhuman between the slave owners and the slaves. This is nothing new. It's existed as long as slavery has. All your articles show is this phenomenon occurring in the form of racism, because of the the Atlantic slave trade. Accusing the British of inventing a way of equating certain people to subhuman is nothing short of stupidity and bigotry.

0,,d0ixqm5,EvanRWT,1456802769,13,askscience,False,0,False,,"The list of domesticated animals all across the world is actually pretty small, numbering about 35 species. There are also a bunch of other species that are considered “semi-domesticated”.

The thing is that domestication is a process that depends on the raw material you work with (i.e., the animal in its wild state), and can’t be uniformly applied to all animals. Typically, animals that can be domesticated have certain pre-existed traits that are exploited for domestication, including:

1.	The animal should preferably live in herds, so it’s a social animal, being used to the company of others. There are very few exceptions to this rule – cats and ferrets are really the only solitary domesticated animals that stand out.
2.	It should preferably not be migratory, or at least not migrate huge distances. It’s very hard to breed this tendency out. Cattle were domesticated from aurochs, which lived in small herds (~30 individuals) and didn’t travel very far. The same goes for yak, water buffalo, zebu, other large bovids. On the other hand, bison and wildebeest are very migratory and travel huge distances.
3.	There should be a pecking order in the herd, that is, animals are submissive to the herd’s alpha male or female. This submissiveness should be transferable to members of a different species – humans.

So the fact is that not every animal is domesticable by nature, or at least not domesticable without a tremendous expenditure of effort and time. Nor is there a particular need, since it’s often much easier to just adapt an already domesticated animal to a new environment or new purpose than to domesticate a brand new species.

Then there is the problem of genetics. Traits that reside on a single gene in one species may be polygenic (that is, reside on several genes on different chromosomes) in another species. This makes the job of domestication much harder for some animals than for others. You can breed dogs or foxes very easily to be friendly and submissive, for example, by simply picking the friendliest animals in one generation to breed in the next. But that won’t work if the “submissiveness” trait is polygenic. From one generation you pick the most submissive animals to breed, but their progeny are completely feral and can’t be handled, and then in the next generation some are friendly and some not, and in the next all are unfriendly, and so on. It may take a heck of a lot of generations to collect all those different friendly/submissive alleles from several different chromosomes into one animal that breeds true.

This is very evident If you look around. Only five of eight species of horses have been domesticated. Only 1 species of deer (reindeer) out of 40+ species have been domesticated. People have been trying to domesticate the zebra for a very long time, but with no success so far. Until we better understand the genetics and epigenetics of behavior, the vast majority of species will remain undomesticable.

Now with modern technology we *have* domesticated some bison. Or at least, semi-domesticated them. But this has been only after breeding them with domesticated cattle, transferring some of the crucial domestication genes from cattle to bison. Domesticated cattle were not available for cross breeding in the Americas. They *were* available in Africa, but unfortunately, wildebeest will not cross-breed with cattle.

Note:

Just to slightly correct your question:

&gt;Why could the Native Americans and Africans not tame these animals just like the Europeans did with the cattle and the Asians with the Yak?

Europeans did not domesticate cattle. There were two independent domestication events for cattle, one in the Middle East, the other in India. Both date to about 10,000 years ago.

0,,d0ixra5,PM_ME_UR_TRUMP_MEMES,1456802798,4,IAmA,False,0,False,,"That's the thing about regressive liberalism. There's no line that can be drawn. Anyone who tries to draw a line and leave the herd is automatically labeled the enemy. 

For many liberals the line was the rape culture narrative and 3rd wave feminist ideologies. Report after report of college rape accusations pushed by the media lonely to be debunked, but not until innocent men were smeared and exiled from campuses. Those who dared call this out were labeled sexist rape apologists. 



Or the biased and false coverage, division, and resulting violence created from Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown was a line. Anyone who watched the cases with an open mind saw that Zimmerman and Office Wilson used justified self defense. But those liberals broke from the herd, and were labeled racists


Or the gamergate fiasco where a large chunk of traditionally liberal millennials we're demonized by modern feminists because they didn't want identity politics being forced into video games. Wage gap myth was spewed and stem people were blamed for more women not wanting to go into stem. Those liberals who once blindly followed liberal media indoctrination now found themselves being demonized by the liberal media. Those liberals drew a line and as a result were called racist, Mysoginistic, bigots

&amp;nbsp;


Now the (arguably largest) red pill is the refugee/economic migrant crisis and blind protection of Islam. This is the issue that seems to be killing liberalism. Those who saw the issues a mile away begged, pleaded with liberals to reconsider open borders for muslims who would refuse to integrate. For muslims from countries that believe women are slaves to husbands, homosexuals should be executed, and anyone who dares to oppose Islam be put to death. Liberals responded by calling them racist, Islamophobic neonazis. 

For years, liberals have been conditioned by the media and celebrities on what to think. How to feel. They've been constantly told that the patriarchy is the greatest evil alive. That rape culture is real and to be despised. Than even the simplest things like ""manspreading"" is oppressive and not to be tolerated. That women should be free to wear what they want without fear of Harassment. That LGBT groups should be free to express themselves. 

... But now the narrative says that's only the case if the people aren't muslim. Muslims have now been placed at the top of the oppressive totem pole. European liberals are now being confronted with REAL patriarchy. REAL rape culture, and they're being labeled neonazis for calling it out... Liberals are now telling women to cover up and stay at arms length of men. That they shouldn't dress how they feel, and that they shouldn't blame the men if they're sexually assaulted because they're the ones that dressed slutty. 

Liberals are now giving up the  protections they once enjoyed to help pay for ""refugees"" where 80% of them aren't even from waring countries. They're being told to think of the ""poor women and children"", yet when they look around, they see mostly young immigrant men. They're hearing of atrocities like Rotherham UK and Cologne Germany, but the media and government they blindly trusted is abandoning them to push the multiculturalism narrative. 

&amp;nbsp;

This... THIS is why people are shifting to the right in droves. THIS is why conservative parties are gaining power in Western Europe, the liberal bastion of the world. THIS is one of the reasons why Donald J Trump is bringing in record numbers of supporters to vote for him. 


So no, it's not just because of the alt-right. It's because regressive liberalism has spun out of control and alienated more and more people who refuse to cross a certain line. It's because regressive liberalism is killing society. ",t5_2qzb6,1460353225,t3_48c8s1,4,t1_d0ivyeg,

&gt; Jean Claude plays an official who's just been appointed as Second In Command to the U.S.Ambassador at an American Embassy in a small, turbulent Eastern European nation. When local insurgents attempt a coup d'etat, the nation's President takes refuge inside the embassy. The embassy is then besieged by the well-armed insurgents. The U.S. Ambassador is killed in the ensuing action, and it's now up to Jean-Claude and the embassy's small detachment of U.S. Marines to fend off the attackers.

South Africa...

Erm, I never mentioned Peru.

Chile... (in fairness I did mention them)

&gt; [Before the enforcement of the bilateral FTA, only eight percent of EU exports to Chile
would enter duty free, cf. Figure A2.1.This share goes up to 92 percent of the exported

So yes, 90% of SA-EU trade is tariff free (in 2013, probably higher now), as is 99% of Canada's, and 98% of Chile's.

You were saying?

---

In any case, even if the UK were to get no free-trade deal whatsoever and had to pay WTO level import/export tariffs on EU goods it wouldn't exactly destroy the economy.

10% of the UK's GDP comes from trade with the EU. A 1% trade tariff on 10% of our GDP would lead to a reduction of 0.01% GDP which is entirely manageable.

If the EU wanted to be extremely vindictive and break WTO guidelines by imposing punitive tariffs just to punish the UK for stepping out of line then admittedly it could be more of a problem. But it would also reveal the EU's true nature and prove right many people arguing against what the EU has become.

...But I don't believe the EU would do this as it'd harm them as much as it'd punish the UK. And they aren't actually the evil mobsters I was joking about in my original comment.",t5_2qh4j,1460353283,t3_48a520,2,t1_d0iwb5n,
0,,d0iy1hu,Info-Troll,1456803249,1,politics,1456834811,0,False,,"There are a wide variety of healthcare systems in other Western countries and only few of them are exclusively single payer systems and none are fully socialized. In all healthcare systems that have public and private insurance, private insurance and private doctors and hospitals are always preferred, but in all cases these Cadillac preferred plans are taxed at a very high rate and in most cases only the rich can afford them.

France provides a basic, universal health insurances through large occupation-based funds. The General National Health Inusrance Scheme covers 83% of French workers, while other occupational specific (e.g.: for agricultural workers, for the self employed, for miners, etc.) cover the remainder. About 99% of individuals are covered by this universal health insurance system. However, France utilizes more market-based ideas than most people realized. Copayment rates for most services are 10%-40%. About 92% of French residents have complementary private health insurance. 
. Most of the funding is from a 13.55% payroll tax (employers pay 12.8%, individuals pay 0.75%). There is a 5.25% general social contribution tax on income as well. Thus, there is an approximately a 18.8% tax on employees for health insurance. There are also dedicated taxes which are assessed on tobacco, alcohol, and pharmaceutical company revenues. 

In essence, the French system avoids widespread rationing because, unlike true single-payer systems, it employs market forces. Even the OECD says that the “proportion of the population with private health insurance” and the degree of cost sharing are key determinants of how severe waiting lists will be.

French doctors are paid by the national health insurance system based on a centrally planned fee schedule, but doctors can charge whatever price they want. The fees are based on an up front treatment lump sum, which is similar to DRGs in the U.S. The patient–or their private insurance–must make up the difference between the fee charged by the doctor and the amount paid for by the universal health care system. The average French doctor earns only €40,000, although medical school is free for them and the French legal system is fairly tort-averse.

Germany has a combination of public and private insurance that relies on private doctors to dispense care much like how we have Medicare/Medicaid (which also uses private doctors and hospitals) and private insurance.
German hospitals operate under diverse ownership, with a mixture of state, private, mutual and friendly societies. Germans can visit any GP or specialist they wish. The majority of Germans are covered under public option (only rich people can afford the more preferred private insurance), citizens pay into one of the 300 statutory state sickness funds through their payroll or bank, payments are around 13% of gross earnings. The unemployed are funded separately though the social fund or the AOKs (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse), the local funds of last resort. Some funds operate on a pay-for-treatment-and reimburse basis, but some treatment centres - notably GPs and hospitals - have arrangements with local sickness funds to save patients paying.

Germany also has a much higher percentage of doctors over a much smaller population than the US. It probably helps that since there are far fewer insures for doctors to deal with they don't need as many people working in medical billing. German success is largely attributable to a highly educated population (many engineers, scientists, doctors, etc.), hard work and fiscal conservatism.

Luxembourg public expenditures account for 84% of the total healthcare costs, but they employ private competition in the delivery of universally accessible hospital and surgical services. They require those seeking universal care to share in its cost through co-payments or deductibles. they employ a social insurance model of funding where an independent authority (or private competitive insurer) oversees the daily operation and financing of the health insurance scheme. The government is still involved in a regulatory and oversight role.

Switzerland has universal coverage but relies entirely on competing private insurance companies and hospitals to dispense healthcare (which has proven to be one of the cheapest and most effective systems in Europe- there are no long wait times); taxpayers subsidize the poor, disabled, and elderly. http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/12/26/switzerland-a-case-study-in-consumer-driven-health-care/ also interesting fact the Swiss are apparently big believers in homeopathy. The Swiss government also plays a role in bulk ordering medications for their citizens and negotiating the price of expensive treatments and procedures.

Belgium's universal healthcare system is based on competing mutual insurance companies and is provisioned by a mixture of state and non-profit hospitals. Each mutual is funded by the state, the funding dependent on its membership numbers.

Like the system in France, citizens pay and swipe a health card at the point of care. They are then reimbursed between 50% and 75% of the costs by their mutuelle/mutualiteit scheme. Some GPs and hospitals have local arrangements with mutuals to reduce payments at the point of care. Also as in France, most citizens also sign up for mutual insurance to top up their healthcare reimbursements (complimentaire). As in Germany, Belgian citizens can visit any healthcare establishment they wish - quite literally walking in off the street, although referrals from private or practice-linked GPs are increasingly being used, and language pays a major part in choices. Almost all dentists in Belgium are private, with only partial patient/state reimbursements complicating the landscape.

The Belgian Ministry of Health also recognize homeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic care as reimbursable alternative treatments, subject to the practitioner being a qualified doctor.

Healthcare insurance is a part of the Belgian social security system, meaning that citizens must join a health insurance fund mutuelle (mutualiti) or ziekenfonds (mutualiteit) and pay through payroll or bank deductions.

Hospitals and GP clinics are private and typically managed by universities, religious organisations or mutuals. Most cities have a choice of a social welfare hospital and a religious hospital. The former are highly regulated and will treat regardless of the patient's ability to pay. The latter tend to have a more middle class atmosphere and are generally associated with 'better' treatment.

Belgium has some rich citizens but the government itself is heavily indebted from their socialist programs and is currently selling state assets to get loans so it doesn't go bankrupt. lousy economy high unemployment. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-01/belgium-debt-load-is-great-unifier-as-government-talks-head-to-10th-month.html

http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/05/29/eu-guide-to-broken-belgium/

In all these above cases have much smaller wealthy populations that pay higher taxes with much less poor and obese people than the US. Subsidized healthcare may be cheaper in Norway but they are a very natural resource rich country with a very small and very wealthy population with much healthier habits.- US has a ton of poor fat people who abuse pills like Pez candy. 70% of Americans are on at least one prescription drug, over 50% have at least 2 prescriptions.

Socialized care= rationed care in most of the first world countries and many of them are well on the way to becoming 3rd world asking the IMF and EU for bailouts due to their countries going bankrupt (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus) and most of the Western European nations have even higher unemployment than the U.S. especially among the youth. Spain youth unemployment=57%, and they all have insanely high confiscatory tax rates in common, and all have VAT taxes. France they pay up to 75% of income in taxes. ALL of the countries that have socialized care have high % VAT taxes and high income taxes to subsidize these healthcare programs.

Wait times in Italy, Spain, GB are very long and care is rationed. You don't get the same attention or effort by doctors as you do here. The more financial strain the government is under the more care is rationed.

&gt;  Description book **Labyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges**:

&gt;  If Jorge Luis Borges had been a computer scientist, he probably would've invented hypertext &amp;amp; the World Wide Web. Instead, being a librarian &amp;amp; one of the world's most widely read people, he became the leading practitioner of a densely layered imaginistic writing style that's been imitated throughout this century, but has no peer (Umberto Eco sometimes comes close). His stories are redolent ...

I understand how huge the difference was between slave trade being a widespread but still generally local institution in Africa and Arabia before British involvement, to a global, industrialized machine after British involvement. 

I understand that it increased demand for slaves. It provided a cheap, easy way for practically the entire world to get African slaves. I don't know that actual number, but it probably increased demand for African slaves by a thousand times at least. 

I understand that without British involvement, there would be tens of millions of slaves that would have not been ""in circulation"" so to speak. (I know that's a cruel way of putting that, but I don't know another way of saying that.) I further understand the difference between being a slave in Africa to being a slave in Europe or America. 

For example, a lot of people that want to alleviate Europeans of culpability in the Atlantic slave trade like to point out that Europeans didn't just go into Africa with a net and wrangle up a bunch of Africans to sell in the new world; that what they actually did is they traded goods with warlords and rulers in Africa for their slaves. However, this doesn't encapsulate the whole picture that being a slave in Africa meant you were more likely an indentured servant or a war prisoner, while in the new world you were property that provided manual labor in abhorrent conditions.

I get all that. I'm not minimizing that. What the British did when they industrialized the slave trade did dehumanize black people to the rest of the world for hundreds of years to come.

The issue I take is that you're saying that this is the first time anything like this has ever happened. That slave owners never dehumanized their slaves before this. That no other slave trade used that form of justification, that the slaves were intrinsically less human than their owners, to keep the trade alive. That this was the first time in human history that slavery was passed through bloodline. 

And none of that is true. If anything, the fact that most African slaves, before Arab and European involvement, were not part of a chattel slave system is the anomaly. Most slave trades across the globe were chattel systems.

The British magnified the scale of the African slave trade, and that still has a lasting effect on race relations worldwide, but acting like white people invented this stuff, like this kind of stuff wouldn't exist without white people is nothing short of rewriting history.",t5_2xlfc,1460354449,t3_48bahj,2,t1_d0izag3,

If light infantry gameplay is either a strength or a skill you are looking to develop, the 173rd Airborne Brigade might be just what you're looking for! Our unit is based on the real-life 173rd Airborne Brigade that has a history dating back to WWI.

If jumping out of helicopters and transport aircraft with 40 to 80+ soldiers from across the U.S. (plus some soldiers from Europe as well) sounds like fun, you'll definitely enjoy what our unit has to offer.

While our unit operation takes place on Saturday evenings, there are other events that would interest you that take place throughout the week.

To be an *Active Duty* soldier you are required to attend at least 2 out of 3 of your required weekly events (squad training, platoon training, and the unit-wide combat operation). This amounts to between 4-6 hours each week (if you plan on attending all 3 events). If you don't have that much time to devote you may enlist as a *Reserve Duty* soldier and only be required to attend 1 event every other week (that event lasts approximately 2 hours).

If you're interested but still need more information feel free to check out the unit's [About Us](http://173rd.us/index.php/page/aboutus.html) page, or you can come talk to a recruiter on our [TeamSpeak Server](http://www.teamspeak.com/invite/ts3.173rd.us/?channel=Request%20a%20Recruiter%20%28Read%20Description%29).

If you've heard all you need to hear visit our website and [register an account] (http://173rd.us/index.php?app=core&amp;module=global&amp;section=register) and submit an [enlistment application](http://173rd.us/index.php/index.php?app=perscom&amp;module=enlistment).

We look forward to fighting alongside you in our unit!",t5_2wxui,1460354517,t3_48acno,1,t3_48acno,
0,,d0j0j6i,narlybookworm,1456807527,1,Coffee,False,0,False,,"""Most coffee lovers agree that espresso is less bitter than drip brew because of the shorter brewing time. However when we ran comparison taste-tests in the homes of espresso lovers, they all agreed that AeroPress espresso tasted better than the brew from their high-priced European espresso machines--why? The reason is that the total immersion brewing of the AeroPress yields a robust flavor at lower temperature--and lower temperature brew is far less bitter. Home espresso machines don’t allow adjustment of temperature. But even if they did, their lack of total immersion would not yield robust flavor at reduced temperature. In addition to smoother taste, the AeroPress has several other advantages over conventional espresso machines.

Grind is not critical in the AeroPress. Grind is so critical in espresso machines that most grinders cannot produce a grind fine enough to make a good tasting shot! Special espresso grinders cost hundreds of dollars and require frequent cleaning.
Espresso experts always adjust the grind when there are changes in humidity or batches of coffee. They throw away two or three shots while adjusting the grind in to achieve the desired 25-second shot.
There is no tamping in the AeroPress. Books on espresso teach the art of just the right amount of tamping. They instruct the home barista to practice on the bathroom scale to learn exactly thirty pounds of pressure.
There is no pre-warming of the portafilter head. In fact the AeroPress has no portafilter head!
There is no maintenance. Espresso machines require regular cleaning and descaling with caustic chemicals. They also require disassembly and cleaning of the showerhead.
There is no need to judge when to stop the pull. This is the most critical skill in using an espresso machine. As espresso lovers well know, most would-be baristas in coffee shops, hotels and restaurants run the pump too long--extracting sour bitterness from the grounds.
With the AeroPress, the amount of water is predetermined by the user, who can brew any strength from weak to super-intense just by choosing the desired amount of water prior to pressing.""

Thats from the amazon sale page. Espresso is water pressured through espresso coffee..so im not understanding how its not espresso..just cause its not coming from a fancy machine..its the same exact process as a machine just..way better.",t5_2qhze,1460354532,t3_488p6b,1,t1_d0j04r1,

Say another 40 similar sized college basketball arenas. Plus older or less frequently used stadiums. Plus another what, 20 MLS stadiums? London certainly isn't a representation of the UK as a whole, and neither is DC. 

And no to representing smaller cities around DC. The Washington Redskins play in Landover, Maryland. For another example, the New York Jets and New York Giants don't play or New York City or New York state. They play in New Jersey. Our areas seem to be more inclusive. I mean, I live 35 mins from DC downtown and I'll tell you I live in DC if we met. DC only has 600k people, but the metro area is about 5.7k. Other cities, such as Boston, are similar. 

In any case, didn't this whole discussion stem from what could host the World Cup easier and on short notice? Per capita stats don't really matter in that case.

&gt;The purpose of automation is not to save money, it's to multiply labor.

That's old school machinisation. The reason manufacturing jobs are returning to America and Europe to be done by robots is not because they can do a better job, but because it is cheaper. ",t5_2t7no,1460354667,t3_48ac74,3,t1_d0iosjy,

That is to say, Mexico is seeing a constant departure of good players and not too many arrivals, while the MLS is seeing more arrivals of good players and not too many departures. I'm not saying that native MLS players &amp; teams aren't developing to a higher level (because I think that's also a reason for the closing gap). ",t5_2qi58,1460354689,t3_48dame,4,t1_d0iw0o1,

America, Europe, the western world and a majority of the world have had an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity in comparison to our forefathers. Take the 1800s for example there were major wars every decade claiming tens of thousands of lives. And not just a single war here and there, major wars being fought simultaneously across the globe. In our time while there may be several minor conflicts happening at the same time none even to the scale or comparison of these. A lot of this has to do with the US and UN/NATO becoming the worlds policeman and the development of nuclear weapons which have basically ensured that any major war between the big powers could result in nuclear annihilation, a risk no one wants to take.

everyone here keep saying democracy is the best and only option right now.but how long US has existed as a country,how long true democracy has existed as a political system,how long human society has existed?India built their country in 1950,while china founded their country in 1949,at that time India is much better than china in so many aspects. India GDP growth rate finally surpass china in 2015,but GDP of china is already 4 times bigger than India,when will they surpass china you do the math.India is a democracy country,i mean democracy is the best option right?what happened to India all these year?is it democracy went wrong or India went wrong?and right now American style democracy is more and more developing into oligarchy,you have old bush,you have warmonger bush,you have failed bush:you president yet?talk to me when you're a president.you have the clintons and some random millionare.the country is literally controlled by several big corporations,like beef is controlled by 5 corporations,pork is also controlled by 4 corps,bird is controlled by 6 corps(not exact number but close),that how you get veggie libel laws,how ridiculous is that?what happened to democracy that big corps can lobby Parliament into signing such a law?and don't get me started with military–industrial complex and wall street and oil corporations. 
Chinese want democracy and freedom of course,but not overthrow the Government kinda democracy,just stop censoring my facebook and pornhub kinda democracy,and when can you(CCP)stop being so sensitive and insecure kinda democracy.a lot of Chinese hate the CCP,but they hate it because maybe corruption in local government,or central government is such a pussy in foreign affairs,who only knows condemnation and abstaining votes,or they hate it because censorship in tv and film,you know one of the rules they had is deification of fictional character after 1949 is not permitted,so if you want write a novel about a tiger which became a tiger god before the year 1949,that's OK,but after 1949 which is the year china been founded that not permitted,how ridiculous is that.but no matter how much they hate CCP,no one want to overthrow it,because compare to chaos and turmoil and poverty,totalitarian is bearable.most westerners know what it feel like to be poor,but don't know what it feel like to be poor in a poor country,and also don't know what it feel like to be poor and weak for 200 years after 2000 years of glorious,you should search world top GDP in last 2000 years to get a feel.Chinese is so sick of it,so sick of hundreds years of humiliation and chaos and turmoil and poverty and weakness it brings.cause Chinese people is always proud or even arrogant,they call their country the middle kingdom,center of the whole world,each and everyone of you is same barbarian to me,and should all pay tribute to me,and they have continuous recorded history books,so they know how arrogant or proud their ancestors are for thousands of years .after being kicked from the top and stayed in bottomless pit and humiliated for 200 years,most people want to come back to where they belong,that why CCP‘s promise ""the great renaissance of china""resonated in so many hearts,""heck we've been living under authoritarian for 5000 years,i guess i could stand a few hundreds years"".But that doesn't mean they're satisfied with the CCP,if you know Chinese society well,you will know they also have left and right,left is called fifty cents,right is called American cents.right wing always bashing ccp and china only because they're always compare china with the best,be it the best political system(democracy) or best film industry(US),or best variety show industry(Korean),best industrial capability(Japan and German),best public welfare(Northern Europe)，you know how arrogant Chinese are for thousand years, of course they will only compare with the best.""CCP sucks,i bet US wouldn't do this in their country"",""china sucks,German dudes make much better cars in their country,""we sucks,Koreans is doing such a good job at preserving culture""
i heard a quote from a friend,""china has tried every methods they could possible think of to bring china back,feudalism,warlord government,democracy（PRC in 1912）,Mao communism,socialism,state capitalism,they also made every possible mistake they could possibly made as a nation and as a government,all they have to do right now is following the current road to their renaissance""",t5_2qh13,1460354736,t3_489x8r,0,t1_d0iapi0,

Well we have no idea how they do it as there appears to be no logic behind what items are being duped or how exactly it has been done. Many methods have made it to the public and they were all fixed in no time, and those who took advantage of them were punished, but no one knows how they are still able to do it today.

Trick Perkz and Kikis all love playing carry champions which results in there being less damage to deal in teamfights for Emperor (all 3 are top 3 in their position for DPM). Couple this with G2 being slightly less botlane centric and therefore more solo/duo kills happening elsewhere on the map his kill participation drops as well demonstrated by Kikis, Trick and Perks D% all being toward the top end of their respective roles but KP being very middle of the pack (suggestive of a muti-threat team at all stages not just teamfights).

Finally Emperor has the highest GPM but one of the lowest G% of any ADC, coupled with the lowest game time in EU LCS this means his damage is often overshadowed by the earlier damagespikes of a strong midlaner and carry top/jungle duo.

The only worrying factor for Emperor is his higher death% but I feel this falls under the scope of the other points, he will always be the squishiest person on the team and with Hybrid playing mostly engage supports (thresh, braum and alistar) he is often left to fend for himself in a teamfight.

&gt;  is an underage girl's cleavage really something idealistic, something a 'progressive mind' needs to consider art? 

This is not the subreddit to get into a debate on the limitation or expectations of art, especially on such a volatile topic. But I'll offer the summary that should be alright on this subreddit. Xenoblade, bravely second, FE:Fates/conquest/birthright, these games be my scene. I've had to import games from europe/ japan if i want to play them ala DoA (Although i tend am a tekken fan myself), and i have zero complaints about the 'censorship' that occurred. 

I'm australian, and we have game censorship, and while i get that America and My own are supposed to be part of the same 'west', i assure you our cultures and cultural standards are quite different.

Vous avez peut-être lu cet article [cet article dans l'Actualité](http://www.lactualite.com/societe/lise-theriault-le-feminisme-et-le-dictionnaire/) où l'auteur base son billet sur la définition que le Robert fait du féminisme (visant l'égalité des sexes).  Or, s'il avait pris le Larousse, il aurait eu une définition différente (sans mention d'égalité).  J'ai un vieux Robert de 1985 chez moi et la définition du terme a changé depuis.  Le Robert, qui avait la même définition que le Larousse, a modifié la signification de ce terme entre 1985 et 2016.  
En fait, j'ai de la difficulté avec le terme ""féminisme"" ; il ne semble pas dire ce que les féministe voudrait qu'il signifie.  Si on parle de capitalisme, on fait référence au capital ; si on parle d'hindouïsme, on par de la religion hindoue ; si on parle d'africanisme, on par de l'Afrique ; si on parle de racisme ; on parle de la race.  Or, avec ce redéfinition du terme, lorsque l'on parle de féminisme, on ne parle plus de la femme, mais d'égalité.  Le terme est devenu mensonger! 
Si on prend son antonyme, ""masculinisme"", il signifie, à bon droit, l'idée d'une domination masculine.  Pourquoi s'insurger que certains s'y perdent dans tout cela?  Si j'ajoute à ça que le terme ""féminisme"" n'est pas des plus attirant pour les hommes qui voudraient s'en réclamer, je crois qu'il serait bon de changer le terme!

Pourquoi pas de ""l'égalogenrisme""?? ;)

Scotland's homicide rate is 2.33 deaths for every 100,000 people each year, compared with 0.7 in England and Wales. In Spain it is 1.02, and in Italy 0.96. Germany has western Europe's lowest murder rate: 0.68 per 100,000 people.

A mark of a free and fair society IS free speech. When a citizen can voice his/her opinion without fear of being silenced by the government. The state employee in this video, being fired BY THE GOVERNMENT is a clear indicated that Estonian freedom is selective, and the society is anything but free. 


You, chime in and I quote ""Boohoo, a state worker got fired for making fun of, basically, its employer"". You literally think there is nothing wrong with silencing opposing views, if you happen to disagree with their message. You hate freedom.


&gt; But no - we're supposed to treat them as Latvians and Estonians


You're suppose to treat them as citizens, their race, heritage, and blindly following your nationalism are not requirements of being a full pledged citizen in a modern European nation. If you're too stupid to realize what you say is insanely racist and xenophobic, I don't know how else explain it to you.

How do you ""slip"" from 11 million to 30 ? How can I have $100 in my wallet made of two bills of $50, see them with my own eyes then proceed to ""slip"" and tell you I have $300.

Disregarding that entirely, how is eleven million not as bad...

I am a fan of pew research center myself but how can you account illegal immigrants accurately ?

I am a **legal** immigrant from Romania living in Spain and I've been here two years without leaving a single paper trail because I wasn't working, I had no accounts with my name on them of any type and any transaction I made was cash. I wasn't paying my own rent but you can rent places without showing up on some government census, in fact the place I live in right now is just an understanding between me and the owner. It is of course no longer the case cause I have a job, a bank account and pay taxes but if I could do that, what makes you think border-hopping mexicans looking for no good can't do it either ?

&gt; As for the last one about the swarm of immigrants, just lol. It's not reality in the US. It doesn't depict any foreseeable reality in the US.

&gt;&gt;foreseeable

Key is in the word foreseeable. Nobody thought millions of arabs and africans would march towards central and all the way to northen Europe either, until all the traitors in politics backed by the media said they could come and now [they are battering the border fences down in order to pass.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/12177750/Migrant-crowd-uses-battering-ram-to-break-open-Macedonia-fences.html)
I don't think at this point in time we have to pretend all of them are from Syria and fleeing from war. Way too much time passed since that claim was made and enough evidence came out that shows very few are actual fleeing from war or even Syria.

If whoever you elect in USA other than Trump starts to promote this just as aggressively as Merkel and the EU did, Mexicans will in fact come in hordes and it's going to be a lot easier for them than it is for those people you see above.
It's easy to come up with excuses. Really easy.


As for the rest of the points you addressed, I wasn't basing my politifact bashing on that single image alone. I've seen a lot of the supposed ""true facts"" presented on politifact completely demolished with sources and critical thinking over the last few months. I end up saving a lot of shit on my hard-drive and bookmarks but I won't go as far as to screencap /pol/ or reddit or any other source each time a comment destroys the narrative.

I've seen it with my own eyes how politifact put false on Trump's claim that most refugees are men and not fleeing from war.

I'm a philly sports fan in the four major US sports. the sixers and Phillies might as well not even exist. it's awful. the players don't care. the players who play against them don't care. and it goes on for seasons like that. I'd rather watch them get sent down to a lower league and scrap and claw a bit. I'd support that, but not this.

It's not just about promotion/relegation, playoffs play a part as well. Look at college basketball vs. college football. the tv ratings for college basketball regular season are abysmal compared to March Madness, that's because no one cares THAT much about seeding. whereas College football regular season is very very popular because each game matters. The NBA also suffers regular season fatigue because half the teams in the league qualify for the playoffs. 

The MLS has chosen a structure that places as little emphasis on regular seasons games as near possible. and chemistry and tactics are just as important in lop-sided matches as they are in equally poised matches, the burden is just skewed on the weaker team, but as whole it's just as important. and I prefer the richness of skill vs tactics one game, or class vs industriousness another, or tactics vs. tactics another. as opposed to the roughly same type of matchup you get every game in the MLS. and in the MLS towards the end of the season you'll be playing against a team that has literally nothing to play for. that almost never happens in the Euro leagues.

As for your points about PSG and Bayern, fair enough. But the Champions League does fix that. Fighting for spots in Europe are as entertaining as fighting for the title. And I like the fact that great teams can assemble, truly great teams. Like the Yankees of old. It adds character to the games that always spreading the wealth just doesn't.",t5_2qi58,1460355460,t3_48dame,-7,t1_d0ix2dl,

0,,d0j2mtk,Bardizbeh,1456811937,1,AskHistorians,1456812447,0,False,,"When Bosnia came under Austro-Hungarian imperial rule in the late 19th century, there were Muslims who posed the question of whether they should stay or emigrate to 'ulema. Rashid Rida (d. 1935) wrote a fatwa in which he affirmed that they should stay in Bosnia and that Muslim presence in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was indeed beneficial for Islam. Of course, most Muslims in the late 19th century lived under the rule of one European power or another.

The argument that a Muslim presence in a non-Muslim polity was actually beneficial for Islam was also made by the Lipka Tatars of Poland-Lithuania. In the 16th and 17th century they numbered a few hundred thousand, quite a large minority for the time. In the [*Risale-i Tatar-i Leh*](http://poloniaottomanica.blogspot.com/2014/02/seljuks-on-baltic-polish-lithuanian.html), it was argued that settlement in Poland (Lehistan)-Lithaunia helped spread Islam and that the rulers respected the Tatars’ military prowess and, concurrently, their religion. 

Khaled Abou El Fadl discusses the Sunni juristic discourse on this issue in an article in *Islamic Law and Society* (vol. 1, pp. 141-87) entitled “Islamic Law and Muslim Minorities: The Juristic Discourse on Muslim Minorities from the Second/Eighth to the Eleventh/Seventeenth Centuries.” As mentioned, the majoritarian opinion was that one should emigrate, if possible, from land under non-Muslim rule. However, as El Fadl shows, there was disagreement on this matter – and those such as the Lipka Tatars and Rashid Rida could find support for their arguments from certain premodern jurists. Of course, the historical reality was that millions of Muslims came under non-Muslim rule after the 12th century and many even migrated to places like China and coastal India, where there are still tens of millions of Muslims. 

El Fadl specifically talks about the case of the Iberian Peninsula at length. After the fall of Toledo (1085 CE), the Maliki jurists became increasingly strict about emigrating from non-Muslim polities. The Maliki madhhab had to deal with this issue at length relatively early because it was the dominant legal school in Iberia and Sicily. From reading the article, the Maliki jurists did not think highly of Muslims who chose to remain, out of choice, in a non-Muslim polity. Ibn Rushd even opined that such an individual's testimony in court is not credible. Unfortunately, I could not find anywhere in the article where El Fadl expressly says whether or not Muslims emigrated from land under non-Muslim rule out of a belief in the veracity of the juristic rulings on the issue.

&gt;  Description book **The Rebel by Albert Camus**:

&gt;  By one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of our century, The Rebel is a classic essay on revolution. For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the ""essential dimensions"" of human nature, manifested in man's timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history. And yet, with an eye toward t...

0,,d0j3c02,Zinegata,1456813680,2,AskHistorians,1456814947,0,False,,"&gt; As Hayden White correctly identifies in ""The Burden of History"", the First World War was the turning point for history's prized place between art and science in society. Before the war, “historical studies, if we include classics under that term, had formed the center of humanistic and social scientific studies...and it was therefore natural that they should become a prime target of those who had lost faith in mans capacity to make sense out of his situation” (120) The turning of the century had witnessed many European intellectuals discussing topics such as the 'end of war' (because the European had supposedly evolved beyond it) and the possibilities of science to save mankind. Young men of an entire generation were educated in the classics, and raised on the heady histories of glorious battle and pro patria mori .
&gt; History, which “was supposed to provide some sort of training for life...had done little to prepare men for the coming of the war” . Science was supposed to be a savior of mankind, just as it had saved history from becoming 'mere' literature. Instead, modern science had been turned against the creators themselves, for the first time, and the clash of 20th century weapons with 19th century tactics would see nearly an entire generation traumatized as their worldview was shattered before them, as captured by Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Historians, still caught in their struggle between art and science were unable to rise to the incredible challenge that the war presented: they were “incapable of rising above narrow partisan loyalties and making sense of the war in any significant way” (120) . Instead, historians had become frozen in the headlights, just as unprepared for the crisis as their students

While I agree that there was a malaise against history after the First World War, the rub of the matter is really _why_ history ""had done little to prepare men for the coming of the war"".

And unpopular reality is that these young men had been raised in the belief that militarism and imperialism were virtues. 

This is why they accepted mass conscription before the war, and why tens of thousands of German university students and later hundreds of thousands of Britons volunteered for service during it. History hadn't prepared them for the horrors of war because it was too busy telling them that _war is glorious_. National victories were emphasized and memorialized; while ancient defeats cited as causes of enmity against others. That the historians could not ""make sense of the war"" beside narrow partisan loyalties underlines the harsher reality - the historians had in fact been largely responsible for conditioning the young men into accepting war based on narrow partisan (national) lines. The only way to make sense of the war was, in fact, to admit they had been part of the problem to begin with.

Indeed, it can be argued that the _realization_ of the younger generation that they had been _conditioned_ into accepting militarism and imperialism was one of the prime factors that led to the current post-modernist world. It was an explicit _rejection_ of the old school of history that had helped condition a generation to accept what turned out not to be glory, but simply death in the trenches. 

Much of the same is happening now in some specific schools of history - such as the South's ""Lost Cause"" narrative - which is losing supporters in the face of the demographic transformation of the United States into a much more multi-cultural society. People will eventually decide for themselves what's in their best interest and will choose the historical narratives that apply to them. The problem with history is that it's still trying too hard to do the reverse; which is to impose narratives on audiences that may unsuited to them.

&gt;Abdelhamid Abaaoud told a friend of his cousin in the days following the attacks that it was easy for ISIS terrorists of all nationalities, including the British, to flood into Europe by mingling with migrants.
Posing as a Romanian vagrant, the 28-year-old Belgian also boasted of murdering 130 people 'like he'd just been shopping,' the woman revealed.

0,,d0j3d1n,Metalsand,1456813759,2,worldnews,False,0,False,,"&gt;  And the current decline in oil prices due to the reckless uncapped production in the middle east is only making gas prices decrease, which results in making it more viable for use in both big business and home use.

That is a whole other situation entirely.  Speculation is that the negotiations to remove the embargos on Iran were in order to drive the price of oil down as a response to Russia's recent aggression, and the fact that ISIS/ISIL have been selling oil from captured facilities (albeit illegally).  

However, I...have no clue what the fuck you're talking about with ""and allow Eastern energy companies to prevail"".  Currently, the only countries interested in renewable energy are mostly European countries and US &amp; Canada.  In fact, the USA has one of the biggest ongoing research projects to create viable fusion reactors.

If anything, reducing our dependency on oil would weaken the position of other countries, but irregardless, do you know why the USA imports so much oil despite having large untapped regions available?  It does so because IF a country wants to put a squeeze on it, USA can tell them to go fuck themselves and start using local resources in an emergency.

As for oil companies and their funding of renewable energy, I do agree with you that it's not completely financially viable.  It's hilarious to watch people who think it's all some sort of conspiracy to keep us dependent on oil...the great thing about capitalism, is that if someone does it better, they can own the entire market.  Although, one thing you said, ""And do you really trust them to come up with the innovations"" really contradicts your earlier statement.  I...honestly have no clue what you even mean by that.  If you're referring to middle eastern countries developing alternative energy sources, you're sorely mistaken, since the governments, especially Saudi Arabia, are still governed by hereditary monarchies who spend billions on frivolous personal items and do little else.  Even if they could stop for one second and reallocate such funds, they don't have the infrastructure or need to perform such research.  ",t5_2qh13,1460355866,t3_48dhs1,2,t1_d0j1pak,

Hell, I got stabbed in Vancouver.

Though I think South America takes the cake when it comes to people just getting wrecked.  Lots of very violent thieves and murderers, even ""safe"" areas aren't really safe.

Turkey in my opinion is very much like America or Europe when it comes to backpacking, cities and towns are good, but middle of nowhere is horrible.  Then there are places like Thailand where the tourist infrastructure is so good that wandering is encouraged.

TL;DR Not a specific Turkey problem, just an issue of being easy prey in a secluded place.",t5_2qqjc,1460355955,t3_48e4ss,118,t1_d0izd2r,

&gt;And your entire bemoaning of the loss of British culture has more to do with you not partaking than any Muslim just being a Muslim.

You're seriously deluded. Muslim ghettos and no-go zones for whites such as parts of luton, tower hamlets, places where it is perfectly possibly to live in Britain without knowing a word of english.

I suggest you start reading the news, maybe head on over r/europe, r/worldnews, and r/european to read up a little and get to grips with reality. And let's not forget that statistic that 1/4 of british muslims supported the charlie hebdo terrorists.

Here, use this to begin your research, it's a documentary on muslim demographics as told by Raheel Raza: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSPvnFDDQHk

Watch it. And tell me we don't have a problem with extremist islam in Britain. Islam itself is a disgusting plague that should never have entered the west, but that's a different topic entirely.

Also, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/48dcvv/sharia_courts_in_the_uk_are_run_by_extremists/

I am now 34 and the boy is 14, his sister just turned 13. My wife and i are still together married 14 years now. It has been fun growing up as a parent. I am sure we have made many mistakes along the way, but we have fun. 
 
I continued on through school for my computer engineering degree while my wife worked nights. It was rough, she was working a 7pm to 7am shift. She would come home and get a couple hours of sleep before I had to leave for class. I would get the kids ready for bed and be up all night doing homework. Paid off in the end, she got layed off the day I started my real job. She hasn't worked since and got to be a stay at home mom (her choice). I was also able to get a master's later on while working. Looking back it was crazy, we were young, didn't need sleep and didn't know any better.

 
We are in a similar spot as others, parents with kids the same age are just shy of my parents age, people our age have babies and toddlers. The thing I think we missed out on is making friends, but it is getting easier now that the kids have their own life. Coworkers are always shocked when they hear I have teenage kids and they are much older with younger ones kids. I guess most professionals waited till later in life.
 
The good job has helped minimize the earning gap between us and folks with similar age kids, though we are behind where we would be if we did not have kids early. I don't even the 60+ year old dad's with middle schoolers. I am happy we have been able to travel with the kids, they have been all over Europe with multiple trips, Philippines, Hong Kong, Korea and trips to Hawaii, Mexico and other fun destinations.

My wife and I are now looking to only 5 more years before the kids are graduating high school and we know it will fly by quickly. We expect our life to take many more changes :)",t5_2qh1i,1460356042,t3_48b1x8,1,t3_48b1x8,

You shouldn't have much of a problem with English on EU servers, there will be plenty of British players and lots of other people speak English well even when it's their second language. Also in this game chat channels are based on language so if you're in the English chat channels you won't have people speaking French in it. 

Speaking as a fellow Brit who has lived in America I can tell you that I have always had FAR more fun in European guilds in games than American ones. Americans are well, American, they just don't think the same way as us and it's unbearable when they start ranting about their guns and how much they love Donald Trump.

&gt;  Description book **The Complete Maus by Art Spiegelman**:

&gt;  Combined for the first time here are Maus I: A Survivor's Tale and Maus II - the complete story of Vladek Spiegelman and his wife, living and surviving in Hitler's Europe. By addressing the horror of the Holocaust through cartoons, the author captures the everyday reality of fear and is able to explore the guilt, relief and extraordinary sensation of survival - and how the children of survivors are...

Turkey is a 2nd world country. It's got a big tourism industry because it's relatively politically stable, it has plenty of coast line, it's very cheap compared to Western Europe and the weather is fantastic. Plenty of people could visit a resort in Turkey and think it's a modern well developed country comparable to Western Europe, but once you go away from the resorts or more inland you see how underdeveloped it is.

It's a gatekeeper to progression - especially when the continued growth of a country is limited to it's GDP (mind you america is debt is now beyond it's GDP and growing outside of it daily - it has actually been reported multiple times that America is getting to a point where it will eventually just be using its GDP to pay off it's accrued interest rather than the debt itself.) Now I'm not sure how much you understand about finance so I won't assume anything - but the basic function of a loan is to delay the return of said value until such time that you can, or you pay it off over time. If you cannot - the banks foreclose your house or whatever and you become bankrupt. What happens if a country cannot repay the debt it owes to a bank which literally creates perpetual debt? You will eventually experience the worst global financial meltdown of all time. So - whilst your very poorly drawn picture of why borrowing is good partially makes sense the larger picture at hand is far more realistic. Greece for example is a country which told it's citizens that the were not allowed to take  money out whilst their country was 265% in debt of their GDP, how does that even make sense? I mean I know WHY they did it - to stop a total financial meltdown of the country, but image you went to take out 20 dollars to go and by some bread or your bill and rent payments defaulted... how would you feel that the money you ""earned"" was now not yours? (which a) it never is and b) they couldn't even cover the interest on their loan with their GDP at this time too btw) If the EU didnt bail them out with an egregiously heavily interest inflated loan of some ridiculous number - you'd be looking at the first forth world european nation. Whilst there are some countries at the moment which borrow less than their GDP - many of them will not be in that state in the coming years. On a global scale our economy becomes more and more unstable the larger our debt grows - this issue is that we can't never not be in debt because to be in the debt to the federal banks is HOW you and I have legal tender. To me - that sounds like a pyramid scheme - but whats worse is - it continues to gatekeep major progress in our technological advancements, advancements which would put major companies out of business in replace of other companies and so forth.

Islam is more violent these days because:

- It was designed for different, more aggressive, political goals than the other religions.

- It has been more effective in maintaining the political structures it created. This makes it more true to its origins.

I'll elaborate and compare these religions:

Political goals:

- Judaism was designed to maintain a nation state in a tiny but  strategic area, coveted by empires.

- Christianity was originally designed to rebel against an empire. Then it was adopted by said empire and was redesigned to consolidate the empire.

- Islam was designed to conquer a new empire from scratch. That's what makes it so expansionist and violent to these days.

Maintaining political structures:

- The Jewish nation lost its state 2000 years ago, after a millenium of some autonomy there. After several attempts to regain the land which ended with genocides, they lost their fighting spirit for more than a millenium.

- Christianity did a poor job in maintaining the western Roman empire, and it collapsed 2 centuries after adopting the religion. The religion did manage to keep Europe under some form of a loosely connected political system for 1000 years, before its inevitable decline. Black plague, reformation, imperialism, world wars, secularism.

- Islam managed to keep some form of central political-religious  authority up until 100 years ago.

The Government has been scruing with Healthcare for decades now. The whole system is bloated and inflated with costs.

&gt;There's examples of Privatisation done really well, and there's example of privatisation done really badly

Only if you look at it in a boolean way. If you analyze the situation economically, privatization never harms the economy. Often harms people, but that is usually inevitable. 

&gt;There's a lot of economists that argue governmental monopoly in certain sectors results in a better outcome

And by a lot you mean a select few whose arguments get destroyed by critics. By all means, provide me with an example of these ""economists"".

&gt;A lot of which end up with the same or better levels of care for overall cheaper societal cost

Those ""Government"" run healthcares of other countries are less restrictive than the US's ""Private"" healthcare. We are also talking average. If you look at healthcare for the upper middle class and wealthy, US crushes everyone like no tomorrow.

&gt;A private monopoly seeks to exert control over pricing to maximize profits, often at the expense of the consumer. A government monopoly can, but doesn't often have that primary goal. It's primary goal is to lower costs, which may sound similar but is entirely different

Very flawed. I will give you a basic example.

In a private system, i will start my company, charge a lot for the drug to break even at some point. I am happy with the money, the customer is happy to be alive (Though they might not be happy with the price). Eventually competition sets in, and i have to lower the price of my drug.

In a government run healthcare, i will never develop the drug in the first place, as the government will force me to price it very cheap and i will never make any money. The government will instead import the drug for the private healthcare country for cheap, which the company would be willing to do for side money. After all, those countries are not their target market.

In your fantasy scenario i still start my company, am forced to sell for real cheap, and still somehow stay afloat. This simply does not happen in reality. 

All these unjustifiably high prices are always solely due to corruption. A company will buy some decades old drug that had it's license extended and charge stupid money for it. If not for that license extension, others would produce that drug for a much cheaper price.

&gt; It acts to set the standard, this is what society is expected to provide regarding your health, if you want more then you can definitely pay for that, but if you can't then you're at least given a good level of care.

While i completely agree that it hurts virtually no one for basic health care, what happens if everyone goes on basic ""free"" healthcare? The whole system collapses unless you start to tax more, at which point people are paying for it in essence anyway.

On a side note, you are completely ignoring population. US has 350 million people. EU has 500 million with almost 30 separate healthcare ""monopolies"" that are extremely close to each other and do compete. It is pretty misleading to say EU countries are a proof that government healthcare works very well.

It took me over a year or may be two. It started from that I would not read Ayn Rand from ideological stand point, and ended with me wondering that may be I should give it a try.

**Distrust in Communism and communists:**

My main beef with communism, and I was not anarchistic, was that too many people have died and to many comrades were bloodthirsty, the standard of life was always to low. Not enough, I was believing, still do, that Stalin was a despot who stole his power and that USSR was not a communism. I started hopping for USSR 2.0, searching for people with high morals and good ethics to make a syndicate and start growing communism inside current structures. The problem with that was that people in general were starting to fight in between them petty power and control.

*Joke: A team of 500 is sent to build a kolhoz in far corners of Georgia, after few weeks they send message: colhoz is built, systems and bureaucracy set, moral is high, you can send us workers.*

Then I began doubting: 

1. many communist all around the world, all receive paycheck either from capitalist institutions(like Lenin did), from tyrants;
2. people do not seem to be receptive to the idea of work and responsibility for  communal property with Colhoz as the most glaring failure of USSR;
3. sadly capitalism was doing exactly that what I wanted but actually succeeding...

**Distrust in capitalism and keynesians:**

I did not knew any economy, but had a course of economics in university. Keynesianism was full of dumb notions though, like shovel ready projects that in a communist society were unacceptable, because they were just wasting precious human resources. This staff would be the reason why I would never become Keynesian. But I very like the staff about supply x demand, because it seamed very true at pure instinctual level.

**Distrust in goverments:**

So I became a moderate capitalism with strong social leaning and a desire to keep govt and capitalist in check as much as fucking possible.

Then I started learning history of US. And I tell you in where I am from every one believes that 9/11 was real, but every one also knows that USSR would have taken USA long long time a go if we believe the media narrative. Main argument was  about USA war machine incapable of defending Pentagon and NY. Complete joke. Those are passenger planes and they are very easy to pick off, so they were let to fly all the way to there destination and kill thousands of people more. This is semi official theory where I lived.

The saudi origin of terrorists and Saddam, as was Mubarak, a USA imperialist tool was unknow to people only in the USA and EU and their vassals. Notice that jet fuel was ""NEVER"" an argument outside of USA. I do not understand or can explain why people bring it all the time, but do not go for plain and easy explanations: you think Russia was capable, or any other country, of crushing it's two super sonic jets into twins and pentagon? No way.

So at the end I was left with semi working capitalism system, govt's that are equally murderous **everywhere**, USSR == USA.

**Afterword**

Then I found libertarianism and finally read Ayn Rand after that. I dived into Austrian economics at the same time. The rest of the journey is much less interesting.

My morals have actually stayed the same all this time: all live is precious, humanity needs to prosper in order to save itself. The question was ""which tool is more effective"". So the the main argument that make me switch actually was not a moral one, but utilitarian one the served my core morals, because at the end of the day capitalism and communism are tools/utilities and I wanted to ""get"" a good result.

**TL;DR: until you learn basic Austrian economics it is not possible for you to like capitalism, as it was impossible for me.**",t5_3cct3,1460357241,t3_47kzl4,1,t1_d0j50sm,

&gt;  Description book **Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault**:

&gt;  Barely two hundred and fifty years ago man condemned of attempting to assassinate the King of France was drawn and quartered in a grisly spectacle that suggested an unmediated duel between the violence of the criminal and the violence of the state. This groundbreaking book by the most influential philosopher since Sartre compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the ...

**Refugees weep as they are welcomed in Germany by mob shouting 'go home'**

&gt;Holy shit these comments are horrible. [not op]
&gt;&gt;These comments are pretty awesome in my opinion, people have finally woken up and are willing to defend their homelands and fight against their treacherous governments that sold them out. That money would be better spent helping Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon with paying for their migrant camps. It is more cost effective to do it that way. These migrants will have the government spend €40,000-50,000 per year per person while in Romanian pensioners are forced to live off of about $86 per month. Merkel will talk about ""EU solidarity and EU values"" while we have millions of poor EU citizen to take care of but we are abandoning to spend that money instead on non-EU citizens in the most inefficient way possible. People are pissed.

Another comment:

&gt;BLM is a racist movement and people are tired of it. Defacing BLM slogans is very similar to defacing KKK slogans. People are tired of both BLM and the KKK.

 

&gt;TL;DR: Africa has problems with transport because anything that isn't guarded gets stolen.


 

&gt;Seriously, Hispanics and Asian don't tolerate the nonsense Black people do because you can't give them the White guilt trips that White people keep falling for even though they weren't alive during slavery. A lot of Black people might not realize this but White people are now their greatest allies because they are the only ones still somewhat willing to listen to them. When Whites become a minority in this country in the next couple of decades Hispanics and Asian will not tolerate their nonsense. Then they will regret the things that they are doing now like rioting, looting, and attacking people while shouting Black Power and Black Lives Matter. White people will still tolerate it because they are afraid of being accused of racism but many Hispanics and Asians couldn't care less about being called racist and will fight back. We saw this in the LA riots when Koreans went on the roofs and were more than willing to shoot at Black criminals to protect their lives, their families, and their livelihoods.",t5_386ix,1460357372,t3_48fe5c,23,t3_48fe5c,

&gt;*Norway and Switzerland — who pay for access to the single market but have no influence over the regulations they must accept — would weaken our control over our economic affairs.""*

~ *Lord Rose 2015*

Bloomberg:-

&gt;*Norway also has far larger costs in accessing EU’s internal market as a member of the European Economic Area. Western Europe’s biggest crude producer contributes roughly 860 million euros ($948 million) annually to help implement EU policy and for programs designed to reduce economic disparities within the bloc, according to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry.*

David Cameron:-

&gt;*""Norway pays as much per head to the EU as we do"".*

**Evidence against the speakers**:-

https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/europapolitikk/tema-norge-eu/okonomiske-bidrag/id684932/

&gt;*How much does Norway pay to be part of the EEA agreement?

**Norway does not pay to have access to the Single Market.**
 
&gt;*The EEA/EFTA countries do not contribute financially to the EU budget but have established their own financial mechanism, EEA Grants, which are managed in cooperation with the beneficiary states. Norway contributes to reducing social and economic disparities in the European Union through the EEA Grants.*

http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85795

In The Deadly Grip of ""Europe"":-

&gt;*Yet, according to the Norwegian government's own figures, its total EU mandated payments (gross) are approximately £435m (€600m) per annum. With a population of five million, that is approximately £86 (€120) per head (gross). Net payments, however, are about £340m (€470m) per annum, or about £68 (€94) per head.*

&gt;*On the other hand, in 2014, the UK gross contributions to the EU were £19.2bn, less £4.9bn rebate. That gives an equivalent gross payment of £14.3bn. After receipts, our net contribution was £9.8 bn.*

&gt;*With a population of 64 million, that puts our gross contribution (without rebate) at £300 per head, our equivalent gross payment at £223 per head, and our net per capita payment £153 per annum – more than twice the Norwegian payments.*

* Norway: £68 (€94) per head
* UK: net per capita payment £153 per annum

&gt;**As such, what David Cameron is telling us is a lie.**

**[UK pays] more than twice the Norwegian payments.**

We're not far from breaking the EU-Centric stranglehold on the concept of Regional cooperation despite all the political prestige and power over the media by the Pro-EU deceptive actors.

&gt; In fact, in the West there are far more Muslims leaving Islam than people converting to it.

Source? 

I'd say number of Muslims leaving Islam is insignificant, so [Europe’s Muslim population is projected to increase by 63%, growing from 43 million in 2010 to 71 million in 2050.](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/europe/)

As an European from a fairly ethnically homogenous country (= never really had to deal with minority identities) I'm often baffled at the amount of ethnic essentialism purporting to be answers to these questions. The top post is a perfect example. ""Asians"" repress their feelings, ""we"" are not storytellers...I mean, if that's your answer, it's not really a surprise that the roles assigned to Asian Americans are stereotypes, then, is it?
For an outsider it's difficult to understand the degree of significance racial identities holds in the US. Ta-Nehisi Coates took me a bit of the way, but I guess I'll never understand how a third-generation Asian American would feel somehow deeply connected to Korean or Thai cinema or why an African American would be *a priori* emotionally connected to Africa.

* I'm assuming you're from England, therefore have no local club. Is that correct? If you have any American ties (family in the Americas), you could maybe choose a ""local"" club based off your family ties. 

* What do you value the most as a fan? The success of the club you support or fan culture? 

* Who do you support in England? I can try to recommend a similar team in MLS

The middle east is filled with hundreds of millions of muslims who can't stop killing each other despite 1 language and 1 god, and yet somehow the europeans have united hundreds of millions of people despite hundreds of languages and gods.

Europe developed to become the pinnacle of human civilisation, a bastion of medical, technological, political, and cultural development and its people have enjoyed levels of personal freedom (and religious freedom!) the likes of which have never been equalled throughout our history as a species.

I'd scrap D-day, though. The lack of heavy weapons on the Reichs side means we can do much better. How about landing in Denmark, or directly in Northwest Germany?

Because this would mean shorter supply lines, the western allies might actually Reach Berlin first this time. ""invading in winter"" jokes aside Russia is fucking huge, and not having access to Trains makes it a slow undertaking to push eastwards.

--------------------------------------
There is no way to hold the tide for long. tanks and machine guns are too big advantages. Armour will lower casualities by a lot, too.

1) This late in the war, I don't see what the Reich can do. Even when listening to your generals, it is too late for anything to turn it, especially considering the massive tech disadvantage

3) Grenades and mines would slow the allies down slightly, but it is not a viable counter for tanks and machine guns.

4: The Allied air force would still outnumber the luftwaffe, and because of their range, they can launch from Britain, which would be wise condidering the supply issues. Forward air bases will likely not be worth it with such an old school supply system.

5): This one is nasty. The allies will be almost defenseless against the luftwaffe, who will bomb Britain and everything else with impunity. It is doable, but would require massive fleets to keep the supply lanes safe and Heavy Investment in AA-weapons to keep the luftwaffe away. It would be slow, it would be bloody, but The allies still have absurd manufacturing advantages, and i would see them prevail sooner or later.  
The german ground troops are basically irrelevant in this scenario. It will be luftwaffe who does all the lifting here.

------------------------------------
What do you mean about 2)?  
Do the rest of europe lose their guns and vehicles as well. or do they not? France and czechoslovakia had some of the worlds best tanks at the start of WW2, and czechoslovakia made lots of tanks for the nazi forces. not sure about them, but France had a large, modern army, at the start of the war, Germany basically defeated them through near-suicidal reclessness and risktaking, combined with a French millitary who did not get good enough orders to take advantage of this.

&gt;  In 1943, Primo Levi, a twenty-five-year-old chemist and ""Italian citizen of Jewish race,"" was arrested by Italian fascists and deported from his native Turin to Auschwitz.

so? i'm not in Russia atm.

&gt; Free media, freedom to criticize the government, freedom to protest etc are far weaker in Russia.

looking on your media and your ""freedoms"" i think that's there is nothing special in it, Russians can do all you listed without any problems. Problems started only for few involved in other murky activities. Russians had a lot of protests and? Recently march in memory of Nemtsov. When you had something like that last time?

This ranking are bullshit read section ""criticism"" on wiki. It's kinda ridiculous when Russian ranked lower then Saudi Arabia.

&gt; By what standard is Merkel a dictator?

she's staying on power too long you know. And i probably don't like her. That's why lol. What is the reason to call Putin a dictator? Does not he democratically elected and don't election recognized as fair in whole world? It's our internal business but he surely representing the majority of Russian people look at his ratings.

&gt; You really believe that? Gosh..

do you really believe you can? I see you operating empty words about ""freedom"" when you have no idea what staying behind them. What is ""free media"" (i read this free media every day and able to compare with russian media) whet is ""freedom to criticize"" (there is submit it made where ""russian liberal"" openly not only criticizing government but also yelling about ""the revolution""), what is freedom of protest? Also don't forget to pick a few anchors to compare Russian position relative to them. And maybe then you'll have an idea what actually Russia is, in your case you never been in Russia and don't have actual experience living in Russia, and when actual Russians telling you that it's not like you imagine you're yelling about ""kremlin"".

0,,d0j7782,mercurybeverage,1456826785,-4,Suomi,1456827625,0,False,,"I think the Finnish identity originates from the division of Swedish immigrants and the original inhabitants who came here from Baltics and East Europe. From there originates the paradox mindset of not being really part of anything and being part of nordic states. Other Nordics don't really see finns as part of their family, as fellow Nordics. I think there is this collective shame of our roots, and we're pretty much incapable of feeling unity with, nor otherwise reach our past in emotional level.

Swedish immigrants started developing the area where we now live into a nation, but the division was harsh and hostile. Later, Russians took over the land and once again the original people (now with slight mixture of nordic genes) were depressed by foreign occupation.

The fabrication of collective cultural and national identity started here and it went on in fast pace up until the nineties and stopped at the EU-membership. Since then division inside the nation has been waking up again, as the country has been robbed from its collective accomplishments by it's political and business elite in the past 20 years.

Finns are one of the most youngest western countries with very short history and a very artificial cultural identity.

So if you ask a Finn about his or her cultural identity, you'll get an answer thats a lie. He or she simply does not know. There may be desires belonging to the admirable collective of Nordic nations or maybe even foregone conclusions that we're Western Europeans, but we're not. 

We are primarily our own nation, a very recent social experiment with lots of good intentions originating from self loathing and shame. We're Finns.",t5_2qlq3,1460357744,t3_48dpu2,-4,t3_48dpu2,

My fiance is white and I'm black and we live in Europe. We get lots of dirty looks from people. Lots is a subjective term  of course but in my books, one dirty look is one too many. We've also had people loudly whispering stuff that we were clearly meant to hear. So I understand your situation.


How do we deal with it? We don't.

As you pointed out, people backtrack and get defensive.

So what do we do? We go about our business giving no fucks to negative energy. Literally just let it roll off your back. Don't let strangers stop you from dining out with your father or going shopping with him. So what if they whisper or stare? They're wasting their breath and you have no reason to focus on how they are reacting to you.

My advice is if it's random people on the street staring, ignore them. It's background noise. What matters are the father daughter moments you're sharing with your father in that instant. If people providing you a service are giving you weird looks, you ask them if there is a problem. If they say no then you say good, and move on. 

You do not owe it to the world to explain or justify your interactions to the world.

People get looked at for being really tall, really fat, really skinny, for being ugly, for being beautiful, for having a disability, for their fashion choice, for being different. That kind of unwanted, often misguided attention isn't going to stop. So don't let it hold you back. If you let it bother you, you and your father are the only ones that get hurt. Everyone else forgets about you after 2 minutes. You just have to avert those judgemental looks without breaking your stride or letting it affect your mood.

You and your father have a good relationship. He went to great lengths to have you in his life. You've suffered great losses together and you support each other. That is beautiful and something to take pride in. Don't let passers by detract from that. You have a great father, don't hold back from making the most of it ;-)

&gt; The U.S., Canadian, German and Japanese ambassadors signed a letter dated Jan. 27 addressed to State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Guo Shengkun, voicing unease about the new counterterrorism law, the draft cyber security law, and a draft law on management of foreign non-governmental organizations.

&gt; The EU ambassador used the same phrase to describe the law&amp;#039;s impact, and both letters expressed an interest in engaging with China as it worked out implementing regulations around the law, to try to mitigate those concerns.

&gt; The Japanese embassy said: &amp;quot;We pay attention to Chinese movement over relevant laws or drafts of laws.""

Almost no coverage in the federal news and no information about them after that.

We don't have as much problems as europe, but we have some. Open borders with former soviet southern mostly muslim shithole republics is one of them.

&gt; * Soni Sori, the Adivasi activist who was herself raped in custody, and detained for several years before being acquitted, has also come under attack.

&gt; * It is perhaps no coincidence that the hounding out of lawyers and journalists from Bastar, and the attack on Soni Sori, comes on the heels of a series of reports of mass violence by security forces.

&gt;If you bought a good or a service online or outside of a shop (by telephone, mail order, from a door-to-door salesperson), you also have the right to cancel and return your order within 14 days, for any reason and with no justification.


The 14-day ""cooling off"" period does not apply, among others, to:

    plane and train tickets, as well as concert tickets, hotel bookings, car rental reservations and catering services for specific dates
    goods and drinks delivered to you by regular delivery – for example delivery by a milkman.
    goods made to order or clearly personalised – such as a tailor-made suit
    sealed data carriers, such as DVDs, which you have unsealed upon receipt.
    !!online digital content, if you have started downloading or streaming it!!
    goods bought from a private individual rather than a company
    urgent repairs and maintenance contracts – if you call a plumber to repair a leaking shower, you can't cancel the work once you have agreed on the price of the service.

Because the stories are *true*. Sure, the list is biased, and it wouldn't be so biased if we were allowed to mix in those stories on the other geodefault subs, but the fact is we can't because it doesn't fit the narrative there.

&gt;do we not have christian presidential candidates in America threatening to repeal gay marriage?

No, and the president in america isn't the be all end all. 


&gt;You can't have thought crime

Correct, but we will see *actual* crime. And we *are* seeing actual crime. Actual cases of people murdering old muslim men just for being who they are, cases of FGM, cases of females being oppressed because they live in insular communities under islamic rule.

In fact, I've even known 1 muslim girl keeping her white boyfriend and her non-virginity a secret from her entire muslim family because she's scared of what they'll do to her when her arranged marriage finally happens.

I've never supported violence against anyone, I want change in government policy. I actually would support violence to defend europe's borders, but that's because invasions are violent by nature. 

I don't want to round people up and concentrate them into camps. But I see the tension rising to boiling points on the continent, as it happening in Norway and Germany, and I see the same thing starting to happen here. There will be more, and more violence.

You might think someone like me would enjoy reading a story about an old muslim man being beaten to death but I can assure you I'd rather no one got killed. But that's not the way things are going is it",t5_2qhqb,1460358205,t3_48dafh,2,t1_d0j7zxy,

0,,d0j88la,communismrules123,1456831110,1,AskHistorians,False,0,False,,"The Soviet Union wasn't around for WWI, the Russian Revolutions and the Russian Civil War happened during and after WWI, the USSR wasn't formed until 1922.

As for WWII, the only direct action that the USSR did that could've been interpreted as helping the start of WWII is the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, signed August 23rd, 1939.

Stalin was very suspicious of the western powers treatment to Germany. Because of their policy of appeasement towards the Nazi government, Stalin, being the paranoid leader he was, feared that the allied powers would rather be accommodated with Hitler than ally the Soviets should Germany ever invade the Soviet Union.

This idea was further reinforced by the fact that the Stalin's repeated request for a formal alliance being denied every time he brought it up, including as recent as August 15th, 1939.

However, the real reason why the offers for the alliance were rejected was because Poland kept on refusing any alliance, fearing that an alliance with the USSR would cause for immediate hostile relations with the Germans and accelerate the war. The British and French could not force the Polish to accept the aid of the USSR or to formally recognize any alliance that could've been made.

At this point, it was well known to the west that this will end up being disastrous to them. Former Prime Minister and MP David Lloyd George even said ""If we are going in without the help of Russia we are walking into a trap. It is the only country whose arms can get there.... If Russia has not been brought into this matter because of certain feelings the Poles have that they do not want the Russians there, it is for us to declare the conditions, and unless the Poles are prepared to accept the only conditions with which we can successfully help them, the responsibility must be theirs.""

The Poles continued to refuse and the British and French governments weren't prepared yet to make the final conditions that Poland would have to choose or to be left to their own responsibilities, and the war broke out before they could be made.

Now here comes the Nazis foreign policy towards the Soviets.

Stalin had absolutely no interest in Poland, no claims he wished to pursue, no plans to invade Poland. Hitler, however, stated in March of 1939, his clear intentions to invade Poland had they not succeeded control of the Danzig Corridor to them.

Why did Stalin agree to this pact then? For two reasons, one is that it ensures peace between the USSR and Germany for the present and to officially expand the Soviets ""Sphere of Influence"", which, to Stalin, meant annexation to help further expand the Soviet Union to protect from the German Menace, the second point is beyond the scope of your question.

Yet again, why did Stalin agree to the pact? Defense. He didn't want to be attacked by the Germans without any allies to back him up.

Why did Hitler agree to the pact? Hitler was great at grand strategy and he learned from WWI. He knew a two front war would've been disastrous for Germany. He wanted to ensure that he could attack Poland safely, then invade the low countries and France, and presumably Britain prior to the USSR, keeping things primarily on one front at a time. It also isn't unthinkable that Hitler also anticipated Stalin to do something with his newly acquired sphere, whether be it annex, puppet, or complete exploitation, not only giving Hitler even more justification for attacking the Soviets, and also driving potential allies away from the Soviet Union due to their relative threat, discourage the Allied powers to take in the Soviet Union as an ally, and allowing the German army to capture cities annex by the Soviets with much more ease than historic Russian cities could have been some ideas he could've had in consideration when organizing the pact.

Now the very core of your question: Did the Soviet Union directly  cause WWII? Directly, they did not. Directly, the cause of WWII is largely accepted to be when Germany attacked Poland.

What about indirectly causing WWII? Well, in August of 1939, Germany was fully mobilized, and armies were already deployed at the Polish border before the Soviet non-aggression pact, so it is very much in the realm of possibility that Hitler was prepared to invade even if the efforts to negotiate a deal with the Soviets doesn't break through.

Sorry this answer is so long! The prewar politics in Europe was anything but simple!

TL;DR version: the USSR didn't start the second world war, however there might have been things they were able to do to prevent the war or to lessen the extent of it.",t5_2ssp3,1460358233,t3_48avah,1,t3_48avah,

for the most part pretty accurate predictions imo, with a few that I disagree with a lot:

puCK (20%) VS MarineLorD (80%) - I don't think many people are aware how good puck has gotten in lotv. He's never been able to crush the live tournaments, but he's been crushing the KR ladder with 250+ ping maintaining top16 gm. I'd say more like 45-55 in favor of marinelord.

HuK (75%) VS PiG (25%) - I think this comes down to who has been practicing more lately, which im unaware of. Neither have been dominate foreigners in lotv, but I think you might underestimate how solid pig is when he's in good form. Id give this matchup like 60-40 in favor of huk.

MaNa (45%) VS PiLiPiLi (55%) - This one probably confuses me the most. Did PiLi do something incredible that I missed recently? Mana had been streaming consistently until I think a few weeks ago so he could hide his builds. Mana hasn't been crushing koreans or anything but I still think he's top 5 eu protoss. PiLi's live tournament results are almost non-existent while Mana's have been exceptional. I'd give this one to Mana 75-25

Kelazhur (20%) VS Neeb (80%) - Neeb has been a monster in lotv, but the same can be said about Kelazhur lately. Neeb is still favored, but I think it's more like 60-40.",t5_2qpp6,1460358297,t3_48eryh,1,t3_48eryh,

As I previously said: I do get that many got it. I did as well.
But seeing as so many did not get this information,
something is off.

When you have well over a hundred people (that we know of) on reddit complaining about the exact same thing,
and they have stated both that the pre-orders end on the 3rd of March, and 28th of February, it's easy to get confused.

Just because you and many others got it because they were informed, does not mean that they should post this information after the pre-order ended on the ""news"" section.

It's just plain wrong, and without a doubt in the grey-zone.

You are trying to argue that people should see it, because you did.
That's not how the world works.

People did not know, because their site is\was un-informative, and I agree. The information is missing, and SHOULD be on the FRONTpage and the page where you choose to purchase.
Why? Especially because the names of the packages are the same,
so people just hearing about the game will go to the front-page and see that package X and Y can play soon, so they go to purchase and see that package X and Y are sold. They buy it,
and THEN get informed that they don't get to play before the 3rd.

I don't get what's so hard to get with that.

I've been working in sales my whole life, and while I've encountered this in companies I've worked as well, and even in the one I'm in now. It's still wrong, and should be dealt with.

When people react to it, something is wrong and should be fixed. It's that easy. Does not matter how many knew or did not know.
The information is too bad on their site. It's as easy as that.

Edit:

As a test, I now went on to their site.
I watched the front-page and saw nothing about pre-order etc.
I saw the news, and the latest news info is the following:
https://www.blackdesertonline.com/news/view/64

""Head start for Conqueror’s package holders starts the 28th of February, 08:00 UTC.
Head start for Explorer’s package holders starts the 1st of March, 08:00 UTC.
Head start for Traveler’s package holders start the 2nd of March, 08:00 UTC.""

Alright. So I see a few different packages that gets to start at X and Y. Fine.

I then go to the purchase-section, because I now know the information I want to know.
Oh.. The ""Explorer's Package"" is sold? - Nice. I'll buy that so I can play right now.

Yes, it DOES say under the 3rd post on the news under ""DO NOT MISS THE KEY DATES"".
This does not matter.
It should be listed under ""purchase"" and\or the latest news-post.

There's a reason for this being mandatory in certain countries,
and as another redditor stated, it's actually not legal in the UK, and it's not in many other EU-countries either.
Mine included.

A company should never assume that people read up on old news, and then just forget or don't want to put the information on their purchase-page. It does not work like that. It's either a bad job, or they have done something shady.

And since so many are complaining about it, I assure you something are most likely done afterwards.

Edit: And they have now fixed it. Since they've fixed it, it seems like it WAS an issue after all.",t5_2w6ir,1460358392,t3_48f83z,1,t1_d0j7nvu,

All of our countries are waking up to some extent, but there's no precedent.  One country, one man defying all of the odds, being bombastic and unapologetic and calling the EU crisis exactly what it is could cause a domino effect in the exact opposite direction.

I'd like to believe we'd come to our western allies aid as well (AFTER they take care of their own Merkel's and such) even though I am firm nationalist, western civilization has to stick together.  If we can start a revolution here, maybe it spreads.  We can get our power back and tell the establishment, the globalists and the economic migrants to get fucked.

Lets assume the summary is accurate. 315 is not a huge number for a sample size. How as this sample chosen? 

Are they comparing to the general population? A lot of people are divorced, have experienced death, or imprisonment etc, I would argue that a loving same sex partnership is better than a single family where the family head is drug addict that's been to jail, so I don't know if they are comparing apples to apple. I'm guess they are not though.

Here's another study, I don't have time to read it fully and in detail at the moment but the conclusion is interesting. The sample size seems much bigger and the selection process more nuanced. 

""Do children need a married mother and father to turn out well as adults? No, if we observe the many anecdotal accounts with which all Americans are familiar. Moreover, there are many cases in the NFSS where respondents have proven resilient and prevailed as adults in spite of numerous transitions, be they death, divorce, additional or diverse romantic partners, or remarriage. But the NFSS also clearly reveals that children appear most apt to succeed well as adults—on multiple counts and across a variety of domains—when they spend their entire childhood with their married mother and father, and especially when the parents remain married to the present day.",t5_2qi63,1460358801,t3_48d510,-3,t1_d0j8z09,

&gt;  Description book **Mother Courage and Her Children by Bertolt Brecht**:

&gt;  Widely considered one of the great dramatic creations of the modern stage, ""Mother Courage and Her Children"" is Bertolt Brecht's most passionate and profound statement against war. Set in the seventeenth century, the play follows Anna Fierling -- ""Mother Courage"" -- an itinerant trader, as she pulls her wagon of wares and her children through the blood and carnage of Europe's religious wars.

In response though, I think an important thing is to have goodwill, in all the things. Bar people who lack goodwill from entering the country, but also teach your own population to have good will towards others. Not Christian goodwill, but general goodwill towards all others - a willingness to work together and play together on an issue, without trying to one up another and create unnecessary hierarchies of superiority. A willingness to form bonds of camaderie with strangers.

The real problem with the bigotry and the later fight-back is really just a us-vs-them ideology. And in that case, you realize, they haven't actually assimilated at all. At different levels and different intensities, different cultures that experienced this all failed to truly bridge the gap in skin tone and nationality, language and race. The biggest danger to Germany, and may other EU countries come in two fronts: 

1. They close their borders. Refugees radicalize in the Failed States areas whereever they find sanctuary to settle down (mostly in lawless regions) or back in their home country, and increasingly destabilize Middle East. 
2. They open their borders. Refugees maintain a tight isolated group and group-think grows within the -cosm. Sometimes this refugee group is well-off and manages to move out of the nation (zionism) or doesn't really have a negative impact, or else it grows resentment for not being able to manifest ""destiny"", and actively disrupts wellbeing (isis/KKK/etc.).

In whatever case, I commend Germany and Merkel for picking the more humane and safer choice, and embracing the fact that it can work out - that refugees can leave peacefully - and possibly keep the negative impact on Germany minimal. It remains a question how we can stop a cycle of bigotry and retaliation, but I think that's a Human Condition these days, a question much harder to tackle. If I had to estimate, we'd figure it out as we reach a smaller sustainable population and zero resource need, as well as some more impactful method of global communication / way of connecting people together.",t5_2qh3l,1460358968,t3_48b5vx,1,t1_d0itsqh,

like febiven whole last year while everyone was worshipping him and calling him best mid in the west? lol, he solo threw 2 out of 3 extremely even lategame scenarios vs KOO in the semis at worlds.

also theres a reason I said statistically speaking, but I mean even dropping the statistics the only other adc that can even compete with doublelift is zven. forgiven doesnt even come close. forgiven might be the best in the game at dodging skillshots, but cant compete with the best when it comes to actually dealing dmg in teamfights (what im trying to say is that he might have the best mechanics but his position is fucking garbage and he doesnt go IN), its funny he made a meme about him self dealing so much dmg lol, when he just doesnt. last but not least forg1ven doesnt have a champion he's extremely famous for because he's good at that specific champion. (and before you say something his lucian/graves is nothing special :/)

doublelift got sivir jinx and maybe even trist, and zven got kalista (well thats most eu adc's) and maybe tristana.

doublelift is BY A MILE the best sivir in the west, whether zven is the best western kalista player can actually be debated, he get a lot of competition from other kalista players in eu.

Which is still the most votes any party in the election got.

The only way to fix this is proportional representation. There's a slight chance of this happening in the UK. There's absolutely no chance of this happening in the EU.

Do you feel more European than British? Do you want our laws to be decided by Polish, Bulgarian, Romanian, German, French, etc. MEPs? Do you want an European superstate (with massive pockets of poverty and massive corruption at the top - like in the US). Because that what the superstate will become.

The European dream is great but it's not going to work out well for everyone. 

I'm puzzled why EU supporters thing that EU Council, Commission and Parliament aren't as corrupt as their local politicians? It's the very same fucking thing. Just further away from home and without media scrutiny.",t5_2qhqb,1460359141,t3_48fcel,4,t1_d0j91as,

Se tu leva um fora de uma mulher, e fica infeliz com isso, é porque você criou um conceito de que depende de uma mulher para ser feliz, isso é carência. Está relacionado com diversos outros problemas psicológicos, como ter sofrido traumas na infância etc.  Se você não aprender a conhecer a si mesmo, quais coisas que lhe causam aborrecimentos e infelicidade, para poder descobrir a causa e corrigir, vai precisar mesmo de substâncias químicas para poder abafar temporariamente a realidade.

Slovenia is one of the safest countries in Europe and the World. You shouldn't need to take any extra security precautions during your time here. I can safely say that most people aren't racist, and if they are they aren't open about it, let alone violent. That said, crime can still happen and you should employ common sense like hiding you valuables and avoiding potentially bad crowds.

&gt;Would I have to worry about walking around by myself/at night?

Absolutely not.

&gt;Is there any political unrest in the country?

There have been some protests related to the migrant crisis lately, but they haven't been violent so far. Avoid them if you happen to bump into them.

&gt;I'm going at the end of this month around Easter so is there some celebrations or stuff I should be aware of 

Easter (28th March) is a national holiday so you can expect many places to be shut down on that day.

&gt;Anyway what are some suggestions for Slovenia

You can find more suggestions elsewhere, but I'll just say this: Don't skip our caves! Škocjanske jame and Postonjska jama are a must see.

&gt;Food-wise, i cant eat pork or beef

Slovenian food is just a typical Central-European food with a few local dishes thrown in. It does tend to include a lot of pork and beef, but you shouldn't have any problems finding other kinds of meat.

&gt;Could I try getting around by public transportation if I don't have a car or is it best to stay just in Ljublijiana. 

Public transport in Ljubljana is good, elsewhere it depends on your destination. Buses are usually better than trains for moving around the country. All major sights can be reached by bus, so there's no need to stay in Ljubljana for 5 days (if I understood you correctly there).

&gt;Are there some useful phrases that are easy to learn that i can try to say to show more of an effort talking to locals?

Thank you = Hvala;
Please = Prosim;
Good day = Dober dan;
Good bye = Nasvidenje.

No wybacz ale jak ogolnikami piszesz ze maja Kaczorow to tez Ci dalem ogolnik taki. Nie interesuja sie sprawa Polski bo ich to nie obchodzi i sytuacja w Polsce nie bedzie miala na nich wplywow no a mialaby na Niemcy. 

&gt;Tak jakby jesteśmy państwem unijnym czy coś od jakichś 12 lat, prawie przez połowę naszej odzyskanej niepodległości, mamy też konstytucję, w której zapisaliśmy demokrację i wolność słowa, dzięki czemu wpuszczono nas do Unii. Akurat nikt specjalnie nie przewidywał, że od demokracji, o którą walczyliśmy pół wieku, tak szybko odejdziemy, i Unia niespecjalnie może to zrobić. Kierunek ""polityczny"" (bo ""gospodarczy"" akurat niestety z UE jest zgodny) idzie jasno w stronę państw wymienianych przez Orbana jako wzorce, jak Rosja, Chiny, Turcja czy Singapur, niespecjalnie są to kraje, które z takim systemem mogłyby wejść do Unii.

Taka zajebista jest demokracja i suwerennosc ze sad EU moze uniewaznic wyrok sadu najwyzszego unijnego. I piszac ""panstwo unijne"" mialem na mysli 1 panstwo w sklad ktorego Polska wchodzi. 

Wydaje mi sie tez bardzo smieszne ze Bruksela I Berlin maja scisk dupy taki sytuacja w Polsce a jednoczesnie chca Turcje do EU wepchac tylnymi drzwiami. Turcja - kraj w ktorym dziennikarzy posyla sie za kradki lub morduje, kraj w ktorym radykalizm rozwija sie coraz lepiej... ale nie demokracja w Polsce jest zagrozona heh. Tutaj ja nie komentuje tego co sie dzieje w PL tylko pokazuje hipokryzje eurokratow. 

&gt;... oj, kłamczuszku kłamczuszku. Francuzi mieli referendum? Pierwsze słyszę. Za to Irlandczycy w drugim referendum przyjęli ratyfikowany traktat, i odpowiednio zmienili konstytucję. Na tym chyba polega demokracja, prawda? Na kompromisach.

O pomylilo mi sie, sama Irlandia byla. No tak w nowa okladke wlozyli ten dokument i masz nowa umowe Lizbonska - chyba nawet zmienili  nazwe. Wow ale zmiana, tyle roznic, wow wow.

&gt;Naprawdę uważasz, że powinniśmy postępować jak fundamentalistyczna totalitarna teokracja nagminnie łamiąca prawa człowieka? Zajebisty wzór. Akurat Iran ma kupę rzeczy, które chcą Amerykanie; my niespecjalnie. Izrael ma poparcie pierdolniętych protestantów z Południa, jak na przykład George W Bush. My za to jesteśmy trzeciorzędnym krajem z ambicjami byciem drugorzędnym, który w oczach naszych sojuszników jest ""załatwiony"".

Czytales druga czesc odpowiedzi? Mowilem ze jesli Polska bylaba tak wazna strategicznie jak Iran przy obecnym rzadzie... co to ma do znaczenia czy to Iran czy Francja? Kazdy kraj gra te gre o interesy wlasne. Tyle sie wytargowali bo Chiny im pewnie tez wiele oferowaly zeby ich przychylnosc dostac. 

I wlasnie, USA nie uwaza Polski za wartego sojusznika wiec nie powinnismy sie podniecac nimi wogole. Jedyna sytuacja w ktorej USA by nas uwazalo za mocnego sojusznika byloby wtedy np. jesli Niemcy lub cale EU nawiazaloby bardzo dobre stosunki z Chinami lub Rosja. Chcieliby za pomoca Polski destabilizowac to. 

&gt;Po pierwsze, machanie flagą i fikuśne dresy z redisbad nie czynią człowieka patriotą.

Ja tam widzialem duzo ""normalnych"" ludzi na tych filmikach czy tez na zywca a nie dresow. Jest ich troche ale wiekszosc to ludzie ubrani normalnie wiec to jest niedorzecznosc. No duma z wlasnej flagi do 1szy krok. W Niemczech policja zakazala machania flaga na protestach po-noworocznych bo to mogloby obrazic muzulmanow haha. 

&gt; Po drugie, bycie patriotą nie czyni człowieka skutecznym i kompetentnym.

No tak, ale sprawia ze takiz czlowiek bedzie duzo mniej podatny na wplywy np. pieniezne zagranicznych firm. 

&gt;Po trzecie, można uważać się za patriotę i chodzić na cudzym pasku, być może wybierając mniejsze zło, jak udowadniaja postaci w rodzaju Poniatowskiego, Piaseckiego, Tuska i Gomułki.

Smiechlem. Idac Twoim tokiem myslenia nigdy nie odzyskalibysmy niepodleglosci w 1918. Jak mozesz byc patriota godzac sie na ustroj ktory zabiera suwerennosc Twojemu panstwu? I co to mialobyc wieksze zlo niby?

Poniatowski to robil tak jak go wywialo. Wpierw zamieszany w to uprowadzenie pierwsze przez szlachte walczaca o wolnosc I RP po czym przyszedl zabor, a potem to uhhh moze jednak by tak walczyc za niepodleglosc? Masakra. ",t5_2qiqo,1460359889,t3_48fmx1,0,t1_d0jajqp,
0,,d0jbrib,m15wallis,1456841094,1,politics,False,0,False,,"&gt; Marshall plan money ran out decades ago, Europe is running on its own money now.

Yes. But the fact remains that what currently exists was built upon what was essentially free money, and subsidized by the US (though many nations did pay some if not all of that back later on). Had that money not been given to them for free, Europe would not be nearly as far along developmentally as it currently is. 

&gt;EU's budgets

The EU isn't a country, nor would it exist without the US to essentially mandate cooperation and non-violence between European powers. NATO is a very powerful binding force in Europe, and has very effectively stopped the centuries of European violence. 

&gt;you have most of your population located either at the East Coast, or West Coast

Not an overwhelming majority. The second most populous state is one of the least dense and on neither the East nor West coast, and there are many large population centers that are in the middle of the US and not attached to a coast. There are also cities with over hundreds of thousands of people that are quite far from any metropolis, and spread all across the US. Our geography isn't nearly as dense as you like to think it is. 

&gt; its not like the US didn't have its significant share of colonialism and neocolonialism 

Only if you have the loosest definition of ""colonialism."" The US does not and never has had a desire to conquer territory to feed and subjugate nations to the greater American economy (the only real exceptions are Hawaii and the Philippines, but the Philippines was always extremely unpopular even at the time it occurred) but to instead install stability to keep out European colonial powers and promote free trade with the US and the rest of the world, whereas European nations conquered huge swathes of the world, directly subjugated their populations, and relegated them to second-class citizens within their national machine. (Oh, and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire) and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Empire) absolutely had colonial possessions, and Scandinavia benefited from centuries of trade with neighbors who did). The US model was not a colonial model, because the US did not want colonies, as colonialism left a bad taste in the mouth of a nation that was born from colonial abuse. And the point here is that your continent has centuries of that ruthless exploitation that to lay their economic and societal foundation on, which the majority of the world simply does not have, including the US.

&gt;That's over 400 million people living in countries with affordable Healthcare and education.

Separate countries, separate systems, separate societies with separate rules and socio-cultural traditions. Your argument will hold weight when Europe becomes a single country. 

&gt;And those people are dead. And you have a problem. And there exists a living solution somewhere else in the world.

Your society has a serious population problem - they're shrinking. The Indian model promotes rapid population growth and development. I suppose you will then be campaigning for the Indian model to rebuild your society?

It's almost like different societies work differently when they're founded by different groups of people and live in entirely different circumstances in different chunks of the world. ",t5_2cneq,1460359895,t3_48dbm0,1,t1_d0j9wmd,

0,,d0jbupq,Roqsan,1456841273,1,Guildwars2,1456841802,0,False,,"No - **some** people, a small/tiny vocal minority, wanted raids because that is what they are used to after being brain washed into playing them by WoW and they don't have the imagination to play sandbox content that isn't on rails. The same kind of people who don't like maps like Orr and HOT, because big brother isn't telling them what to do. And I'd bet that if you look at the percentage of people who actually do raids it is less than 10% probably a lot less (as Fevir pointed out). And meanwhile the addition of raids has meant that other parts of the game - the parts that only Arenanet do well are being neglected. Content where you don't have to make the game into a second job (and WvW for that matter too).

The acid test of whether people actually like raiding, fractals etc. would be to equalise rewards against other content. But, we don't need to ask really what would happen if they did that do we? Some people it seems would bang their heads against a brick wall all day if they got a few more coppers from doing that, rather than play the best content that anyone can produce for less - after all that simply would not be ""efficient"" would it?

Also if Arenanet want to know what people who actually play games rather than farm them are looking for, they only need to look at the hype surrounding Black Desert right now. That is an open world sand box game with no raids or dungeons (not dissimilar to an open world like Tyria is/was). Now I'm not flying a flag for Black Desert as I fully expect the EU/NA publishers, DAUM, will screw it up (however decent the underlying game may or may not be), just like Trion did with Archeage. In fact they already made a good start at that with absurd cash shop pricing even before launch date.

P.S. Thanks for responding by the way!

0,agnostic atheist,d0jc1iq,SsurebreC,1456841643,2,DebateReligion,1456843718,0,False,userflair,"I feel like the top responses here do not represent Christians who actually feel oppressed. As a result, you're not getting any real feedback.

Now sure, I can write nonsense like ""They get their persecution complex from the Jews"" and get a dozen upvotes but I'll instead write a real reply to your question.

For that, you need to go back to the founding of this country. Puritans were persecuted in England, a country with a fictional denomination of Christianity, adopted only because one ruler wanted a divorce primarily because he wanted to have a male heir with another, younger, woman. As a result, they took their stuff and left for the New World. Unfortunately, God didn't provide enough supplies to really make it and many (most?) of them died in the first winter. Although this original message has been diluted in time, the core of let's just call it ""Young America"" is one of resistance against the elements (both physical hardships and people already living here). Clearly religion helped these people and additional immigrants to make it. After all, one of core benefits of religion is that you can move anywhere and as long as there's a local institution of your religion, you can easily make friends with like-minded people. This is important since they can help you getting settled.

Fast forward a few centuries and you'll get to Manifest Destiny. Ignoring massive multi-century foreign investment from Europe, the American Christians believed it was [their] God who blessed them and wanted them to prosper. Conquering or buying (in that order) additional territory helped this country expand and become wealthy.

During the Civil War, Christians used the Bible on both sides of the fight which created two types of specific religious people: those who began to feel persecuted (by the North) and those who felt God helped them win the war. It also enlarged a group of intellectuals who began to criticize some of the words in the Bible and who began to think about this country as a whole rather than focus on Christian laws and values. Although this began pre-America and is certainly documented by the Founding Fathers, the movement grew from the Civil War.

Unfortunately, the World Wars of the 20th century continued to divide the country. Those who felt protected by God (since the US wasn't directly attacked in the same way Europe and Russian were burned to the ground) believed that their faith alone helped them survive and to win the war. However, mass immigrations from Europe and Russia diluted this message since people who survived the destruction of Christendom had less faith. After all, the Western front of the Europrean theater was mostly fought by Christians against Christians and the Pacific threater was fought by the [winning] Christians against non-Christians.

The Cold War ignited Christian passions once again, hence the change in the country's motto and solidified ""In God We Trust"". The divide continued due to the growing population and demographical shifts (not to mention education and spread of ideas though literacy and Internet), people became more aware of other points of view. The hippy movement crystalized this in counter-culture beliefs. The religious movement regrouped itself around Roe vs. Wade and unlike any other time in US history, began to seriously put money into the movement.

To put it simply, persecution sells and it's a great way to get donations. It doesn't matter if it's true, I'm sure some would say Christians are persecuted in the Vatican so there's always a story to tell. As we all know, money gives speech or at least provides for major public avenues of discussion. This continued dominance of pro-Christian ways is a self-serving cycle of donations spanning generations. It's, simply put, highly profitable with plenty of marketing groups and research that alters the narrative to get those dollars. In addition, rather than splintering Christians under their actual groups (with bloody battles between the groups), it was more profitable to unite all Christians under one banner. After all, the Protestant majority failed to block the Catholic Nominee from being elected (JFK). This is why Romney was considered a Christian even though many don't believe Mormons are actually Christians. It's a clear showing how the narrative has shifted to ""we are all Christians"" to group together for a larger force and there's minimal bickering that you see now and then that shows the underlying splinters. One recent flare-up: the Pope and his statements on war and poverty.

This is why selling such outlanding stories like gay marriage, abortion (which are historically replacing divorce, interracial marriage, and alcohol consumption) have began to be the windmills of today. After all, it doesn't matter that if you have a fool like Don Quixote when they're fully funded. The more recent branding of persecution is this: by having something legal (or illegal) which contradict your views, this means you're forced to support them (ex: by paying taxes which fund government which enforces the views you don't like). This makes you as much of a sinner so you have to fight to make sure the laws are overturned even though the laws do not apply to you at all (ex: you don't like abortion then don't have one or if you don't support gay marriage then don't marry a gay person). It also makes you support candidates who want to gut parts of government but, typically, leave alone the military which surely has been blessed by God to defend this country for centuries.

Money has overtaken truth and it's permiating and corrupting everything.

I hope this helps. I don't have any sources for anything I wrote above other than my own personal study of history.",t5_2snuc,1460360026,t3_48egfm,2,t3_48egfm,

&gt;  THINGS FALL APART tells two overlapping, intertwining stories, both of which center around Okonkwo, a “strong man” of an Ibo village in Nigeria. The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and soc...

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.

Get to global elite, then get to the best 1% of global elite. With a lot of luck, you might be able to play pro. Read up on Niko's road to being a pro player for mousesports. He's one of the best and most talented guys in counter-strike today, and he sat on the bench for a long time. 

Get really, really good at another language. There are a few pro spanish teams, but all of them are pretty bad. It's highly unlikely to change anytime soon, so getting a contract from those guys seems far fetched. Why bring in an unknown quantity from Argentina when there's plenty of players in Europe?

Honestly, if you want to go pro it's probably best to practice really really hard, and get in on the ground floor of a newer game. Overwatch seems like the most likely candidate for the next big FPS esports title. Getting from SE to a pro at this point in the game is unrealistic unless you're the most talented guy in the scene. As others have said, the state of the Argentinian scene isn't conductive to good practice right now and probably won't be for a while if ever in CS:GO.

If you're still willing to go that route, watch DDK, YNk, Moses, Anders, Thorin and others on youtube for how to break down strategies and executions.

Look at what IGL's like Fallen, Existence and Karrigan are doing. Don't fall into the trap of doing what Happy/NBK or Flusha is doing. You will likely never be on a team with the amount of talent those strategies require, even if you go pro.

There is an [entire wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Family_Structures_Study) devoted to the controversy surrounding it.

Here is a statement from the American Psychological Association about same sex parents:
&gt; On the basis of a remarkably consistent body of research on lesbian and gay parents and their children, the American Psychological Association (APA) and other health professional and scientific organizations have concluded that there is no scientific evidence that parenting effectiveness is related to parental sexual orientation. That is, lesbian and gay parents are as likely as heterosexual parents to provide supportive and healthy environments for their children. This body of research has shown that the adjustment, development and psychological well-being of children are unrelated to parental sexual orientation and that the children of lesbian and gay parents are as likely as those of heterosexual parents to flourish.

Here is a [literature review](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting.aspx) from the APA.

This is from a research summary prepared for an amicus brief by the American Sociological Association:
&gt; We conclude that there is a clear consensus in the social science literature indicating that American children living within same-sex parent households fare just, as well as those children residing within different-sex parent households over a wide array of well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse. Our assessment of the literature is based on credible and methodologically sound studies that compare well-being outcomes of children residing within same-sex and different-sex parent families.

Some facts on intelligence levels of blacks:1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.&gt; ""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""Source: American Psychological Association2) 

IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:&gt;The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)Source: University of California and University of Western Ontario3)

 Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.&gt;The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.Source: University of Delaware4)

 For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the Raven's Progressive Matriceswhich don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:Source: University of Johannesberg5)

 Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions. Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.&gt;The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study6)

 East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/7) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.&gt; From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites.Source: US Department of Education8)

 For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:&gt; Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ#Estimates_of_the_heritability_of_IQ",t5_31c2x,1460360336,t3_48g2sr,-28,t1_d0jbtgq,

He has made people like you feel empowered to come out of the shadows and voice their racist, sexist, and bigoted feelings. 

You claim you know so much about history, culture, economics, etc., yet you sound so unbelievably naive. If you truly wanted to ""live in an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society"" than you wouldn't be living in the United States of America, also known as the melting pot of the world. A country literally built on the backs of immigrants. 

You also don't seem to understand just how many immigrants come to this country legally each year, and how many of them are from the middle east. As far as illegal immigrants are concerned, it's certainly a problem that needs to be addressed. Now you say you know about economics, but you don't seem to understand what impact deporting 11 million illegal immigrants would have on the economy. Many economists feel it would be a disaster.

I will admit that the Syrian refugee crisis is a massive problem, but do we just turn our backs on them? Didn't US and NATO policies directly lead to this crisis in the first place? Listen, Europe and Germany in particular have handled this situation badly. They needed to make it clear this would be a temporary solution, and now it might affect the future of their country. Yet, if nothing was done, and they turned their backs on the refugees, it probably would've turned into one of the worst humanitarian disasters in history. 

The last thing I'll say is this. The United States sets an example for the world to follow. If we shut our borders down, turn our backs on others in need, and rant and rave about #MakingAmericaWhiteAgain, how are we different than our enemies? How are we different than those that you hate? 

The fact is that this is a GLOBAL society. The world looks to us to lead, and not cower in the corner like a petulant child that people like you think is best.

I think your lines of reasoning have some applicability but mildly over-simplify.

For example the Eastern States are caught between two competing motivations:-

1. Economic development from ex-Soviet stagnation.
2. Atst as having just recently claimed their independence they really don't want to give it up to the EU instead of the former Soviet leadership!

There's a noticeable correlation with nations that do not give away their sovereignty/independence/self-determination:-

1. They are freshly liberated and people's ""mindshare"" in the concept of a shared identity under a free nation is still fresh and hence strong politically. (eg Norway's Grassroots stemming from recent independence from The Kingdom of Denmark until 1814 and then again from Union with Sweden in 1905 and possibly the Nazis in the 1940's once again... (combined with their Fisheries and the EU's ""Power-grab"" of this attempt in the early 70;'s (succeeding thanks to Heath's treachery in the UK - no way hozay))
2. Those nations that have strong fundamental democratic institutions and practices (Switzerland's **Direct Democracy** (it's why they not only rejected the EU but also the EEA)).

To a lesser degree but still with 1. is the UK's strong sense of national identity and patriotism and Island Kingdom history and geographical distinction from ""Europe/The Mainland/The Continent"" (lol). And of course with 1. also some of the Eastern states though of course with much ""humbler"" self-identity due to their economic stagnation while Western Europe thrived.

In this respect the EU has done good work and likewise it's fondly thought of in some of the Balkan nations due to their own wars/independence creation of states. Though it's empire tendencies concerning Russia are undoing of such work.

Again if you look at the PIGS and the mess they are in with some of them bordering on ""Failed Nation Status"" (Greece most certainly) and then Italy has always been fragile since it united from Principalities (or whatever they're called) and their sense of identity is stronger to the village than the nation (is that correct??). In that respect they need a larger entity such as the EU to again plough money in atst as reform it could be argued? All such seem very pro-EU when the money is coming in...

Personally the UK should is different so when you get politicians saying we'll lose out on all those EUROS (scientists and others) it is in comparison to the situation in the PIGS, a sore subject.",t5_2qhcv,1460360607,t3_48f6my,1,t1_d0jbgs0,

Obviously there are plenty of people that have opposed refugee resettlement for a while in Europe, but I think they were outnumbered.

You really only saw the backlash after the Paris attacks and a few other incidents involving refugees. But if you were to poll the public when the whole refugee movement was starting, they wouldn't have those attacks on their minds. I honestly don't think it would have changed much.

It's a terrible situation in either case.

Let's talk real shit and not idealistic shit for a bit, ok?

I'll talk a bit about my issues with her opinions and ideals, why exactly they bother me, and how that relates to what people are being so pissed at her for.

So let's get right down to business, there'll be a lot of personal shit coming from me here.

I'm the product of an arranged marriage, along with my 5 year older sister. Born in a country that no longer exists in its original form due to civil war.

My grandparents decided to join their families for a certain deal - each family would help with building a house for the other family, both financially and physically.

The thing is, they decided on that when my mother was 12, and my father 17 years old. That's when they got ""matched"" and their lives essentially dictated by my grandparents, in pretty much every possible way. They got married 3 years later, father 20 years old, mother 15. My mother gave birth to my sister 5 years later. Sounds normal, right?

Wrong.

Here's what happens in a lot of those cases, what happened to us. When your entire life is dictated by someone else from a young age, you don't exactly get the chance develop your own proper personality. When a society considers it normal to marry and have a committed relationship, with all that it entails, at such a young age, shit doesn't work out ""normal"".

My mother was pushed into that situation before she could manage to solidify her own personality and now, 30 years later, she's downright manic. Everything she or parts of our family decide on, she doubts. Constant doubt, constant fear, constant nagging, because she was simply never able to develop a sense of confidence that others are allowed to develop. 

My father? He got used to being told what to do. He's a hard worker, but with zero personal initiative.

They started hating their life and each other's guts a few years after i was born. My earliest memory is my father trying to beat my mother and me standing inbetween them. He wasn't a typical wife beater. Not always. He technically couldn't be, since my mother was also a work horse of her own kind and equally strong.

But then shit got even worse. The same society, the same country that pretty much made it seem like their situation was normal, fell into civil war, splintered. My father went to war, drafted, since he was a mechanic. He came back an alcoholic. Which made everything just worse.

Bottom line is, when you grow up, your parents are supposed to be your prototypes in a way, your guides. They're supposed to be confident enough in themselves to help you to develop your own confidence, help guide you on your own path. They didn't know that. 

I didn't know that they didn't know either, so you get a fucked up situation. You argue a lot with them when you get older. You don't understand them, they don't understand you. You blame them, without knowing why they're the way they are. Until one day after the biggest fight you ever had with them, your mother snaps, starts threatening to kill herself and confesses that she was molested by her biological father, my grandmother's first of three husbands. She never really told anyone about that, because, well, east european countries were fucked up places where you were expected to suffer stoically in silence. Some still are.

Our family was not the exception. Our family was the rule.

After the initial shock, you process what you just found out and things just click into place. I began to understand them a bit more, could actually communicate and convey my own thoughts and opinions to them without it breaking out into a fight - most of the time.

But at that point, it was very late. I was already 25 years old when i finally managed to understand something about them, to successfully communicate with them. Until then, life was a bundle of rage, blame, guilt, confusion, insecurity and fighting. For all of us, my sister, my parents and me.

Of course, gaming was my escapism. Gaming was actually what allowed me to get a glimpse out into the world, to realize that worlds are being created from people's imagination. I simply wanted to see more of what people would think of and create, and that's what kept me going usually.

Now, here we are. That very same gaming that got me through that shithole that i remember as ""growing up"", is infested by the very same thoughts and principles that caused so much grief for my family and me. 

I see someone, technically working with a gaming company that primarily targets children, arguing that child sex laws should be more lax, outright publicly campaigning for that, presenting it as something innocent, something good. I remember my childhood, my younger years, and i seethe.

She has no idea what the fuck she is talking about. She has no idea about the long-term damage the things she supports do to everyone involved. She is ignorant as fuck about it, refusing to listen to anything opposing it.

And this all on a public account in which she also promotes work for the company she's working on?

You're goddamn right i'm pissed at her. 

You're goddamn right i'll consider everyone trying to take a moral high horse route in this situation a hypocrite. 

You're goddamn right i don't care whether it's related to Gamergate, TorrentialDownpour or whatever the fuck - it's a shitty thing to promote, incredibly damaging, something regressive for society. And she's promoting it while working with a company whose success was based on making products for kids and young adults.

You're goddamn right i want her fired and completely out of the industry that helped me get through the same hellish shit she's promoting.

And YOU feel disgusted with people like ME? Stay ignorant i guess. Life really is easier when you can allow yourself to take the moral high ground about everything.

EDIT:

Rereading this after a few hours, deciding if i'll leave it or delete it. And you know what? It stays. Why? Because i had it easy. However hellish it felt, it was nothing compared to what other people went through in similar circumstances. I was lucky. I understood and didn't let it completely destroy me. And i'll be damned if i back down from this in any way because of that.",t5_33726,1460360914,t3_48e7jo,18,t1_d0j0i4l,

It is not responsible for a nation to let in undocumented hordes of people.  Yes, you have a duty to refugees, but not to anyone else.  Better to stop economic migrants from getting in in the first place.  They are using up resources that could be devoted to those who deserve it.

But I don't think he does it well. 

I don't feel this pedantic nitpicking does much to spread scientific knowledge. It just makes him embody the negative stereotype of scientists as humorless know-it-alls. That science is about being right, not _finding out_ what's right. Where's the joy of discovery, of finding stuff out? That's what science is _really_ about, but he seems to have forsaken that for the more dubious pleasure of putting down everything that isn't 'scientific' enough for him.

Are their loopholes? Yes. ""Under REACH, the EU is still insisting on animal tests for chemicals used in cosmetics where there is a possibility of 'workforce exposure' during manufacturing processes."" And ""We do know that there are approximately 100 cases of ingredients that will have to be tested under REACH. We don't yet know what those chemicals are or what companies are involved."" That is from Peta last summer so they are still looking into things. Basically it's a case of base ingredients being tested however the final formulas arent and only certain things as of right now. What companies have fully switched to different ingredients IDK as it's still being investigated fully. 






MAC in some places does not test on animals and in some it does. Its tricky. They test to be able to sell in China as the way they sell to China requires them to test on animals. (Imported ones have to be there.) However in places where it's not required (US) or where it's banned (EU) they do not. So they are cruelty free where you are but not really cruelty free as a brand. Many people because they test in certain areas still wont buy from them for that. Which I get. And some people wont buy from any brand under an umbrella that does test on animals. So like Urban Decay for instance is fully cruelty free so they do not test however they are owned by Loreal which does so people will still skip them to not give money to Loreal at all. MAC for instance is owned by Estee Lauder and they test as well. So where you are if youre looking to go fully cruelty free across the board it can be difficult cause where you are MAC wont test on animals but they still are elsewhere and same with Loreal brands and others. They arent where you are but they are elsewhere. Its just where you wanna draw the line personally.

The previous one was pretty horrible but I would say Orbán takes the cake. And I'm not leftist at all, I'm right-wing. I'm just not a borderline-nazi like Jobbik. My problem is not that Orban is right-wing, my problem is that he is corrupt to the core, authoritarian, statist and a populist demagogue.

&gt;  Description book **A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway**:

&gt;  Begun in the autumn of 1957 and published posthumously in 1964, Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast captures what it meant to be young and poor and writing in Paris during the 1920s. A correspondent for the Toronto Star, Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braqu...

Bernie gets perceived as weak on foreign policy because he doesn't echo conventional wisdom, but that is precisely why Tulsi Gabbard just endorsed him. She's extremely well respected in the military and ex-military community, and she's endorsing on judgement over (questionable) ""experience."" People made fun of Bernie in the debate when they gave him three choices for ""biggest threat"", Russia, China, or North Korea. Conventional wisdom was to say ""Russia"". Bernie first said ISIL, but they made him pick one of the three, and mocked him for picking ""North Korea"", which then promptly conducted a nuclear weapons test and launched a satellite into orbit on a ballistic missile. People stopped mocking him on foreign policy judgement.

He is not a pacifist, but he wants to avoid unnecessary wars. He has clearly stated that he will not hesitate to go to war to protect US treaty allies in Europe, Asia Pacific, and of course Israel. Maintaining Israel's capacity for deterrence is going to be part of any sensible strategy to maintain Middle East stability. Where he may have some hard words for the Israeli government though would be on rights of detainees and settlements not authorized under international law. I suspect he will have equally if not harsher words for Palestinians who don't actively oppose terrorism.

As one person I read put it better than I, he summed up both his spirituality and his guiding foreign policy principle with the golden rule, much as Rabbi Hillel once did.

&gt;  Description book **The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath**:

&gt;  Sylvia Plath's shocking, realistic, and intensely emotional novel about a woman falling into the grip of insanity. Esther Greenwood is brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time. In her acclaimed and enduring masterwork, Sylvia Plath brilliantly draws the reader into Esther's breakdown with such intensity that her insanity becom...

&gt;The thing is people can feel ok in a country that's considered ""shithole' by you. Africans are poorer but often happier. But war is different, and that's why Syrian refugees got different treatment.  

Sign us up for temporary housing of 1000 of Syrians from war torn areas of the country, as soon as you root out economic migrants and forget about permanent settlement/integration.

&gt;Europe could hold twice more people, of course by the cost of lowering life standard. It is doable, it would just require sacrifice from Europeans.

And my house could comfortably house 4 more people, instead of being a bachelor pad, at the expense of my living standard.

1. We scrapped Europarties and are only keeping the Eurogroupings. Eurogroupings will be formed out of MEPs affiliated with national parties and those who are independent.  
2. EP elections are run by, and only by, the national moderator team. Who your MEPs will be is completely to your model's discretion and the ModelEU won't interfere in any way whatsoever, as long as the MEP minimum criteria set by the EU (which are less strict than MHoC's) are met.  
3. We're probably going for a 2/3rd majority of MEPs voting in favour and 2 out of 4 member states with a majority of MEPs voting in favour, but this may change as we have not decided upon this yet. Negotiations on QMV, superior EU law and other more detailed or controversial topics will be held after the Treaty has been accepted by all models.  
4. Every 6 months.  
5. EP elections will be held at the same time, but people may not vote in different countries anyways. If you're active in two models, you'll have to choose which model to vote from. Same goes for MEP candidates; they may only run in one country. Those who vote or run in two models will get disqualified.  
6. I blame the weather.  
7. No. Double mandates are allowed and will be quite common, especially for the smaller models. Triple and quadriple (yes we have them!) mandates are currently not forbidden but I hope the EP President will _strongly urge_ people not to run for MEP with so many positions already. We may have to introduce rules if this becomes a problem (e.g. conflicts of interests, corruption).

Tech (and Science) is all about order and rules, how stuff works, how everything has a definite pattern.

Magic is generally considered ""the stuff that breaks the rules"", the things that cannot be explained, that don't obey our science.

""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic""

""any sufficiently analysed magic is indistinguishable from sicience""

the breaking of those rules and nonconformity (and thus the removal of our ability to understand how it works) is what magic IS, and we subconsciously expect that in mods.

would it make sense to have a generator with only one slot and no automation? no, because logically you could build a better one by adding more room or adding conveyer belts.

does it make sense if the generator is a flower? sure! I mean, how would you actively improve a flower? you can't force it to have more petals or anything, it's up to the flower.

does it make sense to convert between EU and RF? yep! they are both forms of electricity. what about mana&gt;LP? we don't even know what they ARE exactly, yet you expect to be able to convert them?

notice that the most aesthetically ""techy"" magic mod, thaumcraft, is ENTIRELY devoted to UNDERSTANDING magic (to our physical detriment thanks to warp, we are after all knowing the unknowable).

basically: we expect tech to follow rules and conventions, whilst we expect magic to subvert those rules. as we understand ""magic"" it becomes closer to tech (literally ""removing the magic"" from things).

it's not so much that ""magic doesn't obey the rules"", rather ""things that don't obey the rules get called magic""",t5_2v620,1460362299,t3_48gyxz,125,t3_48gyxz,

I'm not accountable for the actions of others. Not really sure what you don't get about that.

&gt;The other fact is in the past your continent made things worse for them, and so of course they are fucked up now.

And before that their continent made things worse for us. We could literally play this game all day. It's futile. 

&gt;You do realize that Syria doesn't have those problems?

Certainly. Syria is just a place. It's inhabitants are what define it.

&gt;You do realize that where you are getting migrants from those aren't an issue? If migrants of those nationalities are getting those ideas, do you know why? Because people like you isolate them, so their children grow up with no identity.

It's never the fault of those actually committing these crimes. Classic leftism.

&gt;They stick to radical Islam because they are scared, alone, and Islam is all they know because you deprive them from participating in the culture of the country they were born into. So then, they adopt the craziest shit from the extreme of the religion, and you blame it on their parents for moving here.

Maybe they should abandon their backwards, stone-age ideologies and try assimilating and stop blaming other people for their shortcomings.

&gt;Irish Americans dealt with a ton of violence and a whole host of other issues. You know why? Because Americans as a whole treated them like you are currently treating immigrants.

This is how privileged and sheltered you are. You think criticism is akin to actual racial discrimination and oppression. Amazing.

&gt;It isn't because X people are inherently bad, you've forced them to grow up in an environment where that is appealing. Which is awful.

Is anyone responsible for anything they do in your crazy world? Or is it always the fault of someone else?

&gt;You're the one who said you don't want any black people living in Europe. I don't give a shit what color or whatever attribute people are. Between the two of us, you sound like you are much more invested in identity politics.

Indeed I did not. You're simply strawmanning me.",t5_2qh13,1460362444,t3_48g8cx,0,t1_d0jgl24,

Correct, but as [our Treaty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CajMcMORGCo3x1mKjeWUWlqaNKCHxDP8VhLZHHTCndA/edit#heading=h.7ibb49bms6i2) states, the High Representative will be leading discussions on such topics in the CotEU (along with being the Secretary-General), will have a seat in the European Commission if such topics are on the agenda and the High Representative also functions as the main diplomat of the EU especially when it comes to trade, defence, police and crisis management.    
  
The ModelEU currently has no powers at all as we're going to negotiate these powers and other controversial topics after all four member states have joined the EU itself. However, we're going to aim for reality, so the EU will at least have coordinating power over intereuropean matters, and we're hoping to introduce EU agencies (e.g. Frontex, EUFOR) and more institutions (ECJ, ECB) later.    
  
Don't worry though, we'll keep it fun for all four models and any changes will have to be approved by all national head moderators and, depending on the topic, the ECouncil, CotEU or EP.
  
TTIP and the Migrant Crisis are already on the agenda, European peacekeeping is an EU affair IRL but I don't see how it'd be relevant right now.

Second- I was going to ask you all about gear as well. 

My main concern is memory cards. What's everyone bringing? How many and what sizes? I've got a few 128 gigs and another 64, but I'm looking to possibly acquire a few more on slickdeals.net prior to the trip.

Gear: I'm bringing my GoPro, renting a Canon 70D (with a few lenses-wide angle, ect) and possibly a film camera if I feel like it. I've got a bunch of old canon lenses but they're specific for a film camera. Does anyone have a canon film camera they'd bring along for me to use? I'll purchase the film, I just need a canon body to accompany the lenses I already have. 

In regards to clothes: I'm bringing a Chrome bag (cycling backpack) with my clothes in it. No luggage tote on rollers. I have a shoulder camera bag I'm using for the hikes and everything else, which will also double as my place to keep cash and passport. I'm bringing one pair of boots (waterproof Merrill's), one pair of pants (Giro cycling windproof pants), a beanie of some sort (for the wind) and the other usual stuff. So, I'm keeping it pretty basic and giving myself maybe two options for what I wear each day. Please don't judge! It's just not worth it to bring all the extra clothes when we'll be so active every day anyway. You'll be seeing me in repeats throughout the trip-just beware. I'm bringing my NorthFace winter coat and gloves, and a hoodie. I think I'll be layered up enough.

Also bringing-one metal water bottle and one metal thermos (for coffee). $200 cash, then I can swap out into Krona when I get there, and use my debit card for the rest. What's everyone else doing in regards to finances? I'd like some input, as I have never traveled to a European nation before.

I was wondering about what is offered in regards to laundry services at the hostels. Is anyone familiar? If I could wash my clothes in the middle of the trip, that would be a lifesaver. I could pack less undergarments and socks if there's laundry available.

I'm down with all of us having the map /u/blucerchiati made with dropped pins for the trip on our phones, so we can reference it throughout our drives. We'll know what's coming up in regards to site-seeing, and then we can plan what we want to go to at that point. As long as we are prepared with what's ahead, what we can do, I am fine with just choosing as the days go by.

I can't pinpoint what the weather is going to be in Iceland over the eight days we'll be there. Back when I reserved my flight, temps ranged for March in the low 30's to high 30's, but now I find mid-30's and low 40's (F). What is everyone else finding?

Why doesn't it make sense? It's still a sliding scale, the aim assist and various other invisible helpers are just a way to make the base difficulty easier, which is perfectly fine. But if Commander is the base difficulty then it should have none of that, but for whatever reason it still has the invisible aim assists.

&gt;  Description book **The Street of Crocodiles by Bruno Schulz**:

&gt;  The Street of Crocodiles in the Polish city of Drogobych is a street of memories and dreams where recollections of Bruno Schulz's uncommon boyhood and of the eerie side of his merchant family's life are evoked in a startling blend of the real and the fantastic. Most memorable - and most chilling - is the portrait of the author's father, a maddened shopkeeper who imports rare birds' eggs to hatch in...

There is a huge campaign of deceptive propaganda being waged all over Reddit. In the posts, in the voting, in the comments, and in the moderator groups.

Devout Muslims have infiltrated the moderator groups of several large subreddits, including those mentioned above and r/pics, r/Atheism, r/exMuslim and several others. They are using their position to censor news, self posts, and comments that are detrimental to the image of Islam and Muslims.

After you read this comment, Muslims will reply with questions and comments, saying that this is a conspiracy theory, and asking ""where is the proof"", as if definitive proof could be found about the identity of the users of an anonymous website.

The proof is all over this subreddit. Just look at the blatant censorship or r/Europe and r/WorldNews. 

The pattern of censorship is revealing. It's Islamic.

&gt;  Description book **Stone Soup by Marcia Brown**:

&gt;  As someone who generally likes lushly coloured illustrations, I was not expecting to enjoy this version of the European folktale of Stone Soup as much as I did. The illustrations really are wonderful (attention to detail, captured movement, realistic expressions), and the simple combination of white, black, grey and orange shades works surprisingly well. The illustrations notwithst...

Secondly, other Balkan states would feel morally vindicated in their bid to close their own borders, and would do so more aggressively. After all, European countries use fences, water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets on their own citizens quite frequently...

India didn't really have borders prior to British rule, unless you count natural passes and rivers, and fundamentally the state's authority derived from cities with garrisons until it slowly disappeared along the village line. And this isn't just Indian, think of any pre-19th century European state as well. Village borders were contested, but on the higher level this was only ever pursued by the state to increase its own power. There is a place for subaltern history, but it cannot be the only version of history followed.

RUSH LIMBAUGH: Did you see what Bill Gates did? See what Bill Gates said? This is one of the craziest, nonsensical things I have ever in my life heard. I understand why he said it. But it is just over the top unbelievable. Bill Gates says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change. Bill Gates says that socialism is the only thing that can save us from climate change. The world's richest man, Bill Gates, has said that the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. While announcing his plan to spend $2 billion of his own money on green energy during an interview with The Atlantic, the founder of Microsoft called on fellow billionaires to help make the U.S. fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy.

[..]

[Gates] said, ""the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else."" China? China and the U.S. and Europe? Europe's being overrun at the moment and I doubt that they have much on the mind over there, other than self-preservation. But, nevertheless, CO2 emissions are a straw dog anyway. CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas, all of this is made up phony-baloney, good time rock-and-roller hoax material. Why is Bill Gates signing on to this? There is an explanation for this. But man, oh man, he has so signed on -- he goes out and makes these patently ridiculous statements? Let me share with you a theory that I have, ladies and gentlemen. It could be wrong. I think every person who has earned or has inherited or who has acquired, whatever manner, immense wealth is scared to death of losing it. The entrepreneur who slaves away and eventually hits the big payday, one of the first thoughts is, ""gosh I hope somebody doesn't come along and take this away from me."" And the fear manifests itself in the form of government. ""Gee, I hope they don't come up with a wealth tax. Gee, I hope they don't start confiscating everybody's money because they've so spent themselves into debt."" I mean these are ongoing, constant fears. ""Gee I hope the peasants with pitchforks leave me alone and don't storm my castle."" I don't care what it is, these super-wealthy people have a fear, or did at one time, of losing it -- having it taken away, have it taken from them. It is that belief of mine, in that theory, which I have come up with to explain why people like Gates and Buffett and a number of these other super billionaires talk like Marxist liberals all the time. It is to keep people away from their money. It is to send the message, hey we don't threaten you, leave me alone. I'm spending all my money on philanthropy, I'm giving money to AIDS, I'm giving money to Africa, I'm giving money to global warming, I'm giving money to this, I'm giving money to the arts, I'm giving money to support gay marriage and transgenders, leave me alone. It's about assuaging the fear that somebody's going to come for their money. It's about adopting a public persona that makes their wealth OK and the peasants with the pitchforks will leave them alone and not come for their money because they're good people and they care about people. Like Gates is building mosquito nets for malaria. You want to wipe out malaria? Bring back DDT.",t5_2qh1i,1460363212,t3_48h6j4,1,t3_48h6j4,

Have you talked with actual socialists?  I'm talking about ACTUAL socialists, not people who think ""some socialist policies are good"".

&gt;Socialism of the past was always under dictatorships.

Why did that happen?  Because it did not start out that way.  The people had every intention of trying the ""good kind"" of socialism.  It just so happened that doing it required millions to be murdered and for some sort of repressive regime to enforce it. 

This is why some of us scoff when today's socialists say, ""We can get it right.  It has just been done wrong in the past.""

I didn't say being a ""Democratic Socialist"" makes a person a communist.  I said that based on information I provided, I do not believe Bernie Sanders when he claims to not be a socialist.

The reason I have an issue believing that most ""Democratic Socialists"" are only telling a partial truth is because they all seem to want a massive and unsupportable welfare state and I am aware of the writings of Cloward and Piven.

Socialism in Europe is actually collapsing.  It is far from ""just fine"".  Many of these socialist nations are looking at Germany to bail them out of their problems which have been caused by ... socialism.

Could you give the correct description?

I did research this actually for Norwegian and Icelandic Beer, and the application in the EEA agreement or not of agricultural products and alcoholic beverages not made from malt whether or not these got export duties to the UK on them. Even asked the guy in the shop who said of course they do. But he had no idea concerning the specific application of the above in the above agreement...

So you're not really telling me anything new here.

&gt;*What other aspects of that score card are so horribly inaccurate?*

tut-tut. I'm not sure it is wrong, but I'll check.

Edit:

&gt;*EU VAT isn't a thing but whatever*

**What is VAT?** http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/index_en.htm

&gt;*The Value Added Tax, or VAT, in the European Union is a general, broadly based consumption tax assessed on the value added to goods and services. It applies more or less to all goods and services that are bought and sold for use or consumption in the Community. Thus, goods which are sold for export or services which are sold to customers abroad are normally not subject to VAT. Conversely imports are taxed to keep the system fair for EU producers so that they can compete on equal terms on the European market with suppliers situated outside the Union .*

http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/links/tax/index_en.htm

So Norway is exempt as a non-EU nation but UK is not - as per the scorecard.

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-refunds-for-uk-businesses-buying-from-other-eu-countries

So it's factually correct. But I think the point you're trying to make is that the devil is in the detail? Is that right?

Well I imagine the UK will likely continue using the same EU VAT rule system as the links above during the transition process. I don't think it's a can of worms the government will want to open if that makes sense.

Sorry but I'm second-guessing much of what you've not actually said. Yes I was aware of this system (the beer research), but I thought you said it was wrong?

BA F is often called the best J in the world, but you'll also pay high fuel surcharges plus the UK Passenger Duty Tax which on a J/F ticket will tack on $600+ in taxes and fees. Your other option for a true F cabin is AA. They offer 2 types - the 777-200, which is an old and worn out product; and the 777-300ER, which has the new flagship first, but is only offered to LON or occasionally MAD. As a result, you're better off saving the extra miles and flying J in my opinion.

You don't have enough points in other programs (not unless you wanted to burn all of your SPG, MR, TYP and UR for a SQ partner redemption) for 2 RT J tickets, but you could split it up by doing one direction using AA miles and one direction using MR/UR/TYP transferred to a partner airline. Your best option is probably going to be UA on a one-way J award.

You're also pretty late to the game for premium cabin award travel to Europe during peak season. Most all of the saver space is going to be snatched up months ago so you'll need to get creative. 

As to routes to search to get creative for your AA miles, check out [this post](http://thepointsjetsetter.com/the_jet_set_blog/how-to-avoid-high-taxes-fees-surcharges-on-european-aa-award-redemptions/) which talks about all of the routes to Europe to check to avoid the BA fuel surcharges and the UK tax. Check segment by segment using BA or AA starting with the US-Europe segment. Then search BA for the connection from your European arrival city to your destination (MAD/LIS/whatever).

The track record of militant Christians actually killing and/or enslaving non-believers requires going back to a different era in world history. But the point is still well taken.

You had me thinking I had a lapse of memory or something but you quoted someone else or something you intended to type, however true it may be though that wasn't my words.

The people being offended in this thread by a couple marrying under the guise of FSM is proof enough people care. And the whataboutism is the notion that you should expect European and American atheists to care just as much about Islam but our biggest threat tends not to be Islam yet you want to divert debate there; that's whataboutism.

Your last statement is also proof you care. You mention it being a private act yet people have an issue here, largely religious, with that ""private act"". To me, it's people getting married. It's a non-issue to me but the fact that people have an issue with it is troubling in itself and signifies the legacy of religious infestation in the populous.

&gt;Russia reports on such interests when they serve their interest to destabilize Europe, and hush them up when the present a danger to stability in their own country.

Ok, Russia is evil, got it. Now, being serious, they report to serve their interests, just as many state owned media outlets do. There is nothing wrong with not reporting on a story to prevent further problems from arising. Censorship is a different matter, however. Both Turkey and Russia are known for lack of freedom of press. 

 The video I linked has a very strong point against doing a week long or multiple week, daily reporting I've seen from European media in the aftermath of a terror attack. The point is made that it just perpetuates their violence, and gives them publicity which is without a doubt a propaganda win for terrorist groups. It will turn a lot of people against Muslims - good for them, it would make Muslims feel angry, unfairly judged,  and more likely to agree with extremist opinions. 

Not reporting on it is absolutely the right decision imo. The info is out there, and it doesn't need to be repeated for a week. ",t5_2qh4j,1460363828,t3_48hcyy,8,t1_d0jjnla,

Nominally fiction but more rightly called ""creative confessions,"" they told of the author's childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles.

US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), South America (Sao Paulo)

They really need to look at more than latency. They need to look at packet loss, and determine who is wired or wireless. Basically add a flag for wired or wireless, then determine host based on that first. 

Or maybe better, do a quick packet loss test while loading the game. Send a bunch of UDP packets to a server in each region, and make sure the count lines up with what was sent. Keep track of it client side and allow the match making to use historical packet loss data for determining host reliability.

I won't stereotype along gender lines but have you ever asked your girlfriend if she's noticed weird looks directed at you two? We've had a few occasions where I noticed it but he didn't. 


I do agree that there are double standards but in a different way from what you mentioned. As the minority in the couple, a few people have implied that I'm with him for money or for papers to stay in the country. I'm an EU national actually and sound as local as the queen,  but a handful of people have assumed that I'm foreign because I'm black. In my experience it was mostly recent immigrants who made this assumption. 

When the guy is black I've heard comments that he was dating a white woman for status, a bit like having a trophy wife if you like. 

I don't know where you guys live but I've perceived more dirty looks in low income areas. Think inner city Birmingham or Manchester.  In Kensington &amp; Chelsea and other wealthier areas like Hertfordshire people don't bat an eyelid. Or at least if they do, they have enough etiquette to not show it.  I went to a predominantly white school and I was the only black person on my course and ditto in my work environments. Most people in these social circles are indifferent to my race and who I date.

First, unlike many other top politicians he wasnt born into ""right"" family, nor got rich during wild privatisation of 90s, instead he worked at car wash in USA in first half of 90s. Than with his partners set up first leasing company in Slovakia and within a decade got pretty solidly rich after what he sold all his assets and set up largest charity in Slovakia to which he pumped several of his own millions. His leasing company Qatro has been used by cca 1 million Slovaks (5mil total population) and generally worked well, many times offering zero interest rates so people were satisfied with what they got and company became a house-hold name (when it was beginning, no bank would give you like a 1k euro loan so you could buy equipment for your new home).

Several years later, his charity Good Angel also became house-hold name as hundreds of thousands were pouring money into it, with clean account towards whom the money goes (it first started supporting children with cancer and later spread for other sick or disabled people that this state never cared for). So he became very known. Won an election while he was running with zero experience in politics (and thus zero dirt from politics attached to him) against PM Fico, strongest politician in Slovakia, beating him 60 to 40 and upon becoming president he decided that 100 percent of his salary will go to poor families and he will pay from his own account for his housing expenses. Also before him the bar for presidents was rather low, his predecessor was nothing but lackey of Smer party, senile idiot who was only making shame everywhere he went and Kiska instead became strong bipartisan, immidiatelly blocking candidates for constitutional judges (the one Smer-dominated parliament chose were abysmal political nominees with little experience) and started battering political spectrum about their ignoration of healthcare, social system, corruption and disfunctional judicary system, making a lot of fuss, blocking each piece of bad legislation that came to him or candidates that he and his advisor team composed of several former judges of Constitutional Court deemed unworthy of the job. Plus he created imagine of ""peoples man"", every winter serving himself dinner to his employees, going to homeless centers to do the same, when he was inagurated, instead of taking limo from the theatre palace where it took place to his presidential palace he decided to walk among the crowd, greeting people and making his security bit nervous in the process. And his security had to get additional skying training because they were unable to keep up with him during his family winter vacations into public sky resorts where he was regularly waiting in the row for them to get down.

And instead of Russian-leaning idiot like Fico, he is firmly pro-EU and pro-NATO, not being ashamed of that opinion one bit. His success absolutely nuked most of arguments of pro-RUS trolls who claim how Slovaks want to exit NATO, yada, yada when his support hovers at about 60 percent, sometimes even more, far ahead of any other politician.",t5_2qh4j,1460364312,t3_48flnt,9,t1_d0jhk64,

America is still a very Hofstede masculine country.  It takes 10 years of education to become a doctor in America, and it takes 9 months of training to cut hair (2 years if you want an associates degree).  You have to be very intelligent and dedicated to become a doctor, and neither of those are requirements to cut hair.  

It's just the difference in cultures, and each have their strengths and weaknesses.  Americans don't emphasize social good as much as we do scarcity and ability to make money.  

Personally, I very much dislike almost every doctor I know.  There is an ER doctor that works with me that I really like (she's the one married to the lawyer), but with the exception of her they all either seem to have no personality at all or they think they're gods.

That's great if some people like the convenience of a city.  It's also fine if people enjoy wide open spaces and fields for their kids to play in, countless acres to hike around in, lakes and ponds to fish in, and all the quiet splendor of nature those in the country (and even a lot of suburbs) can enjoy.  

I like that my kids attend a school surrounded by fields they can play and run around in instead of just a small fenced in concrete play yard like in the city schools.  I love the idea of a swingset, climbing wall, sandbox, and other things they can play in right outside the house where we can see and interact with them while we are still in the house doing chores.

I agree with you that many doctors can be scumbags (like any other professional).

We tend not to for the fact that they don't make money.  In America it's all about how much you can produce, and that production determines how much money you make.  Famous people are valued on an entertainment level, and because of that it allows them to make money for the studios.  Because they make money for the studios they get rich.  The VAST majority of actors in America are broke nobodies.  Go to LA and every waitress is an actor or screenwriter just waiting for their big break.

&gt;  In 1914, as the shadow of war falls across Europe, a party led by veteran explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton sets out to become the first to traverse the Antarctic continent. Their initial optimism is short-lived, however, as the ice field slowly thickens, encasing the ship Endurance in a death-grip, crushing their craft, and marooning 28 men on a ploar ice floe.In an epic struggle of man versus th...

&gt;  When the unconventional Durrell family can no longer endure the damp, gray English climate, they do what any sensible family would do: sell their house and relocate to the sunny Greek isle of Corfu. My Family and Other Animals was intended to embrace the natural history of the island but ended up as a delightful account of Durrell’s family’s experiences, from the many eccentric han...

It should be our absolute top priority, but it's difficult to do since it's such a long-term threat and people have a hard time getting worked up about things that won't obviously impact them today or tomorrow.

And why shouldn't America take a leading role? We're, by far, the richest and most powerful country in the world. We can stake out a claim as a leader in green energy and profit from it as we sell the technology and products to other countries.

And we're also the highest CO2 emitters per capita. We can't really demand other countries do better when we're not making the slightest effort to improve ourselves. Much of our recent decreases in CO2 emissions is due to switching from coal to natural gas and that was only because natural gas became so cheap. We could do far better than that if we put some effort into it.

We have natural allies in Europe and Japan who are more than willing to do their part. Between these regions, we produce nearly all of the world's supply of commercial aircraft, vehicles and produce much of the potential green energy supplies (wind, solar, hydro and nuclear). We could do a lot if we put some effort into it.",t5_2cneq,1460364758,t3_48g87e,2,t1_d0jgixn,

Sovereign nations with democratically elected governments, and these governments have for the past decades allowed migration in certain numbers, and yet, governments after them were elected which again allowed certain numbers of migration. And for me I trust elected governments and their adivisors (people a lot smarter than you or me) to judge whether ""those numbers are way too high"". Demographic shift is a key word happening in many Western nations with the number of children born becoming dangerously low so immigration is needed. The trends of people wanting to move to places where they have a better chance to a good life existed long before current migration politics. The region between South Africa, Indonesia and Morocco has about 500 million people who wish to leave their countries for better places. One reason being that European colonization, Western trade policies as well as the wars of America and Europe have fucked up a lot of these places. What a nation can decide here is modification to a limited extent - but they cannot stop everything. This is called the theory of Autonomy of Migration. ",t5_3aszm,1460364785,t3_47yeu4,3,t1_d0jky7y,

[just](http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/polls.html) look at this, the PVV is the dutch right wing party and they have grown by 23 seats since the start of 2015. That is a huge rise in the left-wing utopia the Netherlands was up till now.

This is a Greek form of the Hebrew word for passover. If you know your new testament, you'll recall that Jesus' death (and resurrection) happened during the Jewish feast of Passover, and the Christian holiday simply kept the same name, as Jesus' death was supposed (according to the early church) to have been the ultimate Passover sacrifice.

When Christianity came to England, this festival replaced (according to Bede, who may or may not be a reliable source, since he had an axe to grind about how Easter should be celebrated) an older pagan celebration honoring the godess Eostre. Perhaps this holiday was stolen by Christians to one-up / replace the older celebration. Bede includes in his history of England (a different text from the one in which he talks about Eostre) a letter from Gregory the Great (the late 6th century pope) instructing Augustine, his missionary to Kent (S.E. England), to borrow the names of local holidays, along with local holy places, in order to make Christianity more palatable to the people he was trying to convert; it's possible that Easter was renamed (in English) as part of this program.

Or perhaps it simply became blended with a northern European holiday, in much the same way that many different cultural traditions have become mixed together during the modern Christmas season.

Both German and English call the Christian holiday Easter / Ostern, presumably after this older (entirely forgotten, but for the mention in Bede) holiday. In French, it's still named after Pascha (modern French: Pâques).

The connection with Ishtar is a false etymology. Ishtar was a middle eastern goddess, and her name sounds a lot like 'Easter', but 'Easter' is the northern European name for the holiday. In the middle east, when the holiday was being invented, it was named pascha after the Jewish Passover.",t5_2ssp3,1460365201,t3_48hib3,29,t3_48hib3,

I disagree with this one. Allen continually gets sat out in our current games because his stamina is not as good as our other players. He runs and presses like Lallana + Milner, but he can't sustain it for a full 90 just yet.

If we want to seriously have a stab at European football, we will need players like Allen who are willing to play as a substitute and only an occasional first team appearance. 

If we get a better bench player than Allen, then chances are that player is going to want first team time. We just can't have a team full of impressive quality - we'll need players who understand that we have lots of football to play and although they aren't going to play every single game, they will get their chance.

It was reported by Ukrainian journalist and videobloger Anatoly Shary who had received political refugee status in the EU. He said that his attention had been drawn to an item of clothing of one of the characters of the exhibition organised by the TV channel “1 + 1” and the publishing house “Edipress” presented by the magazine “Viva”.

It’s turned out that on one of the ATO fighters’ raglan there is a logo of the SS Division ""Dead head"" with a swastika. At the same time the “hero” himself has a swastika tattoo on his bare chest.

The journalist found the name of the “hero” - it’s a former soldier of the ""Right Sector"" Vladimir Vasjanovich.

On his page in the social network “VKontakte” he puts photos on which he is throwing Nazi zigs, regrets that in the Donbass it is not possible to repeat the Nazi record of the extermination of people, posts pictures of Hitler and so on.

‘I am absolutely convinced that the Viva magazine and the publishing house “Edipress”, closely associated with a highly developed European country, will be able to explain the purpose of this project and the fact that they use outright Nazis in it. I also hope that the European parliament will properly appreciate the exhibition in which one of the characters is an outspoken Nazi and everyone will make right conclusions,’ emphasizes the blogger. 
The journalist also says that his blog will be translated into the maximum number of languages.

‘I want Kiev authorities to be seriously pulled up at last and I want it to be recognized that Nazism exists in Ukraine, in absolutely ugly and horrifying forms. It is time to recognize it,"" says Shary.

Like a lot? Couple of main example: German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, French. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe

Check the number of speakers section and find me - Hungarian! :)

In the future, if we are looking for groups for our languages, then we probably try that on local sites, but in the beta it's probably quite hopeless (for me for sure).

I would write in my introduction something like this: ""I prefer voice communication (discord or in game), but my spoken English doesnt comfortable atm. I think it's good enough for gameplay communication. I can probably understand you because I listening English all day, I just didn't practice it.""

You know, maybe some players looking for perfect English speakers. Plus, it's much less anxious for me, if my new friends knows this, when we start talking.

Que se passerait-il sans ce paragraphe? Sans lui, toute industrie polluante (par exemple une usine faisant des rejets dans une rivière) devrait dédommager les personnes lésées. C'est ça le principe ""pollueur-payeur"". Et quand on y pense, c'est pas un mauvais principe: le pollueur est surement un des mieux placés pour évaluer les conséquences de ses rejets et pour faire le calcul des couts entre les dédommagement et une production plus propre.

Mais ok, ce paragraphe *semble* ajouter la possibilité de fournir des droits de pollution, de par exemple définir des rejets considérés comme normaux, même s'ils endommagent l'écosystème, sans garantir de dédommagement aux personnes lésées par la pollution. C'est, en effet, la création de ""droits de pollution"".

Et en plus de ça, je pense que c'est plus retors. Ce paragraphe est à mon avis volontairement flou. Ils ne précisent pas que l'atteinte doit être autorisée explicitement pour être non réparable. Note la formulation «autorisée par les lois, règlements et engagements internationaux de la France **ou** par un titre délivré pour leur application». L'obtention d'un titre n'est pas obligatoire. C'est quoi une atteinte autorisée par les lois? À mon avis l'astuce est là: c'est une atteinte qui n'est pas interdite. 

Avoir un accident en pleine mer, c'est pas interdit. La preuve: on peut acheter des assurances pour ça, l'état les reconnait, il est donc clair que avoir un accident en pleine mer fait partie des aléas autorisés par la loi dans le cadre de cette activité, ce qui implique que les atteintes écologiques qui en découlent sont légales.

C'est beau, c'est fin, et bravo aux associatifs et journalistes qui ont levé ce lièvre. 

Si on remplaçait le ""ou"" par un ""et"", ça donnerait au texte le sens qu'il semble avoir l'air et créerait un permis de polluer plus classique. Perso ça me semble le minimum mais ça me semblerait être le minimum pour une gouvernement qui prétend gouverner avec des voix écolo de supprimer ce deuxième paragraphe totalement.",t5_2qhjz,1460365633,t3_48ggmm,9,t1_d0jliaa,

However you also have to see where socialism has failed (ussr, north korea, venezuela, cuba, ect). Many of these countries are in many ways more similar to the Us than the scandanavian countries. the countries that have socialism in europe works to an extent because their population is small. They have less people using the social nets and more people contributing to it. In america, we have many more people who would use the social nets, and many more people to cover. Which means much more money is needed. In the Scandinavian and other socialist countries they are taxed heavily to support it.  Here, we would have to be taxed even MORE heavily(everyone, not just the rich). When you raise the taxes for everyone, and give that money to the govt, they will spend it wastefully. History has proven that business is much more efficient with money than the govt. on top of that, To add to that, ALL socialist countries have very slow economic growth. This is crucial. Economic growth is what creates jobs. If you tax the rich more, they will be less inclined to expand and grow their businesses. Or they will move to other countries all together as well as their business and jobs. So yes, socialism can redistribute wealth, but capitalism can do that while boosting economic growth. Essentially, socialism is expensive, and slows economy. So the best bet is creating a capitalist (with some social aspects) system that allows everyone to have jobs and enough economic prosperity to keep money cycling between people.",t5_38unr,1460365872,t3_48gdqc,0,t1_d0jniri,

Generally speaking, we can divide the Reagan administration into two distinct periods. The first, from Reagan's inauguration to late 1983-early 1984 was defined by bellicose rhetoric and aggressive action against the Soviet Union. It was in this period that Reagan spoke of the Soviet Union of an ""evil empire"" and stated that Marxism-Leninism would end up on "" the ashheap of history."" Reagan backed up this confrontational rhetoric with action. In 1981, he instituted the largest peacetime military budget in U.S. history—roughly thirty percent of the entire federal budget. He additionally proposed the creation of a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) that would create a “nuclear umbrella” of spaced-based missile defense technology that could protect against any incoming Soviet missiles. It's difficult to overstate how much Gorbachev initially feared SDI, as he believed that the United States would actually use the technology, nominally for defense purposes, as an offensive weapon. As many critics said of SDI, Reagan was attempting to militarize outer space.

Reagan supplemented the anti-Soviet hostility inherent in SDI’s proposal with even more overt acts of American militarism. In 1983, he approved the commencement of Able Archer, a military exercise meant to test the United States’ nuclear capabilities in the case of war against the Soviet Union. As a part of the exercise, the U.S. Pacific Fleet conducted its largest naval exercise in history right next to Soviet waters. Tensions between the two superpowers neared a boiling point on September 1, 1983, when a Soviet fighter jet shot down Korean Air Lines flight 007, which had inadvertently crossed into Russian airspace. Two hundred and sixty-nine people died, including sixty-one U.S. citizens. By 1983, Reagan’s bellicose rhetoric and policies, in addition to the Korean Air Lines tragedy, heightened Cold War superpower tensions to their highest level since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

Reagan additionally heightened Cold War tensions through his support for various Third World insurgent groups that were fighting communist-supported governments, most notably in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. Reagan wanted Afghanistan in particular to be the Soviet Union's equivalent to the U.S.'s Vietnam War.

By 1984, a more focused foreign policy agenda within the administration, international pressure from American allies, and Reagan’s desire to dampen hostility between the two superpowers led Reagan to adopt a more cooperative approach toward the Soviet Union. Equally important to this transition in superpower relations was the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev. The U.S. saw Gorbachev as a reformer, someone who the U.S. could work with to lessen or even end the Cold War. The Reagan administration took a less aggressive stance in part to ease Gorbachev's domestic critics that were arguing for a more hardline stance against the U.S. The last thing Reagan wanted was for aggressive U.S. actions to lead to Gorbachev's ouster as Soviet premier and the arrival of a much less cooperative Soviet leader. In many ways, this policy of cooperation continued under George H.W. Bush, who made sure to dampen any triumphalist rhetoric as Eastern European countries began to break away from the Soviet Union. This did much to ensure that Gorbachev was able to stay in power throughout the turbulent period from 1989-1991

Reagan's role in the end of the Cold War was only secondary to Gorbachev's reforms and changes in the structure of the international order. Most prominently, Gorbachev offered a completely different interpretation of American global ambitions than his Cold War predecessors. Gorbachev didn't believe that capitalism was inherently expansionist and that the U.S. was attempting to surround the Soviet Union. As Melvyn Leffler has argued, with this change in Soviet threat perception, Gorbachev was then able to attempt to promote domestic economic and social reform that led to the end of the Cold War. Leffler gives Gorbachev the credit of being the “indispensable agent of change” that brought about the end of the Cold War, with Reagan adroitly maneuvering to accept Gorbachev’s attempts to de-escalate the Cold War while also ensuring that the Cold War ended “on America’s terms.”

While historians debate whether it was Gorbachev or the changing structure of the international order that brought about the end of the Cold War, most scholars agree that Reagan's foreign policy was only a secondary factor. This is not to discount Reagan's role in the end of the Cold War. There were many chances in which Reagan's actions might have actually prolonged the Cold War, particularly if he had continued to act aggressively and forced the Soviet government to go in and militarily repress the revolutions in Eastern Europe. No historian really says that Reagan did a bad job with his Cold War policy. He is generally seen as having skillfully recognzed the changing nature of the international system and the sincerity of Gorbachev's attempts at domestic reform. For this, Reagan deserves a lot of credit at ensuring that the external processes that would eventually end the Cold War took place smoothly.

Some historians argue that Reagan knew what he was doing all along, that historians can't really divide the administration up into two distinct eras--one of conflict, one of cooperation. John Lewis Gaddis is perhaps the most prominent of among this interpretation. More so than just Reagan's presidency, Gaddis argues that the Cold War was primarily an ideological conflict and that the U.S. won due to its greater technological capabilities and the ideological superiority of capitalism and democracy over communism. Hal Brands has recently offered a more moderated view of the triumphalist narrative of Gaddis that still gives a great deal of credit to Reagan. Brands argues that the change in tone toward the Soviet Union was a part of Reagan's plan all along. Reagan's policy was so effective because ""the administration underscored Gorbachev's incentives...for moderation and reform, and thereby promoted the transformation of U.S.-Soviet affairs...In the end, Reagan thus succeeded in combining vision with flexibility, strength with diplomacy, and in bringing his grand strategic agenda to fruition.""

I don't, however, want to give too much emphasis to the triumphalist interpretation. Most scholars disagree with it, and in large part its popularity derives from Gaddis's popularity as one of the best diplomatic historians of the 20th century (plus, it's a pretty satisfying narrative for Americans). Besides Gaddis, most Cold War triumphalists are former Reagan officials like Jack Matlock, Robert Gates, Richard Pipes, and others. I gave the example by Brands to show a much more measured version of the argument that, while I might still disagree with some of its main claims, I can still respect as a well-structured argument not founded on ideas of American moral superiority.

In contrast to the triumphalists, other historians, like Beth Fischer, argue that Reagan simply bungled his foreign policy in his first term, and was only able to get his act together by late 1984 to enact a successful policy toward the Soviet Union.

Whether triumphalist or not, almost all historians accept that from 1984 onward Reagan handled foreign policy with the Soviet Union incredibly well. Most, however, believe that Reagan's ultimate role was one more as expediter rather than a direct cause of the end of the Cold War.

La Commission est ce qu'elle est, on ne peut pas lui reprocher de ne pas aller au-delà de ce sur quoi les pays arrivent à se mettre d'accord. 

Sans ministère, par contre, je ne vois pas trop. On a des commissaires et des commissariats plutôt que des ministres et des ministères, ça ne change pas grand chose. De toute façon ni les ministres ni les commissaires ne sont élus directement, mais ils sont quand même indirectement déterminés par les élections. En France, c'est à travers leur nomination par le Président. Dans l'UE, les commissaires sont désignés par le président de la Commission, qui est déterminé par les élections européennes. Les élections ont été remportées par le PPE, dont le candidat était Juncker, c'est donc lui qui est devenu président et a nommé les commissaires. C'est un système proche des démocraties parlementaires courantes en Europe (Allemagne, Italie..). Il est toutefois regrettable que si peu de gens s'intéressent à ces élections, alors qu'elles ont une véritable importance.

Pour le pouvoir d'initiative, je suis d'accord, ce serait bien de mettre fin au monopole de la Commission et de partager ce pouvoir avec le Parlement. Pour autant, je ne pense pas que ce soit aussi scandaleux qu'on puisse le penser, le pouvoir d'initiative sera de toute façon surtout utilisé par l'exécutif (comme en France ou c'est presque exclusivement le cas). Mais ok, c'est vrai que ce serait bien de la partager. La question serait alors de le partager également avec le Conseil. 

Concernant le veto, d'ou est-ce que tu sors ça ? Il n'y a pas de droit de veto de la Commission, et elle n'en aurait de toute façon pas besoin puisqu'elle a le monopole de l'initiative, donc il n'y a rien sur quoi elle aurait à apposer un véto. Sur la remarque du ""non-élu"", j'en ai parlé plus haut, ça n'a rien de surprenant pour l'équivalent d'un gouvernement. 

Enfin, détrompe toi, les rappels à l'ordre ne sont pas juste une lettre méchante qui est mise à la poubelle. La plupart du temps il suffit de rappeler les Etats à leurs obligations pour qu'ils obtempèrent. Evidemment, les Etats résistent souvent sur les sujets les plus polémiques et médiatiques, dont on entend le plus parler, mais c'est oublier l'énorme travail juridique qui est conduit quotidiennement et qui se passe bien. Et quant à la Cour de Justice, je ne vois pas ce qu'il y a de choquant. Il faut bien que quelqu'un décide de poursuivre ou non. Pour information, chaque Etat dispose aussi du pouvoir de saisine, pas juste la Commission. Mais la très grande majorité des affaires viennent de la Commission car c'est un énorme boulot administratif que de suivre l'application de tout le droit européen. Ce n'est pas le rôle de la Cour, qui est là pour trancher le litige, ni du Parlement, et ces institutions n'en auraient de toute façon pas les moyens.

1.**First fact: Media reporting standards are not the same**

India's media reports things differently from media in other parts of the world. Media reports in various parts of the world have themes. American media focus a lot on race issues. Middle East media focuses a lot on sectarian issues. Indian media focuses a lot on gender issues. It would be faulty to not recognize the themes and blindly use media as a barometer.

Crimes get a disproportionate share of India's media reporting. Top news sources in the US, don't report rapes in the way India does. For instance, 25 women in the US were raped/assaulted in the time I took to write this comment (about 30 mins). You wouldn't likely read about any of these 25 cases in the media.

When a woman was sexually assaulted in an Uber taxi in Delhi, it became a major news and the government quickly reacted. But, such crimes involving Uber is fairly routine in the US.

Sources : 

http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/16/least-two-women-who-reported-sexual-assaults-boston-sunday-were-using-uber-police-say/cFHpgzcfIoBYiTfWgOqYOK/story.html

http://abc7news.com/325011/

http://www.whosdrivingyou.org/rideshare-incidents.html#SexualAssaults

In the US and Europe, such rape stories would come in local media and just move out of national attention. You probably didn't even come across it. US local governments didn't pursue Uber with the same vigor. Indian media selectively picks up a case and rallies around that. This creates a distorted reality.

The sad truth is that it is not India vs. US. It is that women get raped and it doesn't become a big news. See this as a global problem.

2.**Second fact: India's rape rate is not the highest in the world. Not even close**

According to the 2010 UN data on rape, the rapes per 100,000 people in India is 0.4 and 27.3 in USA. Going by these statistics, rape rate in USA is a whopping 6825% of India, so much for the ""rape culture"" in India. 

Sources :

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/top-5-countries-highest-rates-rape-1434355

http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Rapes/Per-capita

If you don't like the statistics, construct better ones. Figure out what factor you want to measure that is not covered in the reports from world bodies. Construct scientifically accepted surveys. Get to the root of the problem with logic. Use your stuff between the ears, instead of passing judgements with hot gas.

**Under reporting of Rapes**

Now I know the next thing you'll say is that rapes are under reported in India and it's true, but the matter of fact is that rapes are under reported everywhere in the world, including USA. More than 70% of rapes go under reported in USA. 

Sources : 

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/rape-study-report-america-us_n_4310765.html

https://cavatus.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/sweden-a-raped-country/

Now for the sake of argument, let's give you the benefit of doubt and assume that only 5% of the rapes in India are reported and 95% cases go unreported. Also assume that 100% of rapes in USA are reported. 

By that logic, the real rape rate in India will be 0.4 x 20 = 8. Now let us go further and double that too, we get 8 x 2 = 16, which is still way less than 27.3 (the rape rate in India). 

Therefore, even if you multiply the rape rate of India by 40, it still doesn't matches USA. This proves that India is a much safer country for women compared to USA. 

In cultures across the world, rape carries a stigma. Because, most of the rapes happen with people who are close to the woman. Thus, there is a strong social pressure against reporting. This basic fact is lost on the many who are giving their uneducated comments on the issue.

*The number of recorded rapes in India is certainly a substantial underestimate, but even if we take five times—or ten times—that figure, the corrected and enlarged estimates of rapes would still be substantially lower in India than in the US, the UK, Sweden, or South Africa (even with the assumption that there is no underreporting in these other countries).*

-Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen. 

**Do you want to discuss rapes or engage in stereotypes?**

Here is a simple question for those want to discuss this issue:

Are you interested in creating solutions for making women safe across race, creed, class and country?

Do you want to pick up some news item to justify your own stereotypes about a country?

If you belong to the former group, let us constructively engage in a debate on the solutions. If you belong to the latter group, you are not the solution, but the problem.

In summary, this is plainly a media distortion where one country reports rapes with more vigor than an another country. This leads to blind stereotyping that destroys people's lives &amp; careers for no fault of their own.

Instead of getting into such faulty stereotyping without any statistical evidence, let us as humans figure out ways we can make world safer for women. Because, they are getting raped all over the world at an alarming rate.

You still believe India has a ""rape culture"" and that USA is a very safe country for women?

Most of the bad loans were securitized by private lenders, primarily investment banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, etc. (such investment banks were never subject to Glass-Steagall because they did not hold deposits), and other private finance firms like hedge funds. This is why those types of financial firms had the hardest time during the crisis.

Fannie and Freddie have limits on how ""low they can go"" in terms of issuing and securitizing sub-prime loans. In fact that is the definition of ""sub-prime"": generally speaking, it means loans that Fannie and Freddie will not buy to securitize. 

Where Fannie and Freddie got into trouble was that they bought a lot of the highly-rated private securities that the private banks and funds offered. So when it became clear that those securities were not actually worth rating highly, Fannie and Freddie lost a bunch of capital and had a liquidity crisis. (Which just means a bunch of their savings disappeared and all of sudden they were in danger of running out of money.)

One of the easiest-to-understand points of proof that Glass-Steagall repeal didn't cause the crisis is that Europe never had a similar regulation, yet they didn't cause a similar crisis.

Another point of proof is that firms that would have violated Glass-Steagall generally did OK during the crisis, while firms that did the worst would never have been covered by Glass-Steagall anyway.",t5_2sokd,1460367512,t3_48gx33,29,t1_d0jh4t8,

And when they had their funerals in the streets, more of them were shot at and killed. Again, and again. And afterwards, the people who took part became criminals in the eyes of the regime.

And there are security personnel who got killed at the very beginning also. So both sides had victims in this violence from the very beginning. Nobody knows or can prove who started the violence exactly. Maybe it was foreign agents, shooting on both, protesters and on police. 

&gt; Can you name me a single political party that is actually opposed to Assad? Can any non-Syrian even identify one? I don't know any. What does that tell you about how meaningful it is?

If you look at the results of the last Parlamentary elections in 2012, you see the Baath party with 134 seats, 77 seats for the Independents, 18 seats for the Unionists, 11 seats for the Communists, and so on. They all disagree with each other on topics of economy, education and so on, except for the will to fight against Terrorism, and defending the state. 

Syria cannot become Switzerland over night, but it is reforming and modernise at its appropiate pace, while having to consider that every move should not compromise national security and existantial threats. If you say from the beginning, any political progress or reform is pointless and should not be taken seriously or supported and encouraged, then any other solution then political process and reform can only be war. Those supporting the Government and/or the Syrian state will continue to move the political process forward, even if its not far advanced yet, there is no other peaceful choice.

&gt; It is so funny that it becomes sad when people defending the Syrian regime sound like Zionists. Whether it's flattening neighbourhoods, sieging them, or torturing people. The Whataboutism is strong here. Yeah, of course Arab society has it's troubles. That does not excuse torture carried out by security forces and the mukhabarat. These people are in prisons. There are instructions. Expectations. Orders. If a bunch of Russian colonels can whip up Syrian soldier ass and make them disciplined, then it will not take much to simply not whip, beat, burn, pierce, cut, and rape a human being. Listen to yourself.

Nobody excuses torture. There is no justification for abuse or torture. And torturing is infact illegal in Syria. It still happens. How? Because in Arab countries and Arab societys, prisoners, criminals are the worst of society, they get no respect. In Europe a jail is a nice place, with a TV, Internet, painting classes. In Arab countries, jails are an ugly rat hole. Dirty and cold, people get slapped and beaten. Long before Assad and Mukhabarat, and everywhere where is no Assad or Mukhabarat its the same. In alot of Arab countries there is a western approved leader, and there isnt even a War, but still people get locked up, beaten, abused, tortured and just disappear. It is a social problem, you cannot link it back to a single person. Have you seen what Americans did in prisons like Abu Ghraib? The society of these soldiers thought its okay to torture  inmates. George Bush and the US Secret Service did not step down because of it. It was USA personnel who decided by themselfs its okay to torture and abhse the inmates. Torture and abuse is a problem of society, and of judicial system, its cause cannot be traced back to a single person.

&gt; ""Assad or we burn the country"" was not just said. It was spray painted on walls by soldiers as a warning to others. You want to talk about sociology? Then let us talk about this phrase and how it comes out of a cult personality that Assad has developed (intentionally or not), which is the staple of repressive regimes.

Those who sprayed this are extremists who do not represent the majority of those who support the Government and/or Syrian state. Friends of mine got killed in a terrorist attack on a christian owned restaurant in Qamishli. Kurds sprayed on walls that Christian will be killed and should leave the city. These are acts of extremists Kurds, not representative of them. The Government supporters do also have some extreme elements, like anybody else. What is most important though, is that the policys are not extreme, and that in a peaceful aftermath of a Government victory, all ethnicities and religious groups, atheists, woman, even homosexuals, everybody will be able to continue with his normal life, there will be no group that will be excluded or badly treated. While in a Rebels win, you will have the same situation as in Rebel Held territories, only conservative Sunnis allowed, Christiand and Shiites killed or expelled, Homosexuals thrown from buildings, and so on. So there is no reason to focus to much on which sides of the extremes said what. Lets focus on who would actually tolerate the other, and carry on sensibly.

&gt; That's false. People step down all the time. They resign. They give up. It's a fact of history

You think the Christians, the Shiites, the Woman of Syria would have allowed Assad to step down and the country to be taken over by Islamists Groups. Assad was not allowed to step down. He had to stay and defend the people just like any other official, simple soldier or police officer had to do. It would have been easy and safe and wealthy for him to flee with his family to a beautiful and nice place, but he had to stay and defend like anybody else, thats his duty. Anything else would have caused a complete collaps like Iraq or Libya.

Regardless of that, my original point was something else, Assad does not have the right to ""negotiate"" positions of power and hand them over to whomever it be. He doesnt own Syria. No matter what positions the foreign opposition will want to get in a future settlement of Government positions, Assad cannot give it to them, they will have to get there mandat through votes and therefore through elections.",t5_2x5s1,1460368243,t3_48ejeh,2,t1_d0jjocj,

The specific issues being addressed are European data flows being sent to the US where US companies are under legal obligation to turn them over to the NSA. Those are the ones that are illegal under SafeHarbor and will be illegal under PrivacyShield.

In terms of intelligence agencies, mass data collection is illegal for them too. Fundamental rights apply to all parties in the EU equally. 

However, specific, targeted intelligence gathering is still legal and is subject to each member state's policies. However, it should be noted that the data protection laws in each state are now vulnerable to challenge as to whether or not they meet ECJ standards. Member state intelligence laws thus are covered under the ruling.

I can't speak to intelligence sharing because I don't know how much of that is happening or whether it's a large problem or not. 

I'm most focused on the immediate battle ahead.

By the way, however, people in Europe are not happy to ignore EU intelligence agencies. Intelligence agencies in most states are untouchable by the general public--it's only because ES put the US into the spotlight and told everyone about 5 Eyes that people are starting to object to the whole system.

&gt;Unless a character's race is actually important to the story, and neither Hermione's or Roland's is, then you're just being racist and you need to reassess your views of the world.

This is stated despite the fact that Roland is supposed to be a descendant of King Arthur.

With the exception of movies like *Star Wars*, race is never *not* relevant (and then it is still relevant outside of the universe of the story; it's just that it's replaced by species in-universe). 

Any movie taking place in our universe has to consider the race of the actor because it affects who that person is and the kind of environment they grew up in. There is no place on earth and there has been no time yet when race was not relevant.

I don't understand how the typical uber-liberal view is that race is just something you can put on like a shirt and pants instead of something that affects many meaningful interactions you have in your life and fundamentally affects how you see the world.

Yes Roland comes from elsewhere, but he is still described as the descendent of European royalty and his race will affect how people *here* see him, especially characters who lived through the 1960s.

If there are not sufficient resources now how will it be in 6 months or a year, after another million people show up? Its a disaster already because the migrants lack jobs, education, and cultural integration. In the long term they will be a huge burden on the German social services.

New accommodation for refugees is build every day. At the same time we are trying to decrease the number of people who will arrive. Most of the Syrian refugees are in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - but as they are/were not allowed to work in those countries, many fled to Europe. If you encourage those countries to change their policies (how it's done with Turkey). You actually work towards the solution, instead of just letting them be stuck in Greece - which would have been the alternative to Merkel's decision.

&gt;Its a disaster already because the migrants lack jobs, education, and cultural integration.

I'm not sure if you understand the concept of asylum. You are not trying to import workforce - you are trying to shelter people during wartime. But some will obviously stay - and they will be integrated into society.

&gt;I'm sure the women in Cologne who were attacked, or the people who cant let their children walk to school because the migrants will sexually harass the young girls would disagree with that.... I'm sure the people in areas where crime has spiked because migrants are now 5% of the population but commit 25% of the crimes would totally agree with your assessment that this means nothing in daily life of Germans.

Refugees are the exception to this statistic - they are not significantly more criminal than Germans. It is just not noticeable in daily life - it's as simple as that.

Really clones are exactly what they say they are - there shouldn't really be any deviation in the basic design.

FPV over 4 miles is tough (not to mention illegal in a lot of places...) you'll likely want to go to a 2.4GHz or below frequency in order to get as robust of a signal as you'd need which leaves you less options for control - most likely something like ImmersionRC EzUHF or DragonLink etc. Because I fly in the UK our limits are a bit stricter and tbh I don't have any interest in flying my extremely expensive craft and camera kit out of my visual line of sight, regardless of how great my FPV link is.

And what you are talking about is a complete misinformation. 
A lot of people in the West have worked long and successful to create the image or Russia that seems barbaric, that seems like what russians want is for others to fear them or some such bullshit. 
Most russians want one thing, to be left alone. 
What most don't understand is that Russians have their own way of thinking, its not european, its not asian, its not middle-eastern, its russian. 
And russia always had its fair share of problems which have nothing to do with particular economic policy or type of government. 

The problem with transitioning to full democracy right now is that the collapse of the USSR and then the years of chaos that followed it have brought up a whole generation of cynics who do not believe that democracy can solve their problems because they see all politicians as corrupt. 
There is simply not enough belief in the political process. So when someone who shows strength and a proven ability to solve at least some of the problems then the person usually ends up popular. 
And there will always be a vocal opposition in Russia to any kind of person in power, if you read a bit about russian history you will understand that there were always people willing to say and do anything because they hated the current government for some kind of reason. 

Anyway, my general thought is that you cannot fix russia by applying european or american solutions because its neither. You can't force people to choose someone else by making life harder because life in russia has been hard for the past 1000 years. 
And frankly there is no candidate in Russian politics that could replace Putin even with 50% effectiveness. And while people are cynical in russia they still have some belief in the idea of Russia just like americans have their belief in the idea of America. Unfortunately reality and the belief clashes as you can understand and people tend to believe in a wide spectrum of ideas and facts that come out of that clash. 
For example if you have ever watched The West Wing and House of Cards you might think that one of them shows the more truthful version of american politics while the actual truth will be somewhere in the middle. 
So there are people ready to believe that Putin is the evil mastermind that he is being cast as by a lot of media, others will believe that he is just an ex-kgb guy trying his best to hold Russia together against forces both domestic and foreign. Truth, truth is somewhere in the middle. 
So while some people believe that Russia is evil, expansionist, threatening others willy nilly and some will believe that russia is just fighting against the enemies it had for a long time trying to tear it apart and make it into a resource colony of the West the truth is somewhere in the middle.

Charlemagne was a super fan of the Anno Domini calendar and made it official in the Carolingian empire during his reign in the 800s, but it wasn't fully adopted by all European countries until 1422 when the last one (Portugal) finally joined in. And let's not even get into non-Western-European countries, because Russia was the first of the Eastern European countries to adopt, and that was in 1700. 

So really, your question is: ""what other calendars were in use before the Medieval European era?""

The answer is long but also easy. For the long version, [see this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_era). Not everywhere in the world even thinks the current year is 2016, because they all have their own calendar systems. Probably the most significant of these is the Chinese calendar (Chinese New Year was just a few weeks ago), the Islamic calendar (which starts when Muhammed made his pilgrimage to Mecca), and the Unix calendar, which counts seconds since 1970.

As for the much older calendars, the majority of them count something called ""Regnal years"", which means years since a particular monarch took power. For example, it is right now 64 to 65 years into the reign of Elizabeth II in Britain. Back in the old days, it might have been two years into the reign of Nero, or four years since Augustus took power. ",t5_2sokd,1460369058,t3_48ijxg,2,t3_48ijxg,

That way, when you go to one of those member countries, there is no ambiguity in what you can drive/ride.

There is a lot of flexibility in what each country does with that framework though - for instance, some countries have 18 for the A2.  
It is also allowable to graduate up the licence through training, rather than tests - the UK gov claimed they didn't have the systems in place to be able to allow that, at the time. It still needs the 2 years between, though.

The graduated licencing *is* sensible. Young people aren't the wisest or most level headed when it comes to vehicles.  
So, trying to say ""but you can drive a car..."" is a bad comparison.  
The fault isn't the bike licence, but more the car.

Nope - but why on earth should Trump be answering for comments made online by a third party?  Why shouldn't Trump be confronted with my ""horrendous"" history of comments?  I don't attribute to candidates the attributes of his supporters.  It was a cheap smear from external the party and the other candidates jumped on the bandwagon.  Cruz or Rubio could have tried it themselves but instead they took cues from a far left lobbying organization for their talking points - weak sauce.  I don't see Rubio or Cruz as any less empty headed than half the news anchors on cable News - these people are completely unable to act independently of their scripted performance.

&gt; Revisionist history.

Not remotely

&gt; Of course, knowing Trump, he's probably telling a group of southerners that he supports flying the confederate flag as we speak.

And why shouldn't he?

&gt; Try reading the opinion sometime, you might learn something.

I didn't say the opinion was wrong (necessarily - it might be) - the Constitution must be changed to prohibit it.

&gt; You want to complain about Rubio and Cruz agreeing with the ADL on something? At least they didn't donate money to GLSEN.

I'm sure Trump's dedicated a lot of money to many things I find appalling.  In fact I find Trump quite disconcerting in many ways.  But, he is the only person who I think will do anything about illegal immigration, possibly curtail this insane internationalist free-trade behavior we have that has stripped this country of jobs, and maybe do serious damage to the media and academia's politically correct silencing of the voices of the American populace.  Additionally, Trump seems to be the only person who doesn't view war with Russia in our interest and that is a big deal to me since this aggression against Russia by Obama is purely a center-left EU agenda.

I know Rubio and Cruz won't do a damn thing about immigration or political correctness (especially given how much they jumped on the bandwagon) - they'll just stall and stall and stall on immigration then say they've flopped and they support amnesty then they'll stall and stall and stall some more so more cheap labor comes up from Mexico.  Then they'll say they're not sure they support illegal amnesty and they'll stall and stall and stall then say they think amnesty is a good idea again and so on and so on because these people have no goals regarding immigration except import tons of cheap and undocumented labor to make their donors wealthy.",t5_2vg6d,1460369268,t3_48g5ad,-2,t1_d0ju2wc,

We have the economic sector, and in particular banking and finance--special interest--subordinating the political establishment through lobbying and campaign finance.  

This Act was creating some sort of an Obstruction that limited gains somehow.  You don't need a PhD in economics to understand the basic function of regulatory legislation.  

Now I appreciate your lengthy reply, and you appear to be highly knowledgeable about the particular details and structure of the Act itself.  Much more so than I.  

And yet, what I find troubling is the apologetic tone--that old neo-liberal sympathy for carefully watched self-interest, gone awry.  ""We didn't MEAN for it to end up this way, you know?  It's just that some people, x, and some institutions, y, are making the whole system bad.""  

Which is complete bullshit, of course.  The problem of capitalism is systemic.  And while this Act is one small piece of the puzzle for our current state, it is a significant one and it reflects the nature of the relationship between our current government and the economic interests in this country, i. e. the function of concentrated wealth to sustain and grow itself.  

Maybe do your homework sometime and recognize that Sanders' platform of Social Democracy is not hard Socialism, and it's been in practice in Europe since the end of WW2.  Which is why they live longer and happier lives than we do, with a different value set.  There is a distinction between Socialist parties and Social Democratic parties who make reforms and apologies for capitalism.

I am neither.  Personally I would love to see Trump get elected.  But it's probably not for the same reason as most of his supporters.  

Enjoy your Starbucks and a nice vacation.  Hunker down!  Let the establishment quote the first few passages of Adam Smith for you, and not actually explain his fear in unchecked greed and the nature of capitalism to turn men into brute machines, that ""vile maxim.""  No, the distinction between true liberalism and this American brand of consumer selfishness and imperial neo-liberalism can all be fused into the same hollow ideology, conveniently packaged to fit into your 4000 lb SUV.

Think of the way, though you may be not familiar with it, the Catholic Church had (up until the 1970s) performed the Mass in Latin. Let that sink in.

I don't know how it is in Islam. I would think the majority of Muslims speak Arabic or have learned to speak Arabic. However, Islam is a perfect example here. Indonesian Muslims have the Koran written in Indonesian, yes? Malay have Korans written in Malay, yes? In the US and UK there are English Korans. Europe must have many translated Korans. Heck, there must be Korans in Turkish too! Both in Latin script and in Arabic script. Same would go for Persia, I assume.

Now, if you search among these - the Catholics and the Latin, the Muslims and non-Arabs, Armenians and Turkish - you will find (particularly in the Asian and Western cultures) Holy Scripts written with the native alphabet phonating the Arabic words.

This prayer book is an example of that.

Armenians couldn't read, or didn't learn, Arabic script (Osmanian). But they sure has heck spoke Turkish.

They could read Armenian perhaps, but they couldn't understand the old (""like Latin to the Catholic Church"") Armenian (called ""Krapar"").

So, the solution found by some was to print out the prayers in Turkish but with Armenian letters.

Interestingly, I can read these prayers and wouldn't understand a thing I'm saying, though I know it would sound faintly Turkish. And someone who really has an ear for this could actually understand the Turkish (realizing that they're listening to Christian prayer).

Carthage would have likely set up a Gaulic client kingdom in southern France, to protect their northern border. It would be a distinct possibility that a Gallic kingdom would rise up as an empire.

WW2 level dedication puts that aside IMO, they would worry about things like that later. 

And don't discount the other Navies, they arent blue water anvies by any means, but in theiur own waters they are more than capable of defending themselves and beating more technologically superior ships, like the Swedish sub sinking an american aircraft carrier in a wargame. Canada would have to try and get it's ships across to the UK whilst running that gauntlet of submarines that can just wait for the louder surface ships to get close before sinking them. 

&gt;The EU on the other hand is economically stagnate

I disagree. Not to mention that they can ramp up production and wartime military spending 3-4 times what it is now. WW2 levels of dedication means that the long term economic damage is acceptable as long as they win. 

Nigeria and Pakistand would be reliant on the other countries to get their people anywhere since they lack the naval strength to do it themselves, and the other navies in the Commonwealth dont have the logistical support or training to conduct the complex, large scale operations so far from home that this would require. Only the US, UK and France have that kind of experience and logistical chain. 

And whilst the EU only has three other countries in the top 20, they're closer to the top than the Commonwealth ones, and the power they have drops off rapidly past the top 5-6 (India is only there because of a powerful ground army, its lack of naval strenght really hurts it here). And the EU can get the rest of the countries producing materials and parts for those three countries, turning the industrial capacity of Europe (which historically is significant, a single country was able to produce enough to fight off almost all the major powers in the world at the time by itself) into high-quality munitions and aircraft/ships for those three countries to use.

Engenharia Informática é o curso que decidi seguir também.

Efectivamente sem Matemática A não vais fazer Análises Matemáticas, lamento mas é a pura e dura verdade. Com Humanidades podes esquecer esse teu objectivo certamente, mesmo que possas entrar com os exames certos.

Eu no 10º ano segui logo um Profissional, e segui logo à primeira, contra todos os avisos que me foram dados. Hoje em dia posso-te dizer que ..... Não me arrependo.

Acontece que o pessoal que chega a Engenharia Informática geralmente ou é mesmo muito aplicado ou demora quase o dobro a acabar o curso, não sei como é possível mas olho para a generalidade da malta e é mesmo isso que acontece. Posso-te dizer que também sou um caso especial, pois eu não fui para o profissional com uma postura de quem não quer saber do secundário para nada e está ali para acabar o curso e logo se vê, eu fui efectivamente para a área que gostava numa decisão que esperava mais tarde valorizar-me em relação aos outros Licenciados/Mestres (ainda está em cima da mesa o Mestrado e Erasmus para enriquecer ainda mais), é uma experiência profissional extra (estágio curtinho, é verdade, mas está lá) que só por si me mete à frente do resto do pessoal que tenha acabado de sair do seu curso, e os três anos extra de pedalada (fraquinha, diga-se passagem, mas mais uma vez está lá). Acontece que eu pesquisei bastante por mim por casa, e me interessei bastante pela área, e é uma área que favorece bastante o pessoal auto-didacta digo-te já, a Internet é o melhor recurso que tens para aprender sobre a área, melhor que o curso por si posso já dizer-te. Investi milhares e milhares de horas em trabalho por mim que neste momento posso-te afirmar com toda a certeza que me metem acima de praticamente qualquer licenciado ou qualquer outra pessoa ""com o papel"" em termos de capacidades, claro que continua a ser bastante restrito à área em especifico da programação, quando o curso de longe não é só isso e te dá outras capacidades fundamentais, e não é reconhecido, para além das dezenas de projectos avançados que tenho em repositórios online.

Posso-te dizer que cheguei ao primeiro ano e decidi que antes de mais ia logo cortar as Matemáticas a 1 por semestre, isto pode parecer estúpido por estares a cortar nas cadeiras que estás a fazer mas é bastante benéfico se pensares bem. Permite-te ter mais tempo livre para te aplicares a sério naquelas que estás a fazer, ter muito melhor média que de outra forma, já para não falar que tens cadeiras que vais ver que para ti são peanuts, portanto com o tempo livre extra que tens acabas por ter muito tempo para te aplicar a sério na cadeira de Matemática que estás a fazer. O resultado prático disto acaba por ser que fazes todas as cadeiras para as quais te aplicas-te, com melhor média que os outros geralmente, enquanto que os outros se for preciso acabam por fazer ainda menos que tu, mesmo cortando as matemáticas desta forma.

Nunca fui mau a matemática, bem pelo contrário, contam-se pelos dedos das mãos os testes que fazia antes do 10º ano em que não tivesse pelo menos 90%, mas isso é ridiculamente simples comparado com o nível do ensino superior ou mesmo secundário, de qualquer modo as bases triviais e o raciocínio lógico está lá, e bem apurado, o que me permite apanhar as coisas, mas não te vou mentir, também tive de recorrer a explicações para o fazer, apesar de acreditar que com o esforço devido através de sites como khan academy lá chegaria.

Se tu estás certo do que queres seguir e se é uma área que te desperta interesse acho que deverias pelo menos ponderar esta possibilidade. Não te vou mentir a dizer que vais sair de lá preparado para a vida profissional, porque para além de exercer como técnico de informática e resolver os problemas dos outros não há muito que vás fazer, nem que de facto os cursos são bastante básicos, mas no meu caso deu-me aquele empurrão necessário para me motivar a começar a aprender por mim muito mais e aprofundar a um nível ridiculamente superior do que o que era suposto as coisas.

Boa sorte.

By allowing Hydra to ladder on EU and participate in WCS NA, he has no incentive to practice on NA which further disables potential talent in NA from growing. In what way doe that possibly help the NA scene grow? 

2. I understand that you've developed a personal relationship with Hydra and that he is helping the team out by practicing with one another, but i can't help but feel it has blinded you to some of the other concerns. While Hydra makes an effort to learn English and communicate with his fans, sometimes that's just not enough. The language/culture barrier is a very real thing for me and i believe for many others as well. It's really hard to watch someone like Hydra because the most important part about viewership is personality/communication and without a similar background nor the ability to communicate well, the interest to watch just isn't there. 

3. Without the ability to ""home grow"" foreign streamers as you mentioned in 2013, the viewership and money won't be there. You were right. There is not incentive for foreigners to get better or to provide new content when the outcome of winning something like NA WCS is slim to none. But if NA as a community sees the opportunity to make a living in SC2 b/c the competition is less fierce, perhaps a new drive and hunger will come to fruition and from there, NA pros will feel more competition between  one another. The drive to practice hard and be better than the other NA player will be there until we can finally compete on the Korean level. One of the best Zerg players of all time, Life, developed from this simple domestic hunger: the drive to be better than his friend. Right now it's okay to lose to Polt, to lose to Hydra there is no shame to it. Nobody can blame you for it. Now if i lose to a friend or someone closer to home i'll want to work harder. For example, Polt beat me in WCS no problem, but if someone like Avilo beat me in WCS NA I'll be practicing 10x harder because ill think, man i can beat this guy. Once i beat him, he'll think man i can beat this guy. The cycle of getting better between both players will continue until finally one or both can compete with Koreans.  With the right motivation, it seems that players will get better on their own. Without a complete region lock, the hunger and desire to get truly better isn't there. You said it best. Why try.

&gt; O prolongamento [do CCB] terá que ser antecedido de estudos que permitam requalificar este grande quarteirão e isto está a ser estudado também com a Câmara Municipal de Lisboa

&gt; Aquilo que defendo, e tenho estado em contacto com a Câmara [de Lisboa] é que haja aqui uma parceria para a promoção de todas estas coisas [espaços em Belém e Ajuda]

[Fonte](http://www.tsf.pt/portugal/interior/antonio-lamas-proximo-governo-tem-que-decidir-futuro-do-ccb-4521717.html)

&gt; Uma das críticas de João Soares passa pelo “dinheiro à fartazana” que foi gasto a propósito do eixo Belém-Ajuda, sem que a Câmara Municipal de Lisboa tivesse sido ouvida. António Lamas, por sua vez, nega, afirmando que reuniu várias vezes com vereadores.

[Fonte](http://observador.pt/2016/02/26/presidente-do-ccb-responde-joao-soares-diz-nao-demite/)

&gt; apesar da Câmara Municipal de Lisboa só gerir na zona o Padrão dos Descobrimentos, o seu envolvimento na gestão do conjunto das várias unidades patrimoniais de Belém - como responsável pela qualidade e funcionamento do complexo território que as une - é fundamental.

[Fonte](http://www.publico.pt/opiniao/jornal/o-modelo-da-parques-de-sintra-monte-da-lua-e-aplicavel-em-belem-27323534)

E o envolvimento foi até confirmado pelo Público:

&gt; António Lamas será ainda apoiado na sua missão por ""uma comissão de natureza consultiva"", continua João Póvoas. Nesta comissão consultiva, soube o PÚBLICO, terão assento representantes da Direcção-Geral do Património Cultural (DGPC), do Turismo de Portugal, da Comissão de Coordenação e Desenvolvimento Regional de Lisboa e Vale do Tejo, do Estado-Maior da Armada, da Câmara Municipal de Lisboa, entre outros.

[Fonte](http://www.publico.pt/culturaipsilon/noticia/antonio-lamas-dirige-estrutura-de-missao-para-repensar-zona-monumental-de-belem-1699407)

Eis o que o Fernando Medina disse acerca dessa Comissão:

&gt; A Câmara de Lisboa não teve qualquer participação na elaboração do relatório”, lamentou Fernando Medina, referindo-se ao plano, que, entre outros aspectos, propõe a criação de percursos temáticos relacionados com os Descobrimentos, a criação do Distrito Cultural de Belém e a ampliação do Centro Cultural de Belém (CCB). 

&gt; O autarca socialista, que falava na reunião da Assembleia Municipal de Lisboa desta terça-feira, acrescentou ainda que a autarquia “decidiu não integrar o conselho consultivo” que foi criado para apoiar a estrutura de missão coordenada pelo presidente do CCB. “Este processo não começou bem, prosseguiu pior e esperemos que tenha um final feliz, com a extinção da equipa e a confinação ao que são as competências próprias de cada um”, concluiu.

[Fonte](http://www.publico.pt/local/noticia/medina-critica-plano-estrategico-para-belem-e-pede-extincao-de-estrutura-1714041)

Portanto temos o António Lamas a construir toda uma estratégia, desde antes de ir para o CCB, para o eixo Belém-Ajuda, a ter discussões com a CML desde o início, segundo o próprio, e o Medina, que só foi para lá há meses diz que não foi ouvido e recusou fazer parte da Comissão. 

Se realmente não houvesse reuniões eu acho que a CML já teria desmentido o homem há mais tempo. Só desde o fim do ano passado que começaram a aparecer queixas, e depois do João Soares dizer que era contra. Isto é tudo muito estranho, e só esperando para ver as cartas todas na mesa, mas até lá o António Lamas está a ser muito menos inconstante no discurso do que a CML, do meu ponto de vista.

&gt; Não leves a mal, porque não te estou a chamar o mesmo, mas esse argumento parece os republicanos americanos atrasados mentais a falar de aquecimento global. ""Aquecimento global?!? Mas ainda este mês nevou e esteve um frio de rachar! DUR DUR!""

Tudo bem, é evidência anedótica contra evidência anedótica. Como é que se mede a quantidade de cultura bruta/líquida no CCB?

Breaking fingsers was also common, but was more of an annoyance or pain technique than a fight-winning method. 

The emphasis on backmount, like in early catch-wrestling, is likely due to the general wrestling styles of the time, in which grappling was taught with Pins as a winning condition.

The reality is a little bit more disturbing: http://i.imgur.com/th0mNiv.jpg

If a million people move from Pakistan to the US -- then the people moving might be more moderate than the average. But you will still get hundreds of thousands of people thinking adulterous women should be stoned. That is, a hole is dug in the ground, she is placed in it, and stones thrown at her until she is dead, which can take quite a bit of time. That's what at least half the population wants to do. If a hundred thousand comes, that's tens of thousands who want to do stoning.

Democrats in the US fly off the handles if a Christian organisation does not want to pay for contraceptives. You have really seen nothing of extremism. Why so many Democrats and left-wingers dream of importing so many who want to stone adulterers to death or a range of other very very fucked up things is beyond me. It also seems like an extremist position. Trump would probably base this off countries, like we already have different Visa requiremens for different countries, and only limit permanent immigration - e.g. visiting would still be okay. Hence anyone who has higher education travelling for a purpose would probably not be affected. It would also be for a limited time until the situation referenced changes.

(And even if they won't literally stone someone in the USA and be charged with murder - there's still a really good chance they will treat them like utter shit, as in Europe)

If you have ideas on how to separate between someone who thinks adulterers should be stoned and who don't, that would be useful.

With some nomadic groups, borders moved as the tribe moved, but these groups tended to move in a large circle around the same general patch of land.

The Europeans and natives were living by two different sets of land rules. Just because the natives didn't conceive of land ownership as the Europeans, it doesn't mean that it was just fine to stake a claim on the land the natives were living on.

I'm going to disagree with that being ""not not ok."" Not just the land thieving, but the genocide that the American government committed against the native population puts this whole issue squarely in the ""not ok"" camp for me.

Obviously, there's nothing we can really do about this today (other than provide opportunities and support for the existing native community. If we can actively oppress them, we can also actively help them flourish). I was born into this country; I wasn't actively out slaughtering native 2-300 years ago.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquaintance_rape

&gt;Most rapes are perpetrated by a person known to the victim, however, it is less likely to be reported than stranger rape and thus crime statistics often underestimate the prevalence of acquaintance rape compared to national surveys. 


The statistics are somewhat eye opening:


&gt;A 2004-05 study of 30 predominantly European countries by the United Nations Research Institute found about half of rape victims knew their rapists, over a third by name. 17% were a colleague or boss, 16% a close friend, 11% a former partner, and 7% a current partner.[9] 


&gt;In the United States, acquaintance rape frequently takes the form of date rape or gang rape. A 1987 survey of 7,000 students at 25 schools found that one in four had been a victim of rape or attempted rape, and 84% of those knew their attacker.[12]

Ivare:

&gt;*var-:*

&gt;&gt;change, transform, make different

Enim:

&gt;This one seems to be an amalgamation of sorts between 'en' and 'im', or just a conjugation of one.

&gt;*en:* (discussed in main post)

&gt;&gt;cause to be in; on all sides, completely (could be taken as 'of' or 'for' something on top of these meanings)

&gt;*im/in/il:*

&gt;&gt; in, into, according to

&gt;&gt;(also 'ir') un-, not (negation)

&gt;So, interestingly, 'Enim' could potentially mean 'for', 'into', 'according to', or 'not for', 'not into', 'not according to'. Though, I think making any claims about where exactly this word is derived from would be stretching things — there is too much wiggle room here in my opinion.

Euge:

&gt;The first word of this phrase I looked into, which made me believe it holds up

&gt;*eu-:*

&gt;&gt;well, good

*****

Making the whole phrase literally something like: 'I transform according to good'...pretty much 'For the greater good'. Through this you could potentially make the claim that it means both that and 'Against the greater good', but I wouldn't put much stock in it (although I do think the Amyr aren't quite as benevolent as they claim)

So a little anti-climactic; 'Ivare Enim Euge' seems to translate into exactly what we are told it does. But I find that in itself interesting. If nothing else it helps validate the method of using real-world etymologies. It even implies a relationship between the archaic Temic language and our own archaic Latin/Greek, as the in-universe translation matches up.

What I want to achieve in this league: start with 10hour+ rush with people who know how to race(loot share lvling), but anyone who wants help playing HC/Crafting build is also fine. I'm willing to help out(I'm a long time POE player). Voicecomunication will be setup to help improve the communication and reduce the death amount.

Putin is merely trying to protect his own interests. Russia has a naval base in Crimea, one of the only ports their navy has access to which is ice free all year round. They were never going to allow NATO to threaten that base. The US wouldn't allow a Russian puppet government to threaten access to the Panama or Suez canals or the Persian gulf. 

The west seems to have followed a very strange policy of attempting to encircle Russia by adding tin pot eastern European republics which are of no strategic value to NATO which was formed as a defensive organisation for the western capitalist nations at the height of the cold war. 

It caused the Georgian war in 2008 because NATO gave weapons to a country with a lunatic for president who decided to shell ethnic Russian civilians and thought he could get away with that. Ironically the same lunatic who caused that war is banned from his own country and is now in Ukraine where the EU and US were probably involved with this maiden movement which stirred up all sorts of long standing ethnic issues in that country and thought that it would be peaches and cream. One of the more overlooked oddities of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union is how many of the conquered soviet peoples were willing to put on a German uniform and help in the systematic extermination of their own race. They were known as Hiwis. The large numbers of them captured especially after the surrender of the 6th army at Stalingrad made Stalin even more paranoid than he already was. There are all sorts of extremist anti Russian sentiments in these areas and no shortage of lunatics who will go out and start a war.

Turkey WILL NOT accept them back. You can ""tell them"" to go back, but you CAN'T DEPORT them to Turkey. 

And once you do, they'll sink their plastic boat and you are obligated to rescue them.

Then, most of them have no papers, you have to process them to figure out country of origin (which is a logistical nightmare, but you fail to grasp simple geopolitical concepts, so I doubt you'd be able to grasp that as well) and THEN you can deport those that are not legit refugees.

So that's actually a reason for why the UK does need to get out with two thirds of its trade in services, and so it can make deals which put an emphasis there.

If this really would be true that this is the case, then the rules have to be changed.

It simply cannot be that some countries are allowed to send inifinite amounts of people to other countries to pay for (which is what they do, in practice), but the receiving countries has no right to do the same. 

.
&gt; And once you do, they'll sink their plastic boat and you are obligated to rescue them. 

If Greece is 'obligated to rescue them', then the same has to apply for Turkey as well.

So put them on a boat en route to Turkey. If they arrive to the shore, then the issue is solved. If they start to sink themselves, it is also solved because Turkey will have to rescue them.

It Turkey can do this, then so can everyone else.

.
&gt; Then, most of them have no papers, you have to process them to figure out country of origin

According to the Geneva convention, refugees do NOT have the right to choose a country. It is the first safe country that should process them and harbour them.

I said ""because... reasons"" dismissively because there literally can be no reasons. There is no possible reason for 7.1 billion people to listen to you or for that matter for them to agree on anything at all. The very concept of a consensus breaks down at that species-wide scale into people forming smaller groups that do whatever they want instead.

&gt; We as a society decide what is right and wrong through debate.

Here's where you're mistaken. We don't. We as a society decide what's legal and illegal. That has little to nothing to do with what's right or wrong and in fact there are numerous examples of things that a majority thought were morally right (or at least morally neutral) but were made illegal and vice versa.

&gt; Just because Im saying something contrary to your beliefs does not make me self centered.

No, but acting as if you are able to speak on behalf of the entire human race does. Maybe self-centered isn't the best word to communicate the idea I'm going for. How about conceited? Sounds a bit harsher but probably more accurate since it doesn't carry the connotation of greed that self-centered does.

&gt; Was Nelson Mandela being self centered for standing up for his beliefs? Was the resistance in nazi europe being self centered? Was !andela not qualified to stand up for blacks in south africa? 

Yes to all of the above. They all wanted something, looked around for other people who wanted that same thing, and then took actions to try to get that thing they wanted. It's really hard to lead anything significant without being self-centered. It requires a certain level of confidence that you are better than everyone else at something to try to lead anything significant. Gandhi, for example, wasn't nearly as humble as he pretended to be, the man was just a genius at stirring unrest into a simmering revolt while setting himself up so the British aristocracy would look horrible and make a martyr if they took any action against him. Even according to his own biography, he started his PR-based methods after rejecting the historically common violent overthrows that his predecessors had failed in.",t5_2qnts,1460373854,t3_48h1c8,1,t1_d0k3pyh,

The debate lies in the density of these intellectuals. Life isn't so polarizing. There are jews dumber than you, and blacks smarter than you. It's best to take everyone as an individual, because applying statistics to people is ridiculous. 

If you live in the hood, you're going to meet mostly dumb black/Mexicans/some white people. If you live in the suburbs you'll meet average whites, blacks Mexicans, Asians, whatever. If you live in rural areas in the country side, you're most likely to meet dumber white people. Everything has its place of origin. Race, if it is a factor at all, is not the most defining. Sierra Leone is almost entirely black, and yet it has a higher average IQ than some southern European nations. Sierra Leona is even a poor example, because it is a hellhole. 

Nigerian immigrants are doing well in Western Europe, and their children are often the ones filling the diversity quotas in American universities, because they don't self-victimize with their inferiority complex. I'm not expecting you to know too much about black American culture, but it is a joke. Early child development (probably the most defining aspect of intelligence) is overlooked as poor black parents tend to polarize between working 17 part time jobs, and being strung out of 17 different drugs.

Another interesting thing is black students tend to score more poorly on tests where they are required to mark their race. (one of the few things in Gladwell's ""Blink"" that was well cited) The problem with blacks likely lies in their minds, not in their genes.

Once we get all of this squared away, we can start looking at statistical evidence. It's disingenuous to assume that such a polygenic trait could be so binary.

Edit: I'm aware of studies done on blacks and whites where equality of opportunity was given in theory, but it isn't possible to account for factors such as inferiority complexes and black societal expectations/roles.

Oh and let's not forget Sweden has become the rape capital of the world:

Because these countries have a small government, free trade, right wing immigration policy. Sweden has the most right wing immigration policy in Europe.


&gt;However, there is one case where neoliberalism has had a significant impact on labour immigration policy, namely Sweden. In 2008, Sweden introduced the most expansive migration policy in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2011). The reform was introduced by a coalition between the governing right-wing parties and the Green Party. The reform has weakened the influence of trade unions, and it has given employers a significantly larger influence on immigration (Prop. 2007/2008: 147). Furthermore, the reforms decreased the involvement of state authorities in the recruitment of foreign workers.

Where to begin..  [This is where they are](https://www.google.com.ar/maps/place/Tigre,+Buenos+Aires/@-34.4216442,-58.5784618,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x95bca5a2d0ddb9b1:0x2c1a974c67cba1e4), If they actually are in Tigre. It's a suburb near Buenos Aires, Argentina's Capital and biggest city, and this is our [Flag](http://www.ecolo.mrecic.gov.ar/userfiles/BANDERA_ARGENTINA.png). 90% of Argentinians are descendants from europeans who fled during the first world war. Mostly italians, french and spanish. %92 of Argentinians are Roman Catholics, but less than 20% actually practice. Spanish is our main language and there's around 42 million of us. We have free healthcare, free higher education and gay marriage, constent age is 16, and you can vote if you want to. At 18 you have to vote, can drive and drink (not together). No legal drugs here.

""Cada familia es un mundo"" (Each family is a world) meaning that I can't speak for your family members, but I'll do my best to represent the average family here. So, random facts about everything:

* Tango, while it's a big part of our cultural heritage, it's not widespread. There're a lot of groups who practice and celebrate our folklore, but not everyone here knows how to dance Tango, nor it's heard everywhere.

* The most comercially sucessful genre here is rock! [This is a post I made once sharing some links](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/31otoi/rmusic_name_your_country_and_10_bands_from_there/cq3te9p).

* However if you go to a club, you will mostly hear [Reggaeton](https://youtu.be/Xk0wdDTTPA0), [Cumbia](), or something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w5VdCJGRcM).

* If you have kids, they'll go to elementary school until 12 and then highschool until 18. On average they'll stay with their parents until 23-28, when they either get a degree or enough income to get a new home.

* Working hours are 8am to 5pm on average. Dinner at 9pm. Both members of the family work, is not usual to have a stay-at-home parent. Sunday lunch is for family reunions almost everywhere, every week.

* [Asados](http://lgfotoyvideo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/asado.jpg), [Empanadas](http://www.bougicatering.com.ar/images/empanadas_small1.jpg), [Alfajores](http://www.alimentosaptos.com.ar/post/alfajor-2e-big.jpg), [Dulce de leche](http://razafolklorica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dulce-de-leche-pastelero-copia.jpg), [Milanesas](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/69-DVvEtjWQ/maxresdefault.jpg). A lot of wine and meat.

* [Mate!](http://static0.misionesonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mate_CLAIMA20121010_0215_4.jpg) So, the [Yerba](http://www.apollotea.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/Green_Yerba_Mate_4f17221b5592c.jpg) goes inside the [Mate](http://mla-s1-p.mlstatic.com/pava-electrica-ranser-de-17-lts-je-ra88-ideal-mate-cafe-te-17723-MLA20143993454_082014-F.jpg) with a [Bombilla](http://www.ladespensa.nl/files/images/364.jpg) inside. You pour hot water into it and drink. It tastes a bit bitter. It's hard to explain but it's not just a beverage, we drink this while working, studying, talking, on a pool, on a park.. everywhere. And it's a social thing. Is like inviting someone to have a coffee with you so you can catch up, but with mate. And the thing is that when you do, there's not one mate for each person, instead someone pours the mate for everyone else and  we all drink from the same one. 

* What else.. You greet women with a kiss in the cheek, men with a handshake. There's not bargaining in stores, tips are not mandatory but are still welcomed by waiters and hotel staff, taxes are included in the price. 

That's all I can think off the top of my head. It's a beautiful country, sadly hurt by a lot of corruption from the last governant on the last few years. If you ever have a chance to come visit, take my advice: Don't stay on Buenos Aires. It's a great city with a lot of culture, but we have some of the most beautiful landscapes and it would be a shame if all you saw was a city. Google images from ""Villa La Angostura"", ""Glaciar Perito Moreno"", ""Cataratas de Iguazu"", ""Cordillera de los Andes"" and ""Salta"".

It was pretty intense, when you are travelling with someone its kind of 24hr/day 7 days a week kind of thing. It wasn't a contiguous 3 months, we took a break for a few weeks at a time before meeting up again. Each time we were away from each other we found it pretty difficult, because we didn't know when or if we were going to meet up again. I was very close to trying to make a move to her home country to see how the relationship would go in a more normal setting outside of the travel bubble, but I didn't want to make a strong commitment to it so since it would mean the end of my travel not just in the short term but likely long term. Since she doesn't have the means to travel like I do at the moment. In the end we called it quits and I moved on.

Having the option to spend a few weeks with someone you meet while travelling together is great. Lets face it, travel relationships/flings can be awesome. However, they are relationships that are inside a bubble, detached from what we consider 'normal life'.

In general I think that I would only want to do the kind of long term, open ended travelling I have been doing while single.

Part 1 of 3: 

I died as I lived. In my fantasies, that meant dying during a drug-fueled orgy featuring the love(s) of my life, plus several attractive models and athletes of various genders. In reality, that meant that after a long day staring at a computer screen at work, I went home and had a massive heart attack while playing Civilization V.

Did I have any regrets? Too many to count. 

Upon arrival in heaven, I found myself filled with joy and the Spirit of the Lord. I was here! In life I had never quite been able to believe in God, or any other gods, for that matter. I had feared that, in death, we would simply cease to exist (or, when I was being optimistic, that we would become one with nature, or the life force of the planet). I had always meant to ask other atheists and agnostics how they dealt with this fear, but I had never gotten around to doing so--like so many other things.

But now I was in heaven--Heaven, even! Standing upon what appeared to be a cloud, the ""pearly"" gates gleamed and glimmered in all the colors of the rainbow, with a silvery, opalescent shine. Below them stood an tall old man. He wore a white robe and leather thong sandals, and carried a shepherd's crook. His hair and beard gleamed silvery white. He nodded at me and smiled. ""WELCOME, MY CHILD. YOU HAVE TRAVELED FAR."" I could feel His voice in my very bones, as if no ears were necessary to hear it. It was deep, rich, and velvety--laden with supernatural authority. After a moment, I realized that I had heard this voice many times before.

""God?"" I asked. He nodded. ""Why do you sound like Morgan Freeman?""

His laugh was rich, and boomed like distant thunder. ""MY SWEET CHILD, ALTHOUGH YOU ARE AS CLEVER AS ANY OF MY CREATIONS, NO HUMAN CAN WITNESS MY TRUE SPLENDOR. YOU SIMPLY SEE THE PARTS OF ME WHICH YOU EXPECT TO SEE. I APPEAR IN THIS FASHION TO MANY SOULS FROM YOUR ERA.

""So, you're saying, 'this isn't even your final form?'""

""HUMOR. A COMMON RESPONSE TO FEAR.""

""Perhaps I would be less afraid if you were less intimidating and Old Testament-patriarchal?"" At this, God's form began to change, becoming slender and nearly naked, and bearing a strong resemblance to a certain female musician. As She began to speak, I realized that Her voice had softened, as well.

""All I really want is to make you feel welcome, My child. However, as you ought to know, more dogmatic individuals than you would find the suggestion that I would take this form to be deeply offensive. Ironic, is it not?""

I nodded, and put one hand in my pocket, feeling far more at ease. ""Perfect. Thank you."" As I said this, my fingers touched a metal object that I had not noticed before. I pulled a shining silver key from my pocket. 

""Come forth and enter, for yours in the Kingdom of Heaven."" She gestured to the ornate lock at the center of the pearly gates. 

I inserted the key into the lock, turned it, and was rewarded with a deeply-satisfying click. The gates swung open, and then gradually dissolved. We now stood upon a great grassy meadow, bounded by tall hedgerows. It was dotted with trees bearing all manner of fruit, under which lay rocks in the shape of tables and benches deeply-cushioned with emerald moss. Birdsong drifted over us on a gentle wind.

God gestured expansively, ""In the early days of the universe, My rules were harsh. In time, however, I realized that forbidding certain fruits only encourages many of My children to partake of them. In this garden, you may sample the fruits of knowledge as often as you wish. In heaven, the peace of God will always be with you,"" She smiled, ""and also with your spirit.""

I nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. ""This is wonderful, but I see no other people.""

""Yes. This is the oldest part of Heaven. It is now perhaps more of a lobby than a true dwelling place for souls. Nonetheless, it is still enjoyed by many."" She gestured behind me as she spoke. I turned and saw in the distance a large party of men and women in regency-era attire picnicking beneath an ancient oak. Some laughed and drank wine, while others simply lay in the grass reading and making an occasional comment to their companions.

God continued, ""After creating this first part of Heaven, I realized that many of My aims were at odds with one another. Original sin was a product of this. Instilling my children with both earthly desires and free will meant that few, other than infants, could live a sinless life. When My children began to join Me here, I was faced with a choice: remove the earthly desires that led to their sinning--essentially making emotionless angels out of men--or simply accept My children as they were. My love for My children led Me to choose the latter. I love all of My children, sinners though they may be."" Her smile was like unto a sunrise.

I cleared my throat--an act which seemed like it should have been unnecessary in Heaven. ""But what about people who have committed grave or cardinal sins, or those whom we might call 'evil.' Does Hitler have a place in Heaven?""

""For some sinners, I have undertaken rehabilitation programs with . . . varying degrees of success. Given time, however, even these children will come to understand the error of their ways."" She began to walk toward one of the hedgerows that bounded the great meadow. ""For My children of what you call the 'modern' era, I have devised six circles of Heaven. Each circle represents the range of sins and misdeeds which My children have committed, as well as their virtues. Some sinners are assigned a dwelling place within a given circle. Others, like you, are guilty of a variety of lesser, venal sins--for which I forgive you--and are permitted to choose your place of dwelling. All are permitted to travel between these circles, or to the Garden,"" she gestured to the meadow behind us, ""but are returned to their own dwelling each night.""

This surprised me. ""A curfew? But why?""

""While I wish to provide all of my children with their fill of both earthly and heavenly delights, in doing so, it is My desire to gradually free you all from sin without affecting your free will. Your circle and your dwelling are designed to help you in that process. Shall we examine your choices?""

I nodded, still awed by Her presence, but feeling increasingly wary, as well.

""Good. Although the choice is yours, I believe that this first circle may be the best fit for you."" God led me to a gap between two hedgerows. Atop two cigar-shaped pillars, stood an arch that appeared to have been wrought from stainless steel. The shining words appeared to be in every language at once. After a moment looking at them, I squeezed my eyes shut against the sensory overload. Behind my eyelids, I could still read the after-image of the words: ""Tomorrow Land."" 

God placed her hand on my shoulder, and the pain lifted. ""The Ur-language of Babel. You may now read and speak it without further discomfort."" When I opened my eyes again, I saw the the pillars were made in the form of stylized rockets. God gestured, and we stepped through the arch . . . finding ourselves in another garden. Before us stood a massive iron-and-glass building twenty stories high, and nearly a mile in length. There were full-size trees and entire streets and ""outdoor"" markets within the greenhouse-like building, and I could make out people in a various styles of dress strolling on balconies and catwalks on the upper levels. 

""The Crystal Palace,"" God said. ""Built in London for the Great Exhibition of 1851--though this version is somewhat larger than the original.""

""But I thought this circle would be about the future.""

""It is. Or rather, it is about the future as My children from the modern era saw it."" Without having noticed any transition, I realized that had entered the Palace and were now walking down the Grand Promenade. The other pedestrians were dressed in clothes ranging from the Revolutionary-era (American or French--I wasn't a fashion historian) to bizarre styles that must have been created decades after I was born. Still others wore garb more appropriate for a steampunk novel or a science fiction convention. Despite God's presence, they seemed to take little notice of us.

I cleared my throat again. ""Please forgive me if this question is impertinent, but what does all of this have to do with sin?"" 

God smiled softly--a candle to her earlier sunrise. As if on cue, we passed a Victorian brothel doing a booming trade. Next door was a raucous tavern advertising gin distilled on-site. Most patrons drank from large crystal tumblers, while a few were engaged in a fistfight that seemed on the verge of spreading to the neighboring establishments--which consisted of an ale house (""Sunday roast served daily!""), a cheese shop (""Toutes les fromages Europeens!""), and the aforementioned brothel (""People of every preference welcome! Expert massages and napping areas available!""). 

We turned a corner and the noise dimmed. God said, ""It is very rare indeed for one of My children to commit only one type of sin. It is common, however, for all of my children to want that which they cannot have. For this reason, you might argue that envy lies at the heart of all sins.""

""Not pride?"" I asked.

She shook Her head, ""Pride is another matter altogether.""

The WTO dispute settlement panel also found that the USA misreported certain programmes as ‘non trade-distorting’, when in fact they were trade-distorting

I have lived in many different countries and wherever I go the expats bitch about local customs, food, shops, government and whatever else. The refugees may be complaining about German food, but really they are homesick - when they are complaining about the food its really about other things, though they may not even realise it themselves. I find it sad that you so thoroughly discount the needs of refugees - and yes, palatable food is a human need.

If you want these refugees to integrate you must treat them, their culture, and their customs with respect. When your culture is attacked by outsiders you want to cling to it, you want to totally reject the culture you are immersed in - again it is human nature. Integration is eased when giving up your own identity and culture is not a prerequisite.  

Two countries stand out for me as having been easy to live in as an expat: the UK and New Zealand. In contrast to some other places, people their were not in love with the idea of their national superiority. I could happily call myself British or Kiwi in addition to my native identity, without suffering any sensation of loss, because I never felt my own culture was looked down upon there. I could never call myself French, American* or Australian, to choose three examples, as sense of superiority is pervasive throughout, to identify myself with the native population would be to tactility agree (I feel) that my own culture is inferior. I've never been to Germany, so I can't comment on that, but I have been to the Netherlands and Denmark and I can see that it would be very difficult to integrate in those countries. 

PS: I am white/European, just adding this to provide some context, my viewpoint on Muslim refugees might carry less weight if you thought I was form a Muslim country.

You asked a question, I gave an answer. If you don't like the fact that I am confident in my knowledge because I worked in the field, that's your problem. I'm very direct. Comes from years of working on campaigns. It's shitty work, don't ever do it. 

&gt; I lived in Germany for 6 months last year, so know alittle bit about the political situation there and became more interested in European politics in general by proxy.

Ok, I lived there for three years, and also spent some time in France and Eastern Europe. 

&gt;My credibility (or shiny piece of paper) is my experience in living in alot of places over the past few years and Im noticing this trend of people of different beliefs becoming more and more extreme.

You asked specifically about U.S. politics. I answered in the scope of your question. If you had a different question then you should have asked that one instead. ""Extreme"" beliefs are a different matter. If you look below the surface, you will notice they have the same content as other prior movements, just harsher language. Most of this anger you are seeing isn't even organized. I'd daresay most of the people you speak to who hold those beliefs can even articulate them to you in a meaningful way. 

&gt;I think this trend is also happening in western Europe, but this shouldn't be an argument to say that U.S. is not becoming too politically diverse.

Ok, what left-wing movement is taking root in the U.S.? Please, don't say Sanders, because then I will know that you don't understand what left-wing politics actually are. Sanders is not a socialist. Socialism has a specific definition, which Sanders doesn't not fit. I know ""socialist"" is often used as a slur in U.S. politics, but it has a meaning. Trump is certainly not left-wing. He's an authoritarian for the most part, and those rarely come in left-wing form. Look at what these people argue for. Let's say Isreal-each and every candidate will give you the same answer on that question (even Sanders does). That's not diversity. Economic issues? Each and every one of these people support capitalism. There are no anti-capitalists in U.S. politics (well, I think there is someone on a city council in Seattle.). On all the major issues, none of the people running have wildly differing opinions. The biggest rift is on social issues between the center and the right. But, when discussing the general status quo in the U.S, you won't see much differing opinion. That's not diversity. It's still pretty solidly right-wing. As for the extreme nature of Trump-that's nothing new in U.S. politics. Authoritarians rear their head from time to time in our elections. It's just been a long time since the last time it happened (go look up McCarthy, arguably Nixon).  Even Sanders is nothing new, he's just a return of FDR style politics. Both Sanders and Trump seem to embrace isolationism, but that's a very old strain in American politics. We do have libertarians, but they are just an odd combo of the social-center and right-wing economics. 

Now, perhaps you mean ""divisive"", and if that is what you meant, I'd agree with you. I don't see how the world can be too diverse? Are choices bad for people? Should we all just tote the same line?

Levando em consideração que quem tem baixa renda só compra produtos de alta prioridade, paga menos dos 18% que é a alíquota média de ICMS, ainda tem que pagar mais uns trocos de IPI e IPTU (dependendo de onde residir), fato é que alguém de baixa renda paga BEM menos de 35% de imposto. Mas claro, é o Estado malvadão que rouba o trabalhador, não são os grande concentradores de renda, nem os governantes (governador, neste caso) que fazem mal uso dos impostos arrecadados (privilegiando serviços públicos utilizados pela camada mais rica da população), não, a culpa é do Estado malvadão, ou melhor, é a idéia abstrata de Estado que é puramente malvada, pois imposto é roubo. 

Todos os serviços deveriam ser privatizados, ah que mundo lindo seria, segurança privatizada, judiciário privatizado, mercado totalmente desregulado, que lindo! 

O homem é o lobo do homem no socialismo, pois sempre vai ter um querendo tirar vantagem dos benefícios dados pelo governo, ou não vai cumprir sua parte, mas não no ancap, no ancap o homem é daora e segue o pacto da não agressão, não há maneira nenhuma de quem detém mais capital ter poder desproporcional. /s

Granted ""immediate asylum""?

That's not true either.

When someone arrives in Germany seeking to claim asylum there is a test that determines whether Germany should process their application or whether they should be sent to some other EU country to have their application processed there.  

What Merkel did was suspend that test on select categories of asylum seekers.  This was in response to an urgent looming humanitarian crisis as a result of Greece being overwhelmed by the volume of arrivals and people building up on borders.

In other words Merkel's actions provably occurred after the situation had reached crisis point - the crisis you're trying to blame on these same actions.  

&gt; Between those two statements it is a clear invitation to have people flock to Germany and have their try at claiming assylum. 

But again there's the minor detail that what you're accusing her of didn't happen.  The only ""immediate"" thing anyone was granted was access to the system for applying for asylum in Germany and the only way in which she changed the Dublin rules was to grant immediate access to the system for applying for asylum.  

So what you call two things is actually one thing inaccurately described twice.  What's the difference between that and flat out making shit up?  

&gt; Between those two statements it is a clear invitation to have people flock to Germany and have their try at claiming assylum. 


This is absurd - the system is actually supposed to be accessible to applicants.  If there is a huge advantage to being processed in one place and that place is simply following the guidelines in that process it's not that countries fault other countries are falling so short of of their obligations to provide timely access and outcomes that people prefer the more efficient country.

All Merkel did was grant access to an application system they're legally entitled to access.

And again this action of Merkel's was a response to the immigration crisis - since the cause of that crisis has to proceed the crisis how can Merkel's response have caused it?  Merkel granted automatic access to the system for people who had entered through Greece because Greece was completely overwhelmed by the people already there and the situation had reached a crisis point.  It was an emergency solution to the crisis you're trying to say it caused.

The people going from Greece to Germany isn't the problem - it's a consequence of the problem.

&gt; Worse because Germany has a terrible record of actually being able to deport people, especially from places like North Africa and Central Asia, even if they get rejected its not like they will be kicked out. 

This is nonsense - they were in Greece not being processed.  How were they ever going to have their applications rejected if they were not even being processed?  

Being good at returning rejected applicants is easy enough if you never actually reject any applications because you just don't process them preferring to tacitly encourage people to just slip over the border and wander about Europe being someone elses problem.  

Germany has already being sending unsuccessful applicants back to their country of origin while thousands have voluntarily abandoned their applications and returned to their country of origin since being granted access to Germany's application process.  

They'd probably all still be in the EU right now if Germany had not opened up its application system.


&gt; People are not so stupid as to not realize an opportunity. All they had to do was say they were Syrians. 

What opportunity?  The opportunity to access an application system they're supposed to have timely access to?  

And once again - this was a response to a crisis that was already happening so how could it be the cause of that same crisis?",t5_2qh13,1460378165,t3_48bb5q,1,t1_d0jyvqr,

0,,d0kg36o,Rarehero,1456900774,15,germany,False,0,False,,"&gt;Or am I reading propaganda meant to sway my opinion or thoughts on the matter? Is it not even an issue?

Yep, kinda. And you are falling for onesided media coverage that mostly shows the drama but not the average person who is probably not laid back about the entire situation (of course not) but has a moderate and more sensible opinion about all this and doesn't judge people based on their nationalities.

Let me return the question: Do all US-American people hate Blacks and Hispanics? Is there a civil war going in the US between the different so called races? Are you all that agitated about Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims and refugees that you need Trump as your new leader? Because that's what the US can look like from the outside if you just follow the media coverage.

Does that mean that everything is great in Germany? No, not all. The refugee situation is a problem. Obviously it would better for everyone if the refugees could stay in their home countries and he if hadn't the colossal task of taking care of them and giving them shelter. But alas here we are, and because we failed to act as a European Union in the last couple of years things have become even harder. But you can't blame the refugees for that, and it is not about their nationalities. The average person knows that and behaves accordingly. What you see on the media are the big stories. A German cop pulling a refugee kid out of a bus under chants of racist radicals is a story. Firebombs on refugee homes are a story. But the average German who lives side by side with people from all over the world and who donates his clothes to refugees is not.

A thing to add to this is that most of what you see in the media is limited to small regions. The AfD and PEGIDA are strong in certain regions but only play a little role (if any) in the rest of the county. The situation in NRW is very different from the situation in Saxony, but Bautzen and Clausnitz aren't representative for all of Germany. These towns and what happened there isn't even representative for Saxony or said towns, just like the agitated Trump-voter is not representative for the entire United States.",t5_2qi4z,1460379321,t3_48kt9r,15,t3_48kt9r,

De manera personal, a mi me da más miedo cuando visito el Distrito Federal con la estadística de asaltos que se escucha en las noticias que vivir en esta ciudad.

Te recomiendo que nos visites y te lleves otra experiencia de México. Si te das una vuelta por acá te recomiendo los siguientes lugares:

* Centro Cultural Tijuana si te gusta lo artístico.
* Mision 19, o IPA'A para restaurantes gourmet que te costarán 30 euros (caro para México, pero barato en comparación de Europa).
* Cualquier restaurante de la zona gastronómica en la Zona Río (el estilo de la cocina es reconocido e inclusive tiene su nombre: bajamed, debido a que es parecida a la cocina mediterránea).
* BCB para tomar cerveza artesanal de muchos lugares del mundo
* Playas de Tijuana (no por la playa sino por el malecón).

Otras ciudades muy cercanas:

* Rosarito, a 20 minutos de Tijuana (por la playa).
* Ensenada, a 1 hora y 20 minutos de Tijuana (la carretera escénica tiene vistas muy agradables y la comida de mar en Ensenada es buenísima).
* Valle de Guadalupe, zona vitícola del estado con buenos restaurantes y mucho vino (a dos horas de Tijuana o media hora de Ensenada).
* San Diego, Estados Unidos aprovechando que tienes pasaporte europeo (como muchos en broma decimos el lugar más bonito de Tijuana). Sin embargo, recomiendo mucha paciencia ya que puede tomar entre 15 minutos y 3 horas entre Tijuana y San Diego: la garita de San Ysidro es la más transitada del mundo.

Si vas con amigos estadounidenses, ten por seguro que te van decir de visitar Rosarito y el Hong Kong (strip club) en la zona roja de la ciudad. 

Yo estuve en Budapest, Sombathely y Veszprem y espero que disfrutes o hayas disfrutado de México así como me gusto Hungría.

While I will concede... a lot of what he wrote was irrelevant the answer was there!

&gt;A multinational business may not care that consumers in the United States or OECD nation where it is domiciled are struggling, if it can make up the difference through a growing global prosperity. If 100 million Americans (or Britons or French, etc.) suffer, but the loss in sales is more than made up by a 2 billion less-well-paid-but-collectively-rising-in-prosperity people in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, it may not matter.

Simply put: **it doesn't matter if *Americans* are worse off as long as *humans* are better off.**

If a 1 person loses there $40,000/year job so that 100 can get $440/year jobs instead of $40/year jobs there is not a loss to the system! In fact these people are *more* likely to buy things and less likely to save. This is due to the diminishing marginal returns to consumption.

Dismissing it as ""subjective"" is not a counterpoint. 

Prices will adjust according to demand. A more unequal society means that markets will shift... and there will be a greater and greater gap between luxury and economical goods. 

iPhones will be bought in Africa as they get cheaper just like cellphones and cars did. But luxary foods will become priced higher and higher until only a few people in the world could possibly afford to ever taste it.  Just as sugar, vanilla, and chocolate were in pre-industrial Europe.

Australia was settled less than 250 years ago, any religious institutions are fairly young and have relaxed ways of operating. From what I gather about the Cardinal Pell issue, the abuse was taking place in regional Australia, meaning there's even less structure and less transparency about what goes on.

Churches, sanghas, any religiously institution need time to grow and develop structures that ensure that their members are well looked after. I hope the lesson that is learned from the inquiries is that religion needs to be transparent and their members need to be upfront and honest about misconduct and actively stand up, never to ignore harmful behaviour and be prepared to uproot suffering.

It's quite easy to scapegoat Christianity as being the cause, but when you look at Buddhism in Asia, corruption and misconduct are just as likely to arrise.

Nem todos os deputados da base votam sempre com o governo (aqui eles estão equacionando governo = PT)

&gt; Apenas achei os eixos arbitrariamente colocados

Os autores fizeram um erro de interpretação gigante. Os eixos foram definidos matematicamente, mas na verdade nada tem a ver com ""esquerda"" e ""direita"" ou ""governista"" e ""oposição"".

[Aqui](http://polignu.org/projeto/radar-parlamentar/pca) está uma descrição melhor do estudo. Lá da descrição deles:

&gt; Outro fato importante vindo da análise PCA é que a primeira dimensão é a mais representativa. No nosso caso, esta “primeira dimensão” corresponde ao nosso eixo horizontal, o que quer dizer que a semelhança entre os partidos, i.e. a maneira de cada partido votar, é definida mais em função do apoio que cada partido dá ao governo do que por suas próprias ideologias. Isso pode ser enxergado através da observação de que o espectro de apoio ao governo (largura do gráfico) é bem mais amplo do que o espectro ""ideológico"" (altura do gráfico). Mais especificamente, a primeira componente explica 73% da variância, e a segunda explica 9,6%.

Os eixos do PCA em duas dimensões são os dois eixos de maior variância dos dados. A análise deles colocou os partidos políticos em um ""espaço euclidiano de votação"" na qual partidos que estatisticamente votam juntos estão mais próximos neste espaço, e partidos que são opostos nas votações votam diferente. Este espaço é multi-dimensional. Se você fosse descrever esses dados utilizando apenas um eixo real, o melhor eixo possível é chamado de primeira componente principal.

Na análise deles, a primeira componente principal descreve 73% da variância dos dados. É o eixo vertical da imagem do OP (a quote diz horizontal porque se refere a outra imagem). Aí eles julgaram que esta medida, que descreve tão bem como os partidos votam, distribui os partidos em ""apoiar o governo"" e ""não apoiar o governo"". Aí eles dizem que o segundo componente principal (digamos o ""próximo"" melhor eixo, para descrever os dados em duas dimensões) descreve 9,6% da variância. E se apressam a chamar esse eixo de ""esquerda"" ou ""direita"". Isso não tem absolutamente nada a ver.

Eu diria que estes dois eixos descrevem a conveniência política dos partidos, afinal nem todo voto no Brasil é um voto ideológico. E sim, descrevem a relação dos partidos com o governo federal. Mas o fato do PSOL estar isolado não indica que ele é o ""único"" de esquerda, e sim que eles não votam com ninguém - possivelmente são o único partido que é consistentemente ""do contra"" em questões econômicas, até em situações onde até o PSDB e o DEM aceitam negociar com o governo.

O que o gráfico deles mostra é o melhor método linear de organizar esses dados de votações em duas dimensões - isto é, o gráfico que apresenta maior variância (82.6% de toda a variância estão nesses 2 eixos). E só isso.

Edit: eles agora colocam esta análise no site [radar parlamentar](http://radarparlamentar.polignu.org/), e não só para a Câmara dos deputados. Descrever graficamente como os partidos votam é útil ao eleitor.

Porém, infelizmente a estatística que eles utilizaram não levam em conta o peso político das votações (a hipótese é que para uma votação sem importância todo mundo vota ""sim"", fazendo com que esta votação tenha pouca variância e não influencie o gráfico -- mas nem sempre isso ocorre), ou o tema do que é votado (seria interessante saber algo como ""em votações sobre saúde, o PMDB vota com o PSDB"", etc). Outro problema é que nem sempre um deputado de um partido vota com esse partido (a análise deveria também analisar os deputados individualmente, e agrupá-los em grupos supra-partidários)

Fazendo isso, esse método que eles usam poderia identificar bancadas, como a bancada ruralista ou a bancada da bala, ou ainda ""bancadas ocultas"" de parlamentares que combinaram de votar juntos em certos temas mas não anunciaram isto ao público.

Existem análises nos EUA, utilizando o mesmo método, que fazem assim ""que senadores do partido democrata votam mais com os republicanos"" e etc. De vez em quando postam no /r/dataisbeautiful",t5_2qh9i,1460380300,t3_48j84r,4,t1_d0k6128,

In addition they require medical care and other social services in order to survive. Its not like the migrants will magically be able to survive on nothing so that means the state must support them, potentially forever. 

The same is true for some Germans - we have Germans who haven't worked a single day in their life and never will until they die. Their life is completely financed by Hartz4. Unemployment is currently very low and the government household has a surplus. We were able to feed a comparable number of Germans for a long time - and they received much better benefits than the unemployed (Germans and refugees) today.

The same will be true for some of the refugees but if you look at history - like the refugees we took from Afghanistan 20 years ago - you see that they are now fully integrated into society. You have 1st generation Afghans which came to Germany as toddlers and 2nd generation Afghans which were born here shortly after their parents arrived in the country who now finished high-school and college. They perform better in high-school and college (degree wise) than their German peers.

We have also learned from the past which makes us much better at integration than before. For the Afghan refugees it was hard to get German classes. And they really had to make an effort to even get lessons (meaning those not as committed just didn't get lessons). Now, every refugee is forced to take German lessons and once they have basic knowledge of the language (after 1-1.5 years) they are forced to apply for jobs.

I will very, very likely never be unemployed in my life - yet I'm happy to pay for a system that protects people from unemployment. Asylum works exactly the same way. Of course it creates costs - and again - it is very, very likely that I will never have to apply for Asylum in any country. But it's a good thing that this system is in place.

&gt;They fled to Europe because Merkel said they would not respect the requirements of the Dublin regulation and would grant immediate assylum to anyone from Syria.

This is just completely wrong. Her 'invitation' was a reaction to *immense* problems on the Balkan route. Every major train station (Vienna, Budapest, ...) on the Balkan route was filled with refugees.

&gt;By ignoring the regulations she encouraged them to come and to take advantage of the generous european social welfare systems. 

What was their alternative? Going back to Syria to die? Or staying in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey as slaves and beggars (no protection of the law &amp; no right to work)?

&gt;Yes, them going to Greece would have been bad, but the EU at least could have contained this issue and could more easily have managed it from a centralized location instead of them being spread everywhere and disappearing from where they were being held. 

We are talking about humans not a disease. ""Containing"" them in Greece was never an option due to humanitarian reasons. The situation was already horrible in Greece for all of 2014. Germany wasn't able to follow Dublin concerning refugees that were registered in Greece since I believe 2013 due to legal reasons (the situation in Greece was so bad that it would have been illegal to send them back.)

And then your suggestion is close the border during the peak months? Or - in general - what is your solution here? You are complaining but you seem to completely forget the context of the decision, meaning the situation that was present in August (all you see is ""now it's worse"").

The number of refugees per month rose through all of 2015. There was no way to quickly stop refugees arriving in Greece because Greece is pretty much all coast. Even FrontEx says that they can't do anything without Turkey. In August 2015, 107k refugees reached Greece - a record till that point and twice as many as in July 2015 - this was all before Merkel said anything. The situation on the route was already grim and the countries on the route were overwhelmed. They (prominently Hungary) also ignored Dublin way before Merkel said anything and systematically passed refugees to the next country in line. The countries on the route - e.g. Austria - were also on the brink of shutting their boarders which would have been a humanitarian disaster.

Did Merkel's announcement further increase the already growing number of refugees for the months September and October? Yes. But it did buy time to slowly reduce the flow in a controlled matter instead of letting it crush into a wall. We had time to stop the flow at its source and we had time to build centralized registration hubs in Greece.

The number of refugees that reached Greece in February was 55k - meaning July 2015 levels. Which is a fraction of the amount of people that reached Greece in August and the expected number for September and October. The number of people that will arrive in 2016 might be as high as the number that arrived here in 2015 (if measures in Turkey etc fail) - but at least we can now approach the problem with a solution.

&gt;Also, you assume that as many would have come if it had been stricter and she had not said what she did. Its very arguable that less migrants would have come in the first place, and those who did and were not legitimate could more easily have been filtered out and deported. 

No - completely wrong. The numbers grew through all of 2015. A rise was already projected. This was exactly the reasoning behind Merkel's decision that was made public during her announcement. 

&gt;could more easily have been filtered out and deported

No - how? This makes zero sense. Non of the countries had the infrastructure for that. Especially not Greece.

This proposal is literally ""they should have just waved the magic wand and made the problem go away"". This is almost as worse as the typical captain hindsight reaction to the problem ""well they should have seen the problem coming and should have created the necessary infrastructure in Greece in 2014"".

The refugees would have come either way. This is a fact. 90% of all illegal immigrants/refugees have reached the E.U. through Greece - this has been this way since the last decade - so far we weren't able to find a solution for that. The reason why so many come now isn't because of Merkel or some evil plan by foreigners with a different culture but because of ISIS, civil war, constant violence in Afghanistan and the Arab spring - and in addition to that, you had people from ex-Yugoslavia who tried their luck for economic reasons. 

Merkel didn't get the ball rolling - the ball was already on full speed with no breaks. The countries on the Balkan route were about to let the ball crush into a wall.

The sexual frustration there is as real as the economic one, hence all the rapey refugees in Europe. The society is also extremely patriarchal and while daughters are treated as a commodity who can be married off to wealthy men, the sons are basically just thrown to the streets to fend for themselves. There they become disenfranchised and an easy prey for radical Muslim clerics who tell them they can join the God's army, become Holy warriors and just take what they want from the society that has wronged them so much.

It's poverty and the lack of purpose and hope that drives so many Muslims towards movements such as the IS. Purpose and hope Europe can't give them. In reality, any Muslim refugee can easily become a violent radical if Europe doesn't meet their expectations. Which is why I can't help but to see them as damaged goods.",t5_2qh4j,1460381065,t3_48jbvq,5,t3_48jbvq,

It's complicated but typically, if your item is coming from outside the EU and is over £15 in value you have to pay tax on it.  Tax is applied to the item, shipping and insurance costs.  So in your case £40. 

To collect the tax the Royal Mail acts as the middle-man between you and HMRC and charges an £8 'handling fee' for doing so.

So 20% VAT on £40 (£8) + Royal Mail fee (£8) = £16.  I'm not sure where the other £4 is coming from but maybe that's due to the exchange rate?   If your parcel's costs were marked in a non-GBP currency HMRC's own exchange rate is used - this could push the value of your parcel up and therefore the taxable amount.  Here's [February's HMRC exchange rates](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501867/exrates-monthly-0216.csv/preview)

Meanwhile refugee camps (where truly those needing help are located) closest to war zones, are over-crowded. 

Deport all immigrants arriving illegally. Cut any form of incentive for seeking illegal means to arrive in the EU. Setup consulate attaches in refugee camps to issue visas for those needing it the most, properly documenting and identifying them before their departure to a pre-specified non-negotiable EU-member state

0,,d0kkb5q,riverfish7,1456915111,1,TheRedPill,False,0,False,,"**Occupation:** Doctor turned online entrepreneur

Graduated from a top medical school in the UK in 2012. After finishing my Foundation training as a junior doctor (equivalent of internship in the US), I decided medicine wasn't for me and looked towards other career alternatives. 

Currently I work as a locum doctor. What that means is I go through an agency and fill up shifts whenever a hospital is in desperate need of doctors (and often they are). 

I get to work whenever I want to and make £7000-9000 per month. 

This lifestyle has allowed me to take time off and travel extensively, sometimes for a few weeks at a time. Last year I travelled to 10 different countries. It has also allowed me to save up a chunk of money to start my own business (more on that below).

&gt;Tax reduction methods most people don't know about?

The best part is, I get paid through my own limited company. Last year I was due to pay circa £15,000 in corporation tax. Instead, I managed to exploit a loophole in the system to legally avoid paying for it. Accountants will definitely not be willing to do this for you so PM if you want more details about this.

After a summer of travels through Eastern Europe, I came back refreshed and decided I wanted to start my own business, despite having no experience whatsoever. 

I stumbled upon the world of Amazon FBA Private Labelling. I started in October and my first PL product just launched 2 weeks ago. 

Initially I gave myself a target of 2 months to reach a goal of 10 units sold per day. I've reached that target in 2 weeks. So far haven't made a profit yet, but I'm very optimistic with how the figures are running at the moment and am getting prepared to make a 2nd order and launch a 2nd product at the same time. 

My goal is to have 5 different products under my brand, each selling 10 units a day. 

The Amazon FBA PL business is a very popular business because of the amazing growth rates. For example, I have a friend who launched his first product in November and last month he made $30k in sales.


&gt; Are you from a rich family?

From an upper middle class family. Not obscenely rich. My parents always taught me the value of money. They are both self made entrepreneurs. But I've never had to struggle in my life.

&gt; Was your home environment terrible?

No. Growing up I thought most people's families functioned the same as mine. Boy was I wrong. I'm extremely fortunate to have a strong-knit family. I use to be somewhat embarassed about my dad because he always seemed temperamental, stubborn, unreasonable and at times, rude. Only in the past year or two after reading about TRP have I grown more respect for my dad. I've slowly come to the realisation that my dad is in fact, a very red-pilled and alpha business man, who personifies the attitude of not giving a fuck.

&gt; Did you go to community college, university or receive graduate or doctoral education?

I went to a top medical school in the UK. I was a diabolically shit student however. It was clear from very early on that I was not that interested in medicine. I did the absolute minimum to pass and it's a miracle that I did. 

Despite the fact that I didn't like medicine, I'm extremely glad that I didn't quit. All too often, people quit their majors/careers because they don't like it, which is the wrong way of looking at it. My brother told me only to quit my profession because I have something better waiting for me. Spot on advice I'd say.

Staying on in medical school has allowed me a lifestyle where I get to make great money whilst funding my travels and my online business. If all else fails, I can always fall back on continuing my training as a doctor (I don't believe in backup plans though). 

More importantly however, when you are a lazy and unmotivated student like I was, medical school really kicks you up the ass and forces discipline down your throat. In many ways because of its hierarchical and conservative culture, training to become a doctor is very much the same as training in the army. 

&gt; Did people shame you or not believe you?

Big time. My RP journey started about 1.5 years ago after I broke up with my ex, who looking back, probably had BPD. I wasn't entirely BP back then, but I was a guy who was seemingly content with letting life float by. 

Back in high school, I was part of the popular crowd and even had a gf. But after going to medical school, I became very detached from society and life in general. I gained 20kg in my 2nd year. Smoked 20 cigarettes a day. Spent all my days playing computer games and poker instead of studying. Pretty much made zero friends during the entire time. And girls were completely out of the question.

After graduating, I managed to lose the 20kg. Gave up on computer games and poker completely. There were a few girls here and there. But the problem is, I constantly felt trapped being a doctor. 

It wasn't until after I broke up with my ex that I really started taking serious action with my life:

* I started lifting weights more seriously. A few years ago, I could barely do even 1 pull up. Now I can comfortably do 3x10.

* Gave up smoking completely (18 months and counting). More recently, I have just given up caffeine, which was even harder but something that I highly recommend to everyone. Once I got through all the awful headaches, I've noticed that I have more focus and energy throughout the entire day. 

* Day game. This was huge for me. I'm not a daygame nut and I know I will never be, but in the first few months of daygame I had done a few hundred approaches. I'm a firm believer that daygame improves all aspects of your life, not just with women. Even if I didn't live up to the expectations of getting laid by 9s and 10s every week, just the very fact of knowing that there were some seriously hot women who were attracted to me did wonderful things for my confidence and sense of entitlement. And confidence begets confidence. Even though I haven't approached in months, the IOIs I get when I walk around the city with my gf has quickly gotten rid of the scarcity mindset I was plagued with before.

* Actively applied for jobs outside of medicine. Worked a few months at a top digital health startup. Even worked in a favourite restaurant of mine because I thought I wanted to become a chef at one point. 

The downside of this all is that once you start improving all aspects of my life, you start to see who really are your *true* friends. I've had friends make seemingly innocent comments veiled over jealousy and contempt. I've had to distance myself away from these friends simply because I realised they added no value to my life. It's sad but on the whole I'm better for it.

And Trump isn't even as bad as Hitler, he's not going to start WW3 or anything, but he is likely to shake things up like Hitler did. It's not like he's going to gas the Mexicans, he's just going to send them back to Mexico, which will mean more jobs for the American working classes and higher wages, something Bernie also wants. But if he goes to far, which he very possibly would, he'll be out in 2020 and we get ~~Warren~~Tulsi Gabbard and have a proper first woman president and free social programmes like every civilized country. And unlike Europe we get it without our entire continent being laid waste, which is a win win, we must have to put up with Trump for a few years.

Europe wouldn't have free healthcare were it not for Hitler, while we wouldn't have landed on the moon were it not for the commies (and the Nazi rocket scientists, thanks Hitler), and we wouldn't have the most sophisticated, powerful and envied military and be the global hegemon today were it not for Hitler,
the commies and now the terrorists, who keep us on our toes.

I upvoted you thread because it is very important to talk about this. Because we all have the same goal with different ways: a nice, peaceful world, where no has to suffer poverty.

Also we need to set in stone if we argue about the existing system with a controled market (taxation, patents etc.), or a totally free market with no government.* I will choose the free market*. Because you can't apply libertarian rules into the existing statist system. The definition of the free market is: *Every Individual can do whatever contract with another Individual as long as they don't hurt a third party indirectly or directly.* If you don't agree on the definition make up a better one. If you agree with it feel free to argue with my points. There is no point in keep on reading if you disagree on the definition.

**Progressive Taxes:**

If rich people have to pay higher taxes they either cut wages or increase prices. Guess who suffers from that. The middle and lower class who earns less and has to pay more for the product. Yes, I can't prove that. Neither can you prove that progressive taxes figure out the perfect amount of % to make it still worth to work more. Maybe some people are happy with 60k and won't put in more work to earn 75k.  They have to improve give 125% with flat taxes meanwhile with progressive taxes you would neet to put in more work than 125% to reach 75k. (depending on how high the taxes increase) Maybe that's just too much? 

**How making money works in the free market.**
America has no free market. There are no free markets in the whole world. There are just more free and less free markets. Everything is highly regulated by patents. Thats also why destiny was wrong about history proving the free market won't work f.e. figure out fair wages. There was no free market. It was a controlled market. If you disagree with that you can stop reading here. Or prove me how there are no patents in the world. And how patents don't make it harder to get a start-up up and running.

We also have to rethink how people make money. You can only make money by satisfying a need. Thus by making people happy. They won't buy your stuff if it is shit. Also they won't work for your company if your company pays like shit. They can open their own company. For those who say ""not everyone is rich and can build a company"" setting up a LIMITED company costs way less than  ~200$. Also you can get a credit from the bank if you convince them with your idea. Due to the free market entry barriers are not almost not existing because shitlords can't sue you about violating patents. (patents = government protectet monopolys) I hope we can agree that the only way to make money is to make people happy. (Besides using violence and all that stuff.) If not give a counter example.

**Europe = funcitioning economic system = right wing = left wing = wat?**

&gt; First of all let me clarify that the European Right is much much further to the ""Left"" of the Democratic Party (U.S) on economic issues. Second of all Europe always fluctuates between Right and Left. Recently the Leftists won in Sweden, Greece, Italy, France, Czech republic, and more. Even Germany under Right wing Merkel has high taxes, free education in universities, free healthcare, etc.

I don't know how the Democrats or Republicans fit into that, so i won't say anything about this.

To make it clear and short:

Leftwing = socialism + migrants are better than your own population

Rightwing= socialism + migrants are the worst, germany = masterrace.

This is absolutely wrong. Merkel is not the right wing. She lets in every refugee with very small to no background check. How is that right wing? The Czech republic actually is right winged, thats why they don't let in anymore. Look up who closed it's borders in europe. All those countrys ARE NOT LEFT WING. You can just google rise of the right wing in europe. f.e. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/europe-right-wing-refugees_us_562e9e64e4b06317990f1922
Why are leftis leading in germany: because the election was a long time ago.
Also look up the dept of germany. How can you say a economic system is working if the country drowns in dept?

""Well they vote right wing because of the refugee crisis, not he socialism."" You are right. But the socialism is the reason there is a refugee crisis. The welfare of germany and sweden is so good that even if you don't work you quality of living is way higher than in iran/ iraq whatever 3rd world country. Thats why millions of people try to get here. To benefit from the ""all free all everything"" system. You can't have socialism and open borders. (by open borders i mean almost no background checking)

Also the pension system is absolutly failing in germany. We are constantly increasing the age when you can leave work to pension. how is that a proper fuckining system. The age limit is so fucking high that a lot of people wont life very long from that point. Also translat this article: http://www.mittelbayerische.de/politik-nachrichten/merkel-rente-reicht-nicht-fuer-alle-21771-art1158368.html   ""pension wont be enough for everyone"". how is that a properly functioning system? I pay 18% taxes for my pension and the message i get is ""sorry it won't be enough for everyone. also you need to be old as fuck to get your money back. we know better how to handle YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. and by better we mean you won't get it back.""

Also the healthcare system is a lie. You pay 14% + indivual % from your health insurance. But a lot of shit like teeth or medication are not included. I know you can argue about that. But it isn't as golden as it seems.

I have to study for my exam tomorrow, so I couldn't explain everything in detail and I can't say much about the rest you have said. I will write more tomorrow if people are interested on the libertarian point of view from a normal person and not that retard from skype who gets paid by his parents and is against student loans as a liberatarian. In germany we call that ""Liberalala"" which means you say you are libertarian but acutally have no fucking clue and drag our image to the dirt.

Thanks for reading. Sorry for bad grammar and shit this is not my primary language and I only had a few minutes time for this.

TLDR; an economic system that makes billions of dept is not a functioning economic system.

P.S. Look up how crime, rape and shit increased in sweden due to mass migration and leftist government. https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/the-living-hell-for-swedish-women-5-muslims-commit-nearly-77-6-of-all-rape-crimes/

Hnefatafl is older than even chess and was played all over Scandinavia and later other areas of medieval Europe.

Over the time there were more and more so called Tafl variants around and since I found no good app for that I decided to make my own: Hnefatafl.

So here it is, with six different boards and a ruleset which I think fits them the best. Problem here is that the original rules are unknown and so there are a lot of variants flying around. Of course the rules are included in the app.

The game features the variants Hnefatafl, Tablut, Ard Ri, Tawlbwwrd, Brandubh and Alea Evangelii.

What is so special about Tafl games? The game features two different armies and goals. The black, invading player has to capture the white king while the white, defending player has to escape with his king. Additionally the black player has twice the pieces and a better starting position. So both sides have to use different strategies to win, a concept that you will find in only a few (older) board games.


You can play offline against someone else locally, against an AI or online against any other player (matchmaking through Google Play). 

The game is of course free and has some ads which can be removed through IAPs (only reason why IAPs are in there).

So I hope you guys/gals/vikings like this game. Feel free to comment here, will be around for a while or two.

&gt;People could also tell you why people shouldn't want a new flag. Because you shouldn't.

&gt;but I will almost certainly disagree

You're shutting down even before I've got started. Maybe if your attitude was more ""Well no one has convinced me yet but I'd be happy for you to try, maybe I'll change my mind.""

All I could do is tell you the *subjective* reasons that I want to change. And that is that I want New Zealand to have a much more unique flag that better represents us.

I find that our existing flag represents our European history, the Southern Cross represents our belonging to the Southern Hemisphere, and the Blue of the Pacific Ocean.

But what about Maori? Such a massive part of our history and we choose to represent our European side instead of our Maori side? I don't necessarily think we have to have something Maori on the flag, but if we don't, then I don't think we should be representing our European history on there either. This is why I'm opposed to the Union Jack on it.

And that's enough for me to want to change. The disparity of representation on the flag. That's why I'm much more favourable to something like a silver fern, which already a massive amount of New Zealanders identify with, and doesn't indicate any particular culture, rather it represents New Zealand itself.

But not the Kyle Lockwood Silver Fern design. I just don't like how it looks.

And that's another thing. I really just don't like how the existing flag looks. It's just not great as far as I'm concerned.

You can also just argue that banking regulation is a good thing because a lack of regulation is one of the main things that caused the 2008 financial crisis, but that's more complicated and time consuming to argue, so it's often a good idea just to stick with what can be argued more quickly and more simply.

J'adore le monde politique provincial albertain... C'est toujours un drame, plein de popcorn pour emprunter une de tes phrases que j'adore !).  

Oui, c'est beaucoup comme Montréal / Québec... Mais de poids égaux en termes de population, avec des ""régions"" nord/sud qui tombent sous leur influence.  

Imagine le drame politique et houleux si Montréal faisait face à une ville de Québec aussi populeuse que Montréal.  /r/alberta est plein de gens qui s'entre déchirent (et en regardant les flares des commentateurs en /r/Alberta, souvent les flares en disent tout).   Une personne de Gibbons (nord) va rarement voir le monde du même œil qu'une personne de Taber (sud).  (Même Fort McMurray, nord, s'est penché bien plus Libéral, tandis que Carsdton, sud, est plus *wild* que même le parti Wild Rose).  

La vaste étendue géographique nord-sud n'aide pas non plus... 14 heures de route (à 110km/hr) de High Level dans le nord jusqu'à Coutts dans le sud... Un axe peuplé tout le long (car contrairement au nord du Québec, avec l'exception de l'Abitibi, une grande partie du nord de l'Alberta avait été défrichée et peuplée il y a 100 ans).

Les politiciens albertains adorent jouer sur ces nuances.  C'est en grande partie une raison pour laquelle le parti progressiste-conservateur albertain a pu garder le pouvoir pendant 40 ans (leur côté conservateur chantait au habitants du sud, et leur côté progressiste chantait au nord).  Ils jouaient la carte *diviser et conquérir* quant aux autres partis politiques albertains [Lib, NPD, WR], comme le font beaucoup de partis parapluie.  C'est un peu comme le PQ et l'arrivée de PKP... Les progressistes-conservateurs en AB avaient leur propres Hivon gauche-gauche, et leur propres PKP droit/centre-droite (même Harper croyait que PKP, selon ses actions au cours des anneés, serait conservateur s'il aurait été fédéraliste et intéressé aux enjeux fédéraux ... Harper a même offert un siège au sénat à Julie à un moment donné... Mais à mon avis, c'était plutôt pour faire taire PKP lorsque Harper a eu vent que PKP songait briguer les rangs du PQ).

Je généralise bien sûr, mais il existe certaines poches géographiques et des gens qui sont l'exception à ce règle généraliste, comme le maire de Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, qui est progressiste et mulsulmane dans le sud reconnu d'être plus à droit (Nenshi se placerait sur l'aile gauche du parti libéral, ou l'aile droit du NPD, tandis que Denis Coderre incarnerait l'aile centre-centre du parti Libéral)... et Nenshi reflète un nouveau mouvement important de Calgary, et surtout les jeunes, qui penchent de plus en plus vers le centre/centre-gauche (un ségment de Calgary qui à peine il y a 15 ans aurait été plus à droit), au reflet d'Edmonton.

EDIT:  Allez faire un tour en /r/alberta, lire les commentaires, et recherche les villes mentionnées dans les flares (à côté des noms) en [Google maps](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Alberta/@53.8971403,-116.7609662,6z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x5309b282a82419b5:0xb0a9479a409b8e9e) pour voir si les points de vue s'alignent avec ce qui se trouve au nord de Red-Deer, ou au sud.

They may participate in some of the activities of the free society, but they basically grew up and live in a totally different world than non-Muslims.

Less facetiously ended freedom of movement of labour doesn't mean ending movement of labour but controlling it.  People will still be able to move wherever for work if they wish, but it will be more dependent on their skills, education, or investment that they can offer.

So what we shouldn't be doing is currently leaving a young generation to long term unemployment with holes in their CVs and experience as we recruit unskilled or semi skilled labou from elsewhere.  We shouldn't be encouraging wage suppression because that leads to an hour glass economy which suppresses upward mobility and innovation.

What we should be doing is spending more on education and not just academia.  An open labour market with high earning potential has made the UK complacent and an example of this is seen in the NHS where we simply haven't been training our own staff rather headhunting them.  (Incidentally that non-UK NHS staff are predominantly from outside the EU shows that this is not just a problem with the EU, but also that it can be easy to arrange work visas being outside the EU).

But the greatest asset is economic flexibility and that is in itself one of the reasons why we should Leave. SMEs are now by far, collectively, the largest employers in the UK. So if we could something as revolutionary as giving smaller companies an inside lane outside the EU which actually with its lobbying tends to favour large companies and to squeeze out smaller competitors through excessive regulation, then that too would be a means to an end.  Every job has been created by someone else.  One of the great things about leaving the EU is it could make it easier for small businesses to start up and could lower living and operational costs considerably.  So the answer should be if someone can't find a job, they should be more inclined to make one!  To go into business for themselves.  Not this EU solution of if one system is broken then pack up your troubles and use another system - which if you'll notice is what is spreading more tension and putting more systems under stress.",t5_2qhcv,1460382218,t3_48h535,0,t3_48h535,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_studies_of_Jewish_origins

&gt;In August 2012, Dr. Harry Ostrer in his book Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People, summarized his and other work in genetics of the last 20 years, and concluded that **all major Jewish groups share a common Middle Eastern origin.** Ostrer also claimed to have refuted any large-scale genetic contribution from the Turkic Khazars. Citing Autosomal DNA studies, Nicholas Wade estimates that ""**Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East.**


&gt;A study conducted in 2013 found no evidence of a Khazar origin for Ashkenazi Jews and suggested that ""**Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations**, and among non-Jewish populations, with groups from Europe and the Middle East. **No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews with populations from the Caucasus is evident,** particularly with the populations that most closely represent the Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that **Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe**, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that **there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region.""**


&gt;""Our recent study of high-resolution microsatellite haplotypes demonstrated that **a substantial portion of Y chromosomes of Jews (70%) and of Palestinian Muslim Arabs (82%) belonged to the same chromosome pool.**"" In relation to the region of the Fertile Crescent, the same study noted; ""In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, **Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the Fertile Crescent** (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab neighbors.""

Easy: Rand immigrated to the U.S. herself. She got a visiting visa and married an American to naturalize herself. To the benefit of the U.S. economy I might add, just like the immigration from Mexico to the U.S., that also benefits your economy. 

So Rand pulled herself up from her bootstraps, you say. ""Big deal, she actually made it, but how does that turn her into an advocate for immigration?"" Well, selfishness. When you complain about ""them taking our jobs"", you're complaining about Ayn Rand's selfishness. She doesn't care about whether you have a job or not, she cares who she can hire for the least amount of money. And that's what has put you out of a job, your quite reasonable unwillingness to work for less than your worth. Immigrants usually don't have that unwillingness, so in a Randian free market, she will always replace you. Because without state intervention, your fully expendable and replaceable. 

So be my guest, quote Rand all you want. I'm sure all you hard working students of economics would love to be replaced with cheaper graduates from Russia. Because that's precisely what Rand did. ",t5_33oia,1460382686,t3_48lew6,11,t3_48lew6,

The Republicans are certainly classical liberals with their focus on individual freedoms, the free market, and of course associated with both, property rights. The Democrats are liberals of the John Rawls variety, subscribing certainly to the following justice principle;

&gt; Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that (a) they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice

You have essentially confused the concept of right wing and conservative. America has no serious socialist roots. In that sense America is more right wing, but that doesn't make it conservative. It just prefers some form of liberal economics (not that the Republicans would see themselves as such, but that's what it is). 

On the flip side, Americans also don't have ultra-nationalistic or genuinely far right parties. Look at what is happening in Europe. UKIP, the French National Front, Alternative for Germany, the Sweden Democrats. All these right wing (and with the exception of UKIP, genuinely nationalistic) populist parties are on the rise. In the case of the National Front and the Sweden Democrats, they are the most popular parties. Then we move into Eastern Europe where the solid right is the mainstream. Most notably the Law and Justice Party in Poland, and Fidesz in Hungary. The left is pretty much dead in both those countries. Poland has a threshold for gaining seats in their Parliament, and the United Left didn't achieve this, meaning the socialists in Poland effectively have no representation. In Hungary, the right (3 parties, 2 of which are in Government, the far right Jobbik is not) control over 70% of the seats. Fidesz alone have enough seats to make constitutional changes. Fidesz have been in power since 2010, and Hungary has the rather mad system of having a political civil service. What this means is that rather than having the same unbiased civil service from one Government to the next (as we have in the UK), when Fidesz came to power in 1998 (their first period in office) literally thousands of people in the civil service were sacked and replaced with more loyal people. Added to this, Fidesz actually built a wall/fence on its southern border, and it has been quite effective;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier#Impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_Hungary

What I'm trying to get at here is that the right in Hungary is very entrenched now.

So, America is an odd one. Economically, it is further right, but that is only because the right in most of Europe have only ever been, at best, reluctant capitalists. Capitalism afterall was an idea for the middling sorts, not the landed elite who originally formed the conservative base. Britain is further right on the whole than Europe economically, but America of course more readily embraces classical liberal economics. Southern Europe is notably more left wing (SYRIZA in Greece, but then again Golden Dawn as a fairly good showing, and there is an ultra-nationalist party, or the Spanish left wing one whose name escapes me at this moment). But again, this is just economics, and it isn't inherently 'conservative' what America has in terms of economics. It is liberal. And it most certainly isn't nationalistic.

Many philosophers who wrote in times of empire ended up using it to think through their theories. Locke spoke often of the savages in America and suggested that because they don't  cultivate their land, they don't really own it. Adam Smith talks about the colonies extensively in Wealth of Nations--he doesn't seem morally opposed, but he does seem worried that Europe will become sort of addicted to them. Maybe most notably, John Stuart Mill along with his father James openly advocated for colonial rule in India suggesting that civilization there needed to be cultivated by some one from outside.

Yet none of them are advocates in exactly the way you say. Many thinkers who would be called 'post colonial' don't exactly argue that being a colonized subject is *good.* However they do see it as a double edged sword. For instance, David Scott's *Conscripts of Modernity* portrays P.D. James as a hero of colonial identity, yet acknowledges that he could only be such *because* he was educated in  France and learned to write history.

This still hasn't gotten to your question though. David Harvey, Naomi Klein, the Comaroffs, Noam Chomsky, and Sheldon Wolin, among others, have argued that nowadays the IMF and World Bank engage in a sort of 'soft-imperialism' for the west through free-market reforms. No longer are we taking over countries political structures and ruling with an iron fist, however we are  exploiting economic crises to get countries to sell off national assets to western companies who proceed to make huge profits. (Gazprom in Russia is a great example.).

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I just wrote a formal letter to http://www.mensenrechten.nl/mission-and-ambition the relevant authority in the Netherlands (concerning Daum Games EU) for human rights. The Netherlands Institute for Human Rights explains, monitors and protects human rights, promotes respect for human rights (including equal treatment) in practice, policy and legislation, and increases the awareness of human rights in the Netherlands. All according to EU law.
 
To achieve this ambition the Institute has adopted the following strategic objectives:
Human rights are guaranteed in policy, laws and regulations.
Human rights violations by government or third parties are avoided and corrected.
All people in the Netherlands understand their rights and the rights of others, and are able to enjoy those rights.
Government, parliament, organisations and individuals take active responsibility in relation to human rights.
 
As you well may know, Daum Games chose to ignore the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as part of the European Union and denied us region of service. We find this a great offense (as a citizen of Estonia). The Russian publisher GameNet has no right to have the license over us, and territorial/regional claim, where Russian isn't even a national/official language - and I will bring your attention to the fact that we had absolutely no say in this. We were just included and that was all. Most of us don't even speak Russian, and we were all eager, along with the other Baltic States and fellow EU members, to play Black Desert Online once it came out.
 
We belong to the European Union, yet denied the same service that our other fellow EU countries get? On what grounds?
 
Why do you group us together with Russia as if we were still part of them? We find this very discriminating and this is a serious matter. 
 
In light of this, you will find below the letter I sent to them:
 
-------
""Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am writing to you in English, and I hope that's okay with you.
 
This concerns the recent launch of the online game Black Desert Online and the disappointing denial of region service for Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are part of the European Union and as such, we feel utterly discriminated. Words cannot describe the insult we feel. I write to you as a citizen of Estonia, hoping this little letter will do something or evoke a response. 
 
The publisher of Black Desert Online in the EU region is Daum Games, a company based in The Netherlands.
When they agreed to the licensing terms with the games developer Pearl Abyss (and GameNet, the Russian publisher that has hold over all the non-EU countries), they ignored and plainly dismissed the fact that we are a part of the European Union, and instead chose to hand us over to the Russian territory as if we do not matter.
 
We, as ex-Soviet countries, feel disgraced and clearly discriminated by this. Breaking free from them was not an easy job, and yet we're still automatically put together with them in the same group? I bring your attention to the fact that this all happened while we had absolutely no say in it. We were just included and that was it. As you may know, Russian is not even the official language of any of the Baltic States. 
Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian gamers were very excited to play this game, only to find out that our countries are not considered a part of ""Europe""? Why are we excluded?
As can be seen here:
https://blackdesert.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205606032-In-which-countries-will-the-game-be-available-
 
I write this letter you in hopes of bringing this to the attention of Daum Games as it is a serious matter for us.
 
Daum Games may say this is just due to ""licensing agreements"", and not a geo-political statement, BUT IT IS, by both GameNet AND Daum Games (as well as Pearl Abyss).
 
We belong to the European Union yet we are denied the same service that our other member states get, and on what grounds?
 
One of the forum members wrote to the European Comission (of Justice) that referenced you as a competent/relevant authority in The Netherlands, I have copy-pasted the official response below from them:
 
""We confirm receiving your e-mail concerning your complaint against a Dutch trader which is planning to launch an online game. Following we would like to inform you.
The European Consumer Centre (ECC) can inform you as a consumer about your rights and obligations in a member state of the European Union, Norway and Iceland. Furthermore the ECC offers mediation when you are not able to reach an amicable solution with a foreign seller. The cooperation of both parties remains indispensable. The ECC advice and mediation services are free of charge.
Like you indicate in your e-mail the EU Treaty prohibits discrimination on the basis of residence or nationality and foresees the free movement of goods and services, persons and capital. To enhance the rights of recipients and strengthen their confidence in the internal market, Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market (‘the Services Directive’) obliged Member States to remove obstacles for service recipients wanting to buy services supplied by providers established in other Member States. It also lays down an obligation on Member States to ensure that discriminatory requirements based on service recipients’ nationality or place of residence were put at end.
Article 20 of the Services Directive prohibits discrimination against service recipients on the basis of their nationality or country of residence. The purpose of this provision is to help service recipients, especially consumers, access offers available on the markets of other Member States and make the most of the internal market. Article 20(2) covers, more specifically, instances where the different treatment is applied by service providers, that is, firms or professionals offering services in a market. It obliges Member States to ensure that the general conditions of access to a service, which are made available to the public at large by the provider, do not contain discriminatory provisions relating to the nationality or place of residence of the recipient, but without precluding the possibility of providing for differences in the conditions of access where those differences are directly justified by objective criteria.
It is for the relevant national competent authorities to ensure compliance with the relevant national provisions implementing Article 20(2) of the Services Directive into their national law. In order to perform this assessment, a case-by-case analysis is required in all instances. Recital 95 of the Services Directive lists some examples of objective criteria that can be invoked by service providers for different treatment.
However in the end it is up to the national competent authority to assess whether this can be seen as an objective criteria which justifies the discrimination on the basis of nationality or country of residence. In the Netherlands this is the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights: http://www.mensenrechten.nl/mission-and-ambition
Last we would like to point out that the European Commission launched a public consultation on this topic: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/public-consultation-geo-blocking-and-other-geographically-based-restrictions-when-shopping-and  Here you can share your view and if necessary find the contact details of the European Commission.""

 
I sincerely hope this letter reaches someone that cares for this and has the motivation to take it up with Daum Games.
 
Thank you for hearing me out.
 
Sincerely,
-""
------
 
A number of other people have sent formal letters to the European Commission (of Justice) and I hope that something will be done about it.
 
We really like the game, and we hope that a solution will be found against such discrimination.
 
We are NOT part of Russia - we belong to the EUROPEAN UNION.
As it is obvious here:

It is incredibly difficult for a country like Ukraine (and not only Ukraine) to break out of the vicious circle of corruption and failure of governance on their own, without external pressure that can come only through actual binding deals.

Basically, if you don't like what's happening in Ukraine, both in terms of the war part and the way their government operates, you'll only be making it worse by voting No. 

The *worst* case scenario that can come out of the association agreement is that Ukraine fails in the reforms and remains outside of the EU, leaving the country in the same state it would have been without the agreement.

Labor is as integrated a part of the market as the businesses themselves and the traditional antagonistic relation between the two is nearly none-existent, abandoned in favor of cooperation. The labor leaders themselves are often part of the social elite, a dynamic unseen outside of Scandinavia.

The one area where the power vertical has been extended, and the elites partially externalized, is the political. The EU and Atlanticist organisations/firms are attractive destinations for top-level politicians after they've held office in Denmark. The most prominent example of this is Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who essentially threw us into Iraq in return for the NATO Gen. Sec. post. He's a partner at Goldman Sachs now. The 'Denmark-America Fund' is also one of the most influential lobby organisations in the country, but not so much in policy as cooperation in business and education.",t5_2qjto,1460383768,t3_48lj6p,10,t1_d0kkiqz,

Michael MacDonald and other Conservatives question how repeal of the legislation, announced by Immigration Minister John McCallum, aligns with Canada’s long-standing practice of revoking the citizenship of people who lied to get into the country, most notably war criminals.

&gt; “We’ve been stripping the citizenship of Nazi war criminals and shipping them back to eastern Europe,” said MacDonald. “Is he saying that this is not allowed to be done? What’s the difference?”

Does he really not see the difference between taking citizenship away from someone who obtained it fraudulently and taking citizenship away from someone who obtained it legitimately and who then went on to commit a bad act?

&gt;“If we actually sent a convicted terrorist back to the country of their other citizenship, and that country fosters terrorists and terrorism, now we’ve got a loose terrorist who could fight against our allies and our interests over there …

I've run a few tests myself and it pretty much is if your not using Dual Stack you aren't going to have a fun time, but even if you are it's still possible somehow, haven't captured the data packets to confirm what is causing it yet, but something else does come into play.


Just to add, most European ISP's no longer provide dual stack unless your a business/coporation due to them costing a fair bit to install. Oh and if you have BT as an ISP there is a legal clause you can enact to force them to offer it but it does take a hell of a long time to argue why you need it.
Further edit, by forcing it via a VPN you can also cause it too if you don't have it correctly set up as I tried running one to block my IP from being visible and I had spend an ungodly amount of time fiddling with it to get it correctly working so it is an option but unless you know what to do, I'd just hassle your ISP by threatening to cancel it due to it not providing adequate coverage, pretty much what the clause is in BT's contracts. 

Edit 2: I wouldn't try asking Ubisoft for these details as to how it routes and so forth as they become very skeptical of why you need the information and what you are doing with it.  They don't seem to like people with the skills available to search into being able to easily identify what's going wrong.

The US and UK have benefited immensely from immigration although more often than not it has always been geared towards their economic interests. It is a fact that immigrants contribute immensely to their economies. Their population will be stagnant if not for immigration (below the replacement level)

They do also let some people in as refugees but that number has been dwindling down, more and more the altruistic aspect of immigration is on its way out especially with the rise of Islamophobia. Historically the US has always had massive immigration from impoverished parts of the world like the Irish during the potato famine, the Jews during the WW2, Italians escaping poverty etc. 

The right wing in the West loves to stoke people's fears of the ""other"" by constantly playing the immigrants are taking over the country card. The truth is that brown/black people (even if you lump them together as ""non-whites"" as a homogeneous unit which really not respecting diversities within these groups) are only about 11% of the total population of Britain and a lot of them are well assimilated. The number has been steady for some years now. It is lower in other European countries.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_England

Historically the ""West"" (more specifically the elite and ruling class) has always wanted cheap labor for its capitalist/state machine, be it slaves from Africa, indentured farmers from India, industrial workers from Ireland and post world war 2 workers for her industries/services. Please read about the Caribbean immigration to Britain, Turkish immigration to Germany etc. 

In fact after the end of the 2nd World War, Britain had such a huge shortage of workers that it had to go to its colonies and solicit people. Grand illusions were given to the Caribbean people of how ""amazing"" life is in Britain only to land in a cold and hostile country destroyed by the war.

The general population might view the non-white immigrants with hostility but the bottom line is the educated people of the ""third"" world are more than happy to settle there for a better ""standard of living"".

It's this huge beating chest patriotism that can be off putting for other cultures. Now SPR is certainly no where near the offensive levels of Transformers or the Patriot for the reasons you stated and Spielberg's intentions with the film.

For some more cultural context the film came out in late 1990's. A decade in which the U.S government was involved in bombing fromer-Yugoslavia, the Gulf War and a dozen other small incursion around the globe. The Cold War was over and the sort of peak of Pax-Americana  had begone, military basses around the world and in increased involvement in global affairs. Many people around the world were hesitant and uncomfortable about the remaining super power being the world police. Americans love to have tunnel vision on WW2 (""back to back world champs!"" despite their relatively minor role in it compared to what Russia and other allies had to endure in the European theater. Many Americans look at WW2 as this great thing, this great moment in history, cause well, it was. Democracies and communist fought against facist. A rare moment in history where it was objectively the right and ""noble"" thing to do. No one can arque that the U.S and allies were on the right side of history with that conflict.

By making a film focusing so much on America's involvement in the European theather with these intense interpersonal humanist drama it kind of eschews the other current realities. You have the dominating super power going ""hey look how great we were, remember when we were great and noble and did the right thing?

&gt;Odin is in no way Finnish 

Since there's no direct local tradition of the pre-christian European religions, groups with neo-pagan tendencies have to resort to the Edda and other works when looking for their own cultural roots. From this comes the adaption of a germanic/northern god-father with the name of Wotan, Odin, [and many, many other names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_names_of_Odin).

Europeans don't feel the sense of cultural identity that Christianity once provided; the liberal society where everything goes doesn't provide any values, any sense of identity or heritage. Everywhere we look at the world, heritage is very important for the people. Everyone keeps their ancestors in high regards. 

For one reason or the other, European ingenious people are not allowed to feel a sense of heritage if they're the majority in their own lands, it's some arbitrary bullshit modern society came up with and naturally, some people are not okay with that.

Their car ratings also come from doing surveys of their subscribers, so the sample size per brand is WAY off.  Since they've favored Japanese/European brands for decades, their base tends to be biased as well.

This doesn't mean they're wrong, just that CR isn't a good source for automotive ratings.

If your goal was to get your father to question his beliefs about refugees, attacking him like that was certainly not the best choice.

And where he got those numbers from. If he would change his mind if you could find a reliable source about the actual number of potential terrorists among the refugees.

1) First common form of Interstellar travel is the hyperstream drive, at least what humans call it. As a hyperstream drive is self-contained on a starship and they are a lot easier to produce than the other two. Travelling in hyperstream is not so much about velocity as it is more of the concept of riding the hyperstream ""currents"". As navigating hyperstream currents is impossible while riding the hyperstream currents, thus destinations have to be calculated before entering. The process of entering hyperstream is called ""rifting"" meaning that (temporary) interdimensional rifts are opened. As for unforeseen consequences of lifting, no permanent damage happens to realspace.

Hyperstream drives are further subdivided in regards to travel times.

a) ""Slow"" hyperstream travels (on average) 10 parsecs per day. ""Slow"" drives rift by way of ""punching a hole with brute force"".

b) ""Fast"" hyperstream can travel up to 300 parsecs per day. ""Fast"" drives rift by way of ""making a surgical incision and expanding it"".",t5_2rd6n,1460385141,t3_48l8a1,1,t3_48l8a1,

0,,d0kslxe,EvanRWT,1456934006,2,AskHistorians,False,0,False,,"&gt;I don't, however, this this explains the situation in the west very well.

Probably not. You're right that the entire world didn't suddenly switch to steel at the same time. I was addressing the OP's question on ""why so many cultures"" switched more or less simultaneously. As I mentioned in my previous post, these cultures would primarily lie along a belt from the near east to India, where steel also appears at the same time. Europe, of course, switched later.

&gt;in western Europe. For more than a millennia, people used iron, not steel, knives that were in many cases three times softer than bronze

Can’t this be explained by technology? Iron ore is very common, but steel making is hard. Not only do you need new designs for hotter furnaces, you also need experienced metallurgists who know how to carburize. Too little carbon and you don’t have steel. Too much and the metal shatters. You need to know the process. Typically, this was done by pounding iron into thin sheets, stacking them in layers with alternating layers of charcoal, heating and pounding the whole thing down. Then repeating until the proper amount was incorporated. There are dozens of ways this can go wrong, and you only have the judgment of the experienced metallurgist guiding you through.

It may well be that steel remains uncommon because while iron ore was plentiful, skilled steel smiths were not. They were more prevalent in the big cities and densely populated areas further south.

&gt;over much of western Europe, popular iron tools were inferior to their bronze predecessors, yet widely preferred. And this is part of why I want to push back against the idea that, as you say, 'it's a matter of technology.'

Well, I can offer a technological explanation, but I can’t claim to know if it’s correct. If I assume that nobody uses iron tools that are clearly inferior to bronze by choice, I can still think of why they used them. A simple explanation might be economics.

Once furnaces to smelt steel were invented, they could just as easily be used to melt iron. Molten iron can be cast, which is the cheapest and fastest way to mass produce tools. So even though bronze is better, iron could be in wide use because it’s cheaper, you can find the ore locally instead of importing the ingredients over long distances like for bronze. The only thing holding this back was the requirement for furnaces hot enough to melt iron.

So it may be that Europeans did not have skilled steel smiths to produce a lot of steel, but they did have the furnaces hot enough to melt iron, which had been invented centuries earlier. In such a situation, I would expect to find a small quantity of steel, limited by the number of skilled metallurgists, more bronze, for which the metallurgy was ancient knowledge but the ingredients expensive, and a **lot** of iron, which was cheap and easily made once the furnaces existed. I would expect iron tools to be used by the poor. I don’t know is this is the right explanation, but it seems practical.

&gt;from a purely anthropological perspective, hesitate to explain technological change solely on a cost/benefit analysis of relative hardness of materials (bronze to steel) in absence of the magic-infused contexts in which these differences were being produced

I don’t know enough to rule out magic, so I will refrain from doing so. I would, however, say that it doesn’t seem a necessary ingredient, in that practical considerations of metal properties and  economics can also explain what we see.",t5_2ssp3,1460385291,t3_48hfl8,2,t1_d0klbnf,

0,American West | European Folklore,d0kswyj,itsallfolklore,1456934453,8,AskHistorians,False,0,False,skedaddlespecial,"The idea of a seven-day week is grounded in the lunar cycle since four weeks is roughly equal to a lunar cycle. Alexander Marshack (1918-2004) in his controversial 1972 book, [The Roots of Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Marshack) maintained that he consistently found scratch marks in Upper Paleolithic art that revealed patterns of 7, 14, and 28. Although he may have overstated the case, at least some of his examples are persuasive, suggesting that a seven-day cycle may be extremely old.

The following is an excerpt from my [Introduction to Folklore](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Folklore-Traditional-Studies-Elsewhere-ebook/dp/B00N65B0BY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456934436&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Ronald+M.+James), addressing some of the issues around the history of the week:

&gt;People throughout the world recognize a period of time ranging from three to ten days that plays the same role as the modern week. These are frequently divisions of the lunar cycle. In agricultural societies, the week is often four to five days and is tied to markets. Central Africa, for example, has a four-day week with the market as the focus.

&gt;For the Babylonians, seven was a particularly important number. They recognized seven heavenly bodies that moved independently of the stars: what we now call Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the sun, and the moon. Each of these astronomical objects corresponded to a deity. In addition, much of Babylonian astrology focused on the moon, each phase of which lasts approximately seven days. It was easy, therefore, to associate each day of the week with a deity. The Romans, adopting this practice, began the week with Saturday, naming that day for Saturn, the most remote and slowest of the visible moving planets. Days for the sun and moon followed, and then Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus had their respective days. Romance languages preserve these pagan designations.

&gt;The Germanic world imported the Roman concept of the week before Christianization, so they substituted the names of their own gods for the Roman ones. They only had, however, a four-day week, and they consequently discarded Saturday through Monday, which returned later with the Christian faith. In addition, the Germanic world did not associate celestial objects with their gods, and as a result, the designations for the days of the week had no counterpart in astrology.

&gt;Tiw/Týr, the god of war, assumed the position of Mars. Odin, god of wisdom and magic (Woden for the Anglo-Saxons), took the place of Mercury, although in both cases the analogy was weak. Thor, the Germanic sky god of thunder, was a more obvious substitute for Jupiter. Freya, goddess of love and fertility, assumed the place of Venus.

&gt;The preoccupation of the Christian calendar with the importance of Sunday as that religion’s Sabbath was influenced by the popularity of a Roman religion known as Mithraism, which held the sun as sacred. For the Germanic world, Thor was generally regarded as supreme, and so Thursday assumed premier significance. The important role of Thursday, as opposed to Sunday, created an ambiguity for Northern European folk culture until industrialization and the adoption of the idea of a weekend, consecrating Sunday as the Sabbath. In Germanic-based European folklore, the evening before Thursday or Sunday were the best time for magic. In addition, dreams during those nights had greater potential to become reality. A person born on Thursday should not be baptized on Sunday, and the opposite was also true. If this taboo were broken, the child would grow up seeing ghosts. In addition, only those born on one of those two days had the potential to become a sorcerer.

They list countries as ""free"" that have laws against insulting public officials, insulting religions and religious figures, hate speech, etc. I want a country without those. We're looking at Asia too, I just thought I'd start with Europe. 

If they want to go around insulting religions and different races, etc, I don't think any self-respecting European wants them overy here in the first place.

Because constituent countries are no more that cultural, historical anomalies. In the UK government system, every voter has an equal vote that is the fairest system of them all, the UK government is supreme but every person in the country has an equal say on how the UK government is run.

&gt;It's not an argument for federalism at all, simply an observation on the different overall structures that the EU and the UK have. In the EU all countries are on the same level which simply isn't the case when you compare the Scottish and UK Governments.

Yes, the EU structure is a federal structure. As I said, federal structures only make sense if one believes that individuals within a country don't have individual opinions, instead one country just has one opinion.

&gt;It's not 'theoretically' anything, it's a simple statement of fact - member countries of the EU don't require permission from the EU to leave, assuming people wouldn't be able to leave in the future is nothing but baseless conjecture

Yes, but it's like saying ""I can buy 20 mansions"" it's a statement of fact and is theoretically true, but practically isn't really possible. Many arguments coming from the ""Remain"" campaign are arguments of practicality, claims that our government will not be able to function for 10 years whilst we leave the EU, claims that we will lose Human Rights and workers protections and that it's simply too complicated to let our own country set up these things, claims that it would take too long to replace all the laws and regulations the EU has set up for us.

&gt;People aren't saying that our human rights are dependent on the EU, people are just pointing out the direction that the EU and the direction of the UK when it comes to human rights are quite different.

If you believe that the British people have a different ""direction"" to human rights than the EU, then you believe that there are a different set of human rights that the British people would prefer. Surely then you must conclude that it is right for us to set our own human rights rather than having the EU force us along a different direction of human rights?

All right, I stand corrected then, but the interesting thing is statistics and not overall population. The reason I brought up Sweden was that I though it's popularity was the norm in other countries in Europe, something I have already said, and something I have already been told was wrong.
