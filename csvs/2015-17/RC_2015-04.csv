This is mainly because basketball isn't a very popular sport in Europe though, that has nothing to do with genetics

Same with football (""soccer"" for you). It's not surprising that Americans are far better at basketball while Europeans are far better at football. The talent pool is just much much bigger in one region. And basketball isn't even the most extreme example, stuff like american football is basically non-existant in Europe 

The talent pool for league is also bigger in EU than it is in NA but there's more money in NA. That naturally leads to one region importing players from other regions.

This was one of the first tournaments on the newest patch so some of the picks may be a little be funky. I apologize if you wanted to see the draft, but if I were to include it, each video would be 50+ minutes. 

Some teams were trying out new things to see what worked, others were sticking to the older meta and see if it carried over. One team found something that worked for them and stuck with for a while.

If you are to only watch one game from all of the above, I recommend watching the quarterfinal match. It had some awesome team fights, so back and forth and the ending was spectacular.

&gt;I put Xpecial there out of respect and his abilities, he is underperforming like crazy for a while now but i think he will be back again.

Or, you know, 2 bad games, combined with the exact same vision control problems he's had for his entire career...

Vander's problem is that he's an incredibly streaky player, and Roccat goes as he goes as a result.  He's on a clear downswing this split, and there's not much of a way to argue that...  The watching the games nonsense is just that -- nonsense.

Are you familiar with Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense?  That's exactly what's happening with Bunny's Thresh -- It's so good that people are assuming his other champions are significantly worse.  His vision control is not actually that bad and his other champions are at least passable, and his Thresh draws an extremely important support ban (Interestingly the same is true of TiP Adrian's Leona but we didn't even mention him here, largely because of his poor start to the split).

Finally, the Lemon evaluation is just rhetoric and it's an unfortunate narrative that actually discounts his skill as a player.  He's more defensive, sure, but he's making a set of correct plays.  However, that doesn't mean he's making the optimal set of plays, and it especially doesn't compare to the Herculean task of making Cop (Who don't get me wrong, is an excellent teamfighter and makes generally good decisions) look good in 2v2.

I wouldn't put much hope in that. You can definitely try, but many people are looking for jobs around the university and it's not going to help that you don't speak swedish. I've been here a year and still haven't found work.

I need to wait for a code from the student union to apply for accommodation, does anyone have experience with this?

Sorry, I'm not sure about this. I didn't come to Sweden as a student. If you're on facebook this may be a good time to find a group for your university with international students and ask...at least in regards to housing. 

Are there any limits to what I can do or apply for if I don't have a residence permit but am an EU citizen?

If you plan to be here for more than 3 months I recommend you look into getting a personnummer. It's pretty pain free. Just look up the info on migrationsverket and skatteverket.

&gt;The name Wega  (later Vega) comes from a loose transliteration of the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) word *wāqi‘* meaning ""falling"" or ""landing"", via the phrase *an-nasr al-wāqi‘*, ""the falling eagle"".  The term ""Al Nesr al Waki"" appeared in the [Al Achsasi al Mouakket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Achsasi_al_Mouakket) star catalogue and was translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) as *Vultur Cadens*, ""the falling eagle/vulture"".   The constellation was represented as a vulture in [ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt),  and as an eagle or vulture in [ancient India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India).   The Arabic name then appeared in the [western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) in the [Alfonsine Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonsine_Tables),  which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of [Alfonso X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X).  Medieval [astrolabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe) of England and Western Europe used the names Wega and Alvaca, and depicted it and [Altair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair) as birds.

 [**Classical liberalism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical%20liberalism): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Classical liberalism__ is a political ideology, a branch of [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) which advocates [civil liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties) and [political freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_freedom) with [Representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_government) under the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) and emphasizes [economic freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_freedom).  

&gt;Classical liberalism developed in the 19th century in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). Although classical liberalism built on ideas that had already developed by the end of the 18th century, it advocated a specific kind of society, government and public policy as a response to the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) and urbanization.  Notable individuals whose ideas have contributed to classical liberalism include [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke),  [Jean-Baptiste Say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Say), [Thomas Malthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Malthus), and [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo). It drew on the economics of [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) and on a belief in [natural law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law),  [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism),  and progress. 

&gt;In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into neo-classical liberalism, which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [individual freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_freedom). In its most extreme form, it advocated [Social Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism). [Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.

So a current failure, two challenger players barely holding their own, two people who dont even play at the moment, and a cherry pick of your top players is the argument now?

The fact that you put an unproven solo queue player in your list shows that you have more bias than argument to stand on. There are just as many imports in the euro top three as the NA. I mean, it is cute that you are trying to take so much pride in your polished turd of a region, but that doesnt make it any more factual.

But hey, if Thorin says it it must be true! That is why all three of the middle of the pack EU players he puts in the top ten are totally competitive still, right? Wait... what is that? only one EU player on the whole list is even still relevant? Best players ever. TOP TALENT POOL WORLD! I am sure his bias has nothing to do with being from EU. Totally impartial judge, that one...

You linked a list of great players of all time independent of context. I know living in the glory days is fun, but it is time to come back to the present, where xpeke and alex can barely manage on challenger teams, diamond is the shadow of his old godhood, and froggen is in purgatory only a few games away from relegation.

I disagree with that assessment, and I should point out that the document I linked does discuss uneducated and labour migrants. As for those with violent criminal histories I tend to agree that their immigration should be limited although I doubt that they make up a significant percentage of potential immigrants.

Your examples of the negative effects of immigration policy aren't very good ones (I know, research is super hard!), I'll explain why:

1. I agree that there has been a change to the migration policy in South Africa post-apartheid which has coincided with a rise in unemployment, however to pretend that that fact is a direct result of the migration policy rather than any of the other myriad changes occurring in the country seems like a rather incredible leap to make and I don't view it as very strong evidence in favour of your argument.

2. Sweden joined the EU in 1995. If you view the tables of unemployment which you yourself have linked you should be able to see that in the preceding years, 1991 to 1994, the unemployment rate almost tripled to a higher rate than it sits at now, so once again I find that your example is lacking in support for your argument.

While you were very self congratulatory about the quality of your examples, as I've demonstrated above I don't think they are as good as you'd like. If anything I could now claim that the reduced unemployment in Sweden is an argument in my favour. Indeed in rebuttal I am going to cite Sweden, as [The results of this study indicate that the fears that lead all other EU15 countries to restrict
A10 immigrants’ access to their welfare systems may have been ill-founded. In theory, if excessive welfare use and a negative net contribution of A10 migrants to public finances were to be present anywhere, it ought to be in Sweden with its large welfare sector and equal access to welfare for these migrants... Yet even with quite conservative assumptions about income assimilation and the difference between marginal and average costs the predicted discounted net contribution is positive.](http://economics.handels.gu.se/digitalAssets/1455/1455743_free-immigration-and-welfare-access.pdf)

As for the next paragraph, I agree about the negative impact of capitalism. As for overpopulation I tend to view that as a *result* of social inequality rather than a cause. As a country is able to reduce it's poverty level we tend to see a reduction of family size, rather than what you seem to be proposing is an increase.

Of course I understand that rape and murder are crimes, and I'm not proposing no checks for violent crime however to pretend that the limits of our immigration policy are built around background checks for criminal behaviour is laughable. I find the idea of millions upon millions of immigrants to New Zealand within a year similarly laughable. That is nothing less than hysterical similar to the hysteria over Romanian immigrants to the UK, I think it is similarly baseless. It is not realistic. Neither is the idea losing healthcare, education or all public service overnight. Can you back up any of these ideas? Our economy failing overnight, are you serious?

I'm flattered that you think I seem intelligent. I don't think that your conclusions hold water. By the way I know it likely won't matter to you but I'm not the one who voted your opinions down.",t3_30v0sj,t1_cpx78go,1427856656,False,cpxfcu5,t1_cpxfcu5

SK still can't play anything other than stomp lane, win game. Wake me up when the team finds a way to play decently when Forgiven isn't on a bursty snowball ADC. They can't play siege. They can't kite a team fight out. They can't disengage. Nrated is awful.

Fnatic's 5v5 team fighting is awful. It's funny, their 2v2 and 3v3 type skirmishing is great, it's where they're strong. But in coordinated 5v5's they just lose all focus and next thing you know all 5 members are off doing their own thing like it's solo queue. All five members are strong for their region which is a good thing.

C9 has a vegetable in the mid lane that ruins any sort of diversity the team may show. Balls is forced onto AP tops every game (yes, he individually is underperforming) when he might want to play something like Sion or Hecarim (two very strong tops at the moment) solely because Hai can't play anything except Zed. Hai is awful. Balls is playing terribly.

CLG is like a mix of Fnatic and SK in their big issues, only winning when they completely stomp lane solely because their team fighting or skirmishing past 15 minutes is atrocious. It's pathetic really considering how far along in this game we are. Link is awful. Xmithie is awful.

TIP can't play lane swaps properly. One of the most integral parts of the game is unable to be played by them. Luckily, they have a mint coach in Fly who can and, I assume, will teach them (I hope). Despite Wiz and Adrian both flying under the radar, I don't think they're a true weak link and the rest of the team is top of their class in the region.

Outside of those I don't think any team really sticks out. TIP and Fnatic point out to me because they don't have a true weak player and are really only failing in one certain point that *can*, in theory, be learned and disciplined.

So on and so forth.

I don't have any illusions that this is utopian. Such a thing could only arise after Israel and Palestine sign that peace treaty. There needs to be a time to heal, so the conflicts stop happening. It took Europe fifty years from ending WW2 to signing the Schengen agreement. I think the Levant can do that - **but we need to end the wars and build some mutual trust first**.

1432129534,0,t5_2rgbf,,,0,1427868811,,,GreenParty,0,1,1,christoph_rocker,False,"Jill says she's an ""Exploratory Candidate"", I am curious as to what her foreign policies would be.

There's a lot of aggressive countries that we have to deal with and a lot of hot spots around the globe we are involved in. I would like to know how she thinks we should deal with places like the middle east, Russia, china, Mexico, Canada, etc., both financially and militarily.

On an RT news interview, ""In the Now"" on Feb 9th,  Jill mentioned Syriza, which is a radical left party in Greece composed of many different left wing ideologies. Noting that here in America, third parties are just below the surface and there is fertile ground here to grow into something big and strong in very little time. Mind you that the Green Party has only been in America for 30 years. We are in our infancy but need to grow up fast. We have no choice. There's too much at stake...the environment, war, etc.

There are those who may think we are radical, but I don't think we are. I think we are moderate. In Europe, the Green Party is considered moderate. Roosevelt, when he proposed the New Deal, was hated by the Right/Corporations, but when WWII started, it worked out to be in the best interest of the big corporations and our nation. We have remained in a war economy since and we need to rethink our position. This is where the Green New Deal proposes ""Green Jobs"" for all. There is tremendous amounts of clean up of polluted lands and waters needed. There are vast roads and bridges needing repair. The technology for developing various clean and sustainable fuels is at our fingertips. We just need to redirect our energy from war to peace and perhaps be a model for the world instead of spending trillions on war efforts that only make this a more dangerous and unstable world in every way imaginable.

I would like to hear detailed plans of Jill Steins ""Jobs For All"" and how she plans on making this a reality.

I think she needs to be careful with comparing us with Syriza. She says that they were a blip on the radar in and in 5 years are now the dominant party. Also, She mentions Podemos in Spain, who according to wikipedia: (left-wing populists include anti-capitalism, social justice, pacifism and anti-globalization, whereas class society ideology or socialist theory is not as important as it is to traditional left-wing parties.[2] The criticism of capitalism and globalization is linked to anti-Americanism which has increased in the left populist movements as a result of unpopular US military operations, especially those in the Middle East.) 

We are a party with many different ideologies within our party, but we have clear platform and we are not communists or Trotskyites.

Another thing I want from my Green Representative is a spokesperson who can explain in layman's terms what we are and what we are not. This would clear a lot of misconceptions of our party.

I am a Green Party Member who values my Bill of Rights and US Constitution, which is being whittled away from within by our elected officials who are in bed with the Multinational Corporations. (See Stop the TPP)

I value the right to bear arms but think we need better laws to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Guns are for self protection in a violent society and I don't have any problem with gun ownership. Some Greens don't like guns, but not all of us. I think a strong military is necessary in this violent world, but also I think we spend way too much on the military and that it is as General Smedley butler said, ""War is a Racket"". I think we should strive for total global nuclear nonproliferation and a nuclear free zone in the middle east.

I think free enterprise is a valuable and good thing and rewards those who have a strong work ethic. Making money is great and owning stuff I think is good! The problem is that the antitrust laws have been obliterated to the point where the Capitalists have become monopolies (which shouldn't exist) and they have more power than our elected officials. They also have no loyalty to any country. They only care about unfettered development and unregulated exploitation of natural resources at the expense of the people and our environment.

I would like to know what Jill thinks about land. Two things in particular...owning land and purchasing land to protect the environment. This is a very touchy subject whereas this land was stolen from the Native Americans. I think buying land for preservation with tax money is a waste of money. No one should have to purchase it. Certain lands should be set aside away from developers, certain lands allowed for people to build homes on, not for profit, but for living in for FREE (no property tax), some lands should be owned to a limited extent. There are so few beaches here in Florida that are near where I live in Tampa that it makes me angry and sad that so much beautiful beach areas have been lost to over development and the like. 

Jill Stein's Green New Deal has many solutions to our numerous problems we face nationally and globally. This is a very volatile moment in history when the future of humanity rests with this generation.

The two party system we have has turned into an oligarchy and the people have no voice. The Green Party aims to get the money out of politics and is leading as an example by not accepting any corporate contributions!

What will you do? I am voting GREEN!

If you like the idea of the forgiving of student loans, election day a national holiday, abolishing the electoral college, reinstating the Glass-Steigal act, Legalizing medical marijuana, Clean Energy, No GMO's, No Nukes, Free Health Care for All - like Canada and Europe, Getting Money out of politics, Public Funded College Education and other things that the two party system doesn't even have on the table, then you are in good company.

I would like to see if not Jill, then some Green Party Candidate this 2016 in the National Debates! Last election was shameful and unacceptable in a country that we call democratic and free. Jill was chained to a chair by secret service for hours. This is not the America I want and is not the America the Green party is trying to change.

We are reformists, nonviolent freedom loving, environmentalists, who want justice &amp; liberty for all. What we have now is not working and the only way to change anything is to get involved, no matter how hopeless. 

Might as well try and fail than to let these criminals continue to trash the planet, the economy and our good name. 

Climate Change Deniers, who ignore the 97% of Scientist Consensus that it is happening and is manmade, are in control of the mass media and are committing a crime against humanity in their misinformation campaign against the learned scholars. It is as despicable as the ""War of Currents"" when Edison electrocuted dogs and elephants in public to demonstrate how Telsa's AC was more dangerous and inferior to his DC model. It's as low as the tobacco industries disinformation campaigns of the past. It's all the same in that it's big money before public health. Get it? Good! It's not rocket science.

We need to lead by example. We are failing in that so far &amp; America is hated throughout the world because we are hypocrites. We spout the rhetoric of justice, equality &amp; freedom, all the while in our own country, we have mass unemployment, mass incarceration, mandatory unaffordable health care that if you cant afford, they take a ""fine"" from what should have been your tax return. Millionaires run for office and in turn help form policy in congress that will benefit companies that they have a vested interest in. Police get away with murder and white collar criminals go unpunished after bankrupting the global markets.

A majority of Americans have given up our own personal power to corrupt, immoral liars. We need to take back our power and voice and join in solidarity with all the fragmented parties who have so much in common. We can stay Green and keep our identity as Green Party ideology goes, but if we unite on issues, there's no stopping us. Did you vote last election?

Last but in now way least, we need to bring our young men and women home from the wars and put them to work healing the planet and economy. Not killing innocent people and creating more hatred towards our country. Soldiers have to do what they are ordered, they give up their rights when they sign that contract. This war for oil or whatever foreign resources the ""masters of mankind"" feel the need to exploit must stop now. This ""Orwellian"" endless ""War on Terror"" must stop. We have turned our once free and joyous nation into a massive surveillance state, where you cannot go anywhere without being filmed or recorded. This is not Freedom. Edward Snowden and others have sacrificed their comfortable lives to warn us of how our government is collecting metadata on everyone and that it could well be used against any people who have an open mind and criticize the government. This is how a tyranny gains strength. Thru surveillance and fear.

Wake up people.

Peace.

Our captain, who yeah hasn't been his commanding and bombarding self, is leaving. And we should be honoring ALL that he has done for us. There are players that have left us that have finally been able to say goodbye, and we can look back and again love the times we shared with them and no longer hold (too big of ) a grudge.

1432129738,0,t5_2ssp3,,,0,False,,,AskHistorians,0,1,1,CringingAtTheWorld,False,"This has been a hotly debated topic for quite some time.  The esteemed scholars [over at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Niko_Bellic/Archive_1) (feel free to read, but it is an incredibly dry debate) have done much of the major work on the subject, but records of Bellic's activities before his arrival are few and far between.  Even his nationality is highly disputed.

The general scholarly consensus is that Bellic is some sort of Eastern European, and is most likely of one of the Slavic nationalities (although this is disputed).  It is likely that he is a southern Slav of some sort, although a few scholars claim that he is Russian.

Beyond that, there are a few major claims regarding Niko Bellic's nationality.  One is that he is Serbian, another is that he is Croatian, another is that he is Bosnian, and the occasional scholar claims he's Montenegrin.  These arguments, due to the scarcity of pre-immigration records, tend to be based on a few sentences from wiretaps, witness statements, and videos from during his crime spree.  All evidence used has been put into question, though.

As for his pre-immigration activities, again, there is little information.  Without his nationality sorted out, few scholars have been willing to search for European records.  It is known, though, that Bellic was a war veteran, although the war in question has not been clearly identified.  The events likely traumatized him.

Most of the works examining Bellic's life focus on his time in Liberty City.  Dan Houser's chapter on him in the edited volume *Grand Theft Auto: Vehicle Theft and Mass Terror* (edited by Dan Houser and David Jones), in addition to exploring his Liberty City crime spree, gives a good summary of the pre-immigration debate so far.

U wot m8? Oh, right, why do I have you tagged as ""said Svoboda and Azov weren't fascist"". Because you argued that here before, and got downvoted even on this sub. Look, I kept telling you that I don't believe that the Ukrainian gov't is fascist or any of that Putinist rubbish. I know full well that Svoboda have hardly any popular support. However, you weren't arguing that, you were literally denying that they were fascist/Neo-Nazi. Anything to whitewash the actions of your countrymen. If you were Russian, you'd be a happy vatnik. Nationalism is in itself wonderfully international. A Russian nationalist is little different from a Ukrainian or an American one. The difference is how the governments of those countries handle nationalists. 

&gt;Russians are largely what's wrong with Russia. Specifically their serf-like mentality.

Will quote again. So here's my problem. Ukrainians of these days have a wonderful 'racially aware' mentality that a lot of /r/europe is poorly familiar with. Like, no shit, a lot of Ukrainians speak of Russians as a different ""Asiatic"" race of some sort of people that have some sort of ""racial consciousness"". Fucking bullshit, is what I say, you can go read Mein Kampf if you want that sort of philosophy supported. You cannot speak of people using 'racial consciousness' ideology. It's plain goddamn racist. 

And the funniest part? Ukrainians and Russians, we are the same people. I don't mean this in a vatnik way, no. I was born in Chernovtsi, USSR. Both of my parents were born in Northern Moldova. Jewish-descendant mother who identified as Ukrainian (our town's Jews were massacred, ones who survived didn't act Jewish any more) and my father more ethnically and linguistically Russian. I have lived in Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine is populated by the exact same people. Never once did I feel the people were somehow different. 

What's different are geopolitical and economic circumstances. Here is where I think my history education is useful. Things don't happen because there is such a thing as 'national character', well, not in the sense that you describe it. Events happen, they shape nations. Russia had particularly lawless 90s with some of the worst post-Soviet transition of the Soviet republics. A massive difference. A traumatic difference. Imagine US breaks apart and becomes poorer than some Third World countries. Now imagine a new, seemingly effective and strong leader comes in. Bingo. You get Putin. Notice how there is a similarity with Hitler. I'm not trying to Godwin all over here, but Putin and Hitler are products of once-powerful nations broken and humiliated. People will hang onto anyone who inflates their nationalistic erection. Also, you know, people like jobs and money and living standards, that also helps.

Ukraine has the exact same people. However, situation a bit different. Ukraine was not a global superpower. Living standards fell, sure, but the situation is different because it's not quite as bad of a hit to national pride. In the 90s the concept of national identity in Ukraine is still weak. Look, I know this firsthand, I attended the Chernivtsi Gymnasium #2 in the early 90s. It's right near the Krasnoarmeskiy Square, beautiful place, on the Golovnoy Prospekt. We went over Ukrainian history. I went to a school that had Russian and Ukrainian classes. Our history was funny, none of us understood why we were Ukrainian and why we were special. I see the schools in the US now as I live in the states and there is a huge difference. Nationalism is very well indoctrinated in the US. This is necessary for the creation of a strong and vibrant national identity. The sort that makes people want to improve their nation, and not just steal from it. I'm not a fan of nationalism, but much like communists seeing capitalism as a necessary stage of development, so I see nationalism as a necessary stage of development. One does not go from nothing into internationalism/globalism, one has to pass through nationalism first. 

Anyhow, I am rambling a lot here, but my point is that Ukraine did not have that unifying leader who was perceived to be very effective and who unified people. Therefore the democracy in Ukraine was allowed to live. Had Ukraine gotten a Lukashenko, Ukraine would have been a dictatorship too. That's why I can't stand smug Ukrainian pricks like you. Russia is shit, but it's not shit because the Russian people are actually at fault here and because Russians are some sort of retards who follow leaders slavishly whilst Ukrainians are progressive liberal democrats. Russians, as all people, are influenced by circumstance. Why did Ukraine become democratic and Belarus not? Ukraine never had a leader who could bring stability like Lukashenko. Quite literally, and I stress this, Ukraine is democratic because of its *incompetence*. Now, it's partially a snide remark aimed at your direction, but also partially a historical commentary. Democracy is often incompetent, but it is in the long run more stable. Incompetence can be good. Too competent of a leader in a fledgling nation often leads to autocrats being born.

**Howe and Hummel**

 **shyster lawyers**

Howe and Hummel were easily the grandest shysters
ever to seek out a loophole, suborn a witness or free
a guilty man. Practicing in New York from 1869 to
1906, they made a mockery of the law. Rotund, walrusmustached
William F. Howe was a great courtroom
pleader who could bring sobs to any jury. Young Abe
Hummel was a little man who was marvelously adept
at ferreting out loopholes in the law, to the extent that
once he almost succeeded in making murder legal.
At the age of 32, Howe came to America from England,
where his career as a medical practitioner had
terminated in a prison term for performing an illegal
operation on a woman patient. He studied law and
within three years he opened up shop on New York’s
Centre (later called Center) Street. Howe was an instant
success because of his resonant voice and a face that
could turn on and off any emotion he wished to display
for a jury. Years later, David Belasco, the theatrical producer,
watched Howe’s tearful performance winning an
acquittal for a woman who had shot her lover full of
holes. “That man,” he said, “would make a Broadway
star.”
In the late 1860s Howe hired young Abe Hummel as
his law clerk and in almost no time promoted him to
partner. Anyone so adept at finding holes in the law
was too good to lose. One case that illustrated Hummel’s
ability involved a professional arsonist named
Owen Reilly. Hummel suggested they save the prosecution
the trouble of a trial by pleading Reilly guilty to
attempted arson. Only after the plea was accepted did
anyone notice that there was no penalty for the crime
of attempted arson. However, the statutes did say that
the sentence for any crime attempted but not actually
committed was to be one-half of the maximum allowable
for the actual commission of the crime. Since the
penalty for arson at the time was life imprisonment,
obviously the defendant’s sentence had to be half a life.
Howe made nonsense of that standard.
“Scripture tells us that we knoweth not the day nor
the hour of our departure,” he told the judge. “Can this
court sentence the prisoner at the bar to half of his natural
life? Will it, then, sentence him to half a minute or
to half the days of Methuselah?” The judge gave up
and set Reilly free; the state legislature rushed to revise
the arson statutes shortly thereafter.
On another occasion the pair almost managed to
make murder legal in New York State. It happened in
November 1888, when a client named Handsome
Harry Carlton was convicted of having killed a cop.
Since the jury failed to recommend mercy, the death
penalty was mandatory. Little Abe studied the statutes
very carefully and pointed out to Howe that in the
month of November there was no death penalty for
murder on the books, the state having abolished hanging
the previous June, with the provision that it be
replaced by the electric chair. The new death-dealing
apparatus was to start functioning on the following
439
HOWE and Hummel
January 1, and as Hummel noted, the law specifically
said that electrocution should apply to all convictions
punishable by death on and after January 1.
When Carlton came up for sentencing, early in
December, Howe objected as the judge prepared to pronounce
the death penalty. In fact, he objected to any
sentence being passed on Carlton. If the jury had recommended
mercy, Carlton could be sentenced to life
imprisonment, the lawyer noted. “However, my client
has been convicted of first-degree murder with no recommendation
of mercy and there is no law on the
books covering such a crime.
He then read the precise language in the new law
and concluded that all the judge could do was turn his
client free. Nonplussed, the judge delayed sentencing
while the case moved to the state supreme court. Quite
naturally, Howe and Hummel’s contention made headlines
across the country. In New York the public reaction
was one of utter shock. According to the lawyers’
contention, anyone committing murder between June
and the new year could not be executed. Other murderers
confined in death cells clamored to be released on
the ground that they were being wrongfully held and
could not be executed.
The district attorney’s office vowed to fight the matter,
and Inspector Thomas Byrnes of the New York
Police Department’s Detective Bureau pledged to the
public that his men would continue to clap murderers
behind bars, law or no law.
In the end, Howe and Hummel lost out on their
interpretation; the high court ruled that no slip in syntax
could be used as an excuse to legalize murder.
Harry Carlton swung from the gallows two days after
Christmas, a nick-of-time execution. However, if Carlton
had lost out, Howe and Hummel did not; their
crafty efforts brought many felons and murderers to
their office door.
Buoyed by the publicity, the two shysters coauthored
a book entitled In Danger, or Life in New York: A True
History of the Great City’s Wiles and Temptations.
They explained in the preface that it was published in
the interest of justice and to protect the innocent from
the guilty, but what they actually turned out was a
primer on every type of crime—blackmail, house burglary,
card sharping, safecracking, shoplifting, jewel
thievery and, of course, murder.
It became an immediate best-seller, with bookstore
owners noticing a lot of traffic in their shops by persons
who did not appear to be frequent book buyers. The
book became required reading for every professional or
would-be lawbreaker, from streetwalkers to killers.
More and more when Howe and Hummel asked a new
client, “Who sent you?” the stock reply was, “I read
about you in the book.”
No one ever computed exactly what percentage of
murderers Howe and Hummel got off scot-free, but a
prosecutor once estimated it was at least 70 percent,
and “90 percent of them were guilty.”
Whenever they had a client who was obviously as
guilty as could be, the pair went into their bandage routine,
having the defendant appear swathed in yards of
white bandage, as though to suggest so frail a mind that
his brains might fall out at any moment. One contemporary
account tells of a Howe and Hummel client who
simulated a village idiot’s tic by “twitching the right
corner of the mouth and simultaneously blinking the
left eye.” As soon as he was cleared, the defendant’s
face “resumed its normal composure, except for the
large grin that covered it as he lightly removed the
cloths from about his forehead.” Another client, whose
supposedly blithering insanity was accompanied by
muteness and an ability to communicate only by sign
language, seized Howe’s hand gratefully when the verdict
was announced in his favor and boomed, “Silence
is golden.”
The pair did not always resort to such trickery.
When it was more convenient, they simply bribed witnesses
and appropriate officials to get records changed,
yet somehow they never ran into deep trouble until
after Howe died in 1906. The following year Hummel
was caught paying $1,000 to facilitate a divorce action.
He was sentenced to two years in prison. Released at
the age of 60, Hummel retired to Europe and died in
London in January 1926, a regular to the end in the visitors’
section during trials at the Old Bailey.

Both of them started around the beginning or middle of January and carried on till April. This season his job was on a tight rope before he finally got his tactics together. Even his substitutions up to that point were awful.  His interviews are still terrible as he continuously rambles on about anything (of late people have not noticed this but before we started our run of form the interviews enraged me). 

We bought 10 players and spent over 100 million this summer and still, with only Sturridge missing our next best option was 20 year old Raheem Sterling as a striker. Our best defense consists of a player we bought last season, a player that has been with us for a while, and a player that we bought originally to play in midfield. We were terrible in Europe with probably the easiest group we'll get in a long time because we were lucky enough to be put into pot 3 this season. For those who say he didn't have the experience, fair enough. Then why in the Europa League were we utter shite for both legs against Besiktas amidst our great run of form, a league that Rodgers DOES have some experience in. 

Before you think I'm part of the RodgersOut brigade, I'm not.  I'm a fan of his and want him to succeed at this football club. He's gotten us playing better football that we have been playing in a long time and he's a miracle worker when it comes to making players better. I want him to be our Ferguson, I want him to go on and win us tons and tons of trophies, but he needs to do be consistent throughout the season. I still think that we will get CL football, but if he doesn't, then I would only want him at this club under DoF to make sure he has his shit in order at the start of the season and to make sure our business in the transfer window isn't as bad as last season.

Propelled less competition for Europeans. Look at Afghanistan today. They destroyed them, once the Middle-East was a center of cultural affluence.

&gt;By overemphasizing individual mobility, we ignore important social determinants of success like family inheritance, social connections, and structural discrimination. The three papers in Perspectives on Psychological Science indicate not only that economic inequality is much worse than we think, but also that social mobility is less than you’d imagine. Our unique brand of optimism prevents us from making any real changes.

This. This right here. 

We now have greater social inequality than many countries in Latin America. There is greater social mobility in places like Germany and the UK. And much of this comes down to access to things like health care and education. 

American kids are burdened by insane tuition rates, handed loans farmed out to private corporations, and are basically getting robbed into a lifetime of debt peonage.

I've always felt like referring to people as Turkish, Indian, Chinese etc is more a way to refer to distinguishing characteristics in the same way we refer to people as White or Black. If someone is said to be British-Indian then the Indian part refers only to their ethnicity. If you're in Britain and talking about someone who is obviously British, you'd just say that they're Indian. Context has made the 'British' part unnecessary because their nationality is already known. That's probably why it doesn't really happen to white 2nd gen immigrants. You can't really single someone out in a crowd of Brits by saying that they're the Czech guy.

It's all down to intent and context. If your Mother were to refer her neighbour as ""the Turkish guy"" like it's a negative characteristic or if she's unnecessarily bringing his ethnicity into it when complaining about him then that would be a sign of prejudice. Otherwise I think it's harmless.

I believe Baltic concerns over Russian meddling is justified but implications of full scale invasion that many Baltic politicians take part in are just silly. I will say the same for Russian politicians who think the Baltics are a staging area in a NATO attempt to take Moscow. Its obviously an attempt in both nations to stir up paranoia, by using the extreme version of these situation the neighbors are in. Although, I do not believe that these Mistral class ships pose any sort of threat to the Baltics in anyway considering half the purchase is going to the Pacific, and that the ships hold a command center role.

I do sincerely believe NATO is openly pursuing an encirclment policy regarding Russia, because its in their best interest. I laugh my trousers off whenever I hear yuropeans claiming NATO integration is just the will of every citizen in candidate countries that was expressed through the notoriously fair, incorruptable, and uneasy to influence post-Soviet states. When the Soviet Union collapsed, it was essentially the wild west and NATO was ready to plunder. NATO switched from being a defensive alliance/containment agent to being the strong arm of US foreign policy regarding the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Russian confrontation.

It all depends. This is all about human minds. If aggressor can sell story well market will react calmly. This is what happened with war in Iraq. Nasdaq even went up. But when people see the war as injust aggression they will flee. Happened in Russia during 2008 and is happening now.

China is different. They care deeply about the economy and foreign investments. They are even able to self discipline themselves and change leadership of the party every few years. Putin is different. He can swiftly turn businessman into ruins because he pleases.

Inequality is a big reason. We have some of the best schools, medical centers, etc. But because most people do not have access to such great facilities or due to our more decentralized nature (rampant poverty among minorities, difficulty in class ascension, etc., differences between states, strong political divides,  etc.) our standing is ultimately dragged down.

The title of this thread doesn't seem to reflect what is actually being said. The wording of the press release seems to indicate that the European Union wishes to make it illegal to lock customers to a single store front based on the customer's location. It doesn't seem to be the case that they want to make regional pricing illegal. Which makes a lot of sense.

I do wonder if stores like Steam can just get around this by only selling region locked products. Otherwise, what is to stop people from rich EU countries to buy from storefronts with lower prices en masse.

Straight off, a US driver's license is no good here: you'll need an international driving licence.

If you've never ridden any kind of motorcycle before, I'd say your chances of dropping it when almost stationary are pretty high. Pretty much everybody drops their first bikes pretty quickly after getting on them. It's not a question of parking it at high speed in the side of a taxi, just handling it at walking pace or below where balance in critical and it's an unfamiliar machine. So either be prepared to pay for a little bit of damage, or be super, super careful when you're parking or stopped at junctions and don't let it ever start to tip over like you would allow a bicycle to. 

Having said that... 

* The traffic here is extremely tame, so if I had to ride for the first time in a major European city, I'd pick Barcelona. 

* The auto transmission Vespas (which is without doubt what rental places will be offering) are trivially easy to ride. It has two brakes like a bicycle, you just need to twist the throttle instead of pedalling, and operate the indicators/blinkers. They weigh less than 250lbs and the centre of gravity is low. 

* You don't need bigger than a 50cc in the city.

If you go for it and it happens to rain, I strongly advise against taking it out on wet city roads until you can ride it really smoothly (or better still, just don't). The roads get *really* slippery in town until they've had a good wash.

The Polish army was tasked with the ground invasion, but I'm glad we at least don't worry about that anymore. Nobody has threatened Russia with nuclear strikes because of it's defenses, in fact, nobody has threatened Russia with nukes because of anything. The missile defense program was canceled in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2009 after criticism from Russia and the rest of Europe. Instead it was replaced by medium and short range interceptor systems (not anti ICBM) as a result of Russia moving medium and short range systems closer. The last couple of years a lot of European nations have renewed discussions and plans of anti ICBM measures though, as has Russia. Bush pulling out of the agreement in 2002 was stupid, however, he stated that the reason was it limited the US for protecting itself from strikes from ""rouge nations"", remember 2002 was at the height of US terror paranoia. In 2002 he also signed a treaty with Russia to limit deployed strategic warheads. 

I'm not talking about rhetoric in the press, or some fringe minority political parties, as both Russian and Western news agencies and public profiles have been contributing to an atmosphere of mistrust and hate. Russia has gotten sanctioned and threatened with economic measures, because of it's active role in destabilizing Ukraine.

Offices in any company are not created equal. I always felt the priorities of the business in Europe were being largely driven from London but that could have changed (or have just been my imagination). It doesn't matter as much as you think. Don't worry about ""equal"", worry about if it meets your career goals. 

Your prof is right however, many consultancies (McK included) are indeed franchises in a way. I wouldn't say the quality gap is ""substantial"" though, but the offices don't always work exactly the same way. Standards are universally high everywhere in my opinion.

&gt;Would this be an issue if I were to want to return to Western Europe or the US?

It will and wont be an issue if you want to return to Western Europe or the US. It really depends on what you do with your time there. If you develop a specialism in Albanian beard farming, I'm sure you can imagine any likely move back to the rest of the world may not go as smoothly.


Either way, it is an excellent opportunity. Don't be disheartened by the region. The challenges you'll face in that region will be very different to those faced by clients in the rest of Europe, but it will be a very interesting career journey I'm sure. If you want a ""jet set lifestyle"" and to travel the world then you need to be in a much bigger office in a more prominent city in western Europe. My guess is that any regional practice in the Balkans will focus on the local market and providing support for engagements in the CIS region, Balkans and Eastern Europe, in general. But I can't say with any certainty as I've not worked in the Balkans before.

Even realm divide came out of no where for me. I found, in  similarity with a number of total war players that Shogun 2 was extremely immersive, much more so than EU4. 

My major gripe with EU4 is that none of the factions that I play receive major attention. Mind you I don't play often in Europe, and when I do its an obscure country, but all the factions feel similar. As Iran, for instance, you don't really feel like a Shi'a fortress against the Sunni empires. Manchu doesn't get enough events or flavour, yet the country was more powerful than many European powers at their height. Southeast Asia is practically flavourless, along with Africa, and the Steppe. Only South and Mesoamerica were redeemed in this recent patch. 

Again, comparing it to total war. It is far, far more easier to program a little event for the Clauswitz engine than to come up with skins and designs for a new faction in a total war game. That's why, even though I thoroughly enjoy playing Eu4, I feel that the total war series has put more work into their games and it shows. Attila, for instance, is the best total war yet.

There may have been some female KKK members who wanted the vote too, but it'd be wrong to say the American suffragettes, as a group, allied with the KKK.  They were most definitely on opposite sides.

&gt;Most educated Americans vaguely remember that the amendment granting women the right to vote was passed by Congress in 1919 and ratified by the states in 1920. But the number of people who know anything about the forty-year legislative war that preceded that victory is smaller than the audience of MSNBC. That war began in 1878, when a California Republican named A.A. Sargent introduced the 19th Amendment only to see it voted down by a Democrat-controlled Congress. It finally ended four decades later, when the Republicans won landslide victories in the House and the Senate, giving them the power to pass the amendment despite continued opposition from most elected Democrats -- including President Woodrow Wilson, to whom the suffragettes frequently referred as ""Kaiser Wilson.""

&gt;Meanwhile, the Republicans continued to introduce the 19th Amendment in Congress every year, but the Democrats were able to keep it bottled up in various committees for another decade before allowing either chamber to vote on it. In 1887 it finally reached the floor of the Senate. Once again, however, it was defeated by a vote of 34 to 16. After this setback, advocates of women's suffrage opted to put pressure on Congress by convincing various state legislatures to pass bills giving women the vote. This met with some success. By the turn of the century a variety of Republican-controlled states, including Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho, had granted women suffrage. During the first ten years of the new century, several other states gave women the vote, including Washington and California.

&gt;Congress, however, didn't deign to vote on the issue again until 1914, when it was once again defeated by Senate Democrats. It was subsequently brought up for a vote in January of 1915 in the House, where it went down by a vote of 204 to 174. Nonetheless, the Republicans continued to push even after it was defeated yet again in early 1918. The big break for 19th Amendment came when President Wilson, a true Democrat, violated his most solemn campaign promise. Having pledged to keep the United States out of the European conflict that had been raging since 1914, he decided to enter the war anyway. This set the stage for the 1918 midterm elections in which voter outrage swept the Republicans into power in both the House and the Senate. This finally placed the GOP in a position to pass the amendment despite Democrat opposition.

&gt;During the following spring Rep. James R. Mann, a Republican from Illinois, reintroduced the 19th Amendment in the House and it finally passed by an overwhelming majority. Shortly thereafter a now Republican-controlled Senate also passed it, clearing the way for ratification by the states. By this point, President Wilson had also faced the reality that women would inevitably get the vote and abandoned his opposition. But the Democrats' resistance was by no means dead. They did their level best to prevent the amendment from being ratified: ""When the Amendment was submitted to the states, 26 of the 36 states that ratified it had Republican legislatures. Of the nine states that voted against ratification, eight were Democratic."" Many of these Democrat-controlled states refused to ratify the amendment until the 1970s.

In the case of Israel, Jewish people had been moving back to the area for decades (probably longer I'm not entirely sure) before a Jewish state in the area could be considered realistic.

I think if the day ever comes where the land is returned in a reconciliatory effort, then the Turkish state should also make an effort to repopulate the area with Armenians by offering a severance package (as part of the reparations).

But obviously Turkey (at least with the current government) wouldn't want to give up their geopolitical power just to create a more economically viable Armenia. I believe Turkey could benefit from a stronger Armenia. But Turkey, as a rising regional power, acts as expected, by ensuring its neighbors are weak and cooperative.

Sebastian Gechert, Ansgar Rannenberg - [Macroeconomic Policy Institute](http://www.boeckler.de/imk_english.htm) (IMK), Hans Böckler Foundation

**Abstract**

This policy brief re-examines the effects of the Greek austerity experiment on its economy via a counterfactual analysis. We combine the fiscal multipliers from the meta regression analysis in Gechert and Rannenberg (2014) to the fiscal consolidation measures that have been implemented in Greece between 2010 and 2014. We estimate that austerity explains almost the entire collapse of Greek GDP after 2009. This result suggests that - ceteris paribus - , in the absence of austerity, the Greek economy would have entered a prolonged period of stagnation, rather than a depression.

At the same time the path of the government debt-to-GDP ratio would have been somewhat lower. Furthermore, we estimate that if the consolidation would have been postponed until after the recovery of the Greek economy and implemented gradually, almost two thirds of the cost in terms of lost output could have been avoided. Our results suggest that the period 2010-2014 was the wrong time to implement frontloaded spending cuts due to their strong multipliers in downturns. Implementing only the revenue components of the Greek fiscal consolidation would have strongly reduced the output contraction as compared to the actual path of GDP, but would have been much more effective at lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio than the actual fiscal consolidation. A more cautious consolidation would thus have been in the interest of international creditors as well.

**Conclusions**

The debate on Greek economic policy since the outbreak of the European sovereign debt crisis as well as its future is set to continue over the coming months and years. We contribute to the assessment of the former by estimating the effect of the Greek tax increases and expenditure cuts. We find that austerity in Greece almost exclusively explains the decline of Greek GDP since 2009 and actually increased the government debt-to-GDP ratio somewhat as compared to a no-austerity scenario. We also estimate that most of the costs of fiscal consolidation could have been avoided by postponing and gradually implementing it after the recovery of the Greek economy, due to the lower expenditure multipliers during normal times. Finally, a much lower path of the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio could have been achieved by implementing only the revenue increases but not the expenditure cuts which were part of the consolidation package. It appears that those who warned against the Greek austerity experiment early on (e.g. Horn et al 2011) were right.

To be sure, we do not argue that the Greek public finances were in good shape when the fiscal consolidation began. However, irrespectively of whether the Greek budget was structurally unbalanced or not, as the economy was in particularly bad shape, our results suggest that the 2010-2014 period was the wrong time to implement spending cuts, and that any expenditure based consolidation should have been phased in gradually after the recovery of Greek economy.

You'd think they'd be really good liers but they're generally not so much. If you're reasonably educated you can check out stuff they should know about their specialty too haha...works well. But they don't really need to lie - I don't think patrons tip for a sob story these days, more just for a good dance or a friendly chat etc. I don't see great incentives in place for sob stories. 

They're generally pretty honest. One was paying for a house she was building on Waiheke, a few others fundraising in their travels (European tourists), others are students, and some have office jobs outside of Auckland and come in to strip over the weekend for extra pocket money.

The Illyrians themeselves are considered extinct/absorbed (culturaly) by the Romans by the 2nd century A.D.
The only words Albanians and Greeks share are a few loan words from one another and this is mostly an 19+ century.

With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic. . . .""

I'd also recommend Matthew Stover's entries. You would've read his first SW novel, *Traitor*, in the New Jedi Order series. His others are really great reads, as well.

* Revenge of the Sith
* Shatterpoint
* Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor

And then here are some odds and ends I'd recommend:

* *Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno - For my money, one of the best EU novels outside of Stover's work. Acts as a plothole destroyer for the Prequel Trilogy.

* *Kenobi*, John Jackson Miller - Details Obi-Wan's life on Tatooine. Takes Star Wars back to its Western roots.

* The Medstar Duology (*Battle Surgeons* and *Jedi Healer*), Michael Reaves and Steve Perry - Basically a neat combination of Star Wars and MASH.

* *Scoundrels*, Timothy Zahn - A heist novel that features Han, Lando, and Chewie.

* *Dark Rendezvous*, Sean Stewart - Details Yoda and Dooku's Master/Padawan relationship, in addition to covering the story of a Jedi who can't wield the Force.

* *The Old Republic: Deceived*, Paul S. Kemp - Might be a little too far away from what you are looking for (this takes place around 3650 BBY) but I thought it was one of the better novels from this part of the timeline. Covers a time when the Sith were able to take the fight all the way to Coruscant.

&gt;At a summit in [Minsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk) on 11 February 2015, the leaders of [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) agreed to a package of measures to alleviate the ongoing [war in the Donbass region of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbass).     The talks that led to the deal, overseen by the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe) (OSCE), were organised in response to the collapse of the [Minsk Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_Protocol) ceasefire in January–February 2015. The new package of measures is intended to revive the Protocol, which had been agreed to on 5 September 2014.

There are few times in which heavy metal has challenged the status quo in such a way that it becomes relevant to culture.  Some of the greatest heavy metal records, both celebrated and disdained, all do one thing and that is to challenge the listener to think differently. Ozzy Osborne once said so candidly that ""heavy metal is not something that should be taken seriously on internet by elitists but celebrated in the mosh pit with brothers in arms.""  I feel that American act (hed)p.e. not only represents the Id but revels in Man's existence. 

2004 is not a time discussed for its metal. While *Autumn Aurora*,  *Geist Ist Teufel*, and *Honkin' on Bobo* are some of the most common names associated with greatness of the year, it is *Only in Amerika*, the fourth studio record by hip hop core act (hed)p.e., which is truly the one which outshines all else and perhaps the one which will transcend decades in it's influence.  Few times does one get to look at the world differently in what Allmusic user Johnny Loftus, calls  a ""thrash-hop spew [which] takes cues from Anthrax, Korn, Dirty South, pre-acting career Ice-T, and the uncompromising Psychopathic Records collective.""

2003 was a strange time for (hed)p.e. as their third studio album *Blackout* has been cited by critics like Johnny Loftus as being a record which ""expands on melodic elements that had previously played a supporting role in the band's sound."" Loftus goes on to cite that  ""Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And whether or not it is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have figured out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks."" This moment in (hed)p.e.'s history might have seemed like the crest of a very large mountain the band ascended in the span of four records but this moment would be the last for (hed)p.e. and longtime label Jive Records. 

If one were to assess *Only in Amerika* in terms of an illustration pulled from popular European folklore, the album would spark from a firehawk right after it was released by the giant on top of slumber mountain. While it may seem cliché to use the SlumberMountain giant tale to try and describe only in Amerika, it is only this children's tale which can capture the innocence and drama in such songs as ""Foreplay,"" ""Raise Hell"" and the machismo anthem ""Chicken."" *Only in Amerika* was the first record in which the band felt unshackled by the restraints of a large label. Perhaps it is this that led to lyrics such as. 

&gt;Go ahead pussy keep cryin about your bitch / While you listen to that silly faggot pop punk shit

as well as

&gt;Somethin inside of yo vaginaz got me homicidal / When you bend over - it's all over

and even

&gt;I'm talking American made hand grenades / Home grown Russian AK47s adapted now - fully automatic / Start the revolution / Let these commies fucking have it

Few times does an album come across so brazen and confident that its lyrics incite the listener to action and also allow them to mediate on its meaning. Marshall McLuhan once said that the Medium is the Message and that the medium carries with it the context of meaning. Though Hed Pe is a rapcore act whose album came on compact disc in 2004, its meaning is a call to arms which is measured in weight that is probably transported via forklift.

I personally would LOVE to do a PhD on preserving 18th Century French Damasks; but alas I live in Perth....

If your thing is Venetian trade routes with China in the 14th century, then you'll need to learn Italian and Mandarin, and you'd be better off studying in Italy. 

If its Medieval English architecture, then the UK is a better go and you may end up like the lucky man who's job it is to make medieval bricks to fix up Hampton Court.

On a side note, the Scandinavian countries have free tertiary education, a very good standard of living, and wonderfully collaborative PhD programs. How would you feel about learning Danish and studying *anything* in Copenhagen ? (Military technology and the use of the war axe during the Northern crusades ??)

I know I probably sound like a nutter, but I have an Honours *and* I studied in the UK. There are many more areas to study in the EU, but you *have* to put the work in. Are you prepared to learn another language ? Write articles for submission ? Attend conferences ? All things which can gussie up a less than stellar academic record.

In my opinion, an Honours degree is a very good way to discover if your chosen field is interesting enough for you to write a PhD in; and if you're interested in an Academic life. You'd get all of these things and a better qualification by doing a Masters.

Also be aware that being an EU citizen is not enough for domestic rates - some countries require residence as well - in the UK its two years. Unless you work your box off and get a Rhodes Scholarship, in which case its teacakes and scones all the way.

For myself, I would do a Masters, get published, maybe do a summer school &amp; a conference in my field, and then go looking for a full-fare PhD in the EU.

It seems rather clunky to use so far in that, with Emp Seals and haste capped, I often find myself having to decide between it and HP generators. I've played around with it a bit and on some fights it really does help along with WoG.

A while back Theck talked about the talent and explained that, with our tendency to be haste capped and stacking haste, having another cast on a 20sec CD makes it weaker than the DPS/Healing output of Execution due to having to commit more GCD's to it for less output. At least I think it was Theck.

What's the motivation behind using it, and on which fights would you use it over Execution?

I'm also seeing a lot of Divine Purpose over Holy Avenger. Is this gear-related, or more for specific fights? To me it seems like its stronger than HA on fights where you take more constant damage that hits for a bit less (HanznFranz, maybe Maidens), whereas HA shines on fights where you need to burst or proc your SotR/Bastion WoG more (Flamebender).

As with Holy Prism, I've only seen it pop up recently and have only had a 9/10 Normal one-shot to test it out, would be awesome if you could explain the motivation behind using it and where it comes out ahead of HA.

A question about Maidens - Light's Hammer or not? I've seen a few Paladins use it on Mythic streams, but wasn't sure if it was the tanks or rets as it was healer POV streams.

Operation Paperclip is what first brought ex-HYDRA scientists into the US heartland, and it began because of the immediate need to develop American based superscientific weaponry upon the war's completion- everyone feared an immediate new war with the USSR, after their occupation of large swathes of Europe. HYDRA's work was the most weapons-based superscience division of the war, which is what attracted the USA to its importation in the form of both men and materiel. These continued to form the backbone of the superscientific line of defense of the USA throughout the Cold War.

But why was the growth of HYDRA within SHIELD not properly noticed? There is a very clear reason behind that; even though HYDRA had split from the Nazi regime and become its own quasi-polity, a fact which was not made public to the American people for quite some time, they were still fundamentally considered to be synonymous with Hitler's regime and the Nazi party. Both this original HYDRA and its Nazi cousins were decidedly unsubtle about their imagery, ideology, and authoritarianism. This, in combination with the USSR's often colourful superscience, led to a false association between these two things- essentially, that a superscience based organisation not centered around democratic ideology would always look and sound as unsubtle as the original HYDRA.

The surviving HYDRA members who were interested in continuing with their goals learned from this, and an ideological shift occurred; instead of upright, stolid, unshakeable cult they instead became a network of shadows, connections, and ideologically flexible. Their recruitment was based upon being accommodating enough to be attractive to any valuable target for membership. As time wore on, many HYDRA members were increasingly unconcerned or indifferent to the organisation's history, putting no real stock in the Red Skull or the original HYDRA, and actively considered themselves a new, better breed of HYDRA. Neither did they remain meek- the 20th century was a secret battleground between HYDRA directed ideological manipulation of American culture and society, and those who resisted it, though those who did so did not realise what it was they were fighting. It is from the 80s onwards that HYDRA gained a relatively firm direction over American society, enough to promote values friendly to theirs, and to create environments conducive to recruitment. It is from this period that mass-membership of HYDRA began, and given that the 80s saw a newly aggressive phase of the Cold War they had every reason to be camoflaged from observation.

However, nobody is invincible, and it was only by murdering Howard Stark in 1991 that HYDRA was not discovered in the immediate years after the Cold War ended.

IATM that the separation of religion and government as written into the constitution's 1st amendment and later interpretations represents an awareness on the part of the authors of the constitution of the importance of religion in people's lives but they wanted to balance that with an expression of inclusiveness; a respect for diversity of points of view that was a radical departure from the governments of Europe. It should work so long as religious expression and governmental intervention respect those boundaries. 

Right now, we are seeing politicians trying to exploit the voters by stirring up resentment for the principal of separation of religion and government. Whether or not this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen. I personally think that today's trend has roots in the idea of American exceptionalism that became popular in the aftermath of World War II and what we are seeing now is the cognitive dissonance that comes with trying to fight WWII all over again in Korea, Viet Nam, and the Mideast and seeing those practices fail.

&gt; Which I assume means adding a campaign or two. I know that it has been said they you don't wish to segregate the campaigns further, but PLEASE consider a campaign for V1-V10 only players. While the stat and power difference between say a battle-leveled VR5 and VR14 may not be all that great (open for debate), the SKILL level certainly can be. There is currently a significant learning curve for new players going from the non-vet campaign into the ""regular"" campaigns and one additional step would help with this learning curve. A second and perhaps larger benefit is it would make leveling through the Veteran Ranks through PVP only more palatable if players could avoid the ""elite"" VR14s that often make it less enjoyable. Think of it as a ""safer"" place to enjoy your PVP VR leveling experience.

Even NATO itself its largely the US paying for others to play.

Assuming that's US dollars you're quoting that seems a bit high to me, but then I don't know what bikes go for over there. For reference, my bike was in very good condition when I got it, had 30K miles, came with luggage and cost £1,100. I traded it 3 years later for a set of panniers on a nearly new Triumph. 

So expect it to be pristine and in full working order including extras like heated grips. I'd also definitely hold out for one with luggage - the BMW luggage system for K bikes was awesome.

I wouldn't say its a bad first bike (it was my second bike). The handlebars are a bit narrow and the brakes won't match anything on a newer bike. But it's really well balanced and very stable, the switch gear and levers are big and chunky and the 'brick' engine is very smooth and reliable. It's not a bike that's about being ridden agressively, so if you ride it sensibly, it should treat you right. 

The K75 is famously reliable. It was a cop bike all over Europe for years and I still see the occasional courier in London rocking one. But it does have some issues. From what I can remember...

Rear suspension. It's a very small single sided affair and they generally only have about 15k miles in them. They're easy enough to replace, but will cost a few hundred pounds (or dollars) so if the one you're looking at still has the original or an old replacement, I'd ask him to take the replacement cost off the price. 

Fork springs. The K75 is a long bike with long front forks. If the owner hasn't replaced these in the last 15k or so miles count on having to do this job as well. 

There is a spline in the shaft drive that can become worn and eventually sheer. Try to feel for any juddering when you pull away in 1st and obvs ask the guy if he's ever had any issues.

The original front brake disks were made of stainless steel so don't stop brilliantly in the wet and tend to warp. Check for even wear and juddering when you brake.  

That's about all I can think of, good luck and please post a pic if you buy one!

&gt;The __winter of 1962–1963__ (also known as the __Big Freeze of 1963__) was one of the coldest winters on record in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom).  Temperatures plummeted and lakes and rivers began to freeze over. In the [Central England Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature) (CET) record, extending back to 1659, only the winter (defined as the months of December, January and February) of 1683–84 has been significantly colder, with 1739–40 being slightly colder than 1962–63. However, the winter did not rank so highly in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) for its severity as it did in [England and Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales).

If Israel and Saudi attack Iran unprovoked, the world opinion would be behind Iran, except in the propagandized nations of North America and western Europe. What Israel is doing by using the USA as its bodyguard is to create an anti-American alliance centered upon Russia and China. If that alliance includes India, which looks increasingly likely, the US will have managed to hang itself. The USA has lost any alliances with Latin America, Africa just doesn't matter, and the US alliance is losing all control of Asia (except Japan).

1432137784,0,t5_2qhe0,,Netherlands,0,False,netherlands,,Cricket,0,10,10,styxwade,False,"Cricket in the Netherlands, like most sports, is almost entirely club-based. **The Topklasse** (formerly Hooftklasse) is the top club competition in NL, and has been running in one form or another since 1891, making it the second oldest domestic cricket competition in the world, beaten out by the English County Championship by one year. Initially timed cricket, then 65, 60 and now 50 overs. 

The Topklasse was rather controversially reduced from 10 to 8 teams a few years ago, and the season is now a round-robin home and away league phase, followed by a sort of super-four championship round robin together with a ""shitty-four"" relegation round robin. Top two teams then play a best of three final, bottom team is relegated to the Hooftklasse.

Most clubs have two-four payed players, one overseas player and one ""player coach"" that's effectively an overseas player in all but name.  These are generally decent players, often South African/NZ/AUS players with a fair bit of First Class experience - even A-team regulars. Last season ACC had Heino Kuhn and Grahame van Buuren on the roster, Amol Muzumdar's been playing here for ages, Fawad Ahmed was at HCC for a bit etc. These guys tend to go pretty well, but they're not utterly dominant. I'd say the level's somewhere between what you'd see in 1st Grade cricket and Minor Counties. 

Below the Topklasse there's two more national leagues - the **Hooftklasse** and **Eersteklasse**, and then various regional league below those, though the fall-off in quality is pretty steep.

**The T20 Cup** runs alongside the Topklasse on Friday evenings, with 12 teams split into four regional groups who play a home-and-away round robin with the top two from each group going to the quarter finals day in early August, then finals day in mid-August sees the semi finals and final. 

There's also a corporate competition played on tuesdays and wednesdays, as well as a youth competition, recreational saturday afternoon ""ZaMi"" cricket, and a fairly new schools competition - mainly contested by Dutch/English bilingual schools.

/u/Mikolaj_Kopernik also mentioned the **NSPS**, which is an inter-regional 50 over and 20 over competition set up in collaboration with Cricket Scotland. Featuring North Holland and South Holland sides (officially just ""Northern"" and ""Southern"" - but there's very little serious cricket outside of Holland) and two sides from Scotland. This was originally envisaged as including the Irish inter-pro teams with a view to eventually including a 3-day league, but the Dutch and Scots couldn't get Cricket Ireland on board. Basically this serves to provide a bridge between the Topklasse and the national side, in the absence of any properly structured A-Team programme. 

The ""Pro"" in Pro Series is currently rather aspirational, with the Scots a deal closer to achieving two fully professional sides than us. The Dutch side of things currently lacks for sponsors and coverage, whilst Quipu streamed the games in Scotland last time the only coverage for NL was CricketEurope's ball-by-ball.

You are more than likely receiving a substandard education that will leave you in debt at the end of the road and looking at years of paying that back with an uncertain economy and future for this country as a whole.  

You are being immersed in Jewish propaganda from the first to last steps of your higher education and a great many of your required core classes have a political innuendo that is attempting to indoctrinate you and undermine your race and your people.  We have rapidly reached the point of no return in the demographic battle and this country and the best thing that you can do is leave this substandard, Frankfurt School style environment and give yourself a classical education as I did.

Start with history.  The key to understanding the world that you inhabit is knowing what came before and led to the events of today.  Read all eleven volumes of ""The Story of Civilization"" by William and Ariel Durant which end in the Napoleonic era and then supplement that with ""A New History of the World"" by J.M. Roberts to pick up where the Durants left off.  

Now delve further back with ""The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War"", ""Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History"" by Pomeroy and Burstein (yes, I generally ignore Jews but if Mr. Burstein has Zionist leanings they have escaped me and his work on Classical Antiquity is generally solid).  ""The Rise and Fall of Athens: Nine Greek Lives"" by Plutarch and Herodotus' ""The Histories"" are also required reading.

For your knowledge of the Roman Empire start with those who were there.  The histories of Gnaeus Gellius, Lucius Frugi, Scaevola, Asellio, Julius Caesar, Livy, and Tacitus are required reading for anyone who wants to understand what life in that great empire was actually like.  For a further, more modern analysis of that era look no further than ""Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire"" by Simon Baker and ""The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" by Edward Gibbon. 

Next up should be a study of the Dark and Medieval Ages.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle should be first up followed by ""A History of Medieval Europe: From Constantine to St. Louis"" by R.H.C. Davis and ""The Civilization of the Middle Ages"" by Norman Cantor. Reading along with Churchill's ""A History of the English Speaking Peoples"" is also helpful.

The Renaissance is best studied with ""A Florentine Diary from 1450-1516"" by Luca Landucci, ""The Italian Renaissance"" by J.H. Plumb, ""The Book of the Courtier"" by Baldassare Castiglione, and ""The Sixteenth Century: 1485-1603"" by Patrick Collinson.  Finish up with ""The English Civil War"" by Martyn Bennett to connect the end of the Renaissance with the beginning of the next section, which is my favorite.

The Enlightenment.  You cannot read enough on this era for our modern concepts of government and personal freedom all come from this time.  Start with ""The Enlightenment: A Comparative Social History"" by Thomas Munck for a general understanding and then consume the history of the colonization of the Americas with ""Envisioning America: English Plans for the Colonization of North America 1580-1640"" and on to the War of Independence with ""The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution 1763-1789 by Robert Middlekauff.  Also refer to ""Empire: How Britain Made The Modern World"" by Niall Ferguson and ""The Rise and Fall of the British Empire"" by Lawrence James.  ""Jefferson and His Time"" by Dumas Malone is quite good and I would definitely point you towards ""The Federalist Papers"" by Alexander Hamilton.

For understanding America's transformation from backwater to world power, start with ""The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict"", go to ""The Conquest of a Continent"" by Madison Grant and then to ""A Country of Vast Designs"" by Robert W. Berry.  For the Civil War read Bruce Catton's collection.  It has never been bettered, in my opinion.  Reconstruction is a sore topic for myself and, like most things, the books written by academics in their ivory towers do not correlate with the feelings of the people who lived through Carpetbagger and Negro governance and vengeance.  Off the top of my head I would say read ""The Prostrate State: South Carolina Under Negro Government"" by James S. Pike.

For the 1900s up to the present I can recommend ""The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914"" by Christopher Clark, ""Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy"" by Eric Weitz, ""Crisis, Revolution, and Russian Jews"" by Jonathan Frankel, ""Two Hundred Years"" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn (if you can read German or Russian), ""The Rulers of Russia"" by Denis Fahey, ""Mein Kampf"" by Der Fuhrer, Churchill's histories of the Second World War, ""Crusade in Europe"" by Eisenhower, ""War As I Knew It"" by George S. Patton, ""The Gulag Archipelago"" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, ""Great Britain, the Jews, and Palestine"" by Samuel Landman, and John Lewis Gaddis' works on the Cold War.

Philosophy - Start with what the majority of the world now believes.  Read both Old and New Testaments, the Talmud, the Koran, the Vedas, and the Tipitaka.  Now, devour the useful things.  You should be at the very least passingly familiar with anything by Plato, Aristotle, Xenophanes, Pythagoras, Socrates, Cicero, and Seneca.  Next read ""The Wealth of Nations"" by Adam Smith, ""Economic Essays"" by David Hume, Locke's ""Two Treatises of Government"", ""An Essay Concerning Human Understanding"", and ""Some Thoughts Concerning Education"", Voltaire's ""Zadig"", ""Candide"", and ""Dictionnaire Philosophique"", and Thomas Paine's ""Thoughts on Government"", ""The Age of Reason"", and ""Rights of Man"".

Mathematics - You should at least be capable of high school level algebra and geometry.  Only you can decide what is relevant to your life and profession after grasping those.

Science - As race realists, a college-level understanding of biology is a must and basic chemistry can be useful for any number of things...

Languages - You should gain at the least a rudimentary ability to read Ancient Greek and Latin.  Some of the greatest works of their periods are best read in the native tongue.  You should also look to gain fluency in a modern European language with German, French, and Russian being the most useful in my opinion.

If you were to buy all of the books I recommended you would be far more well-rounded and much less saddled with debt than your fellow students who keep filling American Marxism's greatest training facilities.

A distant relative of mine is on welfare. It pays her enough so that she doesn't starve and doesn't have to go outside naked. She doesn't go on vacations, lives in a shithole rent-stabilized apartment in a bad part of town, eats shit processed food because she can't afford the healthy stuff, drives a beat up old wreck of a car that was a cheap POS when it was new, and is in deep, deep shit any time any problem happens, even if it's as cheap as needing spark plugs. It's certainly not a standard of living that I would aspire to, and I would definitely be looking for work to make more, were I on welfare.

I will grant you this: Some people abuse the system and will just sit back and live in lazy squalor while taking the government check. That's undeniable. But every system gets abused by outliers. Some cops shoot innocent people. Some lawyers prosecute people they know are innocent just to add notches to their belt. Some doctors steal narcotics from the dispensary.

The fact that a system is abused is not an indication that the system should be scrapped. It's an indication that the individuals abusing the system should be punished and no longer allowed to benefit from the system.

What always amazes me in these ""some people abuse welfare and therefore we should get rid of it!"" arguments is that no one was calling for making corporations illegal when BP destroyed the Gulf of Mexico's fishing industry through blatant negligence and greed-based corner cutting. 

The sentiment was to punish BP, not make General Motors illegal because one corporation abused the system.

The mind boggles as to why people who wouldn't think of dismantling the corporate charter system just because some (frankly, many) corporations flagrantly abuse it, are so fast to scream that we must disband welfare just because some individuals abuse it.

Europeans who would die for their club or the average casual American subs that don't even visit this place more than once a week?

I know these numbers may be too complicated for you to comprehend, but believe me, it's appalling how few Europeans here actually grasp the concept that Americans aren't arriving in droves to upvote and gilde shit banter like ""hurr durr muricans r fat retards"" (which got over 1000 upvotes btw). But then again, after what I've seen on /r/soccer today, I shouldn't be surprised that a lot of you are snobby imbeciles who have such pathetic lives they need to shit on foreign fans to feel, even for just a moment, that they are superior to some random stranger on the internet.

TL;DR: you and people like you are imbeciles who incessantly whine about Americans on a site you constantly accuse of being American-dominated. If you are so annoyed by Americans then why come to a place you keep saying is full of them? Just leave then you miserable cunt",t3_3116fe,t1_cpxypez,1427910464,False,cpy0f07,t1_cpy0f07

Excerpt:

&gt; Saint-Germain traveled extensively throughout Europe over the next 40 years - and in all that time never seemed to age. Those who met him were impressed by his many abilities and peculiarities:
&gt; 
&gt; * He could play the violin like a virtuoso.
&gt; 
&gt; * He was an accomplished painter.
&gt;  
&gt; * Wherever he traveled, he set up an elaborate laboratory, presumably for his alchemy work.
&gt; 
&gt; * He seemed to be a man of great wealth, but was not known to have any bank accounts. (If it was due to his ability to transmute base metals into gold, he never performed the feat for observers.)
&gt; 
&gt; * He dined often with friends because he enjoyed their company, but was rarely seen to eat food in public. He subsisted, it was said, on a diet of oatmeal.
&gt; 
&gt; * He prescribed recipes for the removal of facial wrinkles and for dyeing hair.
&gt; 
&gt; * He loved jewels, and much of his clothing - including his shoes - were studded with them.
&gt; 
&gt; * He had perfected a technique for painting jewels.
&gt; 
&gt; * He claimed to be able to fuse several small diamonds into one large one. He also said he could make pearls grow to incredible sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; * He has been linked to several secret societies, including the Rosicrucians, Freemasons, Society of Asiatic Brothers, the Knights of Light, the Illuminati and Order of the Templars.
&gt; 
&gt; The renowned 18th philosopher, Voltaire - himself a respected man of science and reason - said of Saint-Germain that he is ""a man who never dies, and who knows everything.""",t3_312eem,t3_312eem,1427910935,False,cpy0pkd,t1_cpy0pkd

In the first year, “s” will replace the soft “c.” Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy.


The hard “c” will be dropped in favour of “k.” This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.


There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome “ph” will be replaced with “f.” This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter.


In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.


Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.

&gt;But I suppose Syriza's electoral platform was a lie.

Of course it was.

&gt;If being in the eurozone is so important to you that you will accept austerity even though you don't agree that it works, then don't be surprised if austerity is what you get!

Some austerity (or perhaps more accurately, some of the measures that are currently being packaged as ""austerity"") is something Greece has desperately needed for decades. 

&gt;It seems something of a shame for Greek democracy, when the explicit electoral platform of Syriza was an end to austerity and Syriza won a massive majority.

It is entirely irrelevant to Greek democracy. There were elections in Greece, the parties that got the highest percentages are in power, those parties are, by and large, sticking to their electoral promises. Democracy is fine in Greece. It just doesn't get to dictate policy to the rest of the EU.

&gt;In that case all I can say is welcome to permanent austerity.

Nothing is ever permanent. At some point change will come. Greece doesn't need to leave the euro to make sure of that. It needs to continue pleading its case, cultivate better working relationships and negotiate a better deal.

this is the problem with all these studies. Higher immigration from places in eastern Europe undercuts the lowest earners, people that struggle through as Kitchen porters, shop assistants, and labourers, this allows for employers to get people who are willing to work for less for a longer time, that improves profits and is a net gain for the economy.

The reason why immigration helps create new jobs is because forces younger people to train to higher levels, this is why you know need more qualifications to work your way up through labouring that what an accountant needed twenty years ago, having a better educated workforce means more business can compete. In the long run everyone wins. (Immigrants are unlikely to work their way up, but their children are born as full British/Irish citizens and have no language barriers, or gaps in education.)

Everyone wins except for the typical Belfast scally who spent 10 years doing dishes for minimum wage before someone was able to undercut her wage. someone who is incapable of retraining and is unable to find work because she cannot remain competitive, and has to spend the rest of her life living off the state.

This is why countries that have recently started to attract more Immigrants are having knee-jerk reaction racists, because as much as immigration helps a country, it does it replacing people who already struggle.",t3_311hdq,t1_cpy0rbc,1427912425,False,cpy1mmk,t1_cpy1mmk

**Firm cancels Belgian Jewish kindergarten’s insurance due to 'high risk' of anti-Semitic attack**

*'It's an absolute disgrace that the situation has come to this,' says Rabbi Menachem Margolin, director of the European Jewish Association and of the Rabbinical Center of Europe.*





An insurance company has refused to renew the policy of a Jewish kindergarten in Brussels, claiming that the risk of doing so is too high, given the clear threat of anti-Semitic attacks.

The European Jewish Kindergarten, whose enrollment usually ranges from 20-30 children, is located in the same district as the European Union headquarters.

A spokesperson for the European Jewish Association, a federation of Jewish organizations on the continent, reports, “The insurance agent contacted us a few days ago with the unpleasant news that the insurance company we’ve worked with up to now is not prepared to extend the kindergarten’s insurance policy, in the current situation, due to the high risk entailed by a Jewish institution.”

Asked how the kindergarten can resume operations after the Passover break, the spokesperson replied, “The agent we work with has also just gone on vacation and he’s away from Belgium right now – but we will certainly keep looking for an insurance company that will agree to provide us with a policy. In the meantime, we are also calling on European governments to make sure that this issue of protecting the Jews in their countries stays on the agenda. The refusal to insure a kindergarten just because it is Jewish should sound loud alarms for all of Europe’s leaders and stir them to take action.”

“It’s an absolute disgrace that the situation has come to this,” said Rabbi Menachem Margolin, director of the European Jewish Association and of the Rabbinical Center of Europe, in a statement to the media. “First, not enough is being done to secure Jewish institutions in Europe despite the repeated requests and numerous warnings – and consequently insurance companies are using the situation to avoid the risk of insuring Jewish kindergartens. What a surreal and cynical reality.”

The refusal to insure the kindergarten comes less than a year after the terror attack at the Brussels Jewish Museum, in which a French jihadist opened fire at the museum entrance, killing four people including an Israeli couple. That attack in May 2014, followed by the January killings at the kosher supermarket in Paris, have prompted insurance companies to regard Jewish institutions as high risk.

The JMBox 26650 Arrived today. Stabilized 26650 mod with a SX350 chip.

Price: $375ish ( I got it off the list - https://www.facebook.com/groups/648955198565846/)

Been using it for the last couple of hours, so these are my initial impressions

* Packaging was nice, always a fan of a keepable box
* Mod arrived undamaged, pay for fast EMS out of Europe people, this took forever
* Wood is very nice
* Mod is very nicely made, no chips/burrs/scratches etc
* Internals look nice enough down the tube
* Wish the battery adjustment pin was adjustable from the outside of the mod, not just inside. I tried removing it and threading it out -&gt; in , but it didn't work
* Functions fine

I'm not a big fan of the fire button. Using one of the little dome switches instead of a antivandal is just not to my tastes. My wife likes it ( been rocking hana mini's for a while as her backup mod ), but I way prefer a antivandal

USB port is nice ( Droid C1S2 doesn't have one ) for charging/upgrading

And the 26650... I'm still not sold on this, I own 3, have 2 more coming eventually, but I'm thinking I'm an 18650 man... the battery life is great, I just prefer the feel of the 18650 and 26650 is fucking big to stick in your pocket.

In general - not bad, if you don't mind the switch it's a decent stabilized box mod, and they are coming out with an 18650 if you prefer that.",t3_313dih,t3_313dih,1427914322,False,cpy2t4g,t1_cpy2t4g

HAHAHA. Notice the stretching of logic, folks. Utterly desperate. No facts, no logic, just weird and bizarre segues. no fella. There is no [common market of services](http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/services/index_en.htm), only goods. You would know this if you weren't an ideologue.

Well, that's patently obvious lol. They are your 'impartial' evidence are they? Lol. Brilliant. Keep it coming Orcnick, your argument is hilarious.

&gt; Which means giving in to REGULATIONS.

Which means it EFFECTS ONLY THE GOODS YOU ARE SELLING TO THE RECIPIENT. Comprende, yet? It aint difficult. I mean, it really isn't

&gt; Now your just being stupid.... you don't even try to argue the point.

You just said the EU helps us COexist, as if we struggle with this re countries not in the EU. It is the kind of stupid cliched bollocks, you hear from the EU ideological acolytes.

&gt; Only if UK and EU have agreement to have Visas,

As we do. lol. Japan, America, Oz, CAnada, SKorea, even China, Israel, Mexico, Chile, India, South Africa, Brazil, the list is endless. So that non-issue has been ticked off.

&gt; Also you know its hard to get a Visa right? 

Yep you need a skill to offer the country. ope, unlikely that you can become a waiter. That is good.

&gt; The thing is you don't even have arguments more like jibes.

I have rebutted absolutely everything. You are yet to come up with anything beyond cliches, 'coexistence', 'need visas', 'how do you trade?' 'catastrophe', 'the discredited CBI says so'. Everything rebutted. 

&gt; There must be economic value.

Or the ideological value. No idea why but it is out of step with the public init. Only corporations and politicans, not the most persuasive combo is it.

&gt; No and I guess that is why I won't be able to convince you about the EU

Because I believe in freedom of choice, and you don't? If Scots want to leave, let them. 

&gt;  you don't care about other people,

That was the last straw. I decided to look for another host.
Fast forward two weeks, i narrowed my choice to [Rosehosting](https://rosehosting.com) and another one from Europe.
It was touch and go until the end, but i felt more trust in Rosehosting after talking with one of their representatives and they said that migration of all my data will be done by them, for free.  Additionally, i didn't find a single bad review for them in all the reputable review websites.
I signed up with them, they migrated my websites, emails and databases, they configured caching in the server which increased my websites speed enormously.

The Iraqis were utterly incapacitated by the coalition air forces pounding them for months before the fighting on the ground even began.

It's so cliched that I can't tell if your comment is a canned response or not.

&gt;It's the truth.

It's an Catholic friendly interpretation of a period of European history.  As you mentioned, they were big on institutions. Guess what, they wrote good things about themselves.

If you want to see how friendly the Church was to science, start with: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum

Now you're going to say that they had these nice libraries and there were rare books there!  Well, yes, they had libraries where they hoarded books and kept them secret, and occasionally burned them, with some exceptions for those who wanted to do apologetic practice against those old crazy pagans. 

Universities, schools, yes. And all of them with indoctrination into Catholicism and into how great the Church is. I'm sure this wouldn't impart some type of Catholic bias in historians of that era... nope.

&gt;It's just as ignorant as a religious extremist hating scientific institutions for whatever reason.

I'm just going to ignore that line because you clearly didn't think about it much.

&gt;That goes for understanding history too. 

It's not history, too, it's all history. Actual science (with methods and peer review) actually started pretty recently. What you had before is called [protoscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience).  

What you had in medieval times was *the institution with money and power* funding some experiments. You see, science, even primitive science, is expensive. It needs money and free time. Royalty usually had some money to give, especially for research in war tools. The Church had money, prestige, exclusive libraries and plenty of monks who didn't have to be slaves or serfs; they made wines (and bred grape vines), they made beers, they grew fish and sheep and so on, and among those there were a few who did some research. 

What you do not seem to get about it is that the research is done in spite of the traditions, in spite of the status quo.  This is what happens when you have a large, society-wide institution; it happens all the time... withing a large group, you get divisions. The regressives, the progressives'; the conservatives, the liberals; the traditionalists, the reformers.  The regressives, conservatives and traditionalists will always be at the core and hold the prestige of tradition, because that's how traditions are kept over time, over generations, they are the ones that truly represent the institution. The others are just pushing from the outside for some slow progress. 

To say that science and faith are reconcilable is like saying that Christianity and adultery can go together, because many Christians are also adulterers. This is the big problem with religious beliefs. The popular ones will always be traditional, in order to survive; they will make claims with 100% certainty and that guarantees incompatibility with science. No lasting religion can remain friendly with science, because science changes, progresses  and can turn old ideas upside down, while those same ideas remain sacred in a religion. And any religion that is that plastic will simply die out, thin out, dissolve. 

&gt;and culture thrived

There's a reason the Enlightenment age is so relevant. It was something that happened on many levels...  on one, there was more wealth around, so more people, lesser royalty, more nobles and so on had interests in investing in research (and in art), it was no longer just something the Church could do.  What also happened that was important was people starting to bypass all that Church history and books and theology and re-discovering older writings; this was revolutionary change, not just ""actively endorsing bla bla"". For a relevant example, see [a history of a philosophy that was much closer to science than any religious reformist](http://www.epicurus.net/en/history.html#D); this one was re-adopted in the Enlightenment era.


&gt;The man who proposed the big bang theory,Georges Lemaître, was a Catholic priest.

The poor guy was trying to prove God existed, but only managed to show the expansion. Many believers, due to having their mind shit on by theologians, believe that the science of the origins of the universe is the same as the science of its expansion. You can get a basic idea on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony), and I must mention that none of the current theories suggest that there was any being that did any act of creation. 

And in case it's not clear how much pseudoscience there is with the Catholic stories about evolution, go here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution

Here's a history lesson, the British, French, and Russians wanted to do to Germany exactly what they did after WWI, at the end of WWII. The US prevented them from doing this and instead of demanding reparations, the US rebuilt Germany's economy for free, and the economies of many other nations.

The problem is, the more people you invite in, the more opinions you get on everything. Let's say NASA and the ESA were combined. On paper, that sounds great. But let's say NASA continues to be funded at $18 billion from US taxpayers and the ESA gets their $4-6 billion from European taxpayers.

The US might say - well shit, we're paying way too much, you guys need to pay more.

Europe might say ""fine"" but then France and Germany say ""no way, we don't want to pay"" in which case the UK has to step up and shoulder more of the burden.

But then the UK's voters are unhappy, and threaten to withdraw from the ESA, etc.

The same crises going on over the EuroZone and all that would be brought into NASA, an agency that doesn't want to deal with more politics - now at the international level, where the US government has no power over other's desires for funding.

Mainly the west wanted autonomous democratic nations set up in Eastern Europe after they ousted Germany (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Charter), FDR and Churchill both agreed on this ideology for the treatment of any colonized or oppressed nations after the war. SO that's where the Western Allies stood regarding eastern Europe. 

Russia- Stalin possessed an extreme distrust of the west and therefore was not inclined to believe that they did not desire war against USSR, I think many historians would agree that part of his desire for gaining control of eastern European states would be to create a buffer zone between the west and his actual nation in case of invasion. Stalin had already set his sights on eastern Europe prior to war with Germany (look up- Molotov-Ribbentrop pact). This agreement decided that Germany and Russia would not fight each other and this allowed Russia to begin annexing eastern European states unabated. When it comes to his disagreements with the allies 1941-1946, I believe he simply wanted for his nation what had already previously been agreed upon. 

That being said there are a few other considerations concerning the disputes over the future of eastern Europe between the big three
1) Ideology-both wanted their own spread around the world
2) Economic- West wanted capitalistic democracies to tie into their growing global network of economies/ Soviets needed the resources and manpower
3) Investment of time and manpower of Liberation- The Soviets fought an intensely brutal campaign on the eastern front to push the Germans back, they lost millions of people and countless pieces of wartime production. The soviets felt entitled to keeping the territories they had liberated ( this also ties in with the economic reason stated above!)

* Huey P. Long - While I don't usually find much I agree on with American politicians, Huey Long is an exception. His economic views of Every Man a King were, for the most part, exactly like mine. Especially when it comes to limiting wealth and raising the standard of living for the minimum wage worker. I don't know about his other political or social views, but for economics, he's great.

My list is short and I'd like to add to it. If anyone has any suggestions for learning about the economic views of the Third Position (Syndicalism, Corporatism, National Socialism), that would be great. ",t3_313ks6,t3_313ks6,1427928693,False,cpyb1t0,t1_cpyb1t0

Source? That seems remarkably low, especially compared to European nations.

Hell, even in non-industrialised countries at the time, women worked in many jobs at the same rate as men (usually cottage industry or light labour).

I find it extremely unlikely the number was below 40-50%.

&gt;Women were not allowed to vote in U.S. Federal elections until 1921, and many states didn't ratify the 19th Amendment until the 1960s and 70s. 

Can I also get some proof of this as well? I find it extremely unlikely it would take that long, especially as late as the 70's.

&gt;If women had property rights, why were laws passed in the 1840s and 1850s for each state that addressed the rights of married women (generally called the Married Women's Property Acts - might want to read them)? 

And were they enforced? Most countries had property rights. Very few, if any, actually bothered to enforce them. The reason so many governments (In europe mostly, but also elsewhere) just threw them aside (all unopposed, by the way) was because they linked back to an archaic law system which didnt have the benefits of police forces, dedicated investigators or advanced analysis.

Womens property was *considered under law* (and those are the key words there) part of the mans property as, and this dates back thousands of years, as the one best able to *protect* said possessions would have most likely have been the man (physically superior and all that) and as there were very few (if any) laws partaining to the protection of the person (as they were unenforceable due to a lack of the aforementioned police forces, dedicated investigators or advanced analysis), the law system was based around property and how to protect that.

Which is why everything that just so happened to not be a young, fit human male was *considered* property under the law. This does not mean that women didnt own anything. In fact, on the subject of internal power, women ruled.

In short, women had internal power (they ruled the household (men had to ask permission just like anyone else to do anything, evidence of this can be found in Homers 'The Iliad'; Women also ruled their husbands/families lands and businesses and helm sway over the families/couples finances and who they employed as servents/slaves etc), men had external power (mainly because external power (kings, knights, lords, chiefs, warlords etc) usually came hand in hand with being a warrior/soldier, which males are better suited for).

&gt;Most of your assertions apply to MUCH later in the century or other countries, at best. You are having trouble keeping to the time period in question, which is the 1830s.

Your right, as I thought the article was about Britain, which was completely different in almost every way regarding this issue. Only on my third read did I see the word 'Connecticut'. Oops.

On the hand of the time, i am keeping to the same era, but just for other nations, which seemed to be far ahead of the US in this subject.....",t3_30u0dc,t1_cpx9cz8,1427928868,False,cpyb5br,t1_cpyb5br

* Cravats, which are the precursor of the modern neck tie, originated from Eastern European mercenaries in the 17th century in modern day Croatia.

* Chelsea boots were made for the use of Queen Victoria in her horse riding, hence the elastic for ease of putting it on and taking it off.

* Chelsea boots are sometimes are called 'Beatle boots' because the Beatles wore them a lot. This popularisation is foremost in American than Europe.

* A goodyear welt - a construction method of welted footwear - is named after the inventor Charles Goodyear.

* The company H&amp;S stands for 'Hennes and Mauritz'. It does not in fact mean his and him in Swedish. Hennes means 'her' but the word 'Mauritz' comes from a fishing tackle and shooting shop which the founder of H&amp;M bought during the 1960s.

* In the European fashion market the main contenders are H&amp;M and Zara. Both business-wise are completely different. H&amp;M is a forward vertically integrated company meaning it only owns it's transportation network and contracts all it's clothing factories. Zara is a backwards vertically integrated company in that it owns all it's clothing factories.

* Uniqlo in it's expansion business plan is aggressively targeting the USA by adapting to the model of frequent sales and offers. This model does not exist or used to the extent found in the USA in Europe, South-East Asia or the companies native Japan.

* The biggest and wealthiest clothing group is a Inditex which is Spanish.

* Off-the-rack clothing which is produced by standardised machines only gained a larger proportion of clothing produced in the 1950s-60s. Before that made-to-measure clothing, in which tailors had standard 'patterns' or outlines for clothing which they then altered to fit, was the norm.

Drivers can be quite crazy, especially compared to North America. Driving in Europe is much more intense in general than driving in North America. Drivers are generally more skilled so they take more risks and drive more aggressively. In Albania, this reaches an extreme level, as drivers will often disregard traffic laws altogether. You may even see people running red lights, or driving in incoming traffic. 

While this has been improving over the last decade, as of last year (last time I visited Tirana and Saranda), you may still see some of this craziness. Generally, it's become less common for drivers to do some of the more crazy things (like driving in oncoming lane to pass traffic), but speeding and overly aggressive driving is still very common, especially in crowded cities like Tirana and Saranda.

If you have no experience with Albanian traffic, or any experience driving in Europe, I wouldn't recommend driving yourself. Furthermore, taxi prices can be comparable to car rental prices if you don't plan on making too many stops along the way (car rental will be more expensive than usual if you drop off the car in another city). If you are a very skilled driver though, and you think you can deal with this craziness then you might just be OK, as long as you always expect the worst (and maybe watch some YouTube videos of the crazy driving lol).

That being said from a logical standpoint, it makes *sense* for Russia to invade Ukraine. They were increasingly trying to join NATO and align themselves with the West, and it was looking like NATO was seriously going to consider it this time. A geopolitically opposed nation on the Russian border? Fat fucking chance that they'd allow that, not after Napoleon and the Nazis invaded from the West. Besides, even if there wasn't an invasion coming, a Western nation on Russia's doorstep could only increase tensions all around. 

The problem here is that Russia's response was *way* too strong. The amount of support they are giving the Ukrainian rebels calls into question how much of that separatist movement is actually Ukrainian and how much is of it is Russian astroturfing. 

That, and the majority of Ukrainians in favor of staying aligned with the Russian Republic reside in the East, while most of Ukraine's economic activity is in the West, where there was a shitload more support for aligning with the EU and NATO. Previous Russian activity in Crimea suggests that Russia will try to seize all of Ukraine, not just the East where they have their support. But the West isn't sure if they'll stop there. Will this ""revolution"" spread to other former Soviet states as Russia tries to regain its superpower status and rebuild the USSR? We can't know, but because a lot of those former states are now members of NATO, this could lead to a major military confrontation between the East and the West. 

Russia is playing with fire. So far, the lingering uncertainty about the nature of the Ukrainian civil war has kept major Western intervention from entering into the picture, but we are starting to deploy troops into Eastern Europe, and the charade cannot delay confrontation forever.

Iraq, comparatively, was a relatively unimportant country, and our reasons for going there, and the fact that we *were* going there were out in the open.

Resolution 1327 (2003) of the Council of Europe states that:[65]

""The Assembly notes that whilst so-called “honour crimes” emanate from cultural and not religious roots and are perpetrated worldwide (mainly in patriarchal societies or communities), the majority of reported cases in Europe have been amongst Muslim or migrant Muslim communities (although Islam itself does not support the death penalty for honour-related misconduct).""",t3_313w42,t1_cpyd6yu,1427933498,False,cpydlip,t1_cpydlip

A skilled jazz trumpeter with a classical background, ElSaffar has created new techniques to play microtones and ornaments that are idiomatic to Arabic music but are not typically heard on the trumpet. Additionally, he is an acknowledged performer of the classical Iraqi maqam tradition, and performs actively in the US, Europe and the Middle East as a vocalist and santur player. As a composer, ElSaffar has used the microtones found in maqam music to create a unique approach to harmony and melody, establishing himself as an important voice in an age of cross-cultural music making. — [Pi Recordings](http://pirecordings.com/artist/Amir_ElSaffar)

&gt;__April Fools' Day__ (sometimes called __April Fool's Day__ or __All Fools' Day__) is celebrated every year on the first day of April as a day when people play [practical jokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) and [hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax) on each other. The jokes and their victims are known as ""April fools"". Hoax stories may be reported by the press and other media on this day and explained on subsequent days. Popular since the 19th century, the day is not a [national holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday) in any country, but it is well known in India, Canada, Europe, Australia, Brazil and the United States.

how is this even posibil when the most jews did flew from poland, and the nazis before the war even sponsored and fund companies that would get jews out of germany and europea?

So the jews knew evil hitler hated them, but still 90% still stayed in poland? Interesting.

&gt; Sure, he gassed millions and millions and tried to gas nearly every single one, but he failed so he couldn't have hated the Jews that much right?

Hitler gased millions? I am pretty sure not even jews would believe this. 

And what is this alien talk, you are the one that believes every war propaganda. 

Who did build the gas chammbers in ausschwitz remind me again? The germans or the russians?

1432147641,0,t5_2qh3l,,,0,False,,,news,0,1,1,isakandar_al_akbar,False,"Your economy is based on extraction and agriculture.  This is done on a large scale in California too.  But we are completely and utterly a service economy, much more so than Texas.  A closer equivalent would be Pennsylvania or New York. 

SF is very arid. They have very little of their own water, and get most of it from over 100 miles away. You probably thought it wasn't because they have terrible weather.  But actually, they don't have their own water, they get it from the Sierras.

But the main point is that, unlike Texas, agriculture is not a significant portion of the State's GDP, which, again unlike Texas, is in the top 10 in the world (about the size of Russia). Our population is overwhelmingly urban, much more so than Texas, at least for now, and our economy is built around real estate appreciation (people want to live here) and technology.  A huge portion of the GDP growth of the united States has been from California based companies like Apple.  Agriculture may make some people money, and it may even be an integral part of the economy in Texas, which is even more leveraged toward cattle than California.  But it doesn't benefit us as a a whole, and frankly we're being taken advantage of.  Keeping the cost of factory beef low is not worth anything, it has an adverse environmental and social impact.  In fact most big ag practices should be banned just for cruelty/public safety.  But the water issue is much more pressing, as it affects human lives.

Your assessment of the groundwater levels needed to sustain lawns is accurate enough, but it rests on an assumption that the major dam projects should divert water to agriculture rather than real estate and parks, which are just much more profitable in the long term.  California is one of the most popular tourist destinations for all the big markets: Europe, Japan, and China.  With the proper allocation of resources, those numbers could easily be doubled.  I'm talking about reducing agriculture to the level of East Coast states, a complete overhaul of the water distribution system towards urban centers, and general investment in public infrastructure like schools, which have the potential to raise property values and create service jobs, which are the only jobs we should be trying to create more of.  

Agriculture and mining account for 2% of California's GDP, and the financial services that control the futures markets for these industries are often based in other states like Texas, Illinois, New York depending on the sector, which means they don't really provide Californians as many jobs as you would think.  

You're right about farmers' access to the water, it was all dammed and distributed during the New Deal as a way to spur the economy. I guess it sort of worked for a while, but the state had less than a quarter of its current population. Labor costs are also obviously much lower than most states, though this is true for all the border states. 

My main point is that we shouldn't force people to change their water habits until we've addressed the much bigger issue of statewide water distribution toward agriculture, which is not profitable.  The money that could be gathered from the same water being diverted into more sustainable conurbations with developed public services would dwarf what it could produce from agriculture. Californians and Texans can accommodate a moderate rise in the price of food.  So can, I think, most Americans. Will it mean that companies like Kraft and McDonalds will be less profitable, possibly even unsustainable? Of course, but that worries me not in the slightest.

I really don't see valuelessness in green grass, I'm afraid to say.  Real estate is not comparable to Texas, where you can get a mansion for what it would cost to buy a low-end condo in SF.  Our mansions, which are often densely packed in areas like Beverly Hills, Atherton, and Pasadena, many of them worth 5-10 million, each generate a huge amount of property tax revenue. There are loopholes that need to be shut, but investing in green spaces has done a lot more for the economy than agriculture, who have their own loopholes, and, if you drive through the state, are some of the only green places. Much more grass (oat and alphalpha) is grown to sustain cattle than is used for personal lawns.  While lawns can be very wasteful and are made of non-native grasses, they can often add a lot of property value.  The same is true with the irrigation of trees, which is often only sustained by the irrigation of lawns.  These trees will die in areas where this is the case and where legislation has demanded cutbacks on lawn irrigation, and property values will correspondingly go down in those areas, often significantly.  Tackling this issue, Californians have decided they need special irrigation systems for the trees, which means that the amount of water you're saving on lawns goes way down.  The system as it was wasn't broken.  I didn't vote for Jerry Brown (the one field I left blank on my ballot because there were no palatable candidates) and it pisses me off when he talks to me like I'm stupid. I live in an apartment in a city and don't really use much water or have a lawn, but I object  to the idea that these agricultural companies are more important than our lawns. I'm also afraid that I do see valuelessness in cattle and agriculture, at least when it comes at the expense of development.  It's profitable for a few people, yeah, and it's probably a fun job being a rancher, but 2%!!?? That includes mining and oil extraction.  And we're talking about a state that, if you drive through it, you will be made immediately aware that agriculture is almost all we do.  Well, Mexicans without political rights actually do all the work, but California is one giant farm, basically. On the other hand, one square mile of San Francisco generates more capital than all that agriculture combined, and every person and institution involved in generating that capital consumes much less water than agriculture.  As a society we don't eat healthily. I'm not a health nut, I don't eat healthily. But if McDonalds cost twice as much, I'd probably just eat less meat and it wouldn't be a big deal.  On the occasion I did have a burger, it would be much more expensive but much better.  And I'd be buying it because I wanted a hamburger, not because of economic and convenience factors.

Basically, we're an adult country now. It took a while to set everything up, but now we need the kind of government that has the interests of its people, the Californian people, at heart.  Not the overall dominance of the democratic party within the United States.  Texas is in a similar situation, and I believe both states should start thinking about adopting a more autonomous government structure within the US. Obviously this would be unprecedented, but I think it's time to set the precedent.  The power corridor between Boston and DC seems to be all that matters to anyone in national media or political power. I see no need for those people, they're just making our lives worse.  They have no connection to the land out west, which is the basis for any national identity.  I appreciate the founding fathers and Plymouth Rock, but I'm just not from there. My ancestors, sure, and technically I was born in one of the original 13, but I'm not trying to let these carpetbaggers turn my life into some Hollywood disaster movie.  People who come from California and Texas have to start realizing that the people who ""represent"" them care much more about the aforementioned money corridor than they do about the actual states of Texas and California. It doesn't matter what party they belong to.  For all their talk, Texas politicians really haven't done much for the people of Texas.  Like Texas, our interests as a state don't seem to be in line with those of the federal government.  This gap will continue to widen unless it's addressed.",t3_3137bv,t1_cpycvpi,1427941039,False,cpyhi1g,t1_cpyhi1g

However, it appears ten words have been [deciphered](http://stephenbax.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voynich-a-provisional-partial-decoding-BAX.pdf) by a British researcher: Taurus, Coriander, Centaurea, Chiron, Hellebore Nigella Sativa, Kesar and Cotton (*an [illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7Rfqm12.jpg) of the word cotton.*)

The paper's author, Prof. Dax, also advanced *a cultural extinction theory* for the language the manusccript was written in.

&gt;This  precedent  suggests  that  the  Voynich  script could  have  been created  by  a  small  group  wishing  to encode  a  previously  unwritten  language or  dialect.  This  could be  done,  as  in  the case  of  Glagolitic
, by borrowing and  adapting signs from  other  scripts  and  devising  others as  needed. This  group  could  then have attempted to use  that  script  to write  down  a  body  of  knowledge about  plants,  the  stars  and  so  on drawing  on classical  and  other  authorities, in what  we now know  as the  Voynich  manuscript,  only  then for the culture to die out or disappear.

Given that the 15th century was a time of upheaval, in Europe in the Balkans, in the Near East with Timurid expansion as far as Turkey and the Black Sea, and also with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans 
in 1453, it is plausible to consider this ‘cultural extinction’ to be a possibility,  with  the  group  in  question
developing a  script  and  literacy,  only  for  it  to  be  extinguished. Other examples of script which have been devised, only for those who can read it to die out include the interesting Rongorongo script from Easter Island, which again attests to the viability of the theory. This does not mean that the language  itself was extinguished of course;  it is possible that related dialects are still in existence.

1432148183,0,t5_2qh0u,,,0,False,,,pics,0,1,1,IntoTheWest,False,"""As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ""high"" speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let's just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn't previously seen.
So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ""What was the slowest you ever flew in the Blackbird?"" This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.
I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 flypast. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.
Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from the 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet, there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field.
Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us, but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point, we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was), the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.
Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 flypast he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet's hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ""breathtaking"" very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.
As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there—we hadn't spoken a word since ""the pass."" Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ""One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?"" Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ""One hundred fifty-two."" We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ""Don't ever do that to me again!"" And I never did.
A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer's Club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 flypast that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ""It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane."" Impressive indeed.
Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It's ironic that people are interested in how slow the world's fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it's always a good idea to keep that cross-check up...and keep your Mach up, too.""

But that we're bred with different temperaments, so to speak. Now genetics can account for things like the greater production of testosterone in Africans than Europeans and Asians. I believe African Americans suffer something like twice the average rate of prostate cancer. And high testosterone has been linked to low IQ.

[Glad you mentioned chimps! Here’s a clarification on their similarity, and why genetics is more complicated than people seem to think](https://answersingenesis.org/genetics/dna-similarities/greater-than-98-chimphuman-dna-similarity-not-any-more/). On the topic of testosterone – [the ‘elevated levels’ thing is funny, consider there’s evidence elevated testosterone is linked to higher intelligence]( http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/03/14/testosterone-hormone-linked-to-higher-iq/24379.html), though that aside, no one has defined how much ‘elevated testosterone’ is really significant. For example, the [average male testosterone varies by more than 50% over the course of their life]( http://philipsburgpharmacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/testosterone_decline.gif), and [over the course of a day by about 40%](http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/image.cfm?archiveid=3389&amp;type=img&amp;name=striant-02.jpg).

&gt;Again, you're using ""intellect"" in the narrowest possible context. Now, I haven't heard you directly refute this point, so I assume we can both agree that, pre colonial African populations weren't as dense as European and Asian ones.

I’m using intellect the way you are – cognitive capacity. And we do not agree – I, as I stated elsewhere, believe all human populations have virtually identical cognitive capacity, or rather, greater cognitive variation exists between any two random humans than between any ethnicities. Just like the genetic variance.

&gt;Now is it unreasonable to say that a more condensed population would begin to adapt less aggressive, more, ah... empathetic traits? And is it so unreasonable that populations that remained spread out in small villages consisting mostly of family members across a vast continent, wouldn't find evolutionary advantage in selecting for a meeker, more compromising temperament?

Yes, it is unreasonable, especially because Europeans didn’t invent cities. Though, this is your claim – support it with evidence. By this logic, the most intelligent populations on the planet would be those who were forced into high population density places, which historically is not most of Europe.

&gt;Which link was that? I find it difficult to believe that every and all IQ and congantive tests are simply testing someone's SES. 
And 'environmental factors' is kiiiinda what I'm arguing here. 

That link was referring to the SAT. And ‘environmental factors’ are things like lead exposure, SES or hunger and stress (i.e., poverty).

&gt;I'd imagine the collective intelligence of the world has gone up quite a bit. But there is still a gap.

Which, as I showed you, can be explained by testing bias and SES.

&gt;Again, you're lacking nuance. Not every ""racist"" hates black folk. I don't hate people who are less ""intelligent"" than me, no matter the race. Now, I do have a problem with many black societies and cultures. But I think even you can see why I might. That isn't to say I hate anyone for reasons beyond their own control.

This is a fine and nuanced stance to claim, but it breaks down in the face of scrutiny – for example, you claim to not hate anyone for reasons beyond their control; what do you purport is ‘their control’? Is it their fault they were born into poverty and are denied the same opportunities as someone who wasn’t born into poverty? Is it their fault the judicial system is heavily biased against them? Is it their fault they couldn’t get a personal or business loan because of their skin color? I believe that you don’t wantonly hate black people, but I don’t think you’re willing to look at the racial disparity that exists in America objectively.

&gt;African populations faced a more physically demanding environment. The individuals survival depended more on the individual. Whereas denser populations, the individuals survival depended more on their cooperation with others.

I don’t think this is true in any sense of the word. You previously claimed that Africa was an easy environment, and that adapting didn’t require cognitive advancement, because ‘food was available year round’ (which isn’t true). Now you say it’s physically demanding, and individualistic instead of cooperative – this is simply not indicative of any reality in either anthropological or human history.

&gt;Obviously. But surely I don't have to tell you how most of the human population lives near coasts and waterways. Let's not be pedantic here.

I didn’t say most human populations live away from water ways, I disagreed with your claim that ‘most Californians live near the beach’. I don’t wager you were being literal, but you’ve put forth a number of untruths.

&gt;Not all. Sub Saharan, specifically. 

You mean everything south of the Sahara? That’s a lot of land, and a lot of peoples.

&gt;If we change the term ""intellectually"" to ""socially"" I can answer you better. The African population is well suited to living a more indegenous life. … People in Africa today live as they did a thousand years ago. Now, today, ""civilization"" is typically viewed through a western lense. The most impactful (and id say destrictive) of which is our tendency to live in large dense cities. For many populations, this is simply more of the same. For some (sub Saharan Africans, mainland Chinese, native north Americans, and aboriginal Australians in particular) this is a radical departure from their traditional societies. Therefore, these populations are less suited to modern society. 

But ‘intellectually’ and ‘socially’ aren’t interchangeable. You’ve not supported this ‘indigenous life’ claim of yours at all – I could just as easily say ‘Inuits were super social, and that’s why they’re the smartest people on the planet’, and have as much credibility as you do with that handwave.

People in Africa today live in all manner of environments, similarly to people all over the world – there are Africans who live in modern world class cities, smaller shittier cities, suburbs, and villages without electricity. The same thing can be said of every country on the planet. Civilization wasn’t invented by the West – I think it’s problematic to say ‘civiliation is viewed through a Western lens’, because I don’t think that’s saying much. Do you purport that Tokyo is a western city? What about Tibet? What about Mumbai? I think it’s problematic to assume that people in Africa are ‘less suited’ to living in ‘modern society’. 

&gt;Please, please, please grasp this. I'm tired of repeating it. Humans survivability in Africa was ""easier"" because humans adapted from our ape ancestors to survive specifically in Africa. Humans come from Africa. So the African climate is more conducize to basic human survival. Do you understand now????

This is an incorrect assumption, insofar as the notion of ‘African climate being best suited for humans’, because Africa has a lot of climates. Modern humans emerged from temperate to warm climates, which are not remotely limited to Africa, and most importantly, not remotely the only climate found in Africa. Now, you seem to be suggesting that ‘once the climate got tougher, man adapted, and that made man smarter than Africans’. How do you feel about Southern Africa? Are those people smarter than people who live in warm and temperate climes? Like, say, any landmass within the tropics? 

&gt;Yeah. And your point didn't refute that. Because marriage rates don't mean squat for sexual history. So that was me debunking that argument. 

Marriage is the best proxy we have to go by – presumably people marry those they’re attracted to, which is probably the people they have sex with. But find a different example to support your claim if you reject my evidence.

&gt;Which has been shown to be offset by education. Chicken, meet egg. 

[Except not! Education means higher potential earnings, but does not offset your birth SES!]( http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/13-facts-higher-education) This is a hugely problematic fact of America, that SES at birth is a SUPER strong indicator of your SES at death!

&gt;Define ""education"". And how it would relate to traditional African society versus traditional western society. Please. If you can do that I think you'll begin to see my point.

I don’t understand what you’re asking – I was talking about America, and it seems like you’re asking about education in third world countries? Please clarify, and I’ll answer.

&gt;I don't disagree with any of this. *except the low IQ =/= low education. That's.... That kind of the definition of low IQ, innit?? 

Sort of, though education isn’t something one receives because one has a high IQ, education is something one receives because you were born into a SES that allows for it. Einstein born into poverty is simply not going to get the education he received by virtue of his birth SES. [Identical twins show pretty big IQ differentials when raised differently, with low SES resulting in LARGER IQ variation.]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030320)

&gt;

&gt;The __Black War__ refers to the period of conflict between [British colonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) and [Tasmanian Aborigines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Aborigine) in the early nineteenth century.   Although historians vary on their definition of when the conflict began and ended, it is best understood as the officially sanctioned time of declared [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law) by the colonial government between 1828 and 1832.

&gt;The term *Black War* is also sometimes used to refer to other, later conflicts between European colonists and [Aboriginal Australians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aborigines) on mainland Australia. 

&gt;Mass killings of Tasmanian Aborigines were reported as having occurred as part of the Black War in [Van Diemen's Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land).  The accuracy of some of these reports was questioned in the 1830s by the British Government's Commission of Inquiry, headed by Archdeacon (later Bishop) William Broughton and in the 20th century by [historians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian), such as [N. J. B. Plomley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._J._B._Plomley) in the 1960s.  The controversy continued into the new millennium after historian [Keith Windschuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Windschuttle) in 2002 questioned the accuracy of accounts of massacres and high fatalities,  arousing intense controversy in Australia.

&gt;White people are the least numerous race in the world, but somehow there's the mentality that all countries mainly inhabited by white people should allow an unlimited amount of people from other countries to live there, because white countries are better off.

Actually, the amount of people (legally) allowed into ""white"" countries (which I'm assuming you mean western Europe, North America excluding Mexico, Australia, and NZ) is pretty strictly controlled; all these nations have a specific 'cap' on immigration and only allow a set number of immigrants in. Example, Canada takes in ~250,000 people each year.

The reality is that 'white' people in these countries are not reproducing enough, and white people from other countries are not immigrating enough, for the 'white' population to naturally sustain itself. Without fixing this growth deficit, the structure of these countries will collapse as the populations continue to shrink. Example, Japan, which is on the brink of a serious crisis b/c they're too xenophobic to open immigration and nationals are reproducing enough to sustain the population.

&gt;Then there's the point about colonialism and white privilege. I don't understand this point, every nation and race have pretty much been murderous bastards in the past, some more successful than others ... Africans killed other Africans, native Americans killed other native Americans etc. I don't see anything that would suggest that white people were more brutal than any people subjugated by the white people, white people were just more successful.

While its true that war is relatively universal (sadly), colonialism is *not war* but rather a specific and on-going global transfer of wealth/power. It's important to consider colonialism b/c it literally created the world order today, and continues to do so. Consider the conflict in Iraq; Iraq is not a natural entity but rather 3 distinct ethnicities (Kurds, Shias, Sunnis) forced together and put at odds with each other since one group was elevated over the other 2 institutionally. If you were to take a map of the current political situation, you'd handily find the part of Iraq controlled by the Peshmerga is mostly Kurdish, the part controlled by the Iraq govt. is mostly Shia, and the part controlled by ISIS is mostly Sunni. This is not a coincidence

As for white privilege, this is just the structural benefit of the fact that 'white' countries are structured from the ground-up with the assumption that the citizen is white, and the fact that generally, white countries have been extracting ridiculous amounts of wealth from the rest of the world for the last 500 years. If you live in a society that puts your interests first, and is the dominate power world wide, you're going to see some gains that others will not. Its has nothing to do with whites people better at oppressing other people (in fact most evidence points in the other direction, smallpox blankets etc), but rather the fact that the on going domination *is* exploitative and benefits a specific class, benefit which is then reinvested in perpetuating the cycle. An example would be a foreign mining company that displaces local indigenous populations. The company gets richer and that wealth is extracted back to the home country; meanwhile, the indigenous people get poorer as they lose their homes/land/resources

&gt;Lastly, why is it wrong for me, an Estonian who is white, but has been subjugated for most of the past 700 years to wish for a homogeneous society.

Well because put simply, there isn't any way to build a sense of ethnic nationalism that isn't inherently racist, and while that may not have been a problem in the past, that's not the world we live in today. If you say ""this is a country for people of X background"" you're inherently excluding everyone else, which just isn't realistic today at all. How much trade does Estonia do with Russia? The Poles? Nordic countries? Get real man

&gt;Why can't I support policies that support the continuation of my people and the economic and social well being of us? Why is it wrong for me to be against policies that would increase crime, lower our HDI and lower our cohesion, when countries that are much richer seem to fail with dealing with these issues appropriately?

Once again because, if Estonia is like other 'white' countries, it isn't replenishing itself. Also  you're creating a false dichotomy. Greater education, a more equal distribution of wealth, affirmative action, and entrenched feminism have all also been correlated to lower crime, increased HDI, and increased social cohesion, would you say you support these initiatives as well? Ethnic nationalism is not the only way to get those desired results, and arguably, does little to show those results; ethnic nationalism has been tied to some of the worst crimes/hr abuses in the last 20 years, so if you want to make the case that clamping down on immigration will help then I want some stats. 

And which richer countries? America, everything considered, is doing pretty well (that's not to downplay the race issues that exist there). Canada too scores pretty high on HDI. The UK and France, despite sensationalist media, are two of the best places to live in the world, despite pretty generous immigration. Germany too. I'm sorry man but the correlation you're making just isn't there; development, wealth distribution, and state security play a much bigger role in quality of life and the ethnic make-up of a state.

Boomerangs, while commonly associated with Australian Aboriginal people, are not unique to Australia, nor that region of the world.  The basic concept of throwing something like a rock to kill small prey is common to many primitive societies.  A stick is even better than a rock for throwing, because it has a larger surface area to hit a target with and you can get some mechanical advantage in throwing it.  Carving a hunting stick to change / improve flight characteristics is not unique to the CoA Aboriginal either.  They have been found in Europe and North america too.  It is difficult to have modern examples - since wood doesn't tend to survive the test of time well.  But more primitive cultures still use them, which is why we associate Boomerangs with Aussie Aboriginals, they are a primitive culture that survived to modernity to show us such items.  

Anyhow, North American aboriginals used boomerangs too.  The prey the Inuit hunted and the environment they hunted in didn't really call for that weaponry.  More fishing spears, harpoons, spear throwers, bows, and bolas.  Not an overabundance lot of small ground animals where they live(d).  

So the boomerang doesn't even make sense for a water tribe warrior to carry.  Which might be why he sucked at it.  

The catamaran style boats are very Polynesian though.  The Inuit never had large boats.

A year later late one evening my roomie and I had the door open and he came in and he and I made polite conversation about where some of his old friends might be.  He talked about Europe.
I excused my self and went to the latrine to clean up for the night.  Came back to the room and he is still there chatting with my room mate.
My room mate and I at the same time start taking off our clothes and getting ready for bed.

He stood there like a stump.  Roomie goes over and turns off the overhead light and climbs into his bed and I toss back the cover on mine.

So, this happened to me two more times at other bases.  Roomie and I get ready for bed, turn off the tv and get into bed.  Then turn off the lamps.  First guy was a coworker of my roomie and it gave me the creeps.  The guy just sat there in the dark until my room mate told him to get out.
Second guy was my coworker and he asked if we were going to sleep.  Which is what a lot of people do when they take off their clothes, turn everything off, and get into bed.  This guy asked if he could stay and watch tv.  Kicked him out.

Had a coworker I knew just from work called me one evening saying ""he had to change his life, stop the drinking, the pot, the porn, the gambling and get it all together and try to have a relationship with his ex wife and son.""
I reply with  ""Well, good for you and good luck on that but, why are you telling me?""

So in reality the number of armed people (with any gun regardless of number) in the top of that list is actually very close.

Once the ice forms, the brine is squeezed out of the ice crystals, and the ice crystals have a melting temperature of about 32F. So, the temperature of the water being pumped onto the ice is lower than the melting temperature of the ice. Even during the summer in the Beaufort Sea, the ocean temperature remains below the freezing temperature of the freshwater ice that forms on the surface (other areas of the Arctic, like the northern european coastline, or the southern Alaska coastline this may not be the case).

I went to university in Canterbury (a while ago now I must admit). It is a beautiful place and there are a lot of students and hippies around as well as a more conservative older local population. 

You should be able to find somewhere to rent with the dog, but you will probably need to rent from a private landlord. I suspect you are more likely to find pet friendly places in the surrounding villages rather than in Canterbury itself. To live there and take advantage of the best spots, a car is advised. You might find that if you talk to the right people, you can get a banger cheap.

In terms of nature, it is one of the most interesting places in the SE. There are still small patches of the primordial forests that once covered all of the British Isles, complete with flora and fauna only found there. Check out Blean woods. 

Rent wasn't too bad when I was there, however, the SE of England is one of the most expensive places in the world in terms of real estate costs.

Canterbury has a weekly market with cheap produce and meat as well as all the big supermarket chains. However, as a bit of a foodie, I urge you to buy local as much as possible, since there are some of the best ingredients in the UK nearby - Kent is known as the Garden of England. So apples, pears and their products are a big deal. Go to the Cherry Tree in town and have a pint of Biddendens. Try and walk home in a straight line. If you want to know more about local produce, go to Canterbury Wholefoods for good vegan stuff or the Goods Shed for more expensive, gourmet stuff. 

The whole phone scenario is cheaper and easier in the UK and in the EU in general than in the US. Provided you are not contractually tied, you can probably bring your old handset, get it ""unlocked"" and then use a ""pay as you go sim"" data isn't too expensive. 

Libraries are libraries. 

No on in Canterbury is going to judge you for wearing jeans. Just for being an American. I am only half joking. But if you are working on the campus, then loads of people are foreign anyway.

You will be cold in Winter, Spring and Autumn. If you rent somewhere that is bills inclusive, then great. Wear wool, not cotton. That way when you get rained on you stay warm.

My point was that it was not the root cause of this behavior- insular, anti-intellectual, regressive thinking is. 

Like in many dynamic systems, there could easily be a mutual reinforcement between the two. Since religions were (and are being) made up by human beings, they often tend to reflect the preconceptions of those human beings. Growing up in a religious environment is then likely to have a profound influence on the most impressionable people, i.e. children, thus closing the feedback loop.

&gt; You only need look back at womens' treatment under the law during the Islamic Golden Age in Arabic nations vs. Western ones to see an example of a time period when Islam was more liberal in its treatment toward women than Christianity was.

That would appear to be a red herring to me. Europe wasn't as regressive at that time as many people make it (hilariously, we owe this perception to the post-Renaissance anti-religious sentiments which sought to portray Medieval Europe in as bad a light as possible), while the Islamic countries of the time weren't liberal paradises (again, a large source for this orientalistic idealization was probably anti-Catholic and anti-Christian sentiment of some influential Europeans of the latest centuries).

&gt; Yes, religions have been abused by some for use as the conduit through which indoctrinated bigotry is transmitted and preserved, but ultimately, they, alone, wouldn't have any power over people who rejected a fundamentalist mindset, because that's the actual source of where bigotry comes from.

""German economic growth has always been export-led. Berlin’s priorities after World War II were thus to invest in rebuilding the country’s capital stock (which meant keeping a lid on domestic consumption) and to recover export markets (which meant keeping costs, and thus wages, low). With external demand more important than internal demand, growth was determined by competitiveness and monetary stability, not domestic consumption. All government stimulus programs would do in this system is increase the costs of production and lower export demand.

This is a great economic model for a supply-side, export-led economy with a strong monetary authority and supercompetitive products. The problem is that, like the Highlander, there can be only one. Not every European country can be a Germany and run a surplus; others need to run deficits, just as for someone to save, someone else needs to spend. Unfortunately, Germany was able to design the key institutions of the EU and the eurozone in its own image, creating a strong competition authority and an extremely independent and inflation-obsessed central bank. So in the moment of the Greek crisis, Germany’s particular objection to Keynesianism was translated into the prevailing policy stance for an entire regional economy, with disastrous results.

1432151393,0,t5_2qh75,,Moscow,0,False,moscow,,russia,0,1,1,Sarkat11,False,"&gt; USSR came as a result of civil war. Every single casualty of civil war is on USSR ""hands"" then. Or, to be precise, on Bolshevik's hands. 

That is a completely ignorant claim. Why are the winners responsible for all the deaths? If you follow that logic, is the Soviet Union responsible for every single person killed by Nazi Germany? Is the Russian Empire responsible for 'every single casualty' in 1812 Napoleon war? Or if you want a closer comparison - is every single casualty in the American Independence War on the hands of the US government?

Did the White Guard not kill people? Did the foreign Allied Intervention forces not kill people? Did the pro-Germans not killed people? Did the various other factions (like the Green or Ukrainian Independents) not participated in the war? No, it was only Bolsheviks' fault, for sure! They only had the power in 1917-1918 long after Czar stepped down and ALL the other parties completely failed at heading the state (the Provisional Government spent half a year just formulating a policy). Then the disgruntled army loyal to the former elite, supported by foreign countries, started the war - but suddenly it's all Bolsheviks' fault. If anyone should be blamed for the Civil War, it was Nikolay II and his predecessors, for completely failing to understand the changing situation and adapt to it. If the ""bloody Sunday"" of 1905 didn't happen, Bolsheviks wouldn't have that much support from the common people.

&gt; It is all kinds of plausible that R.Empire could industrialize itself in 20 years of peace and not losing a war. Yes, maybe not on the level of USSR, but good enough and with much bigger population.

Czarist Russia did want to industrialize, but they didn't want to urbanize the population or provide education to people - and you can't properly industrialize without it. While Stolypin's reforms were really good, they didn't address these issues. One of the first things Soviet regime did was to introduce 'likbez' and lure the peasants to the cities (and plants) - there was no indication Russian Empire ever wanted to educate their citizens, preferring them in the 'mindless drone' state to keep the power. History does not accept the word ""would be"", Russian Empire was failed by Romanovs, and USSR wasn't something that suddenly appeared out of nowhere. 

The reforms needed and started by Alexander II were good, but not enough, and Stolypin's reforms were only economic, not social. All this talk of how liberal Nikolay II was is good and dandy, but he didn't act the part - he was called ""Bloody Nikolay"" by his people due to way he ""liberally"" handled 1905. And Bolsheviks were not even in power when Nikolay II stepped down (February 1917), they only ascended half a year later (October 1917), after the rest of political parties utterly failed, so Russian Empire ended before USSR emerged - I'm fairly sure that if some other parties proved successful, we'd see a whole different state in place of USSR, as ideology was paramount to it.

&gt; So, the 50 (70) years old regime is better than a country just after revolution ? Color me surprised.

So when you compare the USSR after the Civil War to the peak of Russian Empire - it's ok. When I compare Russian Federation after the USSR breakdown to the peak of USSR - it's not ok. How should I argue with that logic?

USSR brought a lot of good things to Russia that it lacked before - from the recognition on the international politics arena to education and opportunities for common people (how many Russian peasants of XIX century could even dream of having own apartment int he city or become diplomats?), income inequality was almost nonexistent in comparison to Europe and America or even Czarist Russia (Brezhnev's dacha was more spacious, and his food was of better quality, and he had his personal driver with a state-provided car and that's about it - CEOs of large companies had comparatively MORE wealth and comfort than Soviet leaders), Russian scientists became one of the best in the world (especially in rocket science and energy, some of the most difficult scientific areas at the time) - and that's coming from a country never before known for any kind of innovation, apart from the occasional works of geniuses like Lomonosov and Mendeleev.

My point is that while USSR brought a lot of bad with it, it brought a lot of good with it, too. Ivan the Terrible was a bloody monster, who tortured people for fun and his reign was a reign of terror, but he united and solidified the country in a way that ensured it survived for centuries to come. Peter the Great built the fleet and his pet project named St.Petersburg on the countless bones and blood of indentured workers (which was OK at that time, everyone did that), but he brought a factually Medieval state into the Renaissance era. What XX century needed wasn't a spineless Czar that could only punish the insurgency and listen to advisors, but a reformist akin to Peter, who would change the way of life completely - but there wasn't one to be found, that's why we got the revolution we had, and the Civil War that came later.

Why are you shifting the blame exclusively on the most competent part in the mess that was Russia of 1917? ""Every single casualty of civil war is on USSR"", right.",t3_30xegx,t1_cpxsmlo,1427963222,False,cpypbbz,t1_cpypbbz

I had a great opportunity this evening to try out a number of great offerings from my local, albeit government run, liquor store. Most of the items on offer were different wines, however there were these 2 notables that really stood out from the crowd as deserving of some extra attention and time. Unfortunately, due to it being a tasting event, the sample sizes were rather small, maybe 1/4oz, hopefully enough that I was able to do these both some justice.

I'll start with the one I've really contemplated buying a bottle of, even though it is completely ridiculous here, the Balvenie 30. According to the bottle, this nectar is aged both in traditional oak whisky casks and in European oak sherry casks, then bottled at 47% ABV. At my local, $730+tax for a 700ml. Let's see if I'll spend my hard earned bonus cheque on this bottle!

**Nose**: Strawberries and cream

a bit difficult to pick this one apart with such a small sample, but those were the key notes

**Palate**: ethanol and jam, lots of dark fruit jams going on

**Finish**: unfortunately short and underwhelming - possibly due to the amount?

Next up, AnCnoc 1999! Per the bottle on this one, it's bottled at 46% after having spent 14years in both sherry and bourbon casks. Retail for this one $105+tax for 700ml. I was able to visit this one twice, so a bit more of a chance to spend some quality time with it. 

**Nose**: honey comb, lemon, waxy and a bit of alcohol

Really quite a delicious nose here, with the waxiness emerging after having sat for a bit

**Palate**: sweet, salty, caramel

**Finish**: unlit pipe tobacco, nice and warming, lasts a nice while

To put a wrap to all of this, here are my final thoughts about both bottles. Both were quite tasty, but I definitely have reservations about both. I had high anticipation/expectation for the Balvenie 30 and I think it merits another shot as I really enjoyed my 15 single barrel, the 17 peated cask and the double wood is a staple. However, unless it really picks up a notch, this is one bottle that will not be coming home with me. From the sampling I did have I would set this **80**/100.

The real surprise for me this evening was the AnCnoc. I hadn't previously had any of their offerings and they really brought a solid product to the table here. Unfortunately, the salty note on the palate was a real detractor for me. It was like someone dumped a spoon of salt on my tongue along with this otherwise delicious nectar. I have been offered a sampling of the AnCnoc 22 which I am definitely going to pursue, but this 1999 distillation won't follow me home either. Other than the salt which was a major killer for me, this was fantastic!! On my first visit I didn't get the salt note and scored this a 95/100, however being what it is, this one ends up **80**/100 as well.",t3_316bdx,t3_316bdx,1427967572,False,cpyq5ud,t1_cpyq5ud

The back mount counterlungs of the JJ and shearwater electronics are a major plus. For people in Europe the JJ is probably easier to get parts/service. The Meg is very robust and comes in a modular design allowing large scrubber capacities. I married the two, put essentially a custom head containing shearwater electronics onto a meg scrubber/canister and using counterlungs very similar to JJ. 

JJ uses an axial scrubber. They advertise a radial but I have never seen one in person or talked to anyone that has used it. They also don't advertise the price of it. If it is available, and affordable, and you want a JJ then radial would be my suggestion. 

2) in a verbal conversation with Jerry at ISC several weeks ago the meg 15 head is currently available. In a world of shrinking yet easier to read handsets the Meg has made theirs bigger. The new MEG 15 handset is color and easier to read. It's a Can-Bus electronics system too. They have made some interesting design decisions though, with the new head, that I do not care for. At $1000 or so more expensive than the older version 2.7 I would go with the 2.7 head. 

3) Paul Haynes is the best instructor I know, for the Meg, outside of the U.S. He has been teaching rebreathers to the public and military longer than most instructors have been diving. He will travel to teach too. 

In the US I recommend Gregg Stanton and Dave Sutton. Both very experienced MEG instructors up through trimix and cave CCR levels. Both are also ISC repair technicians. 

I do not know of any JJ instructors, personally, but it is a very popular unit on the forums and Id suggest visiting Ccr explorers or rebreather world to see who is recommended. IANTD website can tell you who is actively teaching it in your area. 

4) I have not played with one in person but the new CCR liberty is worth looking into. It has some awesome features, small handsets, user replaceable electronic parts, and is made by a company with an excellent history of quality products

5) don't ignore used deals on rebreathers. Megs, even old ones, can be serviced and upgraded for years to come and can usually be found for $2-7kUS including extras/spares. JJ recently changed to a Can-Bus system and their older units are showing up used too. 

6) there are other exciting units in R&amp;amp;D too. If you don't have to buy today (or in 3 months) Id keep an eye out for what's coming from Mike Hearn of Dive Design.

Spreading rumours like this is not something I would expect from this thread. The discussion started so nicely, why would you drift away to making this a hate thread... Those accusations are ridiculous and not true.  

Banning one advertisement character who spams in world/scene chat is like chopping off one head of a hydra. They have automated bots and come back within seconds, banning one of them mostly does more harm than any good, because players would have to once again set a new character on their blacklist, instead of ignoring one of them and enjoying silence for much longer.  
&amp;nbsp;

We first have to fix our initial payment gateways, the source where Goldsellers get the funds to spam in world chat. This is why paypal and credit cards are not available to so many, because we effectively disallowed spam accounts to use these methods.
&amp;nbsp;

Next, we'll look into cleaning the server from existing sellers, which we have effectively started doing recently.  
&amp;nbsp;

&gt; And that bans are given randomly, and only to people who dont have Knux on his chat room. We all know that you can cheat on Hua, and get recorded, and avoid ban if Knux is your friend.

You forgot the best thing about our public broadcasters here in Germany: They are not allowed to produce content for the Internet.

I shit you not. There is a contract between the 16 member states (and god knows who else) that specifies what the broadcasters may or may not do and one of these specifications says that *only things that are broadcast over a traditional medium like TV or radio or that are directly connected to something broadcast over a traditional medium are allowed to be put on the internet*.

Yes. And you know what?

*That is not actually the stupidest thing that the contract specifies*.

Because it also says that everything put online by public broadcasters has to be **TAKEN OFFLINE AFTER SEVEN DAYS**. 

That's right. If I want to watch the stuff my license fee paid for, but that stuff happens to be more than seven days old, I won't be able to watch it because it has been removed from the Internet.

If I want to *read what happened on Sept. 11th 2001* I must hope that whatever Google gives me is accurate, because all the public broadcaster news sites I trust have removed all their old reporting.

The public broadcasters of Germany are set up in such a way to maximize the amount of money they burn through while at the same time minimizing the amount of available content.

If you've read this far, you might want to take to heart the following, harrowing warning: Our broadcasters in Germany are so broken because the German publishing lobby *made the politicians do this*.

That same lobby is now working hard to influence the Council and the Commission in order to shape the future of Copyright and the Internet in the European Union.

The obvious issue here is that he lives in a rural area and doesn't have friends. (I don't mean this as an insult). I'm just saying from their perspective, they aren't wrong. Most Nintendo games do come off as local multiplayer with friends on the spot, and if 80% of Nintendo's titles are like that, then yeah, its a reasonable complaint. I'd feel the same way if I didn't have friends and family to share it with.

And while I don't think its fair that you are bashing the console without playing some of the games, where yes, there are personal indepth games that don't rely on the multi-people experience. Examples like Bayonetta, Pokemon, the RPG games like Fire Emblem. But I do understand that there comes a point that you just want to play with others, and if you are in a rural area, so you want to play online with friends, and the Wii-U just doesn't support that.

And Mario Party 10 and amiibo, absolutely agree. The amiibo mode is a travesty and it only made amiibo look worse because it can't store memory and the feature was lacking where that time could had been spent developing better things. But it was ONE bad case of it, where with amiibo, assuming I'm not a collector, enjoy the fact I can pay 12.99 for a cool figure, and can eventually use it with other games down the line. Like I have a Marth amiibo, and I can use it in Smash, but down the line, I can use it for Project STEAM and probably other games like the next Fire Emblem. I don't think it will affect games as much as it did Mario Party 10, but agreed, that was one bad case of it looking like a cash grab, but the new free feature with amiibo giving 3 min access to demos looks nice and they are increasing compatibility. But overall, I don't see it hindering other games other than extra costumes and trinkets. 

And guys, lets not bash how horrible the article is written. It's a rant, not a novel. It probably didn't take long to write. Now, I don't agree that the Wii-U is bad, but at the same time, I'm not from Europe, I don't live in a rural area and have local friends to play actively with, and as for the gamepad, whose to say I'm not guilty of preferring a standard controller sometimes, but I do like the gamepad for certain personal games but its so useless when I have friends over to play the other games and yeah, the other controls are better. 

So overall, I see the author's argument quite valid from their situation. The author comes off as a gamer that enjoys traditional games that they can play alone and still wants to option to play with friends online. I wouldn't say Nintendo doesn't cater to that, but in that case, I can honestly say Sony and Microsoft does a better job of it, but at the same time, they struggle creating the same multi-local games that nintendo does so well at. Basically, I love Nintendo, but I agree with some of these, and for me, I see more positives from what Nintendo gives us that I can over look these things, and sorry that it doesn't work for you, but I can sympathize with the author.

&gt;* [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) – 2.4 billion

&gt;* [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) – 5.2 billion

&gt;* [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) – 709 million

&gt;* [Latin America &amp; Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America) – 782 million

&gt;* [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) – 446 million 

&gt;[Walter Greiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Greiling) projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion, in the 21st century, and then stop growing after a readjustment of the [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World) and a sanitation of the [tropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics).  Recent extrapolations from available figures for population growth show that the population of Earth will stop increasing around 2070. 

&gt;The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs report (2004) projects the world population to peak at 9.22 billion in 2075. After reaching this maximum the world population is projected to decline slightly and then resume increasing slowly, to reach a level of 8.97 billion by 2300, about the same as the projected 2050 figure.  A 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division forecast that the world's population will reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.  An alternative scenario is given by Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' ""most likely scenario"" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline. 

&gt;These projected growth patterns depend on assumptions about vital rates. Total fertility is assumed to continue to decline, at varying paces depending on circumstances in individual countries, to a below-replacement level of 1.85 children per woman by mid century. Countries already at this level or below, and other countries when they reach it, will eventually return to replacement over a period of a century and stay at replacement going forward. All countries are projected to have reached replacement fertility by 2175.

&gt;Some of the authors of the report say that life expectancy is assumed to rise slowly and continuously. The projections in the report assume this with no upper limit, though at a slowing pace depending on circumstances in individual countries. By 2100, the report assumes life expectancy to be from 66 to 97 years, and by 2300 from 87 to 106 years, depending on the country. Based on that assumption, they said that rising life expectancy will produce small but continuing population growth by the end of the projections, ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 percent annually.

&gt;However, based on [recent research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_extension), many expect that life expectancy will leap ahead and indefinite human lifespans are not necessarily unfeasible.    This could significantly raise the estimates. In an essay within the U.N. report, Tim Dyson said,

&gt;&gt;


&gt;&gt;*""A rapid increase in life expectancy, which would raise the population pyramids, seems within reach, since it responds to an old and powerful demand for longevity.""*

 [**Long nineteenth century**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long%20nineteenth%20century): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __long 19th century__, defined by [Eric Hobsbawm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm), a British [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) historian and author, refers to the period between the years 1789 and 1914. Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in *[The Age of Revolution: Europe, 1789–1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Revolution:_Europe_1789%E2%80%931848)*; *[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Capital:_1848%E2%80%931875)*; and, *[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Empire:_1875%E2%80%931914)*. The concept is influenced by [Fernand Braudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Braudel)'s idea of the ""long 16th century"" (c. 1450–1640).

&gt;According to Hobsbawn, the long 19th century begins with the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) that established a republic in Europe and ends with the start of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.

&gt;A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used notably by textbook author and Professor of History at [George Mason University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University), [Peter N. Stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_N._Stearns).

To do so, when you get to level 10, select Brewmaster. You will then notice in your 'Spellbook' that you'll have a tab at the bottom called 'Core abilities' this is a good idea of what you want to do.

You gain new abilities at various points, you'll get quite a few early on, then more slowly as you progress. You also get talents which are abilities you get at:
30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 100.

You can use this tool here:
http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/tool/talent-calculator

Here you can see what level you get certain spells &amp; what talents are available when.

---------------------

Your basic priority of using abilities will be something like:

* Tiger palm strike (this only needs to be done every 20 seconds or so) this puts a buff on you to do more damage
* Keg Smash - when all enemies are within range (big damage and +2 chi gained)
* Blackout kick (costs 2 chi)- this puts ""Shuffle"" on you (increases parry and stagger amount by 10%)

To gain more 'Chi' whilst keg smash is on cooldown (CD) you can use jab.

------------------

Until higher levels this will be your basic priority. for the first 30 or-so levels. As you don't get any 'active mitigation' until later levels. Active mitigation is when you use an ability to prevent damage - such as 'Guard' or 'Elusive Brew'.

Centre Pediatrics Vaccine Policy Statement
We firmly believe in the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent serious illness and to save lives.
We firmly believe in the safety of our vaccines.
We firmly believe that all children and young adults should receive all of the recommended vaccines according to the schedule published by the Centers for Disease Control and theAmericanAcademyof Pediatrics.
We firmly believe, based on all available literature, evidence, and current studies, that vaccines do not cause autism or other developmental disabilities. We firmly believe that thimerosal, a preservative that has been in vaccines for decades and remains in some vaccines, does not cause autism or other developmental disabilities. We do not use vaccines under the age of three that contain thimerosal.
We firmly believe that vaccinating children and young adults may be the single most important health-promoting intervention we perform as health care providers, and that you can perform as parents/caregivers. The recommended vaccines and their schedule given are the results of years and years of scientific study and data-gathering on millions of children by thousands of our brightest scientists and physicians.
These things being said, we recognize that there has always been and will likely always be controversy surrounding vaccination. Indeed, Benjamin Franklin, persuaded by his brother, was opposed to smallpox vaccine until scientific data convinced him otherwise. Tragically, he had delayed inoculating his favorite son Franky, who contracted smallpox and died at age 4, leaving Ben with a lifetime of guilt and remorse. Quoting Mr. Franklin’s autobiography:
In 1736, I lost one of my favorite sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox…I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it, my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.
The vaccine campaign is truly a victim of its own success. It is precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing illness that we are even discussing whether or not they should be given. Because of vaccines, many of you have never seen a child with polio, tetanus, whooping cough, bacterial meningitis, or even chickenpox, or known a friend or family member whose child died of one of these diseases. Such success can make us complacent or even lazy about vaccinating. But such an attitude, if it becomes widespread, can only lead to tragic results.
Over the past several years, many people inEuropehave chosen not to vaccinate their children with MMR vaccine after publication of an unfounded suspicion (later retracted) that the vaccine caused autism. As a result of under immunization, there have been small outbreaks of measles and several deaths from complications of measles inEuropeover the past several years.
Furthermore, by not vaccinating your child you are taking selfish advantage of thousands of others who do vaccinate their children, which decreases the likelihood that your child will contract one of these diseases. We feel such an attitude to be self centered and unacceptable.
We are making you aware of these facts not to scare you, intimidate you, or coerce you, but to emphasize the importance of vaccinating your child. We recognize that the choice may be a very emotional one for some parents. We will do everything we can to convince you that vaccinating according the schedule is the right thing to do. However, should you have doubts, please discuss these with your health care provider in advance of your visit. In some cases, we may alter the schedule to accommodate parental concerns or reservations. Please be advised, however, that delaying or “breaking up the vaccines” to give one or two at a time over two or more visits goes against expert recommendations, and can put your child at risk for serious illness (or even death) and goes against our medical advice as providers at Centre Pediatrics. Such additional visits will require additional co-pays on your part. Furthermore, please realize that you will be required to sign a “Refusal to Vaccinate” acknowledgement in the event of lengthy delays.
Finally, if you should absolutely refuse to vaccinate your child despite all our efforts, we will ask you to find another health care provider who shares your views. We do not keep a list of such providers, nor would we recommend any such physician. Please recognize that by not vaccinating you are putting your child at unnecessary risk for life-threatening illness and disability, and even death.
As medical professionals, we feel very strongly that vaccinating children on schedule with currently available vaccines is absolutely the right thing to do for all children and young adults. Thank you for your time in reading this policy, and please feel free to discuss any questions or concerns you may have about vaccines with any one of us.

**Tl;Dr** : Low Bet on Underdogs

Today We are going to Merge the three Fnatic Matches into One Analysis. Fnatic are undoubtedly the best team in the world. Due to Internet Attack issues Faceits League went Haywire .

Fnatic have scheduled three of their remaining 7 matches today.

These are 

* Fnatic vs NIP - Inferno
* Fnatic vs Titan - Inferno
* NaVi vs Fnatic - OverPass

Firstly Lets take a look at the tournament

**Some Rules**

Each team has to play two matches. In one match it is the HOME team and in the other it is the AWAY team. THe home team gets to pick the Map. The sides are decided by a knife round.

Since there are a total of 8 teams, each team will play a maximum of 7 * 2= 14 matches.

A win grants you 3 points . A loss gets you a 0. A tie will get you 1 point. (Please correct me if I am wrong on this)
I request you to check the Points obtained by the Teams till now. 


http://imgur.com/Ao2aNjI 


Remember only the top 5 teams from Europe will go to the Grand LAN Finals. Each team has to play a total of 14 games. Therefore number of matches remaining for each team is as follows 

* NIP - 5 
* Fnatic - 7
* VP - 7
* Titan - 5
* NaVi - 10
* EnVyUs - 7
* TSM - 7
* LGB - 6

As we can see there a clear demarcation between the top of the table and the bottom of the table. And in between is NaVi. NaVi are currently in Fifth position and their performance needs to be on point in order to be selected for the LAN final of FACEIT.

TSM and EnVyUs on the other hand seem to be in a very bad position. Obviously both will be trying to attain that coveted 5th spot and topple NaVi. However for now NaVi should be motivated enough. 

NIP are leading the table but they have also played 2 more matches than Fnatic. I totally expect Fnatic to topple them or be on Par with them at the top of the table. 


**(P.S.)** I cannot find the Past matches results. If someone could link me that would be awesome.

**How Do I think these Maps will go?**

I think Fnatic will take Navi on OverPass. However vs Titan &amp; vs NIP I am not so sure. But I am getting a feeling that Fnatic will not win each and every match today. I would suggest a small bet (similar in size ) on all three underdogs.

The **logic** behind this is 

Almost every underdog is below 33% (NIP might rise later).

If you win any one Underdog Bet you are in a profit + if Fnatic manage to lose any more maps then it is a very good profit.

Todays betting analysis is a bit different than usual and the reason for that is these are Tier 1 teams.

**Any T1 team can defeat any other T1 team on a given day.**

NaVi is the home team on OverPass whereas Fnatic is the home team on the remaining two Maps.


Lets have a final look at **Fnatic's recent Online Matches** . 

http://imgur.com/re8pPED 

While these may not be a decisive factor I believe that they show a slight slump in Fnatics Online Play.

Also this stage of the League is pretty early and the teams are not facing elimination yet. I feel Fnatic might be a bit lacklustre and might end up losing one map. I will be going LOW  on the underdogs however. 


Yes this does guarantee a loss ( and that is the reason I am going low) . However it seems safer than gambling the skins on one match.


**Tl;Dr** : Low Bet on Underdogs

**How Do I think these Maps will go?**

I think Fnatic will take Navi on OverPass. However vs Titan &amp; vs NIP I am not so sure. But I am getting a feeling that Fnatic will not win each and every match today. I would suggest a small bet (similar in size ) on all three underdogs.

The **logic** behind this is 

Almost every underdog is below 33% (NIP might rise later).

If you win any one Underdog Bet you are in a profit + if Fnatic manage to lose any more maps then it is a very good profit.

Todays betting analysis is a bit different than usual and the reason for that is these are Tier 1 teams.

**Any T1 team can defeat any other T1 team on a given day.**

NaVi is the home team on OverPass whereas Fnatic is the home team on the remaining two Maps.


Lets have a final look at **Fnatic's recent Online Matches** . 

http://imgur.com/re8pPED 

While these may not be a decisive factor I believe that they show a slight slump in Fnatics Online Play.

Also this stage of the League is pretty early and the teams are not facing elimination yet. I feel Fnatic might be a bit lacklustre and might end up losing one map. I will be going LOW  on the underdogs however. 


Yes this does guarantee a loss ( and that is the reason I am going low) . However it seems safer than gambling the skins on one match.


**Tl;Dr** : Low Bet on Underdogs

No offense to m0e, he's a good player and used to be a big deal in source, but in CSGO he never even competed at the highest level. He's just a streamer and has been for quite some time. Did he ever attend a major in CSGO? Was he part of some good or even promising team in the NA scene? Did he have any CSGO LAN performances worth mentioning?

The NA scene is already way too much about personalities and huge egos. People should care about real competitive players not about who has the best stream. Hiko got it right, he's streaming a lot now that he's not on a team, but for players who want to compete with a team this double dipping between pro gaming and streaming is just a cash grab and won't get them anywhere in tournaments.

Just look at the difference between NA and EU, the only big streamer european pro CS has is Pasha, and even he who does it to support his family doesn't do it for 10 hours straight, instead he does it without a specific schedule for 2 to 3 hours at a time and is fine with it. Meanwhile NA has Tarik who streams throughout the night and then oversleeps for his league match the next day, or shroud who probably spends more time ingame with natawhee and Polen than with the other 4 members of C9.

Don't get me wrong, I think for them personally it's a smart decision, it's a good way to make more money and even though I don't have the skills for either, I'd pick being a streamer over being a dedicated pro everyday, but then let's be honest and start seeing it for what it is.

1432153158,0,t5_2r9ei,,,0,False,,,DnD,0,3,3,OurOhnlyHope,False,"Hi there! I'm an undergraduate Medieval and Renaissance historian who is doing their dissertation on geographical misconceptions of medieval life in fantasy worlds. I think I may have a few pointers that could help breathe some things into your (already pretty stupendous) world! 

Important things to address:

* Biomes. What are the biomes of your land? Real life countries have expansive environments that respond to weather patterns in unique and semi-consistent ways. I'm getting the sense that this is a European-esque land filled with arboreal mountain valleys, but take that one step further--where are the trees densest? Then answer why. Are there trees along forests? What about in the north? Where are there different trees from the rest of the map, and would this change the architecture of local population centers?

* Cultural Variation. Your map seems to span the length of somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 miles long. Yet, I'm still detecting a heavily Tolkien and R.R.Martin-influenced vocabulary in naming specific areas of the map. Variation in at least the language roots of these areas will lead to a world with more depth, providing for your players a sense of change as they navigate the map. The best way to rectify this is to decide what the major centers of culture are in your world, and then decide how long they have been around for; who first settled them, what language they spoke, why they were effective at their conquest, and if they were taken over by anybody else. Which leads me into my next point..

* Political Boundaries. If there's one thing people forget that stops the world from being fleshed out well, it's a sense of who rules what area, and how effectively they do. In 1973 the cultural geographer Zelinsky argued in *Doctrine of First Effect versus Settlement*, that the first cultural group to settle an area had a remarkable effect on the politics and social rule expressed by the local population. In layman's terms--the first to a spot usually influence how something is ruled. Indicating on your map what cities belong to whom, and then how well those central cities can actually keep their rule will go a long way to establishing how the people of that land will interact with your players. For example: Let's say that Amethystia (of which the capital is Korrinth) recently annexed the bay city of Dormer. Dormer, long a city of merchants and focused on its position in the sea, caved quickly, but now has difficulty adopting the military culture of the rest of Amethystia. See how that already characterizes the populace of the city? It puts Dormer in a unique situation that offers the players a better look at how the world works, beyond Dormer being in allegiance to the Amethystian Crown! Giving your players noticeable differences between the countries they encounter can only benefit your map. 


Nitpicks:

* Elevation. Unless you're on a volcanic isle, mountains in real life do NOT form in the center of a continent or island chain. They actually tend to be towards the edges, which is why the map seems sort of... Off. Take for instance the center of Russia, or the United States of America--flat land in the center. In those continents, mountains are the results of continental plates tearing each other apart, overlapping and overbounding on top of one another in amazing geological intercourse. For example: in the west, there's an entire desert which just... arises out of the sea. Then, we suddenly transition into grassland, and then mountain ranges. 

* River placement. You have a flourishing system of water networks running through your lands, but they don't really have a rhyme or reason for being there other than filling in the interior of the map. Let's contrast two rivers to illustrate my point. First, we will tackle the one you handled very well: the Bia river. This river runs from Kolkon Peak and the Saddleback mountains all the way down through Berrin, where the river then lets out into a delta towards Big Wash. Your depiction of the river leads me to believe that surrounding Berrin must be low-lands used by farmers for basic agriculture and grazing. Endemic to the land is space, perhaps too much for an agrarian society that hasn't mechanized yet to handle, so for now, the majority of trade occurs on the rivers. I can postulate from there that, since this is a major food production center, located strategically on a river defended by other cities, that it would make sense for THIS city to be the capital. Well handled. Let's run on over to the other side of the map though, and take a look at the watershed in Lucenia. Connected through the delta that forms past the town of Farming (Faming? Foaming? I couldn't tell.) are the cities of Milford, Loome, Hilford, Maiz, and Aurry. Right off the bat I'm detecting a gimmick of agricultural names, which is camp, and a bit cute. But beyond one single mountain located far, far away from Farming, there's not really a lot in this area. The rivers seem to nearly connect with another system near Kingmoor--something I don't really understand, unless the entirety of these areas are located on swampy and marshy lowlands which would facilitate the quick transport of precipitation either north or south-east indiscriminately. This doesn't mesh well with the farming theme you established--wouldn't rampant wetlands encourage the growth of hallucinogenic fungi and plague the crops of the entire delta? Really, this would be the perfect place for a mountain range that makes a T-cross section with the Truujin Mts. and Sunset Hills, if only to create a source for the water that isn't just blank space. 

* City Placement. You have a lot of cities on rivers, but not many on the seas themselves. Is this a naval-faring realm? They must be, because we have so many major population centers set up along the edges of rivers. 

Again, I just want to emphasize that you have a good world here. It just needs some quick tweaks to make it more believable. Keep up the good work!",t3_315kdd,t3_315kdd,1427979207,False,cpyt27l,t1_cpyt27l

There are two other rulesets that are played nationally (also in our region), but our ruleset is practically only played here.

The table with no pockets, as you said, has two different games. In drieband (three banks, literally), the goal is to hit the other two balls, but your object ball needs to hit 3 banks before it makes contact with the second ball.  
In carambole, the requirement of hitting the banks is dropped, although some people enforce a rule that increases points for every time you use a bank in a shot.

I've recreationally and competitively played all 4. I like all of them, but topbiljart (bumper pool) requires skill in all aspects used in the other games combined.  
From what I've seen, it's regarded as more or less a hit and miss game. But we treat it as a deeply tactical and highly skilled game (similar to how foosball in Europe is more about tactics and less about being quick, as opposed to what I've seen of American foosball)",t3_3157lu,t1_cpytpn7,1427981455,False,cpytzv8,t1_cpytzv8

We could pay for it, or we could make the parents pay for it. Either way it prevents the child slowing down everyone else at the school which is the current issue.

&gt;The article suggests mostly non-EU

How does it? No numbers are quoted at all, and whilst most European schools do teach English, the article clearly talks more about *primary* schools where kids won't have been taught English. The implication is clearly that these are younger children under the age of 11.

&gt;Compare that to immigrants from India&amp;Pakistan, then you begin to see where the problem is. 

Actually English is much more common in places like Pakistan than it is in places like Romania, with many of the states actually having English as the primary and official language. 29% of Romanians speak English compared with 49% for Pakistanis. India is only 11%, but with such a massive rural population it's probably not very representative in terms of the people who are likely to be coming here.

For further context, 53% of Nigerians and 56% of Filipinos speak English as well so I reject your assertion that more Europeans speak English than do foreigners from non-European countries. Romania doesn't even have the smallest English-speaking population in the EU - Bulgaria, Portugal, Spain and Hungary all have even lower rates.

1432154693,0,t5_2qnzu,,The last thing you never see,0,False,,,Fallout,0,9,9,NATOMarksman,False,"Basically, the world didn't change after the '50s. For around 127 years, the world was stuck in a holding pattern of '50s technology, culture, and most importantly politics. The Atomic Age lasted for that entire period of time, and nuclear technology was a staple of modern life, used in everything from cars to batteries. Only the US managed to harness the full potential of nuclear energy; other nations did develop atomic weapons but not nuclear power.

Since the world did not evolve from the '50s understanding of resource usage, in the 2050s the Resource Wars happened, where the rest of the world waged war on each other over the very limited fossil fuels left. Europe and most of Asia were devastated, and all other nations were starved. Only China remained, and they were running out of fossil fuels as well; they did have nuclear power but it was rudimentary compared to the US', so to stay alive, they invaded the US at Anchorage, Alaska to try to take the US' oil reserves.

The US then counterattacked with T-51b power armor (which, in-universe, allowed individual soldiers to survive tank shells and plasma flamethrowers that would kill virtually everyone else), retaking Alaska and then invading China to try to force defeat.

At the same time, the US government was concerned by the possibility of Chinese biological warfare, so they developed a project called the Pan-Immunity Virion. This would allow soldiers and other people to be rendered immune to a variety of Chinese biological agents. However, they decided to take it a step further and develop the 'Forced Evolutionary Virus'; if they could make people 'evolve' to use four-stranded DNA instead of two-stranded, none of the Chinese biological agents would work on them, and they could splice out aging and diseases too.

The problem was that on almost all people, FEV mutates them into big, dumb brutes. While they are incredibly strong, fast, immune to radiation, and healthy in every way, they aren't very smart and tend to react violently. The mutation process causes them to lose virtually all of their memories, and they don't look human at all. Some people mutated this way still have their faculties and behave as humans, but they are rare.

Military personnel working on the FEV eventually revolted against the government, since they were experimenting on human beings and it created some really horrible things (such as Centaurs; probably the most gnarly thing you'll see in the Wasteland). These people would eventually become the Brotherhood of Steel; over time their mandate changed from taking technology from the government to hoarding technology and keeping it from everyone else. They are usually the best equipped people in the Wasteland, since they almost exclusively use power armor (either the T-51b or the older T-45d), heavy weapons (like miniguns or rocket launchers), or energy weapons (like laser rifles).

No one knows who dropped the first bomb but the world was totally wrecked. Humanity is stubborn, though, so some people survived the intense radiation to become ghouls (mutated people who look like zombies but are actually people with radiation poisoning so intense that it would kill almost anyone else), while others left their Vaults after the radiation tapered off, and still others managed to evade the bombs.

Vaults were commissioned by the US government presumably in preparation for nuclear war, and spots in the Vaults were sold at high prices to citizens. However, within the government was a cabal called the Enclave. The Enclave knew that nuclear war with China was inevitable, but they believed that only people in their organization were worth saving; everyone else could die in nuclear fire for all they cared (and in fact, most of the US died exactly this way). They prepared strategically placed and supplied installations, and moved there when the US invaded China. Their endgame was to eventually repopulate the US once the world was gone, but before they did, they needed data on what to expect out there.

So they used Vaults. Almost all of the Vaults (95%+) were designed as social experiments; one Vault used gambling as a system of government, another had residents injected with FEV, one had an official policy to never allow residents to leave, and so on. The few 'control' Vaults were made to actual specifications and worked properly; since each Vault was designed to hold 1000 people, they are the source of most of the people you find in the Wasteland (or at least, they are their descendents). Vaults are led by an Overseer, who carries out the design specification for their Vaults.

The Enclave have the best equipped military in the entire Wasteland (since they have their own self-contained R&amp;D areas, production facilities, food preparation/water purification like in Vaults, and cutting-edge tech like Vertibirds or power armor even more advanced than the T-51b, which was the last version produced before nuclear war), but they have very few people, and after the events of Fallout 2, almost the entire Enclave was destroyed. The surviving Enclave fled East to the Capital Wasteland, with a few members remaining in the West. They only arrive in force when they have to, and use all of their firepower to keep themselves alive.

Mutants, known as Super Mutants, were affected by FEV. Since the FEV 'fixes' reproductive cells (you need half chromosome cells to come together to form offspring, but FEV 'corrected' them to full chromosome, making Super Mutants sterile), they are driven by an urge to create more Super Mutants. They are known to kill and eat unmutated humans, and to drag them back to FEV sources to make them into Super Mutants.

Throughout the Wasteland, you will encounter a variety of people, including Raiders and mercenaries. Raiders have gone native and will kill you for your stuff, while mercenaries may or may not try to kill you; it depends on how much they get paid, if you piss them off, and if they are commissioned to kill you. Everyone else is just trying to eke out an existence in the Wasteland. 

There's more but you should play the games to find out. Level up your Science to get more tasty info. There are no books to read like in Skyrim and there's decidedly less information (what with the total annihilation of society and almost all records), but there's plenty to find while wandering the wastes.

I play Hearthstone (all 3 regions for dailies, but ""main"" account is on NA), Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, and Heroes of the Storm (dailies). So if you enjoy Blizzard games in general, it could be a fun time. I'll also be picking up Overwatch as soon as it becomes available... so future fun as well! :)

Though I tend to be able to compete at a fairly high-level if I concentrate on a game, I really just enjoy playing for fun... so I'm the kind of person to add if you just want occasional hijinks with, and not a dedicated team-mate or anything along those lines.

About my Hearthstone play:

NA - I commonly rank under 10th on ladder despite only playing dailies.

EU / AS - I only play dailies and - unlike my NA account - I have spent $0 on these accounts. Mostly, I play basic-only decks and still finish above 50% of the region population.

About Heroes of the Storm:

I'm a fairly new player as I only gained Beta access semi-recently. I own enough hero to play leagues and have been doing so for a little while. Not too serious about competing, but seem to do at least competently. Last I checked I had &gt;50% win rate on all maps.

About Diablo 3:
I generally play during seasons now that they have them. I have max-level heroes of each class for ""standard"" characters and I'm doing 1 hard-core max-level per season. So far I have a maxed hard-core Crusader and Wizard (season 1 and 2, respectively).

About Starcraft 2:

I am mainly a Zerg player... though I haven't actually played in a couple of years. When I was part of a small clan (and playing frequently) I managed to make it to high-diamond in 1v1. I achieved multiple master-level in all teams. But, I'm mostly waiting for the new exp before I become active again.",t3_30yqgc,t3_30yqgc,1427993075,False,cpz0qy8,t1_cpz0qy8

I often wonder when people bring up ''I'm only proud of my own achievements'' if they're ever proud of something like a friend, or a family member for their achievements. For example I might not have fought in the second world war but I'm proud my blood or someone that bore my genes had the courage to take up arms.

So why isn't it stupid to be proud of your nation or even continent? Because you helped build it. Through voting, through paying taxes, through helping the community, through military service. You've made sure the nation can and will persist. Because without you, the nation wouldn't be the same. Granted, it'll only be a single brick out of a giant wall. But destroy enough of those bricks and it'll collapse.

So you were born here, and it forced you into it. So what? Are you ever proud of how good you are at sports? Well, your genes and location allowed for it. If you were born without legs you wouldn't be able to play football. Every single achievement we have is because luck in combination with effort allowed for it. We were lucky to be born in Europe, sure. But without our contribution, or the contribution of our ancestors. Europe just wouldn't be the same.

The government subsidises tertiary education for citizens, and provides an interest free (excepting inflation adjustments) loan on all tuition fees if you choose to accept it. This loan is paid back through voluntary repayments (which you receive a discount for making) and mandatory deductions from your income that begin once it reaches a certain figure - I think it's 4% of your income once you start earning more than ~$40kAUD

I owe $19,000AUD in tuition fees. I'm four years into a three year Arts degree with a minimum of another two to go. Due to my culture not believing in mental illness, I never had my ADHD treated and failed a lot of subjects. I'm still not doing very well.

My mandatory repayments have already begun since I dropped down to part-time school to accommodate for a well-paying full-time job that I love, that I didn't need this degree (that I still haven't finished) to get, in a company/industry that I see myself in for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, also due to my culture, not finishing my degree is not an option for me, as it would be dishonourable. However, I was not the eldest, or male, or of racially pure blood, so I did not receive any financial assistance from my family.

Although I know I have it good compared to the American education system, I still worry about whether this will change, and I feel envy that I don't have it as good as many European education systems. Our current government is trying to push through fee deregulation, which would see university course prices soar to American levels, and considering I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, these fees may even surpass American tuition fees. I fear my performance at school is so poor that I may still be attending class when this legislation passes.

It's been thwarted for now, but the ruling class is so close-minded, corrupted, and determined, that I feel like it's only a matter of time that it does. It's gotten to the point that I find it a constant struggle not to polarise baby-boomers in my mind as selfish, arrogant, evil people who have let their wealth go to their heads, who outnumber us, who will be a burden on the backs of the young as they demand their pensions, our rent, our life force.

I stay awake at night over whether I will ever pay this debt off. Over whether I will ever own a home or even continue to afford to rent in an area a reasonable distance from my work. I harbour a lot of resentment towards the generation who are trying to pass a debt sentence on me - who own the homes I can't afford to rent or buy, and who received their university education for free.

2 reasons: 1 there were actual breaks between coalition wars and the peace of Amiens in 1802 provided a real, short truce from all major wars same with the gap between the 6th and 7th coalitions (weak argument) 2. while there are some problems i have with the specific naming of the coalitions (the fourth coalition is ""really"" just prussia joining the third coalition late after the crushing defeat at Austerlitz which knocked austria out of the war soon after) they do highlight some important diplomatic points. 

Given how dominant France was her numerous campaigns saw (with the exception of Britain) pretty much every state in Europe compelled to support him at one point or another while facing a changing cast of enemies at each specific time. Splitting ""the napoleonic"" or napoleonic/revolutionary wars into  coalition wars lets us separate the ""wars"" out by diplomatic relations (e.g. 3rd coalition involves ""the third coalition created against a revisionist france""). 

I would argue we actually do sort of view it as one continuous war also: ""the Napoleonic Wars"" but by splitting them/it up into multiple coalition wars we have a better sense of who is fighting who over what.

&gt;

&gt;__Blood sausage__ is a generic name for a type of [sausage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage) made by [cooking blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_as_food) or dried blood with a filler until it is thick enough to congeal when cooled. The dish exists with different names in various cultures from Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig), cattle, sheep, [duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck), and goat blood can be used depending on different countries.

&gt;In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and [the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americas), typical fillers include meat, fat, [suet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suet), bread, [cornmeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornmeal), [sweet potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato), [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] onion, [chestnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnuts), [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley), and [oatmeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatmeal). In [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_cuisine), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal), and Asia, potato is often replaced by rice. In [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya) fillers are fresh minced goat or beef, fat, and red onions.

But have you heard about the Japanese debt crisis? No? Because there isn't one, even tough Japan's national debt is 230% of their GDP. Yep, after adjusting for the size of their economies, Japan is in a hole that's 2.3 times deeper than Greece's, yet that doesn't make the international headlines.

The US national debt is also around 100%, and that's not all that bad, actually. For historical perspective, at the end of WW2, it was around 130% of GDP.

So what makes Japan and the US different from Greece? Greece borrowed money from foreign entities. Over 90% of Japan's debt is owned by the Japanese. Essentially, Japan owes itself money. Similarly, the vast bulk of US debt is held by Americans. This is why there's no debt crisis--when the money a government owes is mostly to their own citizens, there's no problem. It's not a ""mortgaging of our future"".

Well, not quite true: There is a problem. It means that government is spending more than it's collecting in taxes. This is not surprising, given how much the top *marginal* rate had been cut over the years. Back when Eisenhower was President, the top marginal rate (paid by the richest) was **over 90%**. George W. Bush cut that from 39.6% to 35%. Although most of us directly or indirectly (through retirement funds or bank accounts that, in turn, invest in government debt) own some of that debt, much of it is owned by the wealthy (in fact, one reason why interest rates are so low is because during economic downturns when stocks and other assets are decreasing in value, buying up US Treasury Bonds was basically the safest investment anyone could make--yes, the Fed sets target rates, but that's only half the picture--there's still lots of demand in the market for Treasuries even though their yields are at historical lows). Essentially, this high debt represents a long-term wealth transfer from the poor to the wealthy, as it's money government owes mostly to the rich, at a time when the rich are paying a decreasing share of taxes.

Finally, you'll notice that I've left out China. They hold about a trillion in US national debt. That's a big headline-grabbing number. But it's largely irrelevant for a few reasons. First, a trillion is only about 10% of US debt. Second, they hold this money because US Treasury Bonds are sold on the open market--i.e., anyone who wants to buy them can buy them. It's not ""Oh, we can't find someone, so let's turn to the Chinese"", but rather, ""They happened to want to buy them, and we don't discriminate"". If they were to somehow stop buying them, there's still plenty of demand. Finally, the reason China snaps up so many Treasury Bonds and other dollar-denominated assets is because they need to in order to maintain their currency manipulation. China is deliberately making sure their currency is undervalued, and one way to achieve this is to buy up tons of foreign-denominated assets to drive up the demand (and value) of the dollar and other currencies relative to the Chinese RMB. Why does China want a strong dollar? Because a strong dollar means that Chinese exports are more competitive in the US and US exports are less competitive in China. Judging from the disparity between China's nominal GDP and PPP GDP, the Chinese RMB is about half of what it's really worth. In other words, if China stopped buying US debt and doing other things to manipulate their currency, imported Chinese goods will cost twice as much--that would fix our trade imbalance pretty quickly.

**Edit:** Also, when our debt-to-GDP ratio has gone down in the past, it's mostly by the GDP growing faster than the debt. If the debt represents the government investing in the economy (education, infrastructure, etc.), then this investment spurs growth in the GDP. Also, people have mentioned that because our debt is denominated in dollars, we can print our way out of it if we wanted, and I'd like to add a couple of comments to that. Yes, this is true (though in today's economy, it's more about bits in the Federal Reserve's computer than actual ink-on-fiber). There are downsides to this, and it's more of an escape hatch than something that would actually be used. That said, ""printing money"" isn't always necessarily bad: inflation/deflation is complicated, as it's the result of the supply *and demand* of money as well as things that are entirely out of the purview of monetary policy, like global oil prices. The Fed controls the supply of money and nothing else, which means even if the Fed does not change the supply of money at all, there would still be inflation or deflation from those other factors outside of the Fed's control (this is also the ELI5 for why the gold standard is idiotic and anyone advocating its return is dangerously ignorant). The Fed's goal is to use its control of the supply of money to counteract those other forces in order to maintain a stable price level, with a healthy, modest amount of inflation (too much inflation is bad, but deflation is even more dangerous, so the Fed tries to steer things towards a optimal middle ground). So the Fed has been ""printing"" a lot of money of sorts during the financial crisis, because the economy was about to nosedive off a deflationary cliff--not to pay off US debt (because, again, that's more of an emergency escape hatch), but to stabilize price levels. (In contrast, the European Central Bank, which hasn't been well-governed and lacks the level of political independence of the Fed--they were beholden to Germany's dogmatic worship of austerity--refused to use quantitative easing until it was far too late, which is why parts of Europe sank into the deflationary quicksand and imploded.) And in times of runaway inflation, the Fed tightens the money supply (e.g., Volker in the early 1980's).",t3_3171gr,t3_3171gr,1427995920,False,cpz2mgc,t1_cpz2mgc

Only Australia and US are delusionnal at a point I never saw before. Even Germany shut her mouth.


The issue is that both Russia and Central Asia see China as a market. And in that respect, there is no conflict.

For Russia and China today in Central Asia, the word “co-operation” is far better an operative than “rivalry” out of economic and political necessity if nothing else, and in spite of national diversity and value difference beholden in the region. IMO

Culturally, Central Asian countries are more Russian than Chinese in terms of languages and some customs acquired over the years as part of former USSR.

Religiously, Central Asian countries are more Chinese than Russian in terms of Muslim faith. (Within Chinese there are about 20 million Uighur Muslims and 20 million Hui Muslims).

Economically, Central Asian countries are more out of the planned and compartmented USSR days than the more free-trading pursued by today’s China and Russia.

As such, it’s fitting and significant that Shanghai Cooperation Organization nations (“SCO of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) made a point at the SCO Summit  held in 2013  unanimously they already  decided to revitalize a modern day Silk Road reconnecting Asia and Europe through Central Asian steppes commercially, and to establish a SCO development bank to further such end.

For such efforts, there’s everything to gain and nothing to lose by each Central Asian nation including the SCO members and SCO Observer states

As such there is no reason to construe zero sum rivalry between Russia and China, and there’s even less ground to take purported “Sino phobia resentment"" to heart, being so unwittingly otherwise highlighted in the Economist  article.

I do actually think that him on fncis actually a good move tho, I think fnc have a really really good frontline and enough playmakers that rekless would be able to do his thing in his comfort zone without much pressure, he's not a guy like forgiven where you give him everything and he will carry you hard, he's better suited as a secondary carry imo.

&gt; Eis o principal problema com esse raciocínio: quando investidores investem, eles estão, na prática, comprando um fluxo de renda futura.  **Para que investidores invistam capital em atividades produtivas, eles têm de ter um mínimo de certeza e segurança de que terão um retorno que valha alguma coisa.** 

O retorno deste investimento depende da estabilidade da moeda, se depois eu preciso de mais reais por dólares, ou mais reais para comprar algo meu poder de compra diminuiu.

&gt; Mas se a unidade de conta é diariamente distorcida e desvalorizada, se sua definição é flutuante, há apenas caos e incerteza.  Se um investidor não faz a menor ideia de qual será a definição da unidade de conta no futuro (sabendo apenas que seu poder de compra certamente será bem menor),  **o mínimo que ele irá exigir serão retornos altos em um curto espaço de tempo.**
&gt; 
&gt; É por isso que nenhum país que tem moeda instável e com baixo poder de compra produz bens de qualidade e que são altamente demandados pelo comércio mundial.  Todos os bens de qualidade são produzidos em países com inflação baixa e moeda forte.  Apenas olhe a qualidade dos produtos alemães, suíços, japoneses, americanos, coreanos, canadenses, cingapurianos etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Uma moda fraca e instável, portanto, não apenas afeta todos os preços internos de um país (se a moeda está fraca, então será necessária uma maior quantidade dela para adquirir o mesmo bem), como também enfraquece toda a economia.
&gt; 
&gt; Não há escapatória: moeda fraca, investimentos baixos, economia fraca, carestia alta. Sem exceção.

O mais importante é: O real já perdeu mais de 91% de valor desde sua criação alem de ser uma das moedas que mais desvalorizou perante as outras. Isso não se deve a mágica ou crise internacional.

At the end of the day it's a lot easier to create scores and win conditions based on the amount of land owned and number of wars won, rather than cultural and social values. Those are a lot more personal and abstract, and thus more difficult to incorporate in a tasteful way in a huge game like this. concepts like society, culture, zeitgeist, art &amp; literature, human contacts, traditions &amp; conventions,etc. are incredibly complex and it's practically impossible to fully grasp those concepts and feature them in your game in a meaningfull way, without causing some massive backlash. Add to that the variable of player agency and you might end up with some rather unfortunate results.

As for non-European nations functioning exactly like European ones, I think that, again, can be appointed to the need to stay pragmatic. These nations are mostly just playable in the expansion packs, so I think that they wouldn't spend a lot of time and resources into the creation of an entire new system of ruling. It would be impossible to create for each ""nation"" (really, even countries in Western Europe are generalized in this, if you were to draw the line much further), and it would be impractical to play, since you would need to relearn the game with every new playtrough. As for being able to play them, I think they're mostly added for the novelty and added difficulty for more experienced players, who'd want a challenge.

I'm still under the assumption that the Eurocentrism is in the game to fully immerse the player into ""roleplaying"" a European ruler, rather than posing an argument about history, or providing introspection. I would fully support it if one were to create a game with some meaningful insight in history, and I'm curious to what the result would be, since it would be a very ambitious project. If I have to be completely honest though, I don't see a strategy game working as a medium to deliver that message, since it's an extremely loaded subject, with a lot of nuances, and it could spike a lot of controversy if handled poorly.",t3_2y7wrm,t1_cpyxabb,1428000309,False,cpz4up2,t1_cpz4up2

For example I think last I checked the avg pakistani birth rate in the UK was 2.70. Yes, that is down from an average of about 5 in the 1950s, but 2.70 is still vastly higher than the native rate. Immigration was never a problem when people had enough kids. When you have enough kids to replace yourselves, immigration is not a problem. The problem is when the population stagnates and you fill in the gaps with immigrants. Then you get tension. A good way to relieve anxiety over immigration would be to somehow attain a birth rate of above 2.10 for native europeans. The fact is all countries in europe are based on an ethnicity, and it's only in the last 30 years that we've seen a huge increase in immigration, largely in the name of GDP.

You make several grammatical errors throughout the article, something quite common among today's amateur (and unfortunately sometimes ""professional"") e-sports journalists. I'm of the opinion that, since it really is as simple as starting a WordPress blog, the percentage of ""trained"" journos creating content like this has gone down. 
  
This isn't a particularly bad thing. I believe with time and practice you can improve and excel. 
  
Of course, I wouldn't bring these issues up without offering a few examples.

Paragraph one:

&gt;This article has later been confirmed
  
You combine past tense (has been) with future (later). 
  
A better way might be: **""The article was later confirmed""** or **""The article has since been confirmed""**

Paragraph Four:
&gt;He himself thinks that he is at least on the level of Henrik “Froggen” Hansen, arguably the guy to beat, *as he is often considered as the best European midlaner since season 2.* 
  
Who is, Jensen or Hansen? Of course, we as fans know you mean Froggen, but since your clause (the part between the commas) is only *arguably the guy to beat*, the rest of the statement is referring to your subject, in this case the pronoun ""He"".
  
A better way might be: **He himself thinks that he is at least on the level of Henrik “Froggen” Hansen, arguably the guy to beat as Hansen is often considered as the best European midlaner since season 2.**

Paragraph Two:
&gt;on one of his account

Simple plural mix-up, but I caught a few of them sprinkled around. Should be: **on one of his accounts**
  
   
   

There are similar examples throughout the piece, but this comment isn't meant to shit on your writing. Instead, I would suggest finding an editor with writing skills you are confident in to double-check your stuff before publishing if your goal is to push the best content possible. If not...fuck it. It reads fine for just being a casual hobby.

In the Han Solo and Lando Calrissian tales from the 80s, shields were a support layer within the armor plating of the ship itself and provided structural integrity for the ship as it pulled high-G maneuvers. This was an early attempt to explain why shields are never shown absorbing damage in the movies, the shots always hit the ship itself. This was prior to the existence of the lore authorization committee, but it should/could have served as the basis for their work.

Then the Corellian trilogy posited that shields were only turned on when engines and weapons were not used, because supposedly the shields would block the emissions of those pieces of equipment if they were active at the same time. However, it was now canon that shields were a bubble surrounding the ship, not embedded within its armor.

Then by the X-Wing series shields were canonically declared both a bubble system as with the Corellian trilogy, but they would blink off for the fractions of a second necessary to allow the weaponry to fire out of them, and they were tuned such that they did not block the emissions of the engines. This allowed for the gaming-consistent representation of shields as an always-active protective bubble around the ship, and everything was nice and happy.

.....and then the source books (New Guide to Weapons and Technology specifically) said that shields were layered like an ~~ogre~~ onion, starting as a bubble and layering down to be a final layer within the ship's hull itself, bringing everything ""in line"" but still managing to contradict everything at the same time.

Take English Premier League for example, teams there are importing all the best players they can get and offering them higher wages and better conditions. You often see that good players from other strong leagues join EPL teams, but you rarely see talented English player going to other league. Simply because its much easier and cheaper for clubs to find talent from their country and get them to sign for less money, than to import some talent from England, and if they're already importing they're most likely to import from region such as Korea that is in LCS as Brazil is in football. That doesn't mean that England doesn't have talent, just that if there's talent in England, it's much easier for English teams to notice it than teams from other countries. Overall importing isn't bad and it shouldn't be frowned upon, it's something normal and it makes scene stronger. EU fans can brag about Bjergsen, Incarnation(?) or Santorin being from EU, but they are representing NA teams and that's all that matters in the end.

NA LCS is bigger than the talent NA as region has. With other NA teams bringing good proven players from other regions other NA teams are forced to do same. It's much safer and faster to try to get some well known talent or proven player from Europe, China or Korea than to wait for NA domestic talent to show up. Also bringing player from different region usually sets expectations higher and gets fans more excited for the team.

Also to most EU playrs NA LCS is like promised land, especially if they get offer from top team. Being in NA LCS gives much more exposure and gains more fans than being in lets say H2K.",t3_317eiq,t1_cpz40ne,1428003064,False,cpz6n72,t1_cpz6n72

There are over 300 million non-military guns in the USA [source](http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/09/politics/btn-guns-in-america/index.html).

The US population is about 310 million. That means about 55 million people own about 200 million guns. The other 55 million people own about 80 million guns, which leaves around 20 million unaccounted guns.

We are somewhat exception. He seemed caught on the ""Americans think they are different"" thing, but that isn't exactly correct in this case.

I now live in Barcelona and although I'm yet to fully explore any local music scenes as much as I'd like to, there seems to be quite a few local ska bands, often rocking the latin ska sound.

I'd love to say that wherever you go you'll probably be able to find a scene for whatever type of music you want but I'm currently a bit bitter about being unable to find any breakcore type stuff here in Barcelona!

Yes, almost all the Syrian Kurds support rojava. The islamist-Kurds are a very little percentage of the Syrian Kurds.

&gt; That's the point of my question. I know that the PYD is the dominant political party in Rojava. I know they have support from other factions. But I wonder how much support they have among the people?

At least the support of the overwhelming majority. That's why even Assyrians and Shammar-Arabs decided to join the rojava project.

&gt; And how much of it's ideology is implemented in daily life? You seemed knowledgeable so I asked you. 

rojava operates via a very pleasing manner: every people can rule over their own territory inside Rojava. Plus every group has got an own representation inside the Rojava-councils. For example, the Assyrians have rule over their own villages and the Shammar-Arabs have rule over their own villages in Rojava. 

&gt; Because of your flair I used Liberal in the European sense, relating to Classical Liberalism, while the PYD proposes a Socialist economic model. 

well, there are almost no taxes on businesses/people in rojava. So they implement socialist liberalism in the sense that ''solidarity'' means that everybody gets the same benifits: almost no taxes and decentralization, but also a say in the government.   

&gt;  Hence why I said the KRG is Liberal dominated. As far as I know the KDP and the PUK both advocate a Liberal capitalist economic model.

Yeah, the krg is ultra-capitalist. The rules to open a business in the krg are one of the most liberal in the world.

&gt; Just to be clear, because I felt your comment was a bit defensive, I actually support similar ideology to the PYD. I'm actually curious about how receptive people in Rojava are to such ideas, and how the PYD actually implements Socialism.

I would call it more liberal socialism with a decentralized structure. It's a very unique structure but it works amazingly. Ideologically, rojava claims to be socialist, but practically, it is a mix of decentralization, socialism and liberalism.

I only typed what I did because it was late last night and I saw people here making arguments to OP that I thought had little to do with his actual CMV.  I was trying to come at it from an angle that everyone else wasn't: that maybe he's right about immigration being rough in the short term, but that building community and a concept of global citizenship is probably the path to the world being better in the long run.  

If you can't tell by all the spelling mistakes, I was half asleep writing that, but I do mean it.  I honestly wish the world was a better place.  And OP didn't seem *that* staunch to me - at the very least, he's making a CMV, so he's theoretically open to changing his views.  

In other comments, I actually pointed out to people that it's not surprising that OP is a bit iffy about the idea of immigration, especially by non-whites.  I'm ethnically Latvian, which is similar enough to Estonia: small, relatively isolated nation throughout European history, famine and virtual slavery during the Soviet era, nowadays a pretty decent EU country.  But: inhabited by almost entirely ethnic Baltic peoples and ethnic Russians.  Less than 1% non-whites; maybe one in a thousand people.  It's totally unsurprising to me that OP would see ethnically different people as a bit more ""different"" than I do, having grown up in a country where visible minorities are the majority in some regions.

First, making sure that the Eurozone rules are followed is absolutely essential for its survival. Before you can start thinking about adding more things like fiscal transfers or changing some things like debt ceilings or more tools for ECB, you need to form a basis to build on. And that basis is a common set of rules that everyone follows, without that there is no way for the Eurozone to survive and develop.

Second, Greece has amply demonstrated that it does not intend to follow rules, and the Greek voters have demonstrated that they want to elect governments based on the explicit pledge to not follow agreed terms. That is their right, but they cannot expect to remain part of the Eurozone or the EU in that case.

It's the whole Greek attitude that needs to change. They should say: ""The previous Greek governments, elected and representing the Greek people, have gotten us into a bad mess. We will now do everything it takes to get back on our feet (e.g., internal devaluation, selling government assets, etc. etc.) while honouring the obligations made in our name by the previous governments."" Instead it's just: ""Oh it's too hard, we can't do it. Give us money to pay our bills, but we're going to reject any conditions to place on the money, and if you don't give us money the whole of Europe will surely collapse.

Whilst the Europeans had built up immunity to these diseases, such as flu, the native Americans hadn't.Given the effects of urbanisation and globalisation, i think it is unlikely there are many isolated populations that could be affected this way.
The lack of variation between human populations means it would be very difficult to engineer a virus that affects one population, but not another. You'd have to find some sort of variation/mutation specific to one population. There is a mutation specific only to Northern Europeans in the CCR5 gene that provides immunity to HIV, however it's found at a fairly low frequency, so you couldn't just infect a load of people and expect only Asians, Africans etc to be infected.
Alternately, you could think slightly outside the box. Some populations rely on certain food sources; rice is the staple diet in many South Asian countries. If you managed to engineer something that wiped out rice, you'd likely see a crash in population, much like the Irish Potato Famine.

As for bigger, life-changing things which might take awhile for things to line up for me (for example, I want to move to the U.S.), I put subtler reminders around me. The background on my phone and laptop is of California, and I keep a bunch of dollars in my wallet. I've somehow ended up being employed as a US English editor (even though I'm European and live in the UK!) so I'm constantly learning US grammar and vocab, and see it as prep for when I move over. 

I actually had a specific view of Hollywood as my phone background last year, because I was dying to visit for the first time. But I had no money or time to take off work. Within months, work sent me over on a fully paid trip! I remember how awesome it felt to be standing up by the Griffith Park Observatory looking at the view, realising it was the exact view I'd put on my phone a few months back. Phone/computer backgrounds and Facebook cover photos are great because you see them so often.  

I also have a few postcards around my room of other places I'd like to visit, but I like to keep my walls clean, so they're just propped up here and there, like on my piano stand and bookshelf. In general, I like to feature things in my room that are match to what I want to draw more of into my life - for example if I like a certain book or magazine cover, I'll keep that at the top of the pile. And I hide anything I don't want more of, like bills, medical letters, medication, therapy workbooks, tattered clothes and shoes (the ones I bring out for when I'm painting or cleaning), etc. I'm also in the process of getting rid of old crappy guitars to make room for future, better ones.

Basically I agree. I just think Californians should support full integration of these migrant workers, which is a far cry from prevailing attitudes now, because it would pretty much end the problem. There isn't an infinite supply of illegal Mexican labor, and exploiting the ones there are is bad for everyone. Eventually these unsustainable practices would cease to make financial sense and then harvesting would be a job anyone of any race might choose, like in Europe. The problem is, most Americans haven't accepted the newest wave of immigration, which while it has its problems, is a geographical inevitability since we annexed the Colorado river and California. These people are definitely citizens of California, they've picked our crops for over 150 years. But legally they are silenced, so the only Americans involved in agriculture tend to be ownership, speculation, and management.  It's the kind of dynamic that was inevitably going to lead to catastrophic corruption.

The main point I think you're missing is that they're not just looking the other way. This situation (aside from the drought) is all very much part of the plan. Pro-integration people are trying to protect all Americans from unfair labor practices. The Mexicans have been growing all crops in California since there have been crops in California, so it's just a sign of total corruption that most of them aren't citizens. In fact it's silly to think of them as Mexicans, just think of them as one particular American demographic, and a huge amount of bull shit policy relies on keeping those particular Americans disenfranchised. Obviously they are ok with the status quo, but most people aren't, and agriculture in the south west in general is looking like a worse and worse idea. Self sustainability should be the goal here in terms of agriculture, and other farming could move to some of the states you mentioned already.

It's easy to observe in any religion that poverty breeds fundamentalism.  The heart of Christianity was in Europe, and religious tolerance took hold when there were these exciting things called colonialism and the industrial revolution going on.  It took large-scale cooperation to make the necessary capital investment to exploit those opportunities.

Basic evolutionary selection: the groups which managed to do less fighting and more commerce were hugely successful and, over the span of generations, simply out-competed the extremists.

Islamic countries haven't had similar economic opportunities.  The most hardline Islamic countries are the historically poorest.  The oil economy catapulted dirt-poor Arabs to extreme wealth, but that's both very recent (oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938) and didn't require native capital (the WWII powers were quite willing to put it in).

The current borders in the region were all drawn by a bunch of Oxford or Harvard boys using their knowledge of the region from classics classes - Iraq was, for example, heavily influenced by knowledge these people brought over about ancient civilisations in the region - Babylon, Assyria, Sumer etc. (ie, completely irrelevant stuff.)

All of that very much infuriated the people and by WWII they'd had enough - the West was being a prick and they all knew it. Many Arabs sided with the Axis against the West and through their extensive communications with the Fascist regimes of Europe, antisemitism became a much bigger force in Middle-Eastern politics.

Then, in 1948, Israel is created, in Arab eyes, *by the west*. The West, once again, muscles in, says 'Fuck it - put a Jewish state right here' and creates Israel. This, to the Arabs and Persians, is the *ultimate* proof of the crimes committed by the West. The smoking gun that the west is a meddling, evil, Arab/Muslim hating death machine. They were rabidly angry, feeling opressed, ignored and vengeful. Israel was the epitome of western evil and its very existence, regardless of which faith lived there or its reasons for existing, was testament to the wests crimes and represented decades of repression.

The Persians however, had their own borders by this time, forged over generations. Sure they had their issues with the West but not to the same degree as the Arabs. So, in 1948, the Iranians didn't go to war against Israel but continued quiet and peaceful relations with the new nation. They were fine with Israel because it didn't have the same negative connotations in Iran that it did for the Arabs. In 1953 however, a CIA/Mi6 backed coup in iran toppled the **democratic** government, and replaced it with a hated and repressive shah to get access to the oil reserves. Suddenly, the Persians were in the same West-Hating boat as the Arabs. That way, by the time the Shah was deposed in 1979, the Persians had come to see Israel the same way the Arabs had. A representation of the same shit that toppled Irans government and pillaged her resources. Therefore, to this day, they hate eachother.

But speak about 40 years of Soviet rule, and about years 1968-1989 in particular, which in my eyes was collaboration with occupants par excellence.

This kind of talk is precisely why you can't be taken seriously by some 96% of the Russians. Because the communists coming to power and trying to stay there by any means, including entering alliances with other communists, is rather parallel to the democrats coming to power and trying to stay there by any means, including entering alliances with other democrats, including the troops from the democratic armies being a couple of hours away from the major population centers. Yeah, communists were much more autocratic in their rule; but that was that way anywhere where they came to power.

&gt;that it will take lightly any remarks made by Russians about simplicity of conquering their capital in a few days anytime you wish.

Look, if you take two matter-of-fact objective statements: (1) ""Russia could take Prague in a week, if it so wished"" and (2) ""The US could take Prague in two days, if it so wished"" and then treat only one of them as incredibly offensive, no one in the world is under any obligation to waltz around your oh so tender sensibilities, if only because no one's under any obligation what'd you regard as offensive. Long story short, you finding things offensive puts no obligation on your interlocutors whatsoever.

&gt;I know you will not agree with me, but the fact that Russia annexed Crimea

Oh, and you honestly expected Russia to sit idly and let shit like Odessa Massacre happen? 

&gt;raised insurection in Ukraine

Oh right, the locals were just ecstatic to be spit in their faces repeatedly and to have open Nazis overthrowing the government.

&gt;send its submarines to the coasts of european countries, send its warplanes to the victinity (and into) of their airspace menacing civilian flights

You mean, like the NATO countries have been doing since 1991? For more than ten years Russia stopped any long-distance patrols; take a guess, did the NATO ever stop skirting the Russian borders? Do you think the SIGINT planes have their transponders on? Or did you believe that we'd tolerate this bullshit endlessly without any action on our own side?

&gt;Linguistically, ""collaboration"" implies more or less equal partners who work together

Are you now going to seek refuge in particularities of the finer meanings of the words? Yet even if you read the very thing you quoted, it directly says that the term applies in common usage to the people who worked with or for the Nazi German occupiers. Are you seriously, with a straight face, going to claim that Czechoslovakia in its vast majority did not? All the while Česká zbrojovka, Skoda et all happily worked for the Germans throughout the war?

&gt;they killed over 80 000 civilians here (which represents some 1% of population) during 6 years of their rule.

Which is less than they killed in Germany (you know, all these undesirables, communists, homosexuals, Jews, draft evaders). By about, what, two orders of magnitude? Also, a nitpick, but 80k is not 1% of a 38m population.

&gt;How many killed and executed is enough for you to consider nation resistant?

That's an interesting question; obviously you can't quantify it numerically (like, ""x.y percent of the population was in the Resistance, so there was no mass collaboration""), so obviously we'll have to go with something more solid. Like the results of the resistance's actions: whether the local industry kept working for the German war effort; whether Germany had to pull army units off the fronts to ensure order; whether the patrols from these units were afraid to walk badly lit streets at night (remember, there was no body armour back then, and hardly any man-portable radios), whether high-profile German officers were consistently targeted, whether there were local rebellions, among the general population as well as German auxiliaries, etcetera. 

And before you claim that the Czechs were just up against an overwhelming force, remember that even the UPA bandits held out until mid-50ies, checking off a couple of achievements above in their areas of operation well into the 40ies.

&gt;What I'm curious now is wheter you are just some happy troll like /u/istinspring or no.

Hahaha, oh man. If trolling was what I was after, I wouldn't need to write pages of text, a couple of sentences would work well enough.

&gt;I know I told many things that insulted you

Again, haha. Nope. Not at all, after my discussions with Vlasov-worshippers who [photoshop WWII medals to spell ""good slave""](http://rufabula.com/media/upload/blogs_images/2014/11/25/Horoshij-rab1.jpg), or the Ukrainians who insist all Russians should be put down like rabid dogs, or the fine folks here who think Chechnya should be surrounded with a wall and poured to the brim full of napalm, or the people [drawing stuff like this](http://kavpolit.com/media/redactor/2015/01/09/5_1ca49.jpg), for that matter, too.

&gt;So just out of curiosity I have to ask you - If I appologize for that insults and for charging you with threats of the invasion, will you do the same and appologize for your insults and for wrong accusations of my country of the collaboration?

As I've already said, it was never my intention to insult you, and neither to give any kind of emotional evaluations of Czechoslovakia's performance in the WWII. If you find some of my opinions insulting - well, too bad, those were the communists who cared about mutual understanding to the point of being willing to gloss over the unsightly sides of history for it; communism is long gone, so you'll have to challenge my arguments with yours. Backing down from my opinions just to appear like a nice guy would essentially amount to not being true to my word.

Pessoalmente, e em primeiro lugar, acho que a decisão em relação a ambos é precipitada. Ainda passaram muito poucos anos da morte da Sophia, e muito menos tempo da do Eusébio. Acho que isso condiciona a nossa visão colectiva sobre estas duas personagens.

No caso do Eusébio, acho que abre um precedente difícil de resolver. Os êxitos desportivos são quantificáveis, e o Eusébio até fica pior na fotografia, se me permites, que outros jogadores da bola, como o Cristiano Ronaldo (vamos lá colocá-lo também?). Nós conseguimos quantificar o valor de um Campeonato do Mundo, conseguimos compará-lo com uma Taça de Portugal, por exemplo, e sabemos que outros portugueses virão, que suplantarão o Eusébio, e depois deste o Figo, o Ronaldo, etc.
Por outro lado, a contribuição do Eusébio para o desporto nacional é mínima. Sim, foi um belíssimo jogador, marcou muitos e bons golos, ganhou campeonatos e taças, mas... melhorou o desporto? Melhorou o desporto nacional pelo seu exemplo? Acho que não. Como desportista bem sucedido, melhorou a vida de algum de nós? Não creio. O Eusébio era um bom futebolista, um homem simpático e honesto, mas a sua acção não revolucionou a nossa vida.

Acho que o importante aqui é a qualidade (e não a quantidade) dos feitos pelo país. Num sentido muito técnico, o que está no Diário da República é:

&gt;""As honras do Panteão destinam-se a homenagear e a perpetuar a memória dos cidadãos portugueses que se distinguiram por serviços prestados ao País, no exercício de altos cargos públicos, altos serviços militares, na expansão da cultura portuguesa, na criação literária, científica e artística ou na defesa dos valores da civilização, em prol da dignificação da pessoa humana e da causa da liberdade"".

Se concordarmos que isto faz sentido, então eu não consigo encaixar aqui o Eusébio. Mas consigo encaixar mais a Sophia que quanto a mim deixa um legado artístico e imemorial (a provar?). No entanto, quando fiz o meu comentário, estava a colocar os dois numa balança, a compará-los e por isto tudo, a dar preferência à Sophia. Como também referi, foram decisões precipitadas, tal como foi a da Amália Rodrigues, e por isso acho que nem um nem outro lá deveriam constar.

Em último lugar, também não acho que o reconhecimento internacional seja de todo um dado fundamental para qualificar alguém ao Panteão.",t3_316m3a,t1_cpyzq05,1428011732,False,cpzc5ht,t1_cpzc5ht

Additionally, the Arab Spring was happening in neighboring countries, and the region was filled with unrest.

This is the Amourette Halfcup: 

http://de.triumph.com/AMOURETTE%20300/10026158,de_DE,pd.html?q=amourette#!i%3D8%26color%3D6653_Flashy_Pink%26size%3D070_B

You can tell it is the Halfcup from the padding inside the cup. Most stores with Triumph will have the Amourette Fullcup, but the halfcup will most likely be special order. 

Another great brand to check out would be Anita. While most of their bras are fullcups and thus not suitable for a shallow shape, their general basic cut with wide and soft wires and not too much projection suits a shallowish shape. 

And then of course there are the typical British brands.

1432162758,0,t5_2qqjc,,,0,False,,,todayilearned,0,2,2,Cha-Le-Gai,False,"A very very simplified version is England wanted trade with China, China wanted to export Chinese goods but not import English goods, East India Company wanted to make money so they started selling drugs in the area that then flooded China. China was against the drugs and began fighting back, mainly confiscating opium, and EIC wanted money for their confiscated goods. England backed the company and went to war with China. That was the first opium war. There were also some political stuff and trade agreements. 

Now the second opium wars stemmed from the first. Once again the simplified version is England wanted to expand trade even more than the treaty from the first war allowed and China said no. China was really passive aggressive with the treaty, they still outlawed opium trade and weren't doing doing much to stop pirates from attacking European ships, by this point France had gotten involved in trade too.

England started registering friendly Chinese owned ships as English ships so Chinese boats now flew English flags, then they waited for China to pick on these Chinese citizens. Since China was known for mistreating Chinese friendly to the English. A Chinese pirate ship The Arrow flew an English flag, although on an expired registry, and England took it personally as an insult and attack. Thus started the second war. Basically the same thing happened again except much worse. The US was involved in a couple of battles, the Russians pondered to England but didn't do much, and eventually the Anglo-Franc army defeated the larger but antiquated Chinese military forcing the emperor to flee and his brother signed another peace treaty opening up China to trade with the west, legalize opium trade, some other stuff. 

This huge embarrassment caused China to reconsider it's isolationist tendencies and led the the Chinese strengthening a period of modernization. So while oplum trade was illegal drugs in general were seen as part of the downfall of the once great Qing dynasty. 

These are the highlights from memory, but there is lot more interesting and politically complicated stuff I'm forgetting.

1) The concern about discrimination is based exclusively on events during a time when discrimination was essentially mandated by law, whereas there are no laws mandating businesses discriminate against gays.  When European immigrants came here they encountered voluntary discrimination, yet in a short time this discrimination voluntarily stopped.

2) Zero businesses in Indiana has said they will refuse to serve gays.

3) The issue isn't whether gays will be served, but whether a business will provide a service for a particular event.  It is the event against which some want to ""discriminate"", like if someone doesn't want to provide catering for a KKK gathering.

Não recomendo nenhum Android nesse preço. O Moto G de segunda geração é um pouco mais caro (não sei como você pretende pagar isso), o de primeira não compensa muito agora e o Moto E de primeira geração é meio sei lá.

Não conheço o Asus Zenfone pra falar bem ou mal, mas qualquer Android que tenha a UI modificada eu fico com o pé atrás.

Sobre o Windows Phone, eu fui usuário por 2 anos (um Nokia Lumia 820 e um Lumia 520 porque o primeiro quebrou). Hoje tenho um Moto G. O sistema em si é bem melhor que o Android (na minha singela opinião), porem o ecossistema de aplicativos é precário, e os aplicativos que tem sofrem um grande gap em relação ao Android/iOS (vide Instagram e afins). 

Eu gosto do Windows Phone (fui pro Android porque ganhei o Moto G de presente), mas pra recomendar pra alguém é difícil. Recomendo que você veja se os apps que você precisa e as funcionalidades que você quer vão estar lá. Se tiver, vai ser só alegria, mas se não tiver, recomendo juntar um pouco mais de dinheiro. Se tiver alguma duvida especifica pode perguntar.

Yes. Also [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade) which is how the West was also the one who allowed the Ottomans to rise up in Byzantium by making a crusade on a christian city. Pure genius. It is a bit of a stretch the argument you're making there. The west acted for its own good, Russian soldiers actually volontiered to help us. 



&gt;Additionally, even though I suppose it is impopular, Serbia owns its freedom to some extent to Austria-Hungary.


Ah yes of course we have to ""own"" our freedom to you. Typical arrogance of the West. Both Russia and Autria-Hungary profited from a weak Ottoman empire and used us to achieve that. But my grandfathers lives (and Russian lives) are what got us our independence, nothing else.


Then I have to remind you how it is also true that the same Austria-Hungary would later try to take away the freedom which we ""owe"" to them, annexing Bosnia (half Serbian at the time) and later trying to do the same to Serbia. Then they proceed to kill 60% of male population of Serbia while chanting ""Serbien muss sterben"". An almost completely successful genocide.


So yeah, fuck them and their ""help"".


This is how the West treated us. Russia never did any such thing, and as long as it doesn't I will continue ""liking"" them more.


In the EU we will be a vassal and nothing more. They will give us loans to conveniently build railways from our mines to their factories and tell us how they graciously saved us by giving us NATO bombing and ""freedom"".

Firstly there is the issue of whether the contract is of itself illegal.  Courts won't enforce contracts with a criminal purpose.  So if a Nigerian scammer says that he will send me $1M of stolen money if I send him a ""release payment"" of $30,000 the whole contract is unenforceable either way because it was always for an illegal purpose.

If I tell someone I'll pay them $100 a page for handwriting, that is not a a contract for an illegal purpose and is prima facie enforceable.

Secondly, there is jurisdiction.  The Nigerian scammers (as I understand it) base themselves in third world countries where they are essentially untouchable.  However, ""Arthur Dent"" is probably in a first world country.  So if ""Joyce"" pursues ""Arthur"" in the US or UK or Western Europe, Arthur is vulnerable in a way that ""Joyce"" is not.

[Edited to add] And actually thirdly there is also the financial aspect.  Most scam the scammer operations I've seen result in the original scammer having a vague, small, unclear theoretical entitlement to payment from the reverse scammer.  But this one results in a straight up $300,000 payment owed by Arthur.  You can do things for that kind of money.  ",t3_317wxc,t1_cpzffjj,1428019319,False,cpzgc3t,t1_cpzgc3t

Wait, so a single random guy writes a book in 1941, well after German had begun their aggressive, violent war and that's all of a sudden the Allies wanting to destroy ""Germany"" as a concept? I'm pretty sure Churchill wasn't carrying this book around and probably had never even *heard* of it. Should I post any of the similar whackjob propaganda produced by Germany- some of it even state sponsored?

&gt;he Jews had already made war against Germany in 1933 (Judea Declares War on Germany) 

By this point Germany had officially enforced anti-semitic policies, after supporting them unofficially for years. These policies of course were present within their platform for a decade.

Of course, the actual link is from a *single* newspaper that discusses boycotts of various goods. Boycotts and demonstrations are perfectly legal and even reasonable- even if you ignore the anti-semitic policies employed by Germany. Boycotting some goods is no way tantamount to ""Judea"" declaring ""war"" on Germany. 

&gt;even during and after WWI (Treaty of Versailles was crafted with the intention of leading directly to second World War).

It was a little short sighted, that's for sure but you're going to have to keep trying if you think there was some concreted effort to force *another* world war.

&gt;. For the longest time I had no idea why the Germans targeted the Jews in particular. 

It's extremely simple. It's about us-vs-them. That's a political tactic as old as civilization. 


&gt;The real villains of WWII were the Allies. 

Nah, it was pretty much the axis, you know, the ones who started and continued the whole ordeal.

&gt;From mass executions 

Mass executions you say?

Conduct of the Western Allies was considerably better than any member of the axis.

&gt; bombings of cities 

No one anywhere dismisses allied aerial bombardment (something the Germany did readily) as perfectly okay. You shouldn't speak to circumstances you don't know anything about. There aren't a whole lot of Bomber Harris apologists in the world.

&gt;Rheinwiesenlager

Ah you mean when millions of Germans, roughly five times more than expected, surrendered en masse and demanded the care of the Americans, who were still concerned with the care of the millions of *their own* men, millions of refugees fleeing from the east and the millions of civilians to care for- all across the backdrop of a shattered continent with hamstrung agricultural and industrial capacity where many of their supplies still had to come across an ocean, onto a tiny little harbour and then shipped off on trucks. Yeah. That thing.

&gt;war crimes were committed by all sides in the war

Yes. Absolutely.

&gt;and as such it is unfair to suggest that the Germans were uniquely evil

No one who reads the even littlest bit of history believes this. 

&gt; All school children are encouraged at very young ages to imagine being gassed, they are made to read books and watch movies that elicit very strong and unforgettable negative emotions. 

Sure, and you'd be surprised by the amount of maturity children at a young age are capable of. It's important that ""Holocaust History"" units focus on humanizing all parties. It's possible for even young kids to realize that people who do bad things aren't always frothing at the mouth cartoon supervillains.


&gt;Most commonly, it appears that the eastern Jews were not targeted or killed by faceless Nazis from Germany, but instead by the enraged Slavs whom they had oppressed since 1917

Eastern Jews were *particularly* targeted by Nazis. Non German jews were seen as inferior to even German Jews. They were also targeted by Soviets. 


&gt;we explain how the Holocaust was an historical inevitability

Sure. Judging by how jews have been treated trough history and given the political hotbed in central and eastern Europe at the time, it would be fair to say that someone was going to do something shitty.

It also depends what portion of your time you plan to spend in each of these regions. It will be more expensive to stay in Europe than Southeast Asia, for instance. 

All this said, really only you can know what you'll need to spend through careful planning and research. I'm sure you could bring prices quite low, but for all intensive purposes it seems likely you'll have to invest $3,000-$4,000 at the bare minimum. 

This is esp. true since it looks like your plan will require at least three flights. Assuming you're in the US, flying to Europe will probably run half a thousand or just over if you get tickets early. Europe to Southeast Asia will be similar, and then going back could be quite expensive if you're leaving from Southeast Asia. If you include possible baggage fees for the supplies you'll need to backpack, travel costs may easily occupy the majority of your budget. I'd say you can put $1,500 into travel on the low end.

Backpacking equipment won't be too much, and if you already have supplies, nothing at all. Expect to pay a few hundred for a good backpack and hiking shoes, but it will be fairly cheap compared to most costs.

If you live on the very low, but doable amount of $20 per day, the cost of living will be ~$3.6k. But some of these days will be covered by WWOOFing, so you could probably cut this by 2/3rds or even more if you were frugal.

I'd like to clarify, the United States has been involved globally since its birth. Albeit, not necessarily politically, but for the pursuits primarily of economics, principles and territory. Almost a quarter of all international agreements signed by the United States in the 19th century regarded trade. Not to mention, the Monroe Doctrine at this time focused on complete US influence of the whole North and South American continent (more so the South). This involvement continued well into the coming decades involving various nations of the East, Spain and both World Wars.

As for Communism spread? It was very possible but there's a catch. The Marshall Plan, large sums of aid and loans provided to the European continent for rebuilding was primarily to combat influence by the USSR. Communism had communities around the globe and to be left alone to utilize the atrocities of war could rally support under the USSR umbrella. The catch however, was Stalin. He valued one thing over anything, and that was his power. Although he fought for Communism, what came with it was a reign of terror and death that eventually became so engrossed with Soviet Socialism that they couldn't be separated as his successive Soviet leaders tried but failed to do. This is one of the significant reasons why the United States was able to combat the Soviet's so well on an ideological level.

Being involved with European politics isn't a bad thing. The world of today is becoming multi-polar or full of many active and significant players in the game of international relations. Forging peaceful and strong connections is important for not only the United State's security, but global security as well as the prosperity of humanity. George Kennan in American Diplomacy brings up a valid question regarding World War I. What if the United States merely participated earlier through increasing its power and dialogue with Europe? It is possible, by participating and showing Europe that the threat of the United States entering earlier on, preferably on the side of the UK which was policy at the time, may have increased the costs of war so much for the Axis that it simply wasn't worth starting at all. Rather, instead the US ignored Europe which entered into a bloody, horrible and disastrous war that eventually led to the Second World War. Is it a guarantee that it would prevented WWI? Not at all, but it certainly would not have made it worse as the United States eventually did enter the war.",t3_311jr9,t1_cpyfxhw,1428024754,False,cpzj7ua,t1_cpzj7ua

I don't want to sound like too much of a fanboy but I cannot help myself. Seiko, at every price level, offers something that directly competes with equivalent Swiss or German watches. The only reason a higher end Seiko isn't on every watch enthusiast's wrist is because decades of successful marketing has convinced us that the only valid expensive watches are produced in Europe. This leads people to think, ""1k or more, for a *Seiko* ? No thanks!"" The problem is compounded by the fact that most Westerners are only introduced to Seiko through their mall quartz watches, something Seiko could easily change but apparently does not feel the need to. 

No matter. Anyone that does even a modest amount of research into the brand will discover a hundred years of meaningful horologic history and a company that produces a quality watch for every style and budget, all the way up to the horological high end, all of which being made completely in-house. 

People often state they find it hard to romanticize an expensive Seiko, because it's *only* a Seiko. If you take the time to learn and discover, you'll find wearing a Seiko feels just as esteemed as wearing a Rolex. Indeed, strapping the Marinemaster to my wrist feels just as significant as strapping on my EII 16570.  I'm damn *proud* every time I wear a Seiko.

PILLARS OF CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL POLICY

1. ""Most new drugs are 'life-saving' and must be rushed to patients who need them.""


    a. Most new drugs not for life-threatening conditions. Perhaps 10 percent.

    b. Independent reviewers judge about 90% new drug products as little or no better against clinical measures of improvement or less harm. Consistent pattern for 40 yrs

    c. Therefore about 1% new drugs would be “life-saving.” (10% x 10% = 1%)

    d. Most R&amp;D spent on developing minor variations. Most marketing spent on them.

    e. Inverse Benefit Law of widespread marketing that dilutes benefits and proliferates risks of harms.



2. ""The FDA screens out unsafe and ineffective drugs. Approved drugs are safe and effective.""


    a. Better than placebo means new drugs may be less effective than existing ones. No useful evidence for prescribing or how new drug compares to others.

    b. Non-inferior means new drugs are no worse than -20% the comparator drug. No useful evidence on how superior new drugs are, if they are.

    c. Evidence on risks of harms in minimal. From company trials designed to minimize evidence of harms.

    d. All evidence on a carefully chosen, ideal population most likely to benefit and not have adverse reactions. Real patients and real patterns of use usually less beneficial and more harmful.

    e. Since 90% of new drug products are little or no better, they cannot be safe.

    f. Aside from in-class choice, are the FDA and EMA flooding the market with ineffective, unsafe drugs?



3. An epidemic of harmful side effects (with few offsetting benefits).


    a. the 4th leading cause of death. About 113,000 deaths just in hospitalized patients.

    b. About 2.5 million serious reactions and 1.7 million hospitalizations.

    c. About 50 million adverse reactions, mostly mild but impair performance &amp; judgment

    d. A major cause of falls, accidents, anti-social behaviors.

    e. Risks of harm increase through cascade effect and take multiple drugs.

    f. Harmful side effects generate more sales.



4. Market is flooded with new drug products of little or no advantage that consume 80% of increased pharmaceutical costs. Harmful side effects generate more sales.


    a. A self-reinforcing syndrome: high prices, protected by government from free market competition, fund the development of these drugs and their costly marketing, which generate more revenues to develop more of these drugs.



5. “US prices have to be high to recover $1.7 billion in R&amp;D costs per new drug and recover what lower prices abroad do not recover.”


    a. The $1.7 billion figure is inflated from unverifiable R&amp;D costs which companies have strong incentives to inflate from the start. Half the “costs” are estimated profits that companies would have made if they had not invested in R&amp;D for new products vital for their survival. Another half are costs subsidized by taxpayers. Then the $1.7 billion estimate is based on the most costly 20 percent of new drugs but attributed to all drugs – a three-fold distortion. Just these three factors mean you divide by 12 to get $0.14 billion. Another third of the total comes from backing in a high amount for the unknown cost of discovery. And there’s more… See “Demythologizing the high costs…”

    b. The BMJ article “[Foreign free riders and the high prices of US medicines](http://www.pharmamyths.net/foreign_free_riders_and_the_high_price_of_us_medicines__click__96359.htm)” drew on data from the National Science Foundation, companies and government to conclude that companies earn back all expenses and make a profit at Canadian and European prices. US high prices simply make extra profits from government protections from free-market competition.

    c. The USA is the primary market where drug companies raise prices each year on last year’s models because they are protected from free-market competition.

    d. Pharmaceutical companies will make solid profits under bundled payments that rein in high prices.

    e. Cancer drugs should be relatively cheap. First, most R&amp;D is paid for by others, not companies. Second, trials are smaller and shorter than for other drugs. Third, in most cases we have no verifiable evidence that manufacturing costs are higher. Why, then, are cancer drugs priced higher than statin drugs? Most cancer drugs cause serious harms and provide little additional benefit, with exceptions.

On the 3rd of December, 2041, President Antonio Gladwell of the United States signed Order 39.53.C, which granted the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) over 48 billion dollars of additional funding for a manned mission to Enceladus. Over the next year, the mission became highly publicized and became somewhat of a global event. Conceptual work for the Falcon Scott began, as the bright young engineers at NASA worked day and night to get the mission going. Next, came the crew.

In 2043, NASA opened up applications for positions onboard the Falcon Scott. Initially they planned on a four-man crew, but after seeing the incredible response from the applicant pool, they expanded the mission to six on board. Among the finalists were Dr. David Banks, the Clinical Microbiologist who had made quite a name for himself in the field for his ground-breaking research on the now-treatable H3N2 Influenza strained that plagued much of Europe in the late 30s.

After several additional rounds of interviews and medical physicals, Dr. Banks was selected.

The young bachelor physician brought a whole new aspect to the crew and the mission. While the mission had already brought new excitement to space exploration, the addition of Dr. Banks created a bit of a celebrity feel to the crew. In the six months preceding lift-off, he and the crew did numerous television interviews. There was even a brief reality series depicting their training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The crew enjoyed their new-found celebrity and the perks that came along with it.

In addition to Dr. Banks, there were five other members of the crew: Shreya Mehta, the Punjabi engineer; Peter Arnette, the adopted Chinese-American geologist, Rebecca Sinclair, a petite blonde-haired Caucasian physicist from California, Emily Callender, a well-known red-headed chemist from Virginia, and Timothy Alden, a black British engineer whose work on nuclear reactors made headlines several years ago.

The six of them were frequently seen on newspapers, magazines, and television hand-in-hand wearing their dark blue jump suits with NASA embroidered on the left breast. For six months, they trained together and extensively learned each others personality strengths and quirks. They had become close to family by this point.

Because of its immense debts and obligations, the Empire was forced to both reduce its military and to disperse it across the globe. Historian Paul Kennedy correctly called the challenges facing the Empire at this time ""insoluble"".
Broadly speaking, the key territories of the Empire were the home nations, the Mediterranean territories, and the far east. It faced a serious enemy in all three territories, respectively, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Japan had become an increasingly probable enemy following the American imposed dissolution of the Anglo-British alliance.
The British calculated that if a war in Europe took place, Japan was likely to take advantage and declare war if the British shifted resources back to Europe. Thus, a war in Europe was not considered to be an option.
Chamberlain came to power well after appeasement had begun. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, and the German invasion of the Rhineland had all taken place without serious British reaction. According to Colville, Chamberlain took the view that a future war was likely, but that Britain needed time to rearm (and that rearming might prevent a war). As such, Chamberlain did everything within his power to delay a war while Britain armed. 

Chamberlain had few cards to play. Retrospective diminutions of the German military ignore the fact that in 1937 the Luftwaffe was superior to the combined Franco-British air forces, and that in 1940 the Luftwaffe's supremacy secured German victory in the Battle of France. Furthermore Chamberlain himself was not a military commander, and was reliant upon the advice given to him by his general staff.

Steven Richards

~~Triple H~~

The Undertaker

Of this group, Big Boss Man really isn't THAT viable, he's mainly coasting on heat from being a member of the Corporation in 98-99, and might even be gone by this point, since Buchanan is already in his RTC gear. Big Show was supposed to talk quite a bit in cutscenes and sound very whiny and un-likable, so Kane doesn't fit the role at all unless they want to take time to re-write the dialogue. He's out. Mr. Ass is either injured or buried at this point, having just been destroyed by The Rock and then kicked out of DX. His comeback after this was as ""The One"" Billy Gunn, yuck. Cut him. Rikishi is still with Too Cool at this point, and is a much-beloved babyface. Aside from feuding with Val Venis for the IC title, he can't fit this role without seeming VERY out of place, he's gone. The Undertaker had just made his big return and was white-hot, casting him as the whiny Big Show replacement would be a bad decision, he's out. So our final three are:

British Bulldog

Kurt Angle

Steven Richards

At this point, I'd honestly be happy if they chose any of these three, but I can see why they went with Richards. Kurt Angle was still involved with the Intercontinental title scene, and hadn't been bumped up to main-event status yet, although he was very close. British Bulldog, like Bossman, was coasting on past heat, but he'd fit into the ""Where's my title shot?"" storyline perfectly. I'd imagine he was passed over for someone with more name recognition at the time the game was released, namely Richards.

tl;dr It seems stupid at first, but Richards is the best choice",t3_3170sh,t1_cpz2cvq,1428031212,False,cpzmkbf,t1_cpzmkbf

What is your concern, exactly?  What control of this process do you think Obama had that would allow him to somehow trick everyone?

To what end and what would be the trick?  This wasnt just us - there are many nations 'on board' with this that would be at much higher risk if this deal was a stinker than the US is.

I understand your hesitation to trust the government, but, I dont see what sort of swindling you could possibly be worried about.

If anything, in my mind, Obama and Europe just made the best move they could have, in regards to the Middle East.  Get Iran closer to our side of the board, get them reliant upon us, even.  

Do you realize how fundamentally it will change the game in the Middle East, after lifting the sanctions, to be able to threaten them back in a few years?  We may have more leverage on them than ever before.

Saudi Arabia is not our friend.  Iran is not our friend.  There is no reason for us to support their proxy war by doing all this stuff for Saudi Arabia.  They can take Iran on if they want - I want nothing to do with it though.  And neither should you.

Do you want to take a moment to imagine the cluster fuck a destabilized Iran would be?  The end game all these war hawks wanted was Iran to be hit..  Do you understand the amount of technology and their population size?

Iran being destabilized will make Iraq look like a joke.  It would be fucking horrible.  We owe it to the world to try to avoid that scenario.  In my mind, if Obama is pulling any wool over our eyes its really how much of a clusterfuck he and the other nations on this deal just saved us from more than anything else.

Really - do some research on Iran.  Population densities, factions inside the country.. factions just outside their borders, hostile states nearby... a destabilized Iran may really be the worst thing that has some degree of possibility of happening in geopolitics right now.

None of us want destabilized Iran.  And now we will have direct inspections of their sites to ensure no bombs being made.  

I really dont see the downside here.  But you did say you didnt trust Obama, I just wanted to know what specifically you are worried about.

But by saying ""why this happened"" at least you are conceding that Yserbius is a liar.

During the Hebron massacre, 67 Jews were killed and the remaining 400 or so fled. Today there are somewhat more settlers there (700).    However, the Jews who were killed in 1929 were not some indigenous population, but were heavily European Ashkenazi immigrants from the 1800s, so your 'thousands of years' claim is rather dubious.

When you park your car in Europe on a dark narrow street, it's customary to illuminate the front and rear parking lights on only the side of the car that is exposed to passing vehicles (overnight).

To turn on these lights, your VW/Audi must be coded (VCDS/VAS/Vag-Com) for ROW (Rest Of World) spec lighting. Once your car ""thinks it's European"", you park your car, turn off the ignition, remove the key and use the turn signal stalk to illuminate parking lights on the driver or passenger side.

I presume this symbol exists on NA-spec cars because it would be cost-prohibitive to make separate stalks only for a single decal difference (the programming exists in the car's ECU, not the stalk itself).

Depende do que você acha justo. O problema da desigualdade econômica é que dinheiro da poder e não queremos ter um sistema em que os poderosos só fiquem mais poderosos com o passar do tempo. Mas é mais ou menos isso que acontece se você só taxa consumo. Como um super-rico com 10x mais capital que um pouco-rico não consome 10x mais, uma taxação apenas sobre consumo vai acabar taxando o pouco-rico mais que o super-rico e resultará em um aumento da desigualdade com o tempo.

Se o pais estiver em crescimento econômico forte, com o pobres ficando mais ricos e os ricos ficando ainda mais ricos, todo mundo está melhorando e não é tão ruim assim. Mas em situações econômicas mais estáveis (como o atual), o enriquecimento dos super ricos se dá com a queda do poder de compra dos mais pobres.

&gt;&gt;But Russia's deteriorating economic situation slows PAK FA production and state reduced its orders to 12 jets, according to statements by Yuri Borisov, the deputy minister of defence for armaments in March 2015.He stated 12 had been ordered but the final total was not yet decided, and no time scale given

India is unhappy with the plane and reporting major problems. Something Russia never does with its weapons. the next gen engine the izdeliye 30 has been tested yet. The plane currently has under-powered engines, and in general the thing has as many problems as the F-35. Russian engines have always been behind the west, with shorter life spans, and burn dirty/hot as well. They are great missile magnets.


&gt;and developing the armata platform for tanks and apcs. 

Ok? Lets see how many Russia will buy and how it will match up against the west. Doubt Russia will be able to afford many of them and anytime the US even questions something is a threat the US freaks out and counters it. Not something Russia can afford to do. Maybe it will spur the development of the M1A3 and an actually good APC. 

&gt;Half of the world buys weapons from Russia, there is a reason behind it (also because US won't sell them).

True here. Russia is fast losing market share in the arms market. China, Eastern EU, and other countries are offering the same sort equipment cheaper and with engineers behind it. Russia is very stubborn to give up engineering know how for its more advanced systems. It doesn't like allowing other countries to build copies of it.",t3_314fam,t1_cpyuv5k,1428036237,False,cpzor64,t1_cpzor64

Just because it shows positive incentive to work correlate with welfare given in Europe doesnt apply it to the rest of the world, but unless there is another study demonstrating otherwise, it wouldnt be remiss to assume humans are humans. This isnt a steadfast rule, just more evidence, each new study, each new journal article is just more evidence.

Are you sure you minored in it? I only took the first year entry level shit required for my science degree (statistics in genetics/molecular biology is really straight forward, its the softer science and doesnt need math). I ask this because your example was so crippling wrong. I dont usually accuse people of this shit, but your example was alarmingly incorrect in multiple areas.

Now my second accusation is: Have you even read the article or just the headline?

&gt;What questions were asked? How they were asked

Covered in the article.

&gt;... examined responses to the statement  'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' 

Also this: 

&gt;what i mean by that is if norway (The most generous had **80%** agree) had almost all of the sample size taken from it and only a few in estonia (The least generous had 40% agree).

You completely misunderstand the scope of the study. Its not sampling based on peoples feelings, its sampling based on peoples feelings in respect to the amount of welfare their country provides. It would be irrelevant if the sample size was twice as large in Estonia or Norway, its only in respect to their own individual country that matters.

Go to the ""Notes section"" of  
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/sp-gwb033015.php which OP's article used as source.

1. Countries are given a 'generosity' score based on several variables which are various social service and welfare benefits

2. People in those country's were surveyed on their feelings towards the statement I already copy pasted.

3. It seemed that countries with higher 'generosity' had higher rates of people willing to work.

4. Note that everything here is simplified, read the original shit before you straw man my words because I wont copy past entire paragraphs here. [full original article here (its free access too, so thats nice)](http://wes.sagepub.com/content/29/1/99.full) [pdf here](http://wes.sagepub.com/content/29/1/99.full.pdf+html)

Most of your complaints are easily solved by reading the original article and some of them can even be solved by reading OPs article. Surveys are evidence btw. Especially in sociology.

The player being new or a vet has zero bearing on whether the person is talented or considered ""talent"". No where was young bucks coming out of soloq mentioned. My comment meant there is still plenty of talented NA players on NA teams, especially the actual good teams. The 2nd and 3rd place teams in NA are 100% NA talent. TSM still has 2 members that are NA. While there is a lot of imports in NA the top teams compared to EU and even China have comparable number of imports. 

Although this has nothing to do with what I was saying, youre right, EU and every other region has produced more soloq talent than NA (and I was wrong, your number wasnt an exaggeration). NA does have a lot more than you gave them credit for though, such as Hauntzer, Bunny, Quas, Altec, Porpoise, Slooshi, Azingy, Apollo, Adrian, Gleeb, Mash/Mashme, Keith and Maplestreet as well as relatively new stars, Pobelter, Wildturtle, Xmithie and Zion etc who might count depending on how far back you choose to go. I definitely missed quite a few in teams passed (like XDG members, etc) and solid ones in the CS too. 

While Ill admit NA does have less soloq talent than other regions, I think the difference is actually a lot lower than a lot of people realize. I believe a lot of the imports we have arent because there isnt LCS level players waiting to fill spots in NA LCS, and more so that NA is a destination many international pros want to go to so a lot of NA teams, much like any other team in esports or any other sport, simply want to pick the best, most proven player available. I mean why test out and experiment with a promising soloq player when you can grab a former world champion, like Piglet or Impact. Even though Keith came in a performed even better than Piglet, teams still will go with Piglet 10/10 times because he is the proven pro. ",t3_312rdt,t1_cpys5m8,1428040077,False,cpzq5fe,t1_cpzq5fe

1432169806,0,t5_2t0cn,,Pelleas,0,False,third-Pelleas,,fireemblem,0,3,3,Glaceon10,False,"Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword, also known as Fire Emblem: Rekka no Ken,  though titled as ""Fire Emblem"" outside of Japan, is a good starting point. Among the easiest games of the series, alongside being, quite simply, a fun game. It also has no major gimmicks, thus it will be quite easy to transition between that and other Fire Emblem games.

Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is also a very valid choice. It is quite easy, easier than Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword, though still remarkably fun. To make it more forgiving for a newcomer, infinite grinding is an option, and can help you become more accustomed to properly leveling a team.

Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is another fantastic starting point. Again, it is among the easier games within the franchise, and you can learn the story of Ike, the famous Radiant Hero, and a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. It features a ""Bonus EXP"" system, which the player is given for preforming well. The player can then award this EXP to certain characters in order to help them level up. This makes the game quite easy, and, similarly to Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, can help you learn how to properly train units and build your teams. The issue, however, is that this game is incredibly expensive, often reaching a price of sixty United States dollars (or  €51.84) or so. It can, however, be easily emulated.

Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is also a very good starting place. It also has no major gimmicks, similar to Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword, though it is perhaps simpler and features Marth, the Legendary Hero-King, who you may be familiar with as that character in Super Smash Bros. You may enjoy learning about Marth's back story and origins, which can be quite easy to do, as Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is currently among the more common Fire Emblem titles in North America (and Europe, I believe), and is a remake of the very first title in the series.

As for Fire Emblem Awakening, only play it after you have played two Fire Emblem games or so. It is radically different from other Fire Emblem games, to a point that it will most likely give you certain expectations for the rest of the series, and will most definitely lead to disappointment when every game is so incredibly different. It will also lead to several poor habits which could effectively make you worse at the rest of the games in the series. It was my starting point, and some of those bad habits still haunt me.


TL;DR: Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword (the Fire Emblem which you mentioned), Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon are all fantastic starting points.

This is why Canada has a higher Co2 output per-capita than the US. They have very cold winters. Combine that with a large country and huge distances that need to be traveled and you get a larger CO2 output.

So Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark.... All have colder weather than most of the US, and yet Sweden manages to use less than 1/3 per capita than the US.

They are also all way up there on the GDP per capita list - 3 of 4 of them have a higher GDP per capita than the US.

Now please, tell me how it's because of population density (3 of 4 of those nations have a lower density than the US).

The **only** thing that matters, is how each of the nations have chosen their environmental policy. And the US clearly chose to use more, and save less.

If you just look at the taxation, to lower consumption, the US simply doesn't do it.

(Dirty)Energy isn't taxed to prevent consumption, be it electricity or gasoline.

The most sold car in the US, is one of the least environmental friendly you can possibly get. It's barely taxed at all.

I used to live in Montreal (more than 3 million people), and unless you know someone, you don't look at them, you don't acknowledge them, you stay in your lane. Germany so far has been different.  

And the only odd or outcasts I have met in my life were all in primary school. Primary school was good for me because I was just ""shy"", and not anxious or asocial. In High School, they were no outcasts. It was an all-girl school so I guess we just got each other's back (doesn't mean we all loved each other, but everyone had at least a group of friends).

&gt;__Donald Satterlee Day__ (May 15, 1895 – October 1, 1966) was an American reporter in northern Europe for the *[Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune)* in the 1920s and 1930s. As a broadcaster on German radio for several months during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), he argued that the United States should support Nazi Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Following the Allied victory over Germany, he was arrested by U.S. authorities and investigated for treason, but no charges were brought.

I remember logging on Silvermoon US, looking for a friend which I could never find (he was on EU) so 8 hours of downloading had to be repeated in pain while my friends outleveled me. The agony was real.

As a just manboychild I decided Human Paladin was the best choice, I was stunned by the awesome interactions of the game, I met a friend who had a level 60 mage, it was sick! My twin brother leveled a Rogue and we were in total 10 friends that battled to 60 (or atleast thought so). 

Keybinds was apparently a ""must"" so I found my numpad not used, a load of unbinded buttons! You should have seen me panicking to reach the mouse after pressing my numpaf binds, a real treat! 

After going in ass first through Deadmines, Scarlet Monastery, Zul'Farrak and Sunken Temple most of us hitted 60, we got a slam in the face when we had to continue towards 70 because BC had released two weeks prior. 

The lack of knowledge was one of the things that made it fun, we started raiding Karazhan. 10 headless chickens in a bowl. In arena I played a Holy Paladin with a twohander to aid the damage of my comrades, I remember clearly the smug comments of a Dranei Paladin that wrecked me. We ended up at 1900 rating, my god people were bad (including me). 

I've been playing on and off ever since, and right now I am still playing my Paladin as my main, I do not dare to check my /played, but I still sincerily enjoy the game. ",t3_316yny,t3_316yny,1428049603,False,cpzslt1,t1_cpzslt1

Singura lor armă e, în cel mai bun caz, un anumit „bun-simţism“ previzibil, oricînd pe placul ateismului militant.

Cum să faci un om dintr-un os?“. A coborî la un asemenea nivel e a comite marea imprudenţă de a ignora – cu un curaj sinucigaş – 2000 de ani de analiză de text şi comentariu expert (practicate de intelectuali prestigioşi, de la Sf. Augustin sau Origen pînă la Pascal, Heidegger şi Heisenberg), cu rezultatul că nu poţi depăşi stricta literalitate a unei cărţi, care se întîmplă să fie, pentru civilizaţia europeană, Cartea, o carte care e departe de a fi „la mintea cocoşului“, dacă te apleci asupra ei fără ţîfnă, fără voluptăţi polemice, fără histrionism scriitoricesc.

I'm always up for trying something a little less well known or otherwise exotic. Mavrud is a red Bulgarian grape. I've already tried a red once and found it quite decent, so let's try a white wine from the same grape. 


There is a local legend surrounding this grape. From Wikipedia: 
&gt; Legend contends that during the reign of Khan Krum of Bulgaria, all vineyards were ordered destroyed. Later, a lion escaped from its cage and terrorized the city. However, a fearless young man named Mavrud (now the name of a wine grape) confronted and slew the lion. The king summoned Mavrud's mother to learn the source of such courage. She said she had secretly saved a vine, made wine, and that this was the source of Mavrud's bravery. Khan Krum ordered the vineyards replanted.
&gt; 


So let's go on to describing the taste. I tasted it together with two other people. I found the nose a little underwhelming. From the label (written in terrible English) I thought I would be getting something more fruity or floral, but to my surprise it was subtly oak-like. The first sip I took was all almonds all the way. For me it was far too bitter. My two colleagues though, absolutely adored it! It is certainly rich and fatty, as the label describes. But that pear is, for me, only very subtle. I didn't give up though and about an hour later I tried again (not having had any other wine in between.) I found it had opened up a bit more and almonds had made way for a bit more fruit and pleasant acidity. It leads me to conclude that this wine is far too young at the moment, but some people will still like it. 


I can recommend trying it, if only to explore new things. The suggested retail price is 8.99 euro, which is fairly inexpensive. 


Considering its marketability (being a retailer, after all): Being in Europe the bad English probably won't offend my customers, but I imagine it might be more of a problem in the English speaking parts of the world. It comes with a screwcap. Depending on your clients there may or may not be demand for lesser known wines of the world. It has a European Union 'Organic Wine' certification.

Example: Guy below says portugal has around 3-7 euro/g, and average gross pay in Portugal is 1000 euro~. Say on average 5 euro/gram, means 1 gram = 1/200th of average pay. So 200 grams on an entire salary.

Then you're ignoring an example of how a game is taken apart and resold to a person for more profit which also works to undermine an argument you are not understanding.

&gt;Your second point: of course they are accounted for in market research, are you crazy?

By your own admission, it's not.  Now kindly keep the insults out of an economic argument.  If you want me to clarify, please do so but insults are unnecessary.  That's a second time you're ignoring the point.

&gt;Do you think we leave things like that out?

Okay, how do you factor in parts of communities that aren't known to you?  I gave the examples and it looks as if you responded before reading the entire context.  Not all parts can be researched and known about how people will enjoy a game similarly to how most people don't know what type of car they want when they go to a car lot.  You'll test a few factors, but there is no way to test for a multiple of factors and any and all tests will be flawed.  Doesn't mean we don't try, but how can you tell me that all market research is going to test for all people when 

1) This can change depending on whether you tested in NA which can have a variety of different samples

2) That data can change from EU or JP data

3) Even then, different people have different preferences which can skew the data.

So effectively, you can get a variety of different results with market based research and more than likely you're still taking a guess as to what may happen.  A speculation as I stated earlier.

&gt; You can clearly see in sales data which groups buy which games, it's not rocket science. It's just how genders work.

That makes no sense when you clearly understand one market and their cultural relations and yet if you look at other people and their cultural relations as stated above, you may find different answers.  So did you run those same tests in other countries and what did they give you in return?  It's not gender that's the only factor here...  Do you have a lot of black women as customers, how about Japanese ones?  Is it the east coast or west coast that buys more games?

What about relations of EU to JP customers?  Again, you can have a number of sales points come up which may skew how the data works.

Maybe black women can't buy as many games as you lose them to other, cheaper entertainment alternatives.  With America's hollowed out middle class, that may be a factor.  Again, the point here is that far more context could be given, but merely relying on gender or the market to provide here is a tautological error which ignores context immensely.

&gt;Fourth point: market research will give you the data you need to make your decision

That actually strengthens my argument that it's a speculation on the future...

&gt;Also if you found no information on it how can you tell it was female dominated?

I said this

&gt; Why are you so focused on the gaming industry in aggregate? That's never been how people play games. It falls into the same framing traps as the feminist claiming that the industry doesn't cater to women in the first place.

Not to do research.  The framing trap here is to look at the largest groups and suddenly that's all anyone plays.  This is false and ignores what the data actually says of what the largest and most bought games are.  I recall for 2013, Call of Duty was one of the most bought games.  What does that tell us?  If we just focus on sales, we see only that they've been #1 for a year or two.  If we look at how it affects the community, that tells us an entirely different story.  Players make a choice to move to a new game, keeping clans, learning new mechanics, etc.  That $60 price tag, while good for Activision initially can fragment communities as well as make a series stagnate as the community can't add value to a game which also takes time.  To this day, EA still hasn't added dedicated servers to their football games and they shut down the servers after a year causing you to perpetually buy their games since they are a monopoly.  All I'm pointing out is that market research can be misleading in an economic sense when the market ignores certain aspects except sales to tell an entire story.

&gt;Japanese games coming to the US (I am in Europe), is an entirely different issue: NOT GENDER. They believe that some games might be not worth bringing here. You say there is a clear demand, how do you know that? Do you think they have researched less than you? Are you seriously holding the opinion that they are doing this based on anything, but economics? Please explain their motives then?

It's based on Capcom's corporate structure, which holds that 16 people decide the action of 3000.  I'm currently going through Capcom's data for 2014 so I was looking at their market research and data and they make guesses just as good as anyone else.

And if you looked at their financial data, the same thing could be applied that I'm discussing here.  Which I've done to point out the issues with market research in regards to looking at annual reports.

&gt;If you are concerned about demographics you don't understand the issue. 

That was never my argument.  My argument was about different communities.

The market never provides according to demand and your assertion here ignores (ironically) the affect that marketing has on the market to change public demand.  Kind of like how EA is still in business when they've committed multiple atrocities like Simcity, Inquisition, Dungeon Keeper, etc.  They have the money to keep advertising bad games and hope that enough people are suckers for buying the game to continue their existance for shareholders and profit.

&gt;Demand isn't people want this game, demand is enough people want this game that it's worth my time to invest in it.

...  You missed my point entirely to state the same thing I've been talking about.  The market data won't tell you the entire story such as it didn't tell you, for a long time, about hidden object games since those weren't known about until recently with a huge female presence.

Even then, this still supports the speculation argument I've stated, where people invest in the game even if it has a lower return on investment than Call of Duty. That's economies of scale.  I just used the gambling analogies to make the terminology easier and it seems you ignored it completely to make the same argument I did...",t3_312iaf,t1_cpzsuy2,1428060195,False,cpzup9w,t1_cpzup9w

I do agree going after Russian, Arab and Asian money - especially from autocratic regimes - is a terrible reason to go somewhere else. The races in these places are overwhelmingly dull, and badly visited.

I don't think they should race in France because of tradition, they should race in France because of interest in an F1 race, and more importantly a good racetrack to race on. I don't think anybody including the Belgians care that much about Belgium or its history in motorsport - but we can all agree Spa is among the most respected, amazing and unique racetracks in the world. THAT is a good reason to race somewhere.

F1 going to Austin was a great success. Returning to Mexico was a great move. Both good reasons to drop an uninteresting, badly visited European race. While Mexico will have to prove itself in the current state of F1, Austin turned out to be a great track, with a packed and passionate audience. I'm sure the latter won't be a problem in Mexico.

When UKIP is the only party that wants to leave the EU, and therefore the only party that can work towards capping immigration.

Ask? Why would it say that? Then a smirk forms across your face. Just to mess around you write a question in the book. You let out a laugh and read over the question. It says, ""Will I poop myself tomorrow?""

You wait for a response from the book. Nothing. You chuckle to yourself and put the book back on your desk. That night you consider selling it in some garage sale to maybe creep some kids out. That would be hilarious.

You wake up the next morning, thinking of writing something else in the book. Then something crazier pops into your mind. ""Will I run around the house naked?"" you write. Just the thought makes you burst out into laughter. Then you nearly fall off your chair. ""No"" appeared on the page.

At first you're terrified. A harmless joke has suddenly become a nightmare. You consider burning the book, but then see that's a bad idea upon realising the power of the book. If it can predict the future, you'll be able to do anything.

""Will I burn you?""

""No.""

Huh, looks like the book really can predict the future. Time to think of some important questions.

""Will I get fat?""

This time the book doesn't respond... Then you remember the first question you asked. ""Will I poop myself tomorrow?"" That was today, and it didn't respond to that question... Could that mean, yes?

""Will I eat something in a few hours?""

Again, there's no response, confirming your theory. Well, it's probably a good time to put that brown underwear on, except you don't have any, so you just put on the black briefs you have. May as well be prepared, right? It might even be a good idea to go to the King Size store down the road...

But then the mother of all questions enters your mind. ""Will World War 3 happen?"" You wait for it and it seems to take longer than usual. No, this can't be right. ""No"" isn't coming up. This is not good.

""Will World War 3 happen today?"" you write frantically. Your heart's pounding in your chest as you wait for a response. Nothing appears. You put the pen down shakily and take a deep breath. Oh God this can't be happening, you think to yourself. There's got to be a way you can survive through this.

""Will I survive?"" you write. You hope against all odds that the book won't respond this time. You wait and wait. Thankfully, there's no response. That makes sense right? Otherwise you wouldn't be able to get fat in the future.

""Will I find a fallout shelter?"" There's no response. You frantically search on the web for fallout shelters and find there is one just a few blocks away. You throw in all the tinned food you have into the car. There's only ten tins of food. Whenever you get fat, it's definitely not going to be in the fallout shelter. You drive exactly the speed limit, hoping the entire time you won't see a flash in the distance. It only takes you a few minutes to arrive at the fallout shelter.

The fallout shelter is a public one that was thankfully never converted or torn down. You're grateful that your parents decided to move to an extremely rural location now. You open the door, roll the tins of food down the stairs, grab the book and pen, shut the door, and race down stairs to the second door. You open it up, roll the tinned food through there, set the book and pen down on a bed, then race over to the door and shut it tight.

That's when you feel the rumble. It gets more and more intense until you can hear roaring wind raging above ground which makes you cover your ears. It would have easily blown out your eardrums if you weren't in the shelter. The worst part was the screams *before* the wind. People who knew the horror of a nuclear blast right before it killed them. You knew it would haunt you for the rest of your life.

You pick up the book shakily and give it a kiss on the cover. This dusty, creepy book you found in the middle of nowhere had saved your life. Then you suddenly feel weight pulling down your underwear and a wet feeling. Guess the book was right about the poop...

Now you have the next couple of weeks to ask the book questions. So the next day, after you've eaten your baked beans for breakfast, you ask the book, ""Will the war end in 3 days?""

""No.""

""Will the war end in 4 days?""

""No.""

""Will the war end in 5 days?""

There is no response. Well, that's good. You figure there'll be some more fighting after the nukes were launched, but obviously not for long. Negotiations between the world are probably underway right now.

""Will I ever laugh again?"" you ask. No response, so that makes you feel better in these grim times.

Over the course of the few weeks in there you ask other questions. ""Will I find love?"" ""Will I have a family?"" ""Will I be *morbidly obese* fat?"" All of which return no answer. Guess you've got a bright future ahead of you, one filled of delicious food...

In the year 2030 you're middle aged, have a family and you weigh at least 330 pounds. You also own a big house in Australia now. Leaving America seemed like a good idea after what happened between Russia and the US. 

The world stage has changed drastically, with China being the first world super power, and countries like Australia, Brazil and India being the most developed. North Korea had apparently let some nukes fly in the Russia/US exchange, which subsequently got North Korea blasted off the world map. South Korea had to be evacuated. Although, China were kind enough to give South Korea a small portion of a land and name it ""Korea"". The majority of Russia and US is uninhabitable. Many Americans moved to Canada or Mexico. Russians moved to other places in Europe or further up north in Russia.

One thing is clear, there will be no World War 4. You asked the book and it said, ""No"". World War 3 was a literal Hell unleashed on Earth. Maybe it scared humans away from war for good.

One day, you decide to tell your daughter your story of World War 3. She thinks ""You are the mostest, bravest person ever!"" You smile. But then, inevitably she asks, ""Will something badder than World War 3 happen?""

Only one way to find out. You ask the book, ""Will something badder than World War 3 happen?"" Your daughter has a way with words.

There's no response. How could something worse than WW3 happen? This is bad, whatever it is. You begin to panic. Getting through WW3 was the most terrifying experience.

""Will something worse than WW3 happen in my daughter's life time?""

You wait eagerly. It seems to take longer than usual.

""No.""

You let out a sigh of relief.

""Will it happen 100 years from now?""

""No.""

You continue to ask further, until you ask, ""Will it happen 500,000 years from now?"" and it leaves no response. You feel reassured that whatever it is, it will only be a natural event.

Now that you've settled down, there are some deep questions you'd *really* like to ask that you never got the chance to. ""Will I find the meaning of life?"" There's no response, which excites you, because that's a question you've struggled with forever. ""Will I die?"" Again, there's no response. Just something you've got to accept. It's probably best we all die at some point anyway.

""Will the universe end?"" you ask. Then your jaw drops. ""No"" responds the book. ""What are you?"" you ask the book. You expect no response, probably because the book can't answer it due to only giving ""No"" answers, but what you see next shocks you!

""GOD""

With that, the book slams shut *on its own*. Thankfully, you moved your hands away in time. You utter a ""wow..."" and lie down on your bed. The universe is a crazy place.

So that night when you're lying in bed, you look out your window and admire the stars. What a beautiful life. You don't know whether that was God or not speaking through the book, but it certainly made you reconsider everything. Even if it wasn't God, the fact that something paranormal, demonic, spiritual or whatever it was spoke through to you that way and changed your life so much for the better... You could never thank it enough, especially when you treated it as a joke initially.

You make love to your significant other like no other night. You never actually felt closer or more loved than that night. Your partner appreciated all the extra cuddling. After a kiss good night, you decide you want to pass the book onto your daughter some time in the future.

The year is 2040 and your daughter is heading off to college. Before she leaves the house, you hand her something very special; the book.

""Oh, another text book?"" she laughs.

""No, it's something much more... I know this sounds crazy,"" you explain, ""But Rosemary, this book is the most wonderful, and personal thing I could ever give you. This book saved my life during the war and it answered some of the deepest questions I could ever give it. It even made me see just how beautiful this universe is.""

She chuckles a bit at first, not believing a book could mean so much. But then gives you a hug and says, ""I love you.""

""I love you too,"" you respond.

She gets into her car and puts the book on the front passenger's seat next to her. She sends you a loving smile and you wave her good bye. You trust she'll take care of the book and that it will serve her well in her own life.",t3_319r4b,t3_319r4b,1428062765,False,cpzvcnd,t1_cpzvcnd

Naturally, a majority of people who end up on this sub are fans of either a European or Panamerican club (who I think it is fair to say, surpass the club quality of most other nations). Because of this, we rarely account for the fact that FIFA is made up of every participating nation in the world, and Germany, England or Spain have the same power behind their vote as Cape Verde or Togo, for example. Because of this, it means that for FIFA to lose power and change to happen, the desire for change needs to come from the majority of constituent countries, not just the majority of the better footballing nations. 

Another thing I find people are very quick to forget, is that at the end of the day most football clubs are private business' and the same can be said for FIFA. In truth, they ""owe"" nothing to the fans and there seems to be a perception that they do. Yes, the argument can easily be made that without us, there is no money in football, and nobody to go and watch these footballers play - but FIFA know that not many people will just stop liking football because they're unhappy with how these situations are being managed. We are here simply to maintain the money going into football and FIFA, and ultimately they don't care what we think.

Kosovo's independence was proclaimed unilateraly, based on the results of 17 years old referendum, with the strong objections of the parent state that was democratic at the time (still is). It was done without the approval of the UN Security Council, which is supposed to take care of those things. The justification used for recognition are Serbian crimes toward Albanian population, but those crimes at that point ended 9 years ago.

The point that I'm making is, doing it that way couldn't have ended well. Kosovo is now in status quo, its economy worst in Europe and stagnating, and it is utterly dependent on foreign aid. The rule of law is fleeting at best. Emmigration pressure is huge, basically whoever can emigrate does so - it is not a good place for its people. An uncertain legal status of the state certainly has a dampening effect on any progress.

Now imagine if they have waited for a few more years. Talking to Kosovo officials slowly stopped being a taboo in Serbia, and negotiations would have been possible. And they could have gotten a hell of a deal. At the least, they would have certainly gotten at least 50 out of 250 seats in Serbian Parliament, which would probably make them a part of most coalition governments. They'd have their own police. Serbia would continue to financially support them as underdeveloped region, and it could afford to as it would be doing better than it is doing now without having a territorial dispute. Albanian would be made official language in the region. Heck, maybe they'd be able to get a proper independence referendum in 5 or 10 years, if they'd still want it. And all this under the EU supervision. And with such a major pro-Western influence in the Parliament, I'm sure Serbia would make better choices. There would not be this flirting with Russia that we have now. We'd probably be joining NATO. I honestly think that for normal people this would be a better deal than this semi-independence that they got. 

The point is, recognizing independence achieved in this way has a questionable effect on the welfare of the people affected. You are basically making a bet that your recognition will eventually help lead to a full recognition. Which may still happen, but it has been 7 years now and Kosovo is paying a heavy price of that status quo.",t3_31al5f,t1_cpzu1nd,1428063269,False,cpzvho0,t1_cpzvho0

As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn’t one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen.

So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.

I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.

Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn’t see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren’t really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.

Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn’t say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.

As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn’t spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did.

A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they’re pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed.

Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.

I find it terribly disingenuous to lament anti-Russian sentiments in Western society, when Russian media has been steadily beating an anti-Western narrative since at least 2002.  Russian leaders have not only berated American and European politicians, but have attacked the very fabric of Western society, repeatedly describing it as corrupt, corrosive, and sinful.  This goes beyond the typical disagreement over policy; this has been a systematic attempt to position Russia as a bulwark against Western society by its own leaders.  By insisting on reminding the Russian population that they are different, they have produced a siege mentality and have militarized civic society to repel anything seen as foreign.    Again, this has been happening for over 10 years now.

The fact that it took Western society this long to realize how antagonistic Russian politicians have been against them is what's really shocking.

First of all, I want to challenge the idea of being ""advanced"".  This idea is a Western idea that is imposed on indigenous cultures in imperialistic ways.  For example, most indigenous cultures have knowledge of ecological relationships that *far surpass* the knowledge of ecology that existed in Western countries up until very recently (50-150 years ago).  Also, if you were to assess how ""advanced"" a culture is by how sustainable it is, then there are many indigenous cultures that are more advanced than current Western society.

But about your question:

There are cultures that aren't patriarchal, although they look really different.  An odd example from China are the [Mosuo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo).  In Vietnam, patriarchy was *introduced* by colonization by the Chinese; previously women had had a very prominent role and were more likely to be in leadership positions.  I've read that the [Hopi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) had egalitarian gender roles, before European colonization of America, but this changed.  It seems like there is a pattern of patriarchy often being imposed by a more powerful ally...and this makes me wonder if patriarchy is so widespread not because it's more stable in a culture or society, but because it leads cultures to become more imperialistic or militarized, and thus impose their values.

These are just a few examples that I came up with pretty quickly.  There is some stuff on Wikipedia's page on [Matriarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy), which has a lot of citations to other sources.",t3_317z7y,t1_cpzrbf9,1428067794,False,cpzx28c,t1_cpzx28c

&gt;Prosecutors said Friday that among the items found at Mr. Lubitz’s home were several doctors’ notes stating that he was too ill to work, including on the day of the crash; one of the notes had been torn up. These documents “support the preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues,” the prosecutors said in a statement.

As far as who benefits - here's where the tinfoil comes in.

At some point we're going to have a national conversation on how this guy *hid his medical information* from his employer, because he was obviously unfit to fly and then caused all this *terrrrrrrorism*.

So we're going to most likely expand our *information sharing* with private insurers and other governmental agencies set to establish whether you are fit to fly (or drive, work, use a firearm [hmmm], etc) for *everybody's safety, of course*.

It's a great privacy/safety tradeoff, and the more I think about it - the more likely I think it could be. And if this happens I'll have to flair myself ""from the future,"" I guess.",t3_31b1on,t3_31b1on,1428067965,False,cpzx4qn,t1_cpzx4qn

&gt;__Competition between [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus) and [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes)__ has been characterised as a [duopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly) in the large [jet airliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner) market since the 1990s.  This resulted from a series of mergers within the global [aerospace industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer), with [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus) beginning as a European [consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium) while the American [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing) absorbed its former arch-rival, [McDonnell Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas) in a 1997 merger. Other manufacturers, such as [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin) and [Convair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair), [Fairchild Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Aircraft) in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and [British Aerospace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aerospace) and [Fokker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker) in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), were no longer in a position to compete effectively and withdrew from this market.

I really recommend checking out [this] (http://globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp) website. It is made by military hobbiest who want to get a very accurate definition of every country's **conventional** military strength. Russia is, arguably, the second most powerful conventional fighting force in the world, only behind the United States. However, they are the most powerful regional power because the Untied States' military is spread all around the world and Russia's is very concentrated. Most NATO powers also have their militaries spread out throughout the world, so when looking at these numbers keep that in mind that a local conflict would likely cut those numbers by as much as a half for NATO states. 

That is just the first major reason to their success in a conventional conflict. The second one would be NATO. You see, the Russian military is one whole military, they all run under one system and every leader is familiar with the entire army. You can't say the same with NATO. While yes, they are standardized, the mere needing to council between dozens of countries and to mobilize and organize presents a huge problem. Yes, they have drilled it countless times, but they are still at a delayed disadvantage that Russia doesn't have. 

Third, NATO relies on air superiority. Russia, because of this, has some the best anti-air capabilities in the world. Air superiority means nothing if planes get grilled before even getting close. 

In a conventional war, Russia would win in Eastern and Central Europe. No doubt. Ask and military hobbiest/analyst this and they will need to agree. ",t3_315yi8,t1_cpz40zp,1428068368,False,cpzxaq7,t1_cpzxaq7

I've heard the tales how everyone was anticipating an invasion, what with iceland being a strategically valuable piece of land between Europe and the U.S. One day, all of a sudden, all radio communication is cut with the Capitol and all attempts to hail Reykjavík through telephone or radio is met with silence. The tension in the air is palpable, and my grandmother remembers her mom sitting nervously in a chair not saying anything, white as snow with fear. Finally, my great grandfather arrives home withe news and tells her, ""Yes, we've been invaded... It's the English."" And it was like a baloon being inflated. She sat back down and thanked God.    
    
Some years later, when grandmother was older she asked her mom about it. There were so many reports of the Brittish loosing ground, why were they so upset about the idea of the axis landing in Iceland. Well, it turned out that an individual who lived in town had been traveling to Germany just before the war broke outand had witnessed german aggression towards immigrants and Jews. He'd even been to a nazi rally and was rattled enough that when he returned home he held meetings all over where he urged Iceland to take a stand against Germany.

To put it into perspective that's $4 billion more than the education and defence budgets COMBINED. It's more than 5 times what the government spends on unemployment payments. 

To top that off family tax benefit and 'support for families with children,' which is basically a middle class tax perk, takes up about 8.5% of the budget.

Together, the pension and 'support for families with children' take up only a little less than defence, education and all other welfare payments COMBINED. In terms of GDP, if 'Middleclasswelfareland' were a country it would have about the 62nd largest nominal GDP in the world, a little smaller than Slovakia, a developed EU member country with 5.5 million people, and that's not even taking into account other middle class welfare lurks like negative gearing and super tax concessions. 

You know what I find particularly galling? That the Government attacks the most vulnerable in our society through gutting community legal centers and Legal Aid, pushing single mothers onto the unemployment benefit, threatening to withhold social security from young people, and forcing supply side solutions to unemployment like work for the dole when there simply aren't enough jobs to go around, and yet in an age of catastrophically high youth unemployment, the greys who have enjoyed government largesse all their life, are asking for one final hand out, and their assistance seems to be immune from the cuts faced by the poor and vulnerable. Forget it.

The ride has to end. The pension is poorly targeted social assistance. I have sympathy for a tradie who has done their body in, can't work anymore, and has very little by way of assets. Hell, I'd be happy for them to collect in their 50's. However, if you have equity in your house, you can obtain a reverse mortgage from the bank and you should not be entitled to an aged pension. By providing these people with aged pensions, we are just subsidising the inheritances of the children of the wealthy through social security.

Meanwhile, I built troops up to my force limit as well. I appointed an admiral, sailed all my ships to the Sea of Marmara, and declared war over a claim to Teke (the only province you can fabricate on as Mamluks). Since the entire Ottoman army was in Europe (minus like 4 regiments), and since I sank a third of the Ottoman fleet when I declared war, they didn't have enough naval power to take the crossings back and their armies were on the wrong side. I just sieged everything down. 

The Ottomans also allied Tlemcen but not Tunis, which helped. Tunis likes to invade the Mamluks but won't give Tlemcen access. Tlemcen did send troops via boat to Benghazi, but they had only sieged Benghazi down by the time I was bringing 14 regiments back to wipe them out. 

Occupying all of Anatolia also means the Ottomans had a *lot* of WE ticking up. At some point Byzantium declared war with Serbia. By that point the Ottomans had been steadily downsizing their military ('cuz, y'know, I took like half their income away), and they lost that war. Byzantium sieged down Edirne while I was still at war with them. Then I peaced out, taking the three provinces you see (which are overseas for me but they bisect the Ottomans) and forcing them to release Germiyan (who I promptly diplo-vassalized; I got Dulkadir and Fezzan like that earlier). 

After that, Aq Qoyunlu and Ramazan declared war. Ramazan brought Karaman, Aq Qoyunlu brought Trebizond (as a vassal; no idea when that happened). Genoa also joined in at some point and took Saruhan/Sugla. Genoa had lost Kaffa/Matrika/Genoa at some point prior.  

In addition to all the WE the Ottomans were eating, they also lost a significant chunk of their Sunni territory. And since the Ottomans have pretty terrible Religious Unity at the start, they promptly got hordes of Othodox rebels in Europe. Because, y'know, I didn't screw them over hard enough.

Science is extremely quantitative and professional now - Galileo was part scientist, part artist, part philosopher.  He had more in common with Pythagoras or Archimedes than with a modern scientist.

Science is now so specialized that it's not really possible for someone to be universally recognized: Either they're popular science-entertainers, in which case they usually don't have the time to spend on a lot of actual groundbreaking science, or they do groundbreaking work but it's so narrow (in order to get published) that nobody outside their field will ever hear of them.

And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The reason Galileo shines so brightly is because Europe was still largely surrounded by medieval darkness.
