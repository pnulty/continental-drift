Not necessarily, it's possible you're looking at different data than I am, but it would seem to spike in temperature while CO2 steadily climbs.  Either way if the argument is ""look at this one instance of something deviating slightly, that disproves the entire thing!"" that's not a particularly compelling one.

&gt;Global warming has diverted attention away from traditional pollution which is actually KNOWN to be harmful.

You know what, that's a completely reasonable and fair point.  Global warming has definitely been heavily publicized in recent years.  But it has also been insanely publicized and denied constantly, so the sort of PR push has really been important in bringing what could arguably be one of the greatest issues of our time to the forefront of people's consciousness.  I do agree with you that we shouldn't cease attempts at conservation and cleaning our environment in other ways, however.

&gt;I beg to differ. Solar has huge problems of power storage and loss of efficiency of the cells if covered by clouds (even partially over an array). It burns out batteries and the like. Wind is dependent on local conditions. There's a story of a British town that put up a wind generator. The town hated it because it was an eye sore and it was also calculated that the town wouldn't recoup it's money from the thing for about 50,000 years.

Fair points, and I'd argue that the efficacy of these methods is largely dependent on local conditions, these aren't a universal solution, but could supplement power on a large scale if implemented properly, in appropriate areas.

And I agree with you on nuclear power.  I just wanted to point out that it has a bit of a PR problem and runs risks other than just being a money pit, like solar and wind might end up as.  It requires an entire supporting suite of regulations and bureaucrats to make it run properly.  Not to say we shouldn't be working on it.

&gt;There's a couple of European flops. Germany paid for solar coverage...despite it being cloudy all the time and Spain has huge budget problems from their wind farms not turning out good.

True enough, point is it's conceivably possible to get a lot out of these technologies.

&gt;The cheaper the energy, the easier it is to do a lot of new things. Now, if you restrict energy usage...you hurt that advancement in technology.

Okay, I get your logic, I just disagree on a couple points.  1) we don't need to restrict energy usage, we just need to shift to other sources of energy.  It doesn't need to be significantly more expensive, and I'd argue that if we made cheap, renewable energy more abundant, we would have a much smaller reliance on fossil fuels, and ultimately make energy cheaper for the poor and developing, since scarcity will be less of an issue.  2) I disagree that we should take a risk on putting off efforts to curb human induced global warming in the hope that we will advance quickly enough to a point where we have widespread alternative energy in the form of a yet undeveloped method of energy production.  3) I would argue that embracing the idea that humans are inducing global warming and that we need to incentivize alternative energies, I could see us developing yet undiscovered/implemented forms of alternative energy.

I think enacting various cap and trade policies and a host of other regs would actually be conducive to your ultimate goal.  Again this is my opinion.

&gt;I don't believe the science around Climate Change is very scientific. I think the advocacy around it is very very un-scientific. Insistence on agreeing with the majority, the idea of ""settled science"", the injection of interpretive opinion...its all not scientific. 

Very little of what I'm saying is just 'my opinion.'  the only times I've given my opinion is to respond to instances of you giving your own opinion.  Furthermore, I agree that a lot of the advocacy around global warming is unscientific, shit, a lot of it is just marketing schemes and PR.  But the science behind it is solid, about as solid as we can get without having a second earth to start experimenting on.",t3_30sur6

&gt;""Historically Speaking"" i would love for you to show evidence on what feudal France's idea was based off 

It wasn't.

Fuedal France wasn't some discrete process, decided upon by leaders. It wasn't a box checked off, ""we are now Feudal"" system. Even the term feudalism itself is a neologism, applied retroactively to describe a power relationship that wasn't uniform across Europe.

&gt;(ill give you a hint) no one knows it's open to debate.

There's far more debate over usage of the term ""Feudal"" among historians than there is about the development of vassalage in France. Saying that ""feudal france"" was based off of rome undermines both the complexity and myriad other influences on Carolingian France and the constantly evolving system of power dynamics among European states and while certain systems in France grew out of earlier systems like the roman latifundia also asserts that the Feudal relationship wasn't a result of the power systems and structures already at play and was contrived, determined handing over of political structure.

Als was genau betrachtest du den [ATX Prime Market](http://www.boerse-express.com/kursliste)?

&gt;Heißt also nicht, dass es sie nicht gibt sondern nur, dass sie nicht so eine große Rolle spielen wie in anderen Ländern.

Da der Artikel keinerlei statistische Belege für diese Äußerung anführt werde ich auch keinen solchen heraussuchen. Ich sehe jedoch keinen Anhaltspunkt dafür, dass sich die Struktur der österreichischen Volkswirtschaft grundlegend von der anderer Länder unterscheiden würde.

&gt; Pöttingers Umsatz wurde zu 16% in Österreich in Österreich erwirtschaftet

Weitere 23% des Umsatzes wurden in Deutschland erzielt, woraus anzunehmen ist, dass mindestens 2/3 des Umsatz in EU-Staaten erzielt wurden. Der Agrarsektor wird in Europa wie kein anderer Bereich subventioniert, was auch den Umsatz des genannten Unternehmens begünstigt. 

&gt; Ehrlich gesagt weiß ich nicht warum der Staat Österreich sich hier einzumischen hat, wenn sich eine Firma mit ihren Mitarbeitern ausmacht Überstunden einzuschieben

Es gibt bereits jetzt Möglichkeiten für Arbeitnehmer, Überstunden zu machen. Unter dem Argument der Wahlfreiheit für den Arbeitnehmer werden allerdings häufig Positionen vertreten, die eine vermeintliche Wahlfreiheit ausnutzen. Die ""Freiwilligkeit"", auch am Sonntag arbeiten zu dürfen wird damit rasch zu einer ""Freiwilligkeit"" nach dem Muster ""Natürlich müssen sie nicht am Sonntag arbeiten, ABER es gibt auch genügend andere, die ihre Stelle ebenfalls besetzen können"". Wie der Interviewte auf 10 Stunden kommt ist mir nicht nachvollziehbar, in einigen Bereichen liegt die Grenze, ab der Arbeitszeitüberschreitungen ans Arbeitsinspektorat zu melden sind bei 14 Stunden - abgesehen davon gibt es auch Bereichen, in denen 12 oder 24-Stunden-Schichten üblich sind. Nicht zuletzt unter dem Gesichtspunkt der vermeintlichen ""Freiwilligkeit"" ist zu beachten, dass solche Maßnahmen des Arbeitsschutzes nicht aus Spaß existieren. 

&gt;Schöner Logikfehler drin, wenn dein Unternehmen extrem ineffizient ist.

Wie üblich fehlt dafür jeder Beleg, in der neokonservativen Ideensphäre der NZZ scheinen solche auch nicht erforderlich zu sein. Wie sich der Gedanke ""Private Unternehmen erledigen alles mögliche besser"" im Bereich öffentlicher Dienstleistungen in der Realität manifestiert hat sich bereits oft genug mit katastrophalen Folgen gezeigt. 

&gt; Arbeitskosten für die Firmen können auf vielerlei Arten steigen. Trotzdem netter Versuch es wieder den ""geizigen und skrupellosen"" unterzujubeln, obwohl der größte Treiber des Sinkens der Netto-Reallöhne Gebührensteigerungen von öffentlichen Unternehmen und die kalte Progression bei der Lohnsteuer war.

Auch hierfür fehlt ein statistischer Beleg. In den letzten Jahren haben weder die Gemeinden die Kanalgebühren flächendeckend und signifikant erhöht, noch wurde z.b. der Arbeitgeberanteil an den SV-Beiträgen erhöht. Abgesehen davon sind Gebühren für Wasser, Müll, Strom oder Kanal für die Lohnberechnung irrelevant. Als Gebühren für den Verbraucher bzw. Arbeitnehmer fließen sie in die Berechnung der Inflation ein. Es ist nicht erkennbar, dass Gebühren für o.g. Dinge stärkere Preisanstiege als andere Güter in den Warenkörben verzeichnet hätten.

&gt;Sie haben sich niedriger ""entwickelt"", wenn dein Ausgangspunkt schon viel höher ist 

Das ist nicht korrekt. Die Lohnstückkosten und die Lohnquote sind seit 1970 gefallen. [Quelle](http://www.wifo.ac.at/jart/prj3/wifo/resources/person_dokument/person_dokument.jart?publikationsid=23507&amp;mime_type=application/pdf), Seite 3.

&gt;Aber viel wichtiger ist, dass diese Daten 10-15 Jahre

Die verlinkten Daten stammen aus dem Zeitraum von 2002-2012.

&gt;Wenn es nur um Löhne ginge, wäre schon lang die ganze Produktion in China.

Nicht direkt in China, aber z.b. in Bangladesch, wohin große Teile der europäischen Textilindustrie hin verschwunden sind. 

&gt;Probleme

Die gibt es Zweifelsohne. Allerdings sind das nicht die Dinge, die die Neokonservativen als Probleme verkaufen. Als kurze Auflistung: Umweltverschmutzung, zunehmende Ungleicheit, Lebensqualität. Das alles sind Dinge, auf die die solche Positionen keine Antwort haben - ein Problem, das meistens damit beginnt, dass Marktradikale externe Effekte leugnen.

6.  Planning attacks against American civilians and military targets to be blamed on Cuba in order to gain public support for war.  The only reason it didn't happen was because Kennedy shut it down *after* it was *authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.* [info here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)

This list could go on and on but I'm tired and I think I've made my point.  I do have to mention that in almost every example I have *ever* found, records and evidence of the events were always destroyed in an attempt to cover it up. Whether these actions were or were not authorized, part of a large internal conspiracy, or acted upon by a few individual players is beside the point. 

Now I want to reiterate, I'm NOT saying ""the government,"" CIA, or DoD planned and executed 9/11.  I don't think that *at all.*  Nor am I saying the CIA is full of thousands of evil people.  I AM saying that in an environment where insane amounts of money are being spent on espionage, assassinations, torture, terrorist funding, government overthrows, and regime change, (where authority is *not* to be questioned) it only takes a few bad players to make terrible things happen.  When you have tens of thousands of participants or more working all over the world, there are bound to be bad players.  

Now I have no remote idea as to what the truth might actually be, but i have good reason to believe that what we were told is *not* the whole truth.  And the attempts at covering up as much evidence as possible regarding the events of 9/11 were ridiculous.  Someone did NOT want it investigated beyond the official story.

As far as WTC 7 I have zero reasonable speculation.  I just don't believe it fell due to a fire on the 5th floor east corner or whatever the hell they said.

I agree completely that the world is ""a chaotic place where different parties have different interests.""  Which is exactly why I think there is more to the story than what I heard on the news and that there are probably multiple parties and actors that connect to the events and may have worked to prevent further investigations from being made.  Missing $2.3 trillion not to be excluded.  

TL;DR  There is just no reason to think such a huge world-changing event had only ""the terrorists hate American freedom"" as their cause and that any further investigation into the event should be considered the foolish, idiotic musings of conspiracy theorists.",t3_30vo05

There is a sort of good explanation of ""Mode Four"" at the beginning of this thesis:

http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1336427&amp;fileOId=1646753

TISA is an upcoming trade agreement- the [Trade in Services Agreement](http://www.bilaterals.org/?psi-special-report-the-really-good)- 

People don't own jobs. However, foreign and international companies want special supranational rights to own a set of regulatory conditions at the time of a deals signing- So they typically freeze regulations.

Then they want to - and increasingly are compensated if a country changes anything, huge amounts. For example a French company sued Egypt for raising a minimum wage after they had signed an agreement, ( Veolia Propreté v. Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID Case No.&amp;nbsp;ARB/12/15 ) 

A [Dutch insurer sued Slovak Republic](http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw3206.pdf) for voting for single payer- which requires insurance companies pack up their bags and go - They sued for ""their"" ""expected lost profits"". And won.

Thats what is called **Investor State Dispute Settlement**. A global  corporate power grab. So, once something is ""liberalised"" like formerly public education, it cannot be reversed. They set up a ratchet that gives special corprate couts te power to fine countries if they break the agreement.

Yeah, I guess then Israel exchanged 700,000 Arabs for 1 million Jews kicked out of the rest of the Arab world? That's a population exchange too, right?

Not because it was ""offensive"" or anything but because it was completely fucking delusional, in the way that SJW-leaning leftists, are often detached from reality.

&gt;__Erythritol__ (__(2*R*,3*S*)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol__) is a [sugar alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol) (or [polyol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyol)) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)  and throughout much of the world. It was discovered in 1848 by British chemist [John Stenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stenhouse).  It occurs naturally in some fruit and fermented foods.  At the industrial level, it is produced from glucose by fermentation with a [yeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast), *[Moniliella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moniliella) pollinis*.  Erythritol is 60–70% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar), yet it is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar,  does not cause tooth decay,  and is partially absorbed by the body, excreted in urine and feces. It is less likely to cause gastric side effects than other [sugar alcohols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohols) [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] because of its unique digestion pathway. Under U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) labeling requirements, it has a caloric value of 0.2 kilo[calories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie) per gram (95% less than sugar and other carbohydrates), though nutritional labeling varies from country to country. Some countries, such as [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), label it as zero-[calorie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie), while [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) regulations currently label it and all other sugar alcohols at 0.24 kcal/g. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

When you click the ""sign on"" button on their wi-fi page it says ""Get up to 10 times the speed when you sign in with a Microsoft account.""


Unfortunately, I did not see any links on the sign in page as to how to do that. The [Seattle Center blog](http://centerspotlight.seattle.gov/2015/03/30/586/) makes mention of a ""Microsoft Wi-Fi app that allows regular visitors to automatically connect to the platform at the highest possible speed"" but again, there wasn't any link to any such app.


I manually searched the Google Play Store for ""Microsoft Wi-Fi"" app, no dice, then I searched the Windows Phone app store, nothing, then lastly I searched the Windows app store, still nothing save for wi-fi troubleshooting help articles.


Looking at the wi-fi settings on my phone it said that my linkspeed was 12 Mbps, which probably means 802.11b. So, in practical terms, the only way to enjoy the full bandwidth that this project, and 802.11b has to offer is to download a hitherto undiscovered Microsoft app, which may not exist for your device and sign in using your Windows Live credentials, assuming you have any.


I'm not angry, just disappointed. I'm sure the underlying technology of using white-space is really cool, but from a user experience standpoint, the superfluous restrictions made it very frustrating. How many people do you think are going to be able to find this hidden app? I still haven't, perhaps it's a built-in feature exclusive to Windows phones or tablets? If so that would guarantee that [only ~4%](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/windows-phone-market-share-slips-u-s-europe-iphone-6-surges/) of the population could even conceivably access the full bandwidth of the access point.

**Edit**: For comparison's sake, last weekend I was studying in the Seattle Central Library. I did a speedtest then while on their wi-fi and got ~ 100 Mb/s up and down. Unfortunately I did not save an image to link to you guys.

That is some of my limited Portuguese, without any help from a translator.  If you want to learn more English, I highly recommend the apps Duolingo and HelloTalk.  If you don't already know them, they are available for both iPhone and Android. Duolingo is available online as well, to use from your computer.   Duolingo teaches language by small lessons.

Consolidating the servers was a huge step back from good matchmaking as you forced players together that simply do not belong together.

By consolidating the servers, matchmaking should actually be quite better. With more even matches, and shorter queue times.

CIS makes up a large population of Strife in its current state. Although that has not always been the case, it is now. When Strife goes on Steam, and S2 begins their marketing campaign, you will have much more speaking English speakers. If the European population becomes large enough again, I can certainly imagine S2 redividing the servers. Same goes with US&gt;USE&gt;USW, and SEA as well, potentially. I'm not saying S2 is going to do this, but if the game grows substantially, I would bet on it. Strife is a good game, and it will have its shot to become something much greater. 

For now? There's not that much you can do about it. I've played League on LAN at times in the past, because I'm east coast, and it is quite lower ping. At higher levels, 70 ping difference does make a difference.

In turn, I learned some Spanish. Quite a bit actually. I had taken classes back in highschool, but only the very basics still retained in my memory. I enjoyed speaking to the Latin Americans, utilizing the Spanish I had learned. Now? I work with a lot of people who speak Spanish, its come in handy.

It's unfair! What really spread the plague was obvious: barbaric Mongolians. They ride around, knocking down people's walls, never settling down in one spot, conquering land from the South China Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. They're the ones making trade routes between Europe and East Asia possible in the first place. They say, ""A man can walk a trade route through the entire Mongolian Empire with a gold plate balanced on his head and never have to worry about being robbed!"" They made it easy for the black death to spread! Damn Mongolians!

To be honest, China was already hurting from a pretty serious famine as well as a violent transition between the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Between 1200 AD and 1393 AD, China lost over 45% of its population. It's hard to tell how much of this loss was directly caused by the black death, as record keeping on the subject was scarce. In fact, the first recorded diagnosis of the black death wasn't until the 1600's!

To make matters worse, America has considerably less social mobility than Canada and Europe.

&gt;By overemphasizing individual mobility, we ignore important social determinants of success like family inheritance, social connections, and structural discrimination. The three papers in Perspectives on Psychological Science indicate not only that economic inequality is much worse than we think, but also that social mobility is less than you’d imagine. Our unique brand of optimism prevents us from making any real changes.

We Americans now have greater social inequality than many countries in Latin America. There is greater social mobility in places like Germany. And much of this comes down to access to things like health care and education. 

American kids are burdened by insane tuition rates, handed loans farmed out to private corporations, and are basically getting robbed into a lifetime of debt peonage.

I would think it'd be more accurate to say religion was the *justification* of many wars, but not necessarily the reason for them. Much of the Crusades, for example, were used to take land.

So Hitler, says fuck the system, and starts building an Army (Something the treaties said he couldnt do) and no one stops him. His building an Army gets the german economy going again. Schools, roads, jobs, food, and cash money are a thing again. Yeah, Hitler blames the Jews, but everyone was doing that for the last thousand years so what? but Hitler wanted to SHOW people that he meant business. So he says fuck it, starts rounding the jews up (which was quite popular to the germans) and keeping them separate from the rest of the country, while he does this he starts taking back German lands and basically telling Europe to suck his dick.

He is generally considered one of the most important figures of the [Apostolic Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Age).   In the mid-30s to the mid-50s, he founded several churches in [Asia Minor and Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_centers_of_Christianity). Paul used his status as both a [Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) and a [Roman citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizenship) to advantage in his ministry to both Jewish and Roman audiences.

I find that the people who use these phrases ""there are no British values"", ""British values are vague"", "" Britain has no culture"" or even worse ""white people have no culture"" are the same 'progressive', open-borders, cultural relativist types that only seem intent on pushing their ideology of shaming western (typically white) males (that is if it is not just pure laziness on their behalf of thinking about British values). One of these ways is shaming our values and culture which is exactly what you're doing in your post, and which is actually rather insulting - you deserve the down votes.

British values first of all stem from Western values. These values are ethical values, political systems and belief systems introduced by the Greeks, Romans and Christianity.

These values include traditions of rationalism, spread throughout the middle ages and renaissance and developed by Hellenistic philosophy, Scholasticism, humanism, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. These are derived from political thought, widespread employment of rational argument favouring freethought, assimilation of human rights, the need for equality, and democracy.

&gt;

&gt;The __white-throated needletail__ (*Hirundapus caudacutus*), also known as __needle-tailed swift__ or __spine-tailed swift__, is a large [swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift). It is the fastest-flying bird in flapping [flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight), with confirmed speeds reaching 111.6 km/h (69.3 mph).  It is commonly reputed to reach velocities of up to 170 km/h (105 mph), though this has not been verified.   

&gt;These birds have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They build their nests in rock crevices in cliffs or hollow trees. They never settle voluntarily on the ground [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] and spend most of their lives in the air, living on the [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) they catch in their beaks.

&gt;These swifts breed in rocky hills in central [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) and southern [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia). This species is [migratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration), wintering south in the [Indian Subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Subcontinent), [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia) and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). It is a rare vagrant in western Europe, but has been recorded as far west as [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) and [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain). In June 2013, the bird was spotted in the United Kingdom, the first sighting in 22 years. This bird flew into a [wind turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine) and died; its body was sent to a museum.

&gt;Seriously dude your Analogy is completely ridiculous. Water is a molecular compound. Ivory is mostly enamel, Hydroxylapatite - Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 . It can be made synthetically. No one is calling for a ban on Hydroxylapatite, but just Ivory from elephant tusks.

Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if you're missing the point on purpose.  Nobody in their right mind would interpret what I said as stating that ivory was directly analogous to water in a material sense, the point was to use a theoretical case using a different scarce resource to illustrate that the issue with ivory isn't ivory, it's scarcity.  In my analogy, nobody would be calling for a ban on water, either....just water from *that particular location*.  Oddly enough, this corresponds perfectly to what you just said.  I'm also going to note that you've quite pointedly ignored my offer of an alternative commodity, probably because your BS objections don't work as well there.

&gt;Lol, okay if you think that's true then do the math, How much would the price for global ivory change? Exactly how long would the prices stay low? How many elephants are there in the world and how much more quickly would their population grow while prices are low, before they rebound?

&gt;Don't forget to show your work. Everything you said should be able to be proven mathematically.

&gt;Of course, you won't because you don't even know where to look up the equations. But put up or shut up.

If you had even the *slightest* grasp of the numbers involved, it would be obvious to you that the figure I used is far beyond what would be necessary to accomplish even the most extreme of results.  Either you have no knowledge whatsoever of the scale involved, or you're fully aware of what my number means and are being obstructive just for the sake of it.  In the vain hope that it's the former, I'll give you some *very* rough napkin math that should give you a sense of what we're talking about.  No, I'm not going to get into the complexities of international markets, nor am I going to calculate population replenishment with a view to the location of existing populations, potential avenues of artificial movement and general space requirements with regards to projected human encroachment (which, given the time frame, is just plain infeasible), but frankly if it isn't obvious to you by the end then you wouldn't have a hope if I went into more detail.

First, bear in mind that there are far fewer uses for ivory today than there were then: even cheap ivory would still be more expensive than most of the materials that replaced it except in a handful of specific craft goods, ""medicines,"" and ostentatious displays of wealth.  Part of the problem here is that it's hard to get a decent estimate as to how big the potential market would actually get.  If the amount we're releasing gets us to the point of relative demand-inelasticity, it's practically guaranteed to eradicate most poaching on the simple basis that poachers incur overhead not present in a pre-existing stock.  However, even amounts far short of that would be enough to tank the market (just look at the behavior of other commodity markets under similar circumstances), especially given that the profits can be plowed right back into more conventional methods for discouraging poaching.

According to one estimate, ivory trafficking between 2009 and early 2014 was [on the order of 170 tons](http://www.bloodyivory.org/stop-the-ivory-trade).  Given the source, this figure is likely an overestimate, but we're being conservative so we'll accept it.  Moreover, we'll call it five years' time, even though it's closer to five and a half.  This gives us a rough figure for *current* poaching of about 35 tons a year.  For perspective, if we were able to magically replace poached ivory with our supply, that 500k tons would last us roughly 14,000 years.  Obviously, however, it's not that simple.  Let's say that we start releasing 250 tons a year, or roughly seven times as much as is currently being poached.  That would last us roughly 2,000 years, and be more than enough to thoroughly crash the market for ivory - international trade is complicated, but you don't octuple the amount of something in circulation without major consequences.  However, let's take it even further: let's release 1,000 tons a year, over 28 times the existing supply.  For a bit of perspective, that's about as much per year as the *total* shipped to Europe during the colonization of Africa, and that would *still* last us a good 500 years.  Of course, even that far out predictions on pretty much everything become totally meaningless.  (Plus, ivory probably doesn't keep quite that long.)  Realistically, we should stop here, but since I bothered to actually take a look at things let's continue.

According to [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1609400/pdf/rstb20061831.pdf), under ideal conditions the African forest elephant can increase its population by as much as 8% per year, but let's be conservative and say 4%.  Let's say there are 50,000 forest elephants left ([again, a conservative estimate](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/27/world/africa/in-gabon-lure-of-ivory-proves-hard-to-resist.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)).  Because someone else has already done the heavy lifting, all we have to do is use the standard exponential growth formula (here 50,000\*1.04^500 ).  This indicates that, had we somewhere to put them, we'd have roughly 16 *trillion* elephants (16,430,079,078,983, to be exact), meaning that we'd run out of space to put them in long before we ran out of ivory.  This may seem like a lot, but it turns out that elephants are surprisingly good at breeding when they're not being slaughtered, and 500 years is a *really* long time.  For perspective, if we were willing to settle for a *mere* nine hundred million elephants, we could cut that time in half (and double the amount of ivory released), and cutting it in half again would still leave us with almost seven million.  

In other words, unless you're of the impression that releasing an amount of ivory equal to over a *hundred times* the existing illicit trade wouldn't crash it (not to mention providing enough money to handle any remaining poachers using Predator drones), my number is more than big enough to allow for a full recovery of the population.  Bear in mind, once again, that throughout *every single step* of this calculation I've used the most conservative estimates I possibly could, then made them even more conservative.  (Plus, I was using figures for a single species of elephant next to figures for the entire ivory trade.)  Even then, it's really no contest.  That's the magic of numbers: if you understand the general magnitudes involved, it's easy to make a decent guess then revise it upwards for safety without needing to get into too much detail.

Nonetheless, this all completely misses the point (yet again): the number I gave was impossibly high (hence ""magically"") and existed only for the purpose of demonstrating that the goal isn't to eradicate ivory but to prevent elephants from going extinct.  I chose a ridiculously high number specifically so that you *wouldn't* pull the ""well prove it"" bullshit, because I kind of assumed that you'd have at least a basic understanding of how much 500kT of ivory really was and realize that I'd picked an arbitrarily large number that would clearly be ""enough.""  In case you *still* don't get it, the point I was trying to make could be rephrased as ""if a government magically found itself with enough ivory to create an artificial price ceiling on ivory situated below the cost of poaching for a length of time sufficient to allow elephant population recovery, it would happily put that ivory into circulation rather than burning it.  If it found itself with an identical amount (in value, size or weight) of cocaine, it would probably still burn it unless another use could be found for it (destabilizing other countries, whatever).  It is obvious that policies on ivory should not mirror policies on drugs, because the problem with ivory is a shortage of elephants and the problem with drugs is the impact of drug usage (not production).""  Unfortunately, if you haven't grasped the concept already I rather doubt any further explanation will help - with that, I'm going to get some sleep.

In the league his record was 13 wins, 5 losses and 2 draws. In the League Cup he had 2 wins. In UEFA Cup he had 4 wins and 2 losses. In the Scottish Cup he had that 1 loss that you all hang his whole career on.

But wait, there’s more. Most recently, a batch of eastern European countries have been held up as role models by advocates of austerity: Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Lithuania -- call them the REBLL Alliance. They cut spending more than any other countries in Europe in 2009 and 2010 and grew faster than the rest in 2011 and 2012. Could this finally be the proof that spending cuts lead to growth? Not so fast.

The first question to ask is why there was so much cutting in the first place, and the answer is interesting. Back in the early years of this century, when these states were on the verge of becoming EU members, their bank assets looked extremely undervalued. The governments of these states, recovering from their communist pasts and eagerly embracing their capitalist futures, decided to build economic institutions that were extremely open to capital flows and friendly to foreign investment. The coming together of these two forces led 80–100 percent of the local banks to be bought by foreigners. During the liquidity crunch of 2008–9, the new Austrian, German, and Swedish parent banks decided to find the extra cash they needed by taking money from these local eastern European branches. But this meant that the eastern European countries had to watch helplessly as their money supplies flowed away.

To stanch the bleeding, an agreement was signed in Vienna in 2009 between the banks; the EU, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission; and Hungary, Latvia, and Romania. It committed the banks in Europe’s core to keeping their funds in their eastern European banks if the eastern European countries’ governments committed to austerity policies designed to stabilize the local banks’ balance sheets. The Vienna agreement prevented the spreading of the liquidity crunch to the rest of the REBLLs, so long as austerity was applied elsewhere in the region as well. The upshot of this agreement was that Latvian teachers and Romanian pensioners took massive income hits to guarantee the senior bondholders of European core-country banks.

But putting all this aside, has the cutting -- and there was lots of it -- been successful? In Latvia in 2009, consumption dropped by almost 23 percent and GDP fell by seven percent. In Estonia, both fell by almost 15 percent. Double-digit public-sector wage cuts became the norm across the REBLLs, causing havoc for public health, education, and social welfare programs. Yet the bounce back has been impressive, with these countries’ recovering between 60 and 80 percent of their losses from the contraction. Still, the game has not been worth the candle.

First, if the objective of austerity is to reduce debt, then all these countries, except Estonia, have failed: they have more debt today than when they started cutting. Indeed, Latvia, Lithuania, and Romania all ran much higher budget deficits at the peak of their austerity programs, in 2009–10, than did either Greece or Spain at the peak of theirs. Second, it will take until at least 2015, under the most optimistic of projections, for any of them to regain the ground lost since 2009, with the result that unemployment in these states will remain in double digits for the foreseeable future. And third, these countries did not experience any of the positive expectations or confidence that austerity is supposed to generate. According to a Eurobarometer poll, 79 percent of Latvians surveyed in 2009 thought that the economic situation in their country was bad. By 2011, when the Latvian growth rate was the highest in the EU, a full 91 percent of Latvians surveyed perceived the economic situation to be bad, and 58 percent said that the worst was yet to come. In short, as is the case with the expansionary consolidations of the 1980s, eastern Europe’s recent experience cannot be described as a victory for austerity. The REBLL Alliance has failed to blow up the Debt Star. In fact, it just made it bigger, and at enormous cost.""

However, for those eggs to still be a viable commercial product, farms needed a **lot** more land to let the hens out into. Again, it promotes agribusiness, who can afford to buy the big tracts of land necessary for industrial-scale free range farming. Then there's the daft aspect of the CAP which gives grants based on landholding, meaning that the larger your farm is, the more you get in EU grants. There's been talk of reform, but nothing concrete, because quite frankly the EU don't give a shit if it makes money.

The little farms, of course, have always done it, and to be fair have found a niché for a ""luxury"" product, if one that is now being marginalised by those agribusiness free-range eggs.

The mid-sized farms, especially on the continent, have actually intensified use of caged hens as a result, because they can't feasibly compete with bigger businesses but can still turn a tidy profit if they let a few lucky hens out into the yard to meet their loosely-policed free-range quota. We're practically the only country that has taken any real steps to eradicate caged hens, but the result is that more and more of our eggs are coming from the European Mainland, from farms with truly hideous conditions.

First step, stop listening to this guy, he may be big, but if he's telling you to run no test, he clearly has no idea what he's talking about. Reiterating what others have said; head to /r/steroids, read their wiki, spend a month or two reading threads, and go from there. 

&gt;a) He told me that my natural test levels are high so I shouldn't worry about it.

Have you had bloodwork done? Do you know what your test level is? Being young doesn't guarantee anything, plenty of 20-somethings on TRT due to low test levels. 

Regardless, as soon as you start a cycle, your body will shut down your natural test production. Hence why exogenous test is a must have in any cycle. 

&gt;b) Because the weight that you put on with Anavar isn't much but it isn't water weight and I have read that they aren't as toxic.

Not as liver toxic, but from the research I've done, var will wreck your lipids. You should be good for 6 weeks (dose dependant), but it's something to keep an eye on. 

&gt;I know I might sound like a complete idiot but that is why I decide to post something before actually proceeding with the cycle.

&gt; Other concern is that this game is more expensive to play than wow,

Well, is it? With credd you can pay exactly ZERO after your initial purchase. Hell, the system is so good that WoW is going to start using a variation of this system. Why do you think it is more expensive?

&gt;  To those of you still playing, is it worth it?

&gt; or do you play other games to avoid getting bored from not getting groups etc.

* Revenge of the Sith
* Shatterpoint
* Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor

And then here are some odds and ends I'd recommend:

* *Darth Plagueis*, James Luceno - For my money, one of the best EU novels outside of Stover's work. Acts as a plothole destroyer for the Prequel Trilogy.

* *Kenobi*, John Jackson Miller - Details Obi-Wan's life on Tatooine. Takes Star Wars back to its Western roots.

* The Medstar Duology (*Battle Surgeons* and *Jedi Healer*), Michael Reaves and Steve Perry - Basically a neat combination of Star Wars and MASH.

* *Scoundrels*, Timothy Zahn - A heist novel that features Han, Lando, and Chewie.

* *Dark Rendezvous*, Sean Stewart - Details Yoda and Dooku's Master/Padawan relationship, in addition to covering the story of a Jedi who can't wield the Force.

* *The Old Republic: Deceived*, Paul S. Kemp - Might be a little too far away from what you are looking for (this takes place around 3650 BBY) but I thought it was one of the better novels from this part of the timeline. Covers a time when the Sith were able to take the fight all the way to Coruscant.

In 2007, General Wesley Clark (ret) gave an interview with Democracy now.  In the Interview Clark discussed, that during the invasion of Afghanistan, he was given a list of countries that the US had decided to go to war with.  After Afghanistan, he was told they would go to war with; Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somolia, Sudan and after those, they would finish off with Iran.  Syria we have all ready discussed. Lebanon is significant due to the proposed Isreal/Turkish pipeline and I would expect to pass through Syria as well.  Siege tactics are currently being employed against Lebanon as thousands of Syrian refugees are flooding across the border.  Expect the next 'humanitarian' mission to be in Lebanon.  Somalia and Sudan are important for stability along the Red Sea and I would expect that they will come after Lebenon.  The Red Sea area is going to become important for natural gas development.  Finally, with Iran's allies in the Middle East wiped out, it will fall, thus bringing, Caspian Sea supremacy to Western Powers.  

Canada in particular, should stop the ridiculous sabre-rattling and realize that a war with Russia would be the complete end of Canada.  Russia would flood over the North Pole and the US would push up from the South.  The battle ground would be Canada.

There are few times in which heavy metal has challenged the status quo in such a way that it becomes relevant to culture.  Some of the greatest heavy metal records, both celebrated and disdained, all do one thing and that is to challenge the listener to think differently. Ozzy Osborne once said so candidly that ""heavy metal is not something that should be taken seriously on internet by elitists but celebrated in the mosh pit with brothers in arms.""  I feel that American act (hed)p.e. not only represents the Id but revels in Man's existence. 

2004 is not a time discussed for its metal. While *Autumn Aurora*,  *Geist Ist Teufel*, and *Honkin' on Bobo* are some of the most common names associated with greatness of the year, it is *Only in Amerika*, the fourth studio record by hip hop core act (hed)p.e., which is truly the one which outshines all else and perhaps the one which will transcend decades in it's influence.  Few times does one get to look at the world differently in what Allmusic user Johnny Loftus, calls  a ""thrash-hop spew [which] takes cues from Anthrax, Korn, Dirty South, pre-acting career Ice-T, and the uncompromising Psychopathic Records collective.""

2003 was a strange time for (hed)p.e. as their third studio album *Blackout* has been cited by critics like Johnny Loftus as being a record which ""expands on melodic elements that had previously played a supporting role in the band's sound."" Loftus goes on to cite that  ""Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And whether or not it is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have figured out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks."" This moment in (hed)p.e.'s history might have seemed like the crest of a very large mountain the band ascended in the span of four records but this moment would be the last for (hed)p.e. and longtime label Jive Records. 

If one were to assess *Only in Amerika* in terms of an illustration pulled from popular European folklore, the album would spark from a firehawk right after it was released by the giant on top of slumber mountain. While it may seem cliché to use the SlumberMountain giant tale to try and describe only in Amerika, it is only this children's tale which can capture the innocence and drama in such songs as ""Foreplay,"" ""Raise Hell"" and the machismo anthem ""Chicken."" *Only in Amerika* was the first record in which the band felt unshackled by the restraints of a large label. Perhaps it is this that led to lyrics such as. 

&gt;Go ahead pussy keep cryin about your bitch / While you listen to that silly faggot pop punk shit

as well as

&gt;Somethin inside of yo vaginaz got me homicidal / When you bend over - it's all over

and even

&gt;I'm talking American made hand grenades / Home grown Russian AK47s adapted now - fully automatic / Start the revolution / Let these commies fucking have it

Few times does an album come across so brazen and confident that its lyrics incite the listener to action and also allow them to mediate on its meaning. Marshall McLuhan once said that the Medium is the Message and that the medium carries with it the context of meaning. Though Hed Pe is a rapcore act whose album came on compact disc in 2004, its meaning is a call to arms which is measured in weight that is probably transported via forklift.   ",t3_311m39

Original capital came from land ownership, which was an inherently aristocratic concept. Some aristocrats were better than others at converting their original capital into sustained industrialism, back when technological and philosophical advancements started to indicate that the good old days of agricultural domination were over; still, the bulk of that original capital came from originally-privileged classes -- your average peasant, artisan or merchant would never get the resources to build a big textile mill. The middle classes were then co-opted when it became clear the system needed more managers and technically-skilled professionals than the upper classes could ever produce, who were necessary to get better returns on invested (aristocratic) capital. 

At least this is what happened in the UK, commonly considered the birthplace of modern capitalism because of the industrial revolution. In mainland Europe there were different developments (the middle classes successfully rioted in France to get access to power and capital; they struggled to emerge in Italy, where Catholic influence was stronger; were again co-opted in Prussia; and so on).

Could you elaborate? Why else bring this point up?

&gt;... provided the digital goods are delivered immediately. Valve makes you waive your rights right when you click the button, and the game isn't even on your HDD/SSD.

I'm fairly sure that when you purchase something on Steam you are purchasing a license to whatever it is you bought. You are paying for access to the software, not for the software itself. Upon purchasing a product on Steam, you are immediately granted access to the software. It seems to me Valve is completely in line with any EU law.

Yeah, I know. Talking about licenses and all that stuff is a bunch of legalese I don't even want to understand. But it's what you have to deal with in order to use this software. If you don't want to deal with it, more power to you. There are some services out there that do provide a refund policy, such as Origin and GOG.

Total contribution points without pvp: 1290.

From daily quests: 790 CP.
Stealing keys (from other alliances): Each key you steal will grant you 10 CP. PvE time: you can only steal 5 keys from each other alliance. PvP time:  10 keys from each alliance.
PvE keys: 100CP
PvP keys: 200CP
PvE monsters and BAMs: This can give you a total of 300 CP. PvE time you each 1 CP for each monster and 10 this points are doubled if you're killing on PvP time.

Daily quest starts in Fort Elenea.
Quest order I use (rank 2 this week so far): 

- Take all the quests in Fort Elenea. 

- Do the we have no banans quest.

- Back and get the ""BAM quest"".

- Teleport to ""Wastes""

- Kill the Basilisk, then go for the first gathering quest.

- Move down to the 2nd BAM and kill it, when you're there follow the left side to get 3 ""Contaminated Seeds"".

- Then go to the last ""BAM"" and kill that one.

- Teleport back to Fort Elenea and finish all your quests.

- Back to ""Wastes"" and do the ""monster quest"".

- Go towards FT (I think) deploy to the left and gather 3 ""Noctenium Ores"".

- Teleport back to Fort Elenea.

- Get the quests.

- Teleport to ""Aurum area"" (FT).

- Do the BAM and monster quest.

- Teleport to Fort Elenea, finish and get the quests.

- Teleport to Dark (something, IO).

- Do the BAM and monster quest. 

- Teleport to fort Elenea and hand them in.

3 more dailys:

- Find your time to steal keys (I do it at PvP time).

- Do ""balders temple solo"" to finish a daily.

- Find your time to do solo-vault.

1 more thing:

- PvE monsters or BAMs in the alliance territory 300 on PvE time and 150 on PvP time. (I also do this in Aurum on pvp time, gather trees and kill them).

Hinduism is easy to understand, unlike say the papacy. Gradually blobbing up to 100% of a trade node is the best way to learn how trade works too.

Em relação a uma identificação automática dos documentos com relevância, já é mais complicado. Que critério é que podemos usar para determinar essa relevância?

Um método que me ocorre é usar as mesmas técnicas que são usadas para detectar SPAM, por exemplo [filtros bayseanos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering). Criamos um conjunto de documentos relevantes e a seguir filtramos os novos documentos usando esse critério. Isto depois pode-se afinar de muitas formas.

Uma aproximação ao problema, mais simples que a anterior, será criar alarmes em função de palavras chave. Eu já tenho isso implementado usando feeds RSS. Por exemplo um feed com os últimos documentos do DR que referem ""palestina"" será qualquer coisa como:

Assuming that's US dollars you're quoting that seems a bit high to me, but then I don't know what bikes go for over there. For reference, my bike was in very good condition when I got it, had 30K miles, came with luggage and cost £1,100. I traded it 3 years later for a set of panniers on a nearly new Triumph. 

So expect it to be pristine and in full working order including extras like heated grips. I'd also definitely hold out for one with luggage - the BMW luggage system for K bikes was awesome.

I wouldn't say its a bad first bike (it was my second bike). The handlebars are a bit narrow and the brakes won't match anything on a newer bike. But it's really well balanced and very stable, the switch gear and levers are big and chunky and the 'brick' engine is very smooth and reliable. It's not a bike that's about being ridden agressively, so if you ride it sensibly, it should treat you right. 

The K75 is famously reliable. It was a cop bike all over Europe for years and I still see the occasional courier in London rocking one. But it does have some issues. From what I can remember...

Rear suspension. It's a very small single sided affair and they generally only have about 15k miles in them. They're easy enough to replace, but will cost a few hundred pounds (or dollars) so if the one you're looking at still has the original or an old replacement, I'd ask him to take the replacement cost off the price. 

Fork springs. The K75 is a long bike with long front forks. If the owner hasn't replaced these in the last 15k or so miles count on having to do this job as well. 

There is a spline in the shaft drive that can become worn and eventually sheer. Try to feel for any juddering when you pull away in 1st and obvs ask the guy if he's ever had any issues.

The original front brake disks were made of stainless steel so don't stop brilliantly in the wet and tend to warp. Check for even wear and juddering when you brake.  

That's about all I can think of, good luck and please post a pic if you buy one!

In this phase, if there's only one player advanced on the flank as there was with Mata, then he's got to be Moreno's man.  If Sakho comes out that far to mark him then we've opened a big channel right down the middle, so he can't do it.  Moreno, meanwhile, is just marking a huge empty space that no United player is looking to move into at all.  Even then, if they were to move into the space Moreno was in (assuming he went to mark Mata instead), then we're still keeping the ball in front of our defenders and the AM (Coutinho in this case) can mark the fullback there.

Our formation is very interesting because it changes significantly depending on what phase we're in.  The lfuidity of it is really neat, and it's something we're starting to see more and more of throughout Europe (Guardiola's Bayern is really the hugest example of this though).

I'm still PJSalt that Carbine fucked this up so monstrously, as oPvP was a great feature and for me livened up boring PvE areas (and transformed dailies into hilarious gang-war style battlegrounds). See: http://puu.sh/gALOt/c81d56ba63.jpg . 

Nobody's going to transfer back to PvP now, because the whole reason people went PvP -&gt; PvE in the first place was the panic to ensure they remain where the population is so that they can enjoy the benefits of a healthy economy, a healthy social atmosphere and raiding teams.

What this means is that unless they have a miraculous way to incentivize people going to a PvP server again, all of this amazing stuff that people wanted before is dead, because the negatives outweigh the benefits of pursuing it.

I miss open world PvP so much but the experience is accompanied by having a large community participating in it - myself moving to a PvP server is irrelevant without the entirety of the populating moving as well.

The thing that angers me the most is how stubborn Carbine was about it. They read the reddits, they read the feedback... and they consciously dug their heels in and refused to listen to an extremely clear message from the Wildstar playerbase. Sometimes it's good to ignore the vocal majority (e.g. class forums where 'suggestions' are strongly put forward by those in an inappropriate position of experience to understand the implications of their suggestions), and critical assessment of ideas that are suggested is always good...

However, with this issue, I don't think there was any critical assessment. What I saw was laziness and stubbornness. I usually don't want to speak up with heavy criticism, and I don't think I would here if it didn't have a positive purpose.

In this case, my point is twofold:
1) Berate those responsible for this at Carbine so they don't do this again. Whoever was in charge of this, you messed up. I'm pissed at you, and I think you have explaining to do (that's part of your job, and you should be held accountable as I think you damaged WildStar greatly). Learn from that.

2) Moving forward, Carbine needs to consider their options and what they can do (if anything) to rectify the situation. Throwing a few sweets towards people and saying ""hey come roll on pvp"" we have an event on isn't going to work here. New, uninformed players are being misled by rolling on PvP servers and it's a pitfall for any new players entering the game, so it needs to be fixed. My suggestion is to shut it down, and start coming up with a plan to fix open world PvP properly. Oh, and for those who wanna use the 'well you can just flag' argument - I flat out reject that, it's not the same, people don't flag themselves properly and for oPvP to work there should not be the option to be 'safe' in an open area without guards.

&gt; European Bitcoin trading volume is 1,394 BTC. We’ll keep an eye on the European markets to track if there’s an increase.

I’ve been noticing an increase in Euro to bitcoin trading volume. 3267 bitcoins have been traded in Euros over the past 24 hours, which is more than double what it was at the time of that post. This may not be huge when compared to USD and CNY pairings but it’s an increase nonetheless. I mention this because some parts of Europe are undergoing a financial crisis. One of Bitcoin’s selling features is its ability to circumvent capital controls and has the potential to mitigate bank runs and bail ins. It’s too early in the game to see a significant impact on the markets, as most people still don’t know how to use Bitcoin.

Trading volume in general has cooled down, especially in China. Price action is uncertain and traders may be hesitant to use high leverage. Perhaps many are waiting for a break out, which means a few large orders can swing the price in either direction. We’re seeing strong support between $236-$240. If $236 breaks I anticipate a major dump and if $255 breaks perhaps we’ll see another bull run. Everything in between can give you consistent scalping opportunities but its risky.

As the old saying goes, prices take the stairs up and the elevator down. Only time will tell what the next major move will be…

I’ve been very busy lately (moved twice) and this subject has been pushed a bit to the side and I completely forgot to answer your post. 

**Government**

I am glad we somewhat agree on the region approach as I firmly believe that it will be the ”easiest to swallow” for a lot of the people who do not live in the biggest urban areas. As far as the LAU in Finland, I think Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Estonia all need to follow the same route as Denmark in cutting down the number of municipalities and granting greater power to each of them. Denmark cut their municipalities from 270 to 98, while also reducing their NUTS level regions from 13 (or 16) to 5. Norway is currently in talks to reduce their LUT level (kommuner) from 428 to somewhere around a hundred, and the  NUTS level (fylker) from 19 to maybe 5 larger (landsdeler).

**International**

I agree that the most probable scenario is that all countries join the NATO, mostly because of the eastern region being uncertain and that no country seems to be willing to increase their defense budget to the heights needed to be an effective deterrent on their own.

**Monetary**

I really have no idea how that would play out. As far as I know all countries fulfill the necessary criteria to join the Eurozone, but are they willing? Sweden and Denmark maintaining their permanent opt-out suggests not. But Norway’s economy is very dependent on the oil prices, so maybe a solution is to seek safety in the Euro?

**Languages**

I think Scandinavian as a language is a necessary thing for the Union, but I agree that it might not be the best suitable as the official state language. As far as I know the proficiency of English in all countries are well over 90% (well over any proficiency in a Scandinavian language in any non-Scandinavian country), so English is a probably the strongest contender for a common language for all the countries. And the other union languages should be accessible and voluntary to learn everywhere. But again, we run into the problem of feeling at home in your own country. Many inhabitants might not be comfortable to speak English on an every day basis, and this might just be enough resistance to bury the idea. 

**Flag**

Great idea for the flags! Currently most regions have coat-of-arms but not really a flag, so putting the coat-of-arms in the top corner is a great way of incorporating the symbols for the regions in the union! :D

**Capital**

Gothenburg is probably the most diplomatic solution, and probably the one to gather the least friction. And it is also a very populated region situated close to the geographical center of the union, and also close to continental Europe. 


**Expansion**

As for land grabbing, I don’t think that is a very good idea. The areas you mention Karelia, Isle of Man, Shetland, Orkney, Slesvig and Newfoundland might once have been a part of the current Nordic countries, but I struggle to see any similarities or cultural bonds between the people that live there now and the current inhabitants of the Nordic countries. Those areas are probably better off in their current state (maybe with the exception of Karelia). Aaaand in the case of Newfoundland it would be difficult to govern a populated area many timezones away.  

But again, thank you so much for your time and I am sorry I didn't answer earlier. I will try to make amends to the webpage where I see fit, and when I eventually get time to tinker with this again ☺

&gt; During his time at United, particularly during the Treble season, Beckham was often more important to the team's success than Scholes and Giggs, yet now he is by far the least celebrated of that midfield.

Often times he was not. Giggs scored the crucial goal against Arsenal and Juventus that year. Beckham ran riot early in the season because teams, especially in Europe, were putting 3 men on Giggs and didn't know who Beckham was. As the season progressed teams started to mark Beckham more closely and Giggs did much better in the second half of the season.

It would be based on individual cases and the patient's rights. The patient has a choice in accepting treatment, choosing their doctor, or going into something like hospice care, but a patient should have less control over what determines the treatment the doctor will give them.

Europe is already doing a few things similar to this, although I don't know how they weight patient's rights. I know that in France, where continuing life support has been a choice under the responsibility of the physician, relatives were found to be statistically more likely to have overall positive feelings about that loved one's life, especially in the case of babies. They were more likely to say ""he/she was only here a short time, but we already learned so much from them,"" then they were to say things like ""I feel like I was forced to kill my own [insert loved one here].""

Doctors are simply just closer to being more objective and more suitable for making any kind of decision regarding treatments. This is anathema to American belief that choice is the most important thing we have, whether it's ice cream cones, shoes, or even a child.

Of course, abortion should be something every woman has access to. But you seem to be mistaken in thinking that life only begins at birth. The cells begin forming at conception. Cells are alive, and therefore the fetus is alive. Everyone accepts that this is true, so what they really concern themselves with is sentience and cognitive awareness or ""how developed is the child?"" However, cognitive development is just an excuse. The woman in this article had a child that was about to be born, but it's own brain development is irrelevant to those members of the pro-choice movement who believe that you should always have a right to kill your child, pre-birth, no matter what. With this logic, there's no real reason you shouldn't be able to kill a 2 week old baby, who certainly isn't much different than a baby just about to pop out.

The only difference is a false assumption that we can assign personhood to someone unable to speak for themselves, as we deem necessary. Sometimes killing is a necessary solution, however it is not those emotionally involved in a situation who are the most fit to determine how important their child's right to life is. It trivializes life and makes it unimportant.

My frustration is with people who believe that reality changes based on the label they slap on things. A baby in the womb is still a baby. It is an offspring. A child. The idea that we get to decide when children are not humans or truly alive or what have you is why people are disturbed and afraid.

I would imagine that the truth is not abortions are unhappy affairs. I am sure that most mothers would not want to kill their unborn children, but there are times where one has no choice. Sometimes, you would be preventing a child's suffering and destitution, as well as their own. This is why I would suggest that the three factors to consider are health, rape, and poverty. Someone who is financially capable of taking on a child, is perfectly healthy and stable, and is not a rape victim should not be given the right to determine whether they give an abortion. I assume this is the minority of cases, but in these cases, there simply is no moral ground from which to kill a life. At the very least, giving a child up for adoption is another consideration.

Those are women that do not want to deal with the consequence of their actions. Sex is a privilege and responsibility. It did not evolve for the purpose of pleasure but the purpose of reproduction, and we have a growing problem with people from more privileged backgrounds not being able to raise children due to the extensive educations and increasing work hours, and spouses doing the same. I would imagine that this would lead to population decline, except perhaps in the lower classes, which is who honestly needs the abortions most, so that individuals have more opportunities.

Sex is for reproduction, and society still needs that to continue, from good homes and stable environments. We are not going to get there by allowing everyone to drop the responsibility of childbirth. End of story.",t3_30yu7e

""talk like they know everything""  I fail to see why an American cannot know just as much as anyone else about the sport. If anything, Europeans talk like they know more just because of their birth. 

""while screaming [America] over and over again?"" When does this happen besides in the occasional USMNT thread? In England threads they say ""brave this, brave that.""

Ok here we go, 

Australia: Not in Europe, trades mostly with USA and China, also has tons of natural resources and supplies. 

South Korea: Trades with China and Japan regional trade partners who have lots of international trade agreements. 

Canada: Massive trade with the US, relations very close, plus Natural resources in the plentiful

Japan: (see south Korea) Close military and diplomatic relations with US. 

Chile: Part of USAN (similar to the founding EEC) 

Iceland: Not a EU but part of EFTA and Schengen which means it does follow EU rules. 

Switzerland: Again similar to Iceland, not in the EU but signs up to many of it rules even though it can't directly dictate them. 

Turkey: EU candidate to Join still pending. 

The point is most of those countries have never relied on the  EU apart from Switz and Iceland, and there under a lot of pressure to eventually join and already sign up to many of there rules. The UK does rely a lot on trade with the EU and if we leave it will shake up our economy hugely only to be in a weaker position. 

Its not about ""can we survive?"" Its about what is the best option and what does best for the people. Going through economic turmoil, putting people jobs on the line, just so we can get a ""sovereignty"" that does not exist is well ideologically insane. Why weaken our position, we will still have to listen to EU legislation just we won't get any say on it. 

&gt; Only the EU offers the world stability, economic management, and a secure future

No the EU never said this, what the EU saids, ""if you want to be part of project to make a giant economic and political union based on western European values, then come on and join. If not leave.""  There is no hidden agenda.

Right. Well, as the one of the two of us that actually has Greek nationality, let me suggest that perhaps the answer to that question should be left to the Greek people. I mean, it's nice that you're offering to kick us out for our own good and I really do appreciate it, but don't worry: we are capable of making our own decisions. 

In the meantime, as a Greek, I am not convinced that leaving the euro will do anything but inflict greater pain. As a European I fear that pain won't be limited to Greece. So I will continue to call for the only position that I think can help. 

&gt; Instead, I see plenty of evidence from the rest of the eurozone saying that Greek austerity must continue and that the memorandum must be respected. 

There are plenty of people in Greece that believe the same. Indeed, although I don't agree that austerity works, I think Greece has a better shot with austerity and inside the euro than it does without and outside. ",t3_3125g6

I agree with you, there isn't the political will for it. This is kind of my point. It is economically necessary for the eurozone to be successful to create a real transfer union. But it is not politically possible. I just can't see a solution to this! Maybe things will change? If anything, positions seem to be hardening, not softening.

&gt;  And even if Germany were to agree to this, proud nations like France or the UK will not give in to any of that in the forseeable future.

The UK is not the problem here. The UK will not be part of this, but that doesn't really matter because the UK is not in the eurozone and will never join it. I don't think the UK would object to the eurozone doing this without the UK. If anything, this could be good for the UK as it gives the UK more opportunities to renegotiate other things that the UK cares about.

The question with France is a bit more complex, but generally the French governments have been more keen on fiscal transfers than the German governments. The French were the ones that wanted the euro and the French have, traditionally, believed more in the European ""grand projet"" than the Germans have. The main difficulty with France is that their economy is decoupling from the German economy and also they are increasingly voting for extremists (more than Germans are).

I think you might have a problem with the Dutchies too, they are becoming some serious EUsceptics!

Theres a lot that comes into play for quality in recording: windshield makeup, angle, how it passes light, even the placement of the dashcam, and to how the dashcam is powered - clean supply or noisy. On price the B40+GPS is say ~$100 where the CDV is going for ~$120, not much in it for a integrated solution. 

Also, I suspect the sample videos you mention may have had a polarized filter placed between the lens and windshield - they reduce glare and reflections.

I'd recommend Unbroken. It's about a US Olympic distance runner. There was a movie based off of it last year that was directed and produced by Angelina Jolie. It's a pretty interesting book.

Mostly I've just been reading stuff online about footballers in Europe during the war. I've found one player in particular I'd like to learn more about, but there doesn't seem to be to much information on. Julius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to play on the German national team, and he served in the German Army during World War 1. In 1943 he ended up in Auschwitz where he died. He went from the greatest honor a soccer player can receive by playing for his country, to fighting for his country in a war, to his country turning its back on him because of his religion, and dying in probably the worst place to be during that time.",t3_3120i8

Data does not speak and we must then apply it to the real world to get actual answers. I've did searches and pulled up academic studies containing the facts you seem to think academia is denying.

i am not claiming that they deny IQ differences etc, i am claiming they are culturally marxist, which means they will use cultural differences to explain the inequality.  they will not admit genetic explanations, that is verboten.  they don't outright deny inequality, they just explain it using ""culture"".  they are ideologically opposed to genetic explanations.

&gt;There are natural fluctuations around mean values. You seemed to deny this by saying there was some hard cap on how intelligent a black person could be

there's a soft cap.  the cap is the highest IQ ever recorded for a negro.  pretending there is no cap is absurd as i demonstrated by asking for a 999 IQ black person.  i am not saying a smarter black cannot be born with a higher than ever before IQ, but it is extremely unlikely.  that is a soft cap on black IQ.

&gt;and completly refused to accept the countless examples of intelligent, skilled black people as a counterpoint.

you gave me an arab and a list of halfbreeds, iirc, then you suggested shaka zulu, a psychopath who held negro slaves, was into rape and murder, and lost a war against a numerically inferior british army.  i'm blown away by his brilliance.

&gt;Statistics is tricky and so is interpreting them

i know how to interpret statistics.  this is a strawman which you have thoroughly defeated.  you can leave it alone now.  

i think you are still denying the genetic link to poor black behavior, is that correct?  and poor intelligence?  or have we got over that hurdle now?

&gt;A black person is not 85% percent as a smart as a white person.

85% of black people are below the mean white IQ value.  i am significantly above the mean white IQ value, so there is something like a 95-99% chance i am more intelligent than any given negro i encounter.  and this is american negros who are mixed with europeans...  in africa, the odds of meeting a negro with above my IQ would be 0-1%.  jewish lies about fractals aside, they have never built a civilization.

&gt;Since the dawn of history the Negro has owned the continent of Africa -- rich beyond the dream of poet's fancy, crunching acres of diamonds beneath his bare black feet and yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white man showed to him its glittering light.

&gt;His land swarmed with powerful and docile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart or sled. A hunter by necessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving beyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an hour. In a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved a block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud.

&gt;With league on league of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he watched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf on his beach, the howl of the storm over his head, gazed on the dim blue horizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a sail.

this is the problem with all these studies. Higher immigration from places in eastern Europe undercuts the lowest earners, people that struggle through as Kitchen porters, shop assistants, and labourers, this allows for employers to get people who are willing to work for less for a longer time, that improves profits and is a net gain for the economy.

The reason why immigration helps create new jobs is because forces younger people to train to higher levels, this is why you know need more qualifications to work your way up through labouring that what an accountant needed twenty years ago, having a better educated workforce means more business can compete. In the long run everyone wins. (Immigrants are unlikely to work their way up, but their children are born as full British/Irish citizens and have no language barriers, or gaps in education.)

Everyone wins except for the typical Belfast scally who spent 10 years doing dishes for minimum wage before someone was able to undercut her wage. someone who is incapable of retraining and is unable to find work because she cannot remain competitive, and has to spend the rest of her life living off the state.

This is why countries that have recently started to attract more Immigrants are having knee-jerk reaction racists, because as much as immigration helps a country, it does it replacing people who already struggle.",t3_311hdq

You could chop one down and count individual rings to determine the age of the tree. Such as Old Tjikko which is 9,550 years old.

Actually, they didn’t get that tree’s age from counting the rings. [According to here]( http://enjoysweden.se/en/object/old-tjikko-oldest-tree-in-the-world/), “The age of the tree was determined by carbon dating of the root system under the tree, not by dendrochronology, or counting tree rings. The trunk itself is estimated to be only a few hundred years old…”

The only trees that actually do have more rings than there have been years since the Flood are ones that can grow multiple rings in a year. So really, if anything, the tree rings we see would be an argument against the evolutionary timeline: if trees have been growing for millions of years, why are all of our trees with annual rings only about 4000 years old? 

&gt;You can observe in Greenland, Antarctica, etc. And drill into the snow ice. This ice is is up to 680,000 layers and it compacted over the course of each year. Inside of this ice are airgaps or tiny bubbles if you will of atmosphere that scientists are able to recover and observe the make up which end up being in line with the time period.

Do you know of any specific examples of this? Like with Old Tjikko, once we look into it with more detail we’ll see what you’ve heard doesn’t wind up actually lining up with the data. 

&gt;In the grand canyon there are layers of ancient rock that could not have settled in the timespan that creationism presents.

Sure they could! The Flood would actually create excellent conditions for stratification and hydrologic sorting.

As http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doubts-on-dinosaurs/, notes, “sediment settling after a high-energy event, such as an impact, tsunami or storm, produces identifiable layers”. The Flood would have been the most hi	gh-energy event to occur in our planet’s history – it quickly producing layers wouldn’t have been much different from other high-energy events like these. 


&gt; Creationist also like to say that the grand canyon was created by the great flood.

Actually the more common view is that it was formed several centuries post-Flood.

&gt; If that is so why do we not have multiple grand canyons on multiple continents.

Evolutionists like to say that the Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River – so if a rather typical river produced it why do we not have multiple grand canyons on multiple continents?

In reality the Grand Canyon was formed after the Flood in very atypical circumstances. What likely happened is that two very large – the size of the Great Lakes - lakes after the Flood spilled over. That colossal amount of water is what carved the Grand Canyon. [See here]( http://www.creationscience.com/onlinebook/GrandCanyon5.html) for an in-depth step by step look at the Creationistic model of its formation.

Since there were no similar giant spillovers, there are no other Grand Canyons. So under your view, why did no other rivers carve Grand Canyons? What makes the Colorado River so special?

&gt; Neanderthals also disprove it. The story starts with Neanderthal showing up in Europe about 400,000 years ago, long before modern man.

And what are you basing this date on?

Also, Neanderthals were completely and fully human in every sense. They had art, like masks, according to http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3256228.stm, and paintings, according to http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21458-first-neanderthal-cave-paintings-discovered-in-spain.html. They also [buried their dead]( www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/science/neanderthals-and-the-dead.html?_r=0), and did so the same way as everyone else. As [discussed here]( http://www.heritagedaily.com/2013/02/early-human-burials-varied-widely-but-most-were-simple) “the majority of [very ancient] burials were fairly plain and included mostly items of daily life [placed in the graved] as opposed to ornate burial goods. In that way, many were similar to Neanderthal graves. Both early humans and Neanderthals put bodies into pits sometimes with household items. During the Upper Paleolithic, this included ornaments worn by the deceased while they were alive”. 

In fact this is basically how we bury our dead today in the Western world: we put someone in a suit like they’d wear while living, often with some of their jewelry like their wedding ring, and then we put them in a pit. 

And, Neanderthals they could breed with everyone else, since, according to http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18869-neanderthal-genome-reveals-interbreeding-with-humans.html?page=1, for most non-Africans “between 1 and 4 per cent of their genome” is Neanderthal DNA. 

So there’s absolutely no basis for saying they weren’t human. But I suppose people have been using evolution as the basis of scientific racism to label others as non-humans since its inception, so this is just par for the course.

&gt; Creationism also mentions 7,000 kinds of animals.

Who mentions this? I’ve never heard someone say there are 7000 Kinds. Its not even possible to know how many there were originally since so many have gone extinct.

&gt; A number that is agreed upon when it comes to how many different species are on earth is about 20 million.

A Kind and a species are completely different keep in mind. There’s not even a firm definition for “species”. 

All sorts of things are in different species that under Creation would typically be grouped into the same Kind. Take all the different species of ants, or lions and tigers, for example. 

&gt; In the timespan of the creationism myth we would have to find an average of 11ish new species/day

You’re ignoring the fact that not every kind of organism started out with just two members, that was only the case for humans. He filled the Earth with all the other organisms. So they were created with large and quite likely diverse populations from the get-go.",t3_310gxq

I have Wordpress sites and they started to slow down as my visitors number increased, so when i asked for help from my old hosting, they decided that it is completely normal to charge me for any tips or help for speeding up my websites.
That was the last straw. I decided to look for another host.
Fast forward two weeks, i narrowed my choice to [Rosehosting](https://rosehosting.com) and another one from Europe.
It was touch and go until the end, but i felt more trust in Rosehosting after talking with one of their representatives and they said that migration of all my data will be done by them, for free.  Additionally, i didn't find a single bad review for them in all the reputable review websites.
I signed up with them, they migrated my websites, emails and databases, they configured caching in the server which increased my websites speed enormously. 
I think that migrating your data for free, configure your server for optimal performance pretty much shows the level of managed hosting one company should have.

limited releases aren't meant to do much besides gauge demand and test networking/bandwidth issues.

Let us also not forget, Apple paid them for this, this is also common, this will temp a few people to go out and spend the $100 dollars on an AppleTV because they can't wait only 90 days.

In the end though, it is a 90 day exclusive deal, and after those 3 months it will be available on a multitude of other platforms. So going back to your original statement of ""any one else is fucked"" no they aren't fuck because it will come to them eventually, I mean do you think Netlix was available on all platforms when it first came out? No it wasn't because they didn't even have a streaming service when they first started, it took a few years and even then the service was limited on what devices it came out on, it is only today that we see it on every single TV or Bluray player.

Also lets go back to international availability, Netflix started out only in the United States, then to Canada and then to Europe and etc...even now they don't offer service to everyone in the modern world. Here is a map of where they offer service now, and remember it took them years to even make it this far. https://help.netflix.com/en/node/14164

So in the end, I think you are jumping the gun to criticize  HBOgo, comparing it to a nearly 15 year old company s footprint which took 15 years to create. HBOgo will be fine in the end.

In my mind what they are doing is smart, because they are being cautious, it is never a good thing to dump everything into one basket, they are testing the waters and will slowly ramp up like any other smart company would do, mass release and over extension of services without smaller test groups is likely to cause disaster, it is the same reason they have close beta tests on devices and games.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Prepuce
&gt; At various points in history, a number of churches in Europe have claimed to possess Jesus' foreskin, sometimes at the same time. Various miraculous powers have been ascribed to it.

http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/the_holy_foreskin
&gt; The Holy Foreskin first made an appearance in medieval Europe around 800 ad, when King Charlemagne presented it as a gift to Pope Leo III. Charlemagne said it had been given to him by an angel.

&gt; However, rival foreskins soon began to pop up all over Europe. All told, twenty-one different churches claimed to have the Holy Foreskin, often at the same time. Various miraculous powers were attributed to these foreskins. In particular, they were supposed to be able to protect women during childbirth.

&gt; Given the glut of Holy Foreskins, churches made efforts to have their foreskin authenticated by Church leaders as the sole genuine article. In the early 12th century, the monks of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome asked Pope Innocent III to rule on the authenticity of their foreskin, but he declined to do so. Later, the monks of Charroux claimed their foreskin to be the only real one, pointing out that it apparently yielded drops of blood. This convinced Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) who declared theirs to be the authentic thing.

&gt; Some medieval theologians argued that all the Holy Foreskins necessarily had to be frauds since the actual Holy Foreskin had, they asserted, ascended into Heaven with Christ. The 17th century theologian Leo Allatius speculated in his essay De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba that the holy foreskin had ascended into heaven at the same time as Jesus, and had become the rings of Saturn.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/29/who-stole-john-paul-s-blood-and-christ-s-foreskin.html
&gt; The foreskin of Christ is perhaps the most controversial missing relic after it disappeared in 1983 under mysterious circumstances. Until then, it had been encased in a gilded box and paraded through the village of Calcata, north of Rome, in an annual procession marking the annual day of circumcision. It was purported to be the only piece of Christ’s body on earth. Those who made a pilgrimage to pray to the relic were given a 10-year indulgence. The practice was altered in 1900 when anyone who dared mention the holy foreskin—except during the feast day on which it was honored and put on display—was subject to excommunication. The practice of parading the prepuce once a year continued until it disappeared in 1983. Conventional wisdom was that the foreskin found its way to the Vatican, either taken there by the priest of Calcata or snatched in secret. The fear, according to David Farley, who wrote the book An Irreverent Curiosity: In Search of the Church’s Strangest Relic in Italy’s Oldest Town, was that scientists might attempt to clone Christ from the tiny flap of flesh.",t3_31234q

I do not care for the Mohammedans any more than I care for the Jews.  As for the Dome of the Rock?  Their right.  You conquer the territory, you have the right to do as you will with it.  If the Temple was so important they should have fought harder to keep it or died trying.  You don't get to flee the territory, roam the Earth spreading your parasitism, and then come back millennia later and lay a historical claim to it.

#2 That is not at all how the Zionist State came to be.  Some Jews did indeed buy territory fair and square but they were a very small minority.  The vast majority of them came from Europe between the great wars due to the Balfour Declaration promising British support for a Zionist State in return for Jewish Zionists in America agitating that country's entry into WWI.  Yes, there was certainly violence between Jews and Palestinians during that time but widespread violence did not begin until shortly before WWII when the Zionists took advantage of Britain's occupation with more pressing matters to step up terrorism against the British Mandate and the indigenous population.  Look up the horrific acts committed by Menachem Begin and David Ben-Gurion and then defend the measures they took to create their vile state.  These are people who were treacherous enough to bomb a boat load of their fellow Jews to make a political statement about the British restriction on Jewish migration to the Mandate.  In short, the Irgun and Haganah were not resistance groups against Palestinian violence, they were terrorists who were out to blackmail the British government into speeding up their takeover of the region.

#3 I do blame them because they have no claim to that land.  As badly as I despise the Mohammedans and their barbaric religion and customs, the land was theirs.  If there was a massive influx of Cherokee Indians looking to reclaim their homeland where I currently reside, I would resist them with every fiber of my being and by all means necessary because this land is, essentially, a spoil of war.  They fought bravely, they died, my people live here now.  Also, those Jews that you're angry with for attempting to destroy Western culture are the same Jews that you are defending.  There are divisions among Jews, surely, but within damned near every one is a committed Zionist.  Their blood bond, forged over millennia, is more powerful than any left-right squabble and those leftist American Jews are no more American than a Somali who stepped off of the boat yesterday.  They have always been, and always will be, an alien people who infiltrate and financially dominate their host country with no thought to its own survival, but with every thought on the Jewish State.

#4 That is not at all what my argument is akin to.  The Jews did not take that land by force.  They did not buy it fairly.  They took advantage of a desperate Britain to gain entry in large numbers, connived the British forces into disarming the indigenous population whilst allowing the Zionist ""resistance groups"" to remain armed, and finally used the Holohoax as leverage against any nations with reservations about handing over a country to these rat bastards.  Creating Israel out of the Palestinian mandate because they supposedly had a religious and historical right to the land is *exactly* like handing over New York City to the Mohawks.

And people never make that argument about any other country when talking about foreign aid. For some reason, people only scrutinize charitable acts when the US does it. 

It was seen as a win-win. Rebuild Europe while at the same time boosting the US economy. Does the fact that the US benefited from it make it any less of a good deed? Does everything have to be selfless? If so, then can you depict ANY country's actions as ever being altruistic?

Here's a history lesson, the British, French, and Russians wanted to do to Germany exactly what they did after WWI, at the end of WWII. The US prevented them from doing this and instead of demanding reparations, the US rebuilt Germany's economy for free, and the economies of many other nations. Compare the state of West Germany to East Germany to see the dichotomy of receiving US aid vs. being the victim of the Soviets. Eastern Germany is STILL struggling to some extent. The westerners have had a decades-long headstart that was based almost entirely on having a cozy relationship with the US. What the US did was objectively altruistic.

In the beginning was France Telecom, the national phone operator. They own the copper lines, and basically the whole infrastructure. When other Internet providers started to deploy DSL, the authority forced FT to give access to the copper lines (the last mile) to them. This enabled them to  deploy quickly in the whole territory and most people could soon after choose between getting the Internet from FT or from other companies (SFR, Neuf, etc.).

We also had cable at that time, but it never really took up... There was some sort of an unofficial cartel between all the providers at that time to keep the prices high (starting at around 50€ or more per month), and this lasted a few years until Free (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_(ISP) ) decided to fire up the big guns.

They launched a new DSL offer that was 50% cheaper than everybody else. Even though their service was kind of shitty at the beginning (network was OK, but line activation took weeks and the support was abysmall), they got traction and put pressure on the other providers, and because their plan also provided unlimited phone calls + TV in addition to the Internet (through innovative set top boxes), it quickly forced everybody to lower their prices and offer similar plans.

Hadn't we had a government that forced FT to open their copper lines, or a disruptive actor like Free, it would have surely been very different.

On a side note, Free entered the mobile market a few years ago with a similar strategy. My current plan with them is 20€ for unlimited calls, unlimited SMS, 4G with 20Gb monthly fair use, with free calls to dozens of country and roaming (voice + data) in EU....

I'm a Brit and while the ESA is great I think if we combined the budgets a lot could be gained from economy of scale. 

I agree they should invite more countries to collaborate. 

The problem is, the more people you invite in, the more opinions you get on everything. Let's say NASA and the ESA were combined. On paper, that sounds great. But let's say NASA continues to be funded at $18 billion from US taxpayers and the ESA gets their $4-6 billion from European taxpayers.

The US might say - well shit, we're paying way too much, you guys need to pay more.

Europe might say ""fine"" but then France and Germany say ""no way, we don't want to pay"" in which case the UK has to step up and shoulder more of the burden.

But then the UK's voters are unhappy, and threaten to withdraw from the ESA, etc.

The same crises going on over the EuroZone and all that would be brought into NASA, an agency that doesn't want to deal with more politics - now at the international level, where the US government has no power over other's desires for funding.

&gt;  However, why oh why, does US government systematically exclude China from all NASA and international space projects.

&gt; They have the cash, they have the interest, and they want to join in. Quit with the blind political prejudice and invite them in, before you need to go begging to them to be allowed in to their projects. (With all the waste of resources such duplication would involve.)

Because space technology has dual use purposes with military technology, and no one trusts China's promises to keep it civilian-use only.

China bought an ex-Soviet aircraft carrier claiming it was going to be turned into a casino. The company turned out to be a front for the Chinese Navy who have since refurbished it and commissioned it as an aircraft carrier.

Likewise, Russia doesn't want to sell its best jet engines to China because it knows China will reverse engineer and copy them and put them on their own fighter jets.

This isn't blind prejudice towards the Chinese.",t3_311ukd

I can give you a few examples. Sorry for not elaborating earlier. Do you know what a ventricular assist device is? Essentially it is a mechanical pump that does the work of the heart for patients with advanced heart failure who cannot or do not qualify for transplant whether because of other disease or simply no hearts available. There is no cure for heart failure, just a slow descent into death. In Europe, in many countries they limit the number of implants per year. Many patients with resources travel to usa and other countries and pay cash for service. Those who cannot afford are medically managed to best of ability. This is not an issue with the U.S. System. Regardless of procedure, you can get it. This would be what people who use scare tactics would call a death panel(I am not one of ""those"" people). 
The same can be said for more common procedures like hip and knee replacements. 

In a universal system, you have a pool of money available to care for people. You have a budget. You have seen what our government does with Medicare and Medicaid, drastically underestimated and now aRe struggling to keep solvent. The American people are the never give up type, and a lot of our money is needlessly spent in the last days of life doing anything to keep people alive in the hopes of miracles.

1) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

&amp;gt; ""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""

Source: [American Psychological Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence:_Knowns_and_Unknowns)

2) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

&amp;gt;The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein &amp;amp; Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)

Source: [University of California and University of Western Ontario](http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf)

3) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. [The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 compared to is 30:1.](http://i.imgur.com/AmwfD29.png) 

&amp;gt;The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

4) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the [Raven's Progressive Matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in South Africa between white and black engineering students:

5) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions.  Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

&amp;gt;The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

6) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

7) From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites. 

[Source: US Department of Education](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=171)

8) From the elementary education achievement perspective: At both the grade 4 and grade 8 level, there is a persistent achievement gap between whites and blacks in both mathematics test scores and reading test scores in ALL states.

9) Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

I am more disturbed by the fact that while both Battlefield and Call of Duty tends to boast their ""realism"", their basic ideas of world politics are pretty much the least realistic aspect of their games.

Why is Iran always a part of an evil MidEast coalition based in Riyadh? Iranians and Saudis hate each other, and based on the recent events where Iranian-backed Houthis and Assadists are fighting Saudi-backed rebels in both Yemen and Syria, the basic concept of a Shia Iran joining a coalition of Sunni Arab nations is fucking laughable.

It's funny, insulting, racist and displays everything that's wrong with Western perception of Middle Eastern politics.

Iran would be willing to fight an evil MidEast coalition run by bloodthirsty Gulf Arabs alongsides the US and Europe. It's the reason why right now hey're sending Shia militias to fight ISIS/Daesh and had to rely on US airstrikes to retake Tikrit for fuck's sake!",t3_312k5d

Because we did bad things to everyone else in order to now be better off than them.


&gt;Then there's the point about colonialism and white privilege. I don't understand this point, every nation and race have pretty much been murderous bastards in the past, some more successful than others, although I'd like to note here than I'm an Estonian and Estonia has never subjugated other people. Africans killed other Africans, native Americans killed other native Americans etc. I don't see anything that would suggest that white people were more brutal than any people subjugated by the white people, white people were just more successful.

If africa won the colonialist lottery and ended up in western europes position, it would be more or less the same situation. Youre not wrong but its not that relevant.


&gt;Lastly, why is it wrong for me, an Estonian who is white, but has been subjugated for most of the past 700 years to wish for a homogeneous society. 

Its not, its wrong that you need everyone to be white for it to be homogenous.

&gt; Estonia who's people when seeking refugee in Sweden and Finland during the Soviet occupation were handed over to the Soviets and killed, to deny refugees from countries who's cultures are incompatible with ours. 

What does that even mean? Which cultures are incompatible with yours?

&gt; Why does this make me a xenophobe and a racist? 

Because you cant get along with people who arent from your culture and you want to keep people out of your country based on the color of their skin.

&gt; Why can't I support policies that support the continuation of my people and the economic and social well being of us? 

Those two things arent connected. your people will continue regardless of the colour of their skin wont they?

&gt; Why is it wrong for me to be against policies that would increase crime, lower our HDI and lower our cohesion, when countries that are much richer seem to fail with dealing with these issues appropriately?

As I recall we had a cheap, heavy dome tent which was so heavy we had to split the weight between us...  But we got by OK.

That said, try to look at all possible outcomes before you set off on such a journey.  Looking at your choices I see a few things that I would think about a bit more before jumping in.

1.  Weight.  That's heavy gear for backpacking.  Not sure what the packed size is but probably not small if that's the weight.  I would aim for 2-3 kg max.

2.  Vestibule (porch) size.  That's a large vestibule there and I would question whether you really need all that space.  You are sacrificing a lot of inner tent space for that vestibule and it seems like it might be a waste.  Look for the approximate size you think you'll need otherwise you're just adding packing weight and size where you don't need it.  That vestibule looks like it could host a wedding reception garden party!

3. Configurability and set-up ease/ quality of equipment.  On longer trips with lots set ups and take downs, different climates etc, your tent is going to need good quality poles and material.  You don't want a pole to snap mid trip.  It looks like this tent cannot be set up with only the fly sheet (i.e. shelter form) or have the flysheet removed so that you can just use the inner tent.  You might wonder why you might need those configurations but, say you didn't sleep one night and are tired, want to sleep during the day but it's a nice warm sunny day - you're not going to sleep in your tent with a flysheet on it on a sunny day - that's for sure.  It'll be a sauna!  But if you can configure it as a shelter (without inner) or as an inner only, you'll be all good.

So a quick search I found [this one](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Backpacking-Tent-Reviews/Hilleberg-Anjan-2) which looks pretty good.  Comes in a bit more expensive at just over 400 pounds but it's light at 1.6kg.  Possibly a perfect vestibule size for backpacks and a bit more, highly configurable, great in storm conditions (check out the video at the bottom of the page where a guy sets the tent up in front of a wind maschine!).  It can be set up as only a shelter with ground sheet also - great for ducking out of sudden rain storms or sleeping/relaxing in hot weather day or night.

Consider whether you will want a ground sheet and inner mat too.  I'd said a ground sheet is a good option but you won't need an inner mat.  Take a therm-a-rest mat with you to insulate from the ground - this is highly recommended.  Sleeping bags with comfort down to minus 2-4 degrees maybe depending on how tolerant you are to the cold.  Maybe get sleeping bags that can be zipped together to form one so you can share body heat.  A good sleeping bag that will keep you warm at low temperatures and packs small won't be cheap, but not sleeping at night is pretty crap.  I use an bag liner sometimes that can increase your sleeping bags comfort range.  Like [this one](http://www.seatosummit.com/product/?item=Thermolite%26reg%3B+Reactor+Compact+Plus+Liner&amp;o1=0&amp;o2=0&amp;o3=139).

Read up on how to stay warm at night in a sleeping bag - there's kind of an art to it!  

For sure if you spend a little more, you might find things easier and that'll make your adventure more comfortable and less stressful.  Also, you'll have a good quality item that you can use for years.  I've always bought what I thought was quality stuff and have never had anything break or tear.  As for that 50 quid dome tent I used many years ago on my trip around Europe I think we took it out into the backyard when we got back and ceremoniously burnt it!",t3_31381q

Più in generale, Craxi è il massimo interprete (con Andreotti, ma lì si va nella Dc che alla voce americani è un discorso a parte) della politica estera Mediterraneo-centrica in chiave antiamericana. Lo fa sempre con grande schiettezza e senza nascondere niente agli americani (alla fine con Reagan si staranno persino simpatici), ma lo fa nondimeno.

* Opinione pubblica - Fino a Tangentopoli, le benemerenze accumulate sul campo avevano fruttato a Craxi una certa simpatia trasversale. Simpatia particolare, perché veniva in massima parte da persone che non votavano Psi: quali che fossero le differenze ideologiche, il rispetto diffuso di cui godeva Craxi ""perché lui almeno quella volta agli americani gliel'ha fatta vedere"" era massiccio.

Some are quite good at this, other quite poor. If the concern for the OVERALL population drives policy then you see better outcomes. Swedes, history aside, are quite good at allowing all who enter its gates to prosper, through good social policies. But they are also quite effective at including those who come in to integrate into society. All who I met there from elsewhere spoke Swedish.

Of course the traditional Estonians have gone through horrible occupations, they have been murdered, sent to Siberia, and their language and customs trivialized under Soviet rule. Continual public education on Estonian traditions and values, promoting the cultural events like the song festival, these are ways to mitigate outside influences. Most immigrants in Estonia I've met are quite shy about learning the language, or in the case of Russians, unwilling. Language is not an issue for immigrants in Sweden where there is enough funding available to promote education in Swedish language. There is also more social openness in Sweden that is noticeable. 

Estonia is very competitive at the moment because of low wages and a relatively low cost of living compared with the rest of Europe. This will need to change if Estonia is to develop further. It is a beautiful country and one you should be proud of being born into. However, what you need to keep in mind is that if you are only supporting policies that help only traditional Estonians, that means not supporting the rest of the population, including Russians I assume from your phrasing. When you further isolate that population through public policy you are inviting further confrontation, along with more poverty and crime. More than providing services only for Estonians, there needs to be a greater narrative of Estonia for all within its borders. Promote the language, teach it in the Russian schools as well, and allow outsiders to participate in culture. Being inclusive will give you a better outcome. 

One of the poorest examples: The U.S. is still balancing this equation. We have a greater narrative, but lack the policies to provide avenues to prosperity for many minorities and the poor. ",t3_314rlr

Public schools are free to attend and charter schools can be attended with a voucher from the state. Private schools are extremely expensive. For what it's worth, charter schools are far more common there, with public schools being sort of invisible. Most people either go to charter or private schools.

The problem with Chile's voucher system is similar to the problems that come with Fair Student Funding in urban school districts. The schools receive their funding on a by-student basis. This makes logical sense--the school receives an operating budget roughly equivalent to its student population and so all needs should already be met by the time the student walks through the door. The problem with this is that it really doesn't account for accidents and happenstance--when accidents occur, there is rarely any room left in the budget to cover whatever needs to be fixed and so things like broken windows or desks just become a part of the school until they can find a way to bring in a new student.

On top of that, it's difficult to quantify how much a student should be ""worth."" In NYC, ELL and special ed students are ""worth"" significantly more for a school's budget, but this does not necessarily translate to the money going straight to that kid as it's usually unclear at first exactly what the best course of action is for educating these students. Even for kids without special needs (or ones with undiagnosed special needs), there is always a huge variety in performance ability. This variety in performance ability usually translates to a need for extra resources around the school. If there is no room in the budget, then it's just not happening. Apart from all of that, this money rarely, if ever, covers operating costs for sports and extra-curricular activities.

In Chile, all parents that can afford to send their kids to private schools do so. There is no populist belief in the public schools system there. Those that cannot afford to do so send their kids to charters or public schools. The system has created this massive underclass caste of people who attend broken down, shoddy schools with shoe string budgets, quite similar to the situation in many large cities in the United States, and who are thus placed at a massive disadvantage. It should come as no surprise that these schools are usually found in areas of concentrated poverty.

**Political:**

* Foreign Policy (Military Intervention): I'm strongly for interventionism, but not the cowboy Dubya style interventionism where we needlessly invade countries like Iraq. I like Obama's style where we work through diplomacy and coalitions, and only use military force when it's the last resort.

* Justice: As a first step, I'd like to see the decriminalization of at the very least marijuana. At the end of the day, I'd like to see the legalization of all drugs, and the setting up of rehab centers to help these people. These people need help, not to be thrown in jail and have their lives ruined, especially when it so disproportionately hurts the black community. All private prisons should also be abolished and taken over by the federal government. Just their very nature is evil, not to mention what happens in these prisons and the cycles set up to keep people in them.

* Immigration: I fully support and urge the passing of the DREAM Act as a fundamental first step in repairing our immigration system. I would support giving amnesty to skilled illegal immigrants who have been in the US for a decent amount of time and who have never committed a violent crime. We are a nation who rose to our power through our immigrants. We shouldn't shun them away by, as some would suggest, building a wall along the entire border. In regard to the Central American kids, yes, they need to be sent home. However, we MUST make sure they reach their home safely. I cannot stress this enough. If there's even a possibility of their death on the way home to their countries, as we have seen before, then I would propose putting them in the foster care system with the possibility of amnesty. These kids did nothing wrong, and don't deserve to be sentenced de facto to death because of a decision their parents made.

**Economic:**

* Business and Industry: Business needs more regulation, primarily Wall St. It was the deregulation that led to our fall from grace in the Great Recession. Firstly, I'd like to see the return of Glass-Steagall. This was a fundamental regulation bill that should never have been done away with. In regards to taxes, I don't see a reason to raise the corporate tax rate. We may actually be able to decrease it by a couple points if we just get rid of all these damn loopholes we've created. Get rid of as many of them as possible, and lower the rate a bit, and we'll be doing fine.

* Employment: We of course need more private sector employment. However, we also need more public sector employment. The amount of public sector jobs has been steadily decreasing even under the Obama Administration, and this needs to stop. We need to encourage the hiring of more policemen, firemen, teachers, etc. Private sector and public sector both need to be encouraged.

* Environment: We need to encourage environmentalism and need to crack down on companies that have routinely damaged our environment. For example, here in my native state of Arkansas, an Exxon pipeline broke, contaminating a large amount of the town of Mayflower, and forcing people out of their homes. In North Carolina, waste from coal power plants has been allowed to be deposited in major rivers. And of course there's the BP oil spill. These companies need to be held responsible for the damage they do to our nation. 

* Energy: We need to encourage a major transition away from fossil fuels and achieve, in the long-run, independence from fossil fuels. Solar, wind, hydro, all of this needs to be encouraged. Furthermore, we need to end the discrimination of Tesla cars. Electric and green energy is the way to go, not this ""all of the above"" strategy Obama's touted. No expansion of fossil fuels like natural gas.

* Transport: Public transport should be encouraged and subsidized in major cities. Public transport should be cleaned up and renovated so that people don't speak with disdain when they mention the subway or buses.

**Social:**

* Education: Education should be taken over by the federal government entirely, I believe. I'd like to see also a model like Finland's education system, where kids are encouraged to go after what they're interested in. People learn best when they're curious, and that should definitely be encouraged. Not everyone needs to learn advanced algebra and trigonometry, and forcing them to waste their time with stuff like this is a travesty. That time could be better spent figuring out what they want to do with the rest of their lives. Furthermore, our teachers need to be held to a high standard. I'd like to see teachers required to have a Masters degree to teach. Of course there'd be a program for current teachers to pay for them to get their Masters degree. We should also abolish college tuition like Germany has done, and work to bring down our massive collective student loan debt. 

* Health: I'd like to see a single-payer system, or at the very least a public option that can negotiate down healthcare costs like they are able in Europe and Canada. The public option is a must-have institution. This is easily done via the expansion of Medicare to cover everyone. All it would need is minor tweaking. The ACA also should not be repealed. 

* Civil Rights, Women and Equalities: More equality is of course the way to go. The Violence Against Women Act should be passed, equal pay should be mandated for equal work, LGBT people should be protected from being fired for being who they are which is currently not the case, racial profiling should be discouraged, women should be encouraged to seek STEM fields, and affirmative action should be encouraged until equality meets a certain threshold, at which point it should be ended.

* Faith: We're a secular nation as mandated by the Constitution. ""In God We Trust"" should be replaced with ""E Pluribus Unum"" as our national motto, and official prayer in government institutions like Congress, the courts, and even city council meetings should be done away with. I'm a Christian, not a militant Atheist, but it's clear what the First Amendment says, and what the Treaty of Tripoli, which our Founding Fathers wrote and signed, says. We have no official religion or stance on religion, and should act like it.",t3_308yvu

&gt;__April Fools' Day__ (sometimes called __April Fool's Day__ or __All Fools' Day__) is celebrated every year on the first day of April as a day when people play [practical jokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) and [hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax) on each other. The jokes and their victims are known as ""April fools"". Hoax stories may be reported by the press and other media on this day and explained on subsequent days. Popular since the 19th century, the day is not a [national holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday) in any country, but it is well known in India, Canada, Europe, Australia, Brazil and the United States.

However, it appears ten words have been [deciphered](http://stephenbax.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voynich-a-provisional-partial-decoding-BAX.pdf) by a British researcher: Taurus, Coriander, Centaurea, Chiron, Hellebore Nigella Sativa, Kesar and Cotton (*an [illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7Rfqm12.jpg) of the word cotton.*)

The paper's author, Prof. Dax, also advanced *a cultural extinction theory* for the language the manusccript was written in.

&gt;This  precedent  suggests  that  the  Voynich  script could  have  been created  by  a  small  group  wishing  to encode  a  previously  unwritten  language or  dialect.  This  could be  done,  as  in  the case  of  Glagolitic
, by borrowing and  adapting signs from  other  scripts  and  devising  others as  needed. This  group  could  then have attempted to use  that  script  to write  down  a  body  of  knowledge about  plants,  the  stars  and  so  on drawing  on classical  and  other  authorities, in what  we now know  as the  Voynich  manuscript,  only  then for the culture to die out or disappear.

Given that the 15th century was a time of upheaval, in Europe in the Balkans, in the Near East with Timurid expansion as far as Turkey and the Black Sea, and also with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans 
in 1453, it is plausible to consider this ‘cultural extinction’ to be a possibility,  with  the  group  in  question
developing a  script  and  literacy,  only  for  it  to  be  extinguished. Other examples of script which have been devised, only for those who can read it to die out include the interesting Rongorongo script from Easter Island, which again attests to the viability of the theory. This does not mean that the language  itself was extinguished of course;  it is possible that related dialects are still in existence.

1.Immediate wages cut to all members of political staff to minimum wage. You should do it for purpose not Money. I want them to take a minor pay drop in order to be in office. 

2. All government funded schemes and grants(anything that cost money for the govt.)  will be abolished over the coarse of 5 years and the criteria tightened to allow those in need to get it, and those not in need not to. 

3. Tell the eu to fuck off trying to change our industry tax it's 12.5% for a reason! We've nothing else in this country. 

4. No watercharges, no house tax, and no more full council houses, if you really need to in extreme cases funding for a one bedroom apartment will be given for 1 month to assist. 

5. When voting the voter has an unlimited amount of votes they can vote 1 time or 100 times but only once for a single candidate. (this allows an equal representation for each miniority/majority) 

6. Sounds horrible but deport everyone who doesn't have a job after 1 year, we've a big problem with this in Ireland from asylum seekers just being leaches on society. 

7. A cap of €600 a week for 6 months  will be given to each household who apply for different grants and schemes. Then after it'll be a cap of €400 to get people out working. 

8. decentralise dublin and spread road networks further out  to smaller towns and make the centre of Ireland the centre of road networks. 

9. pump a ton of money into education and healthcare these are being drawn from every budget and only worsening the prospect of the country. 

10. Allow 16 year olds to vote. 

11. Legalise same sex marriage. 

12. Legalise weed, not a huge problem in Ireland but still not a terrible economic move. (success in the USA for it) 

13. All politicians caught taking bribes will be imprisoned. 

14.  For Irish to be taught in the junior cert( a lower test that the Final school exam) but still be taught for the leaving cert(the final exam) 

15. For 'life' classes to be thought in school(how to cook, pay bills, take out a loan etc.)

Most European countries have completely different situations from the US and a comparison is completely unreliable. It's almost like different situations have different results.

For instance the UK has a population density of about 650 people per sq mile. The US has 85 per sq mile. They have about the same rate of urbanization, which means that people in rural areas are far more spread out then in the UK. I doubt there are many areas in the UK where residents are over an hour away from the nearest police station. In the US that is not at all unusual for rural residents.

Plus looking at the UK (widely held up as good gun control) what animals are there to attack you? The most dangerous land predator they have less is the fox. Whereas the US has multiple species of bears, cougars, bobcats, wolverines, wolves, coyotes and dozens of other animals with the ability to straight up kill your ass.

So no, if it takes cops up to an hour to respond to emergencies (if they have someone ready to go right then), as opposed to the UKs average of 15 minutes. And the Us has to deal with actual dangerous animals rather then a fox or two in the UK. So yea, keep comparing them like the comparison means something.",t3_3146q2

Again, not claiming we're different species. But that we're bred with different temperaments, so to speak. Now genetics can account for things like the greater production of testosterone in Africans than Europeans and Asians. I believe African Americans suffer something like twice the average rate of prostate cancer. And high testosterone has been linked to low IQ.

[Glad you mentioned chimps! Here’s a clarification on their similarity, and why genetics is more complicated than people seem to think](https://answersingenesis.org/genetics/dna-similarities/greater-than-98-chimphuman-dna-similarity-not-any-more/). On the topic of testosterone – [the ‘elevated levels’ thing is funny, consider there’s evidence elevated testosterone is linked to higher intelligence]( http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/03/14/testosterone-hormone-linked-to-higher-iq/24379.html), though that aside, no one has defined how much ‘elevated testosterone’ is really significant. For example, the [average male testosterone varies by more than 50% over the course of their life]( http://philipsburgpharmacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/testosterone_decline.gif), and [over the course of a day by about 40%](http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/image.cfm?archiveid=3389&amp;type=img&amp;name=striant-02.jpg).

&gt;Again, you're using ""intellect"" in the narrowest possible context. Now, I haven't heard you directly refute this point, so I assume we can both agree that, pre colonial African populations weren't as dense as European and Asian ones.

I’m using intellect the way you are – cognitive capacity. And we do not agree – I, as I stated elsewhere, believe all human populations have virtually identical cognitive capacity, or rather, greater cognitive variation exists between any two random humans than between any ethnicities. Just like the genetic variance.

&gt;Now is it unreasonable to say that a more condensed population would begin to adapt less aggressive, more, ah... empathetic traits? And is it so unreasonable that populations that remained spread out in small villages consisting mostly of family members across a vast continent, wouldn't find evolutionary advantage in selecting for a meeker, more compromising temperament?

Yes, it is unreasonable, especially because Europeans didn’t invent cities. Though, this is your claim – support it with evidence. By this logic, the most intelligent populations on the planet would be those who were forced into high population density places, which historically is not most of Europe.

&gt;Which link was that? I find it difficult to believe that every and all IQ and congantive tests are simply testing someone's SES. 
And 'environmental factors' is kiiiinda what I'm arguing here. 

That link was referring to the SAT. And ‘environmental factors’ are things like lead exposure, SES or hunger and stress (i.e., poverty).

&gt;I'd imagine the collective intelligence of the world has gone up quite a bit. But there is still a gap.

Which, as I showed you, can be explained by testing bias and SES.

&gt;Again, you're lacking nuance. Not every ""racist"" hates black folk. I don't hate people who are less ""intelligent"" than me, no matter the race. Now, I do have a problem with many black societies and cultures. But I think even you can see why I might. That isn't to say I hate anyone for reasons beyond their own control.

This is a fine and nuanced stance to claim, but it breaks down in the face of scrutiny – for example, you claim to not hate anyone for reasons beyond their control; what do you purport is ‘their control’? Is it their fault they were born into poverty and are denied the same opportunities as someone who wasn’t born into poverty? Is it their fault the judicial system is heavily biased against them? Is it their fault they couldn’t get a personal or business loan because of their skin color? I believe that you don’t wantonly hate black people, but I don’t think you’re willing to look at the racial disparity that exists in America objectively.

&gt;African populations faced a more physically demanding environment. The individuals survival depended more on the individual. Whereas denser populations, the individuals survival depended more on their cooperation with others.

I don’t think this is true in any sense of the word. You previously claimed that Africa was an easy environment, and that adapting didn’t require cognitive advancement, because ‘food was available year round’ (which isn’t true). Now you say it’s physically demanding, and individualistic instead of cooperative – this is simply not indicative of any reality in either anthropological or human history.

&gt;Obviously. But surely I don't have to tell you how most of the human population lives near coasts and waterways. Let's not be pedantic here.

I didn’t say most human populations live away from water ways, I disagreed with your claim that ‘most Californians live near the beach’. I don’t wager you were being literal, but you’ve put forth a number of untruths.

&gt;Not all. Sub Saharan, specifically. 

You mean everything south of the Sahara? That’s a lot of land, and a lot of peoples.

&gt;If we change the term ""intellectually"" to ""socially"" I can answer you better. The African population is well suited to living a more indegenous life. … People in Africa today live as they did a thousand years ago. Now, today, ""civilization"" is typically viewed through a western lense. The most impactful (and id say destrictive) of which is our tendency to live in large dense cities. For many populations, this is simply more of the same. For some (sub Saharan Africans, mainland Chinese, native north Americans, and aboriginal Australians in particular) this is a radical departure from their traditional societies. Therefore, these populations are less suited to modern society. 

But ‘intellectually’ and ‘socially’ aren’t interchangeable. You’ve not supported this ‘indigenous life’ claim of yours at all – I could just as easily say ‘Inuits were super social, and that’s why they’re the smartest people on the planet’, and have as much credibility as you do with that handwave.

People in Africa today live in all manner of environments, similarly to people all over the world – there are Africans who live in modern world class cities, smaller shittier cities, suburbs, and villages without electricity. The same thing can be said of every country on the planet. Civilization wasn’t invented by the West – I think it’s problematic to say ‘civiliation is viewed through a Western lens’, because I don’t think that’s saying much. Do you purport that Tokyo is a western city? What about Tibet? What about Mumbai? I think it’s problematic to assume that people in Africa are ‘less suited’ to living in ‘modern society’. 

&gt;Please, please, please grasp this. I'm tired of repeating it. Humans survivability in Africa was ""easier"" because humans adapted from our ape ancestors to survive specifically in Africa. Humans come from Africa. So the African climate is more conducize to basic human survival. Do you understand now????

This is an incorrect assumption, insofar as the notion of ‘African climate being best suited for humans’, because Africa has a lot of climates. Modern humans emerged from temperate to warm climates, which are not remotely limited to Africa, and most importantly, not remotely the only climate found in Africa. Now, you seem to be suggesting that ‘once the climate got tougher, man adapted, and that made man smarter than Africans’. How do you feel about Southern Africa? Are those people smarter than people who live in warm and temperate climes? Like, say, any landmass within the tropics? 

&gt;Yeah. And your point didn't refute that. Because marriage rates don't mean squat for sexual history. So that was me debunking that argument. 

Marriage is the best proxy we have to go by – presumably people marry those they’re attracted to, which is probably the people they have sex with. But find a different example to support your claim if you reject my evidence.

&gt;Which has been shown to be offset by education. Chicken, meet egg. 

[Except not! Education means higher potential earnings, but does not offset your birth SES!]( http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/13-facts-higher-education) This is a hugely problematic fact of America, that SES at birth is a SUPER strong indicator of your SES at death!

&gt;Define ""education"". And how it would relate to traditional African society versus traditional western society. Please. If you can do that I think you'll begin to see my point.

I don’t understand what you’re asking – I was talking about America, and it seems like you’re asking about education in third world countries? Please clarify, and I’ll answer.

&gt;I don't disagree with any of this. *except the low IQ =/= low education. That's.... That kind of the definition of low IQ, innit?? 

Sort of, though education isn’t something one receives because one has a high IQ, education is something one receives because you were born into a SES that allows for it. Einstein born into poverty is simply not going to get the education he received by virtue of his birth SES. [Identical twins show pretty big IQ differentials when raised differently, with low SES resulting in LARGER IQ variation.]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030320) 

&gt;Don't be deliberately dense, else this conversation will end.

Don’t call me dense or obtuse again or this conversation will end. I’m affording you the decency of civility, and using citations to support my points - prove I haven't made a mistake in doing so.

I don't think you understand the personal relations between Stalin and hitler at all. Stalin considered hitler an extremely close personal friend, he did everything in his power to appease him. When Hitler attacked Stalin was so shaken up by it that he refused to leave his room or speak to anyone for two days. I don't see him ever suing for peace against an enemy that raped, slaughtered and butchered their way through the country side then, when faced with retreated, burnt and killed everything in their path. I don't see it possible that he would allow that to happen, especially when he was in the mind set of invading Finland and Poland before the war and Western Europe after the war. He was not scared of war and for these two reasons I don't see Stalin ever suing for peace against an army he has on the retreat. Stalin even refused to leave Moscow while the rest of the government evacuated despite the city being under siege. 

Without the oil embargo there would be no invasion of South East Asia... The end. But if they did:

In Asia the British, Chinese and indians had been fighting and holding Japanese advances in south east asia. Their garrisons in modern day Indonesia were too weak and were overthrown but in Burma they were holding their own. Experiments with the Chindits were proving extremely effective against Japanese forces and were bringing the fight back to the Japanese. India was a huge powerhouse, with production and manpower levels not seen in a single nation anywhere else in the world.

While not capable of winning the war in europe AND the war in Asia the Commonwealth is capable of forcing a stalemate in both. Since the war in Europe had been won in terms of assuring the UK's independence they can focus on Asia. Australia is at no risk, just like in real life the Japanese never drew up plans for an invasion, in fact they never even considered it a part of Asia or the Pacific. This is significant as their entire goal was ownership of both those regions. The Japanese war machine, even before US intervention, had no means of destroying the self sufficient nation. The environment would have killed them, the cities were thousand of kilometers apart and the wildlife was far more dangerous than anything in the jungles they had been fighting in. 

The supply lines for an Australian invasion were unfeasible and ridiculous. They could take Darwin with heavy casualties and resistance from the military and civilians, at this time Australia was just as heavily armed as the US in terms of civilian owned weapons. 

But aside from denying a port with which to support New Guinea (currently administered by Queensland) there would be nothing to gain. The next city is two thousand kilometers away and it is not a pleasant journey (trust me, I've driven it). The temperature gets up past 45 degrees C, the humidity is so high you can drown in it, heatstroke is a real threat even while having access to litres of clean water. At night the temperature remains so high that you would consider it a summers day in other parts of the world. Trying to cross from Darwin to any other city would be a suicide mission. There is no air conditioning, no cool water and none of the soldiers are accustomed to the climate. They would all die horribly should they move out of the city. I nearly got heat stroke from standing in the shade in the Northern Territory while drinking warm water, luckily there was a car with air con and cold water that came and picked me up. 

India had a massive armed forces, 2.5 million in 1945. Had the US not intervened then the Indian government would have seen the Japanese threat to be much more severe and mobilized the entire nation in to full scale military and production, much like Britain in WW1. A population of 600 million in full war footing would have out produced and out manned every other nation on the planet with the exception of China which was currently being massacred by the Japanese. 

Japan, just like germany, severely lacked production and resources. Unlike Germany however they lacked heavy armour, anti-tank weapons or effective officer training. instead of making their officers return to Japan to train new ones, they let them continue to fight and die on the battlefield. When new officers came they were fanatical but they were not combat effective. Much like the SS units made up of hitler youth, they were good at dying for their country but not so great at killing for it.  

Much of India's army was made up of the warrior classes, similar to the abolished samurai class of japan in which their lifestyle was entirely devoted to making war. In combination with effective British weapons, training and leadership they proved a dangerous adversary, especially to late war japan. 

With an increase in Indian support and more effort taken to ensure Chinese effectiveness it would leave Japanese forces out numbered in Burma. To counter this there would be a major reinforcement of the region by Japan and would leave the region in a sever and horrific state of battle. All resources that would have been spent on the pacific front would be sent to Burma by both sides. I cannot see any way that Japan could break a nation with 600 000 000 people lead by british officers and proven military tradition. A complete lack of effective armour, heavy guns and anti-armour weapons would end in Japanese defeat. Even a single Matilda II tank would spell disaster for an entire japanese battalion as they lacked any sort of weapon capable of destroying it. Much like the German experiences with KV tanks. Even the british 2 pounder gun could open up a japanese tank like a can of tuna and these weapons were easily portable, small and light. 

While naval supremacy would lie with japan until the might of the Royal Navy could be brought down from Europe the land war in Asia would eventually be won out by the Allies. Without US intervention Stalin might even see it fit to move forces to the east to engage japan once the germans were in full scale retreat (around 1944 in real life). he would no doubt claim land in Asia and possibly try to annex large swathes of China and Korea. Soviet forces at this point in time were some of the most well equipped and motivated forces in the world. Against the lightly armed Japanese there would be no question as to who would win. 

While not able to mount a landing on Japan or retake the island fortresses the allies could retake mainland Asia and sue for peace in their favour. Should they not accept a nuclear option could be taken since the Japanese nuclear project was all but abandoned in favour of RADAR research. 

The combined strength of the Commonwealth including India and what was left of China plus any assistance the Soviet union might be able to give would prove too much in China and Burma. 

Should neither a nuclear option or suing for peace work or be available then the allies would have to hold Japan in a stalemate. Allied dominance of China with a re-armed populace of the areas they liberate while Japan dominates the Pacific. This would lead to a sort of unwritten cease fire as neither side wants to expend more resources on a theater that neither side can make gains on. 

once Germany is defeated then the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Australia, India, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and everyone else. They would be facing off against all the dark green on this map:

I'm sure you can tell me how that would end. After the war the British Empire would either collapse completely from an expenditure of all its strength or it would grow to a size never before seen and become even more powerful than before. I really can't decide which. I suppose it depends entirely on the Soviet Union which in this scenario would be decades ahead of the US in terms of war technology and have an army ten times larger than the UK. ",t3_30tnbv

Before the net/tubes/wikipedia..... what you'd do is go to that archaeic set of books called the ""encyclopedia"". Maybe Brittanica, maybe Websters.... there'd be a 20-30 volume set of books. It was like Wikipedia, but in dead tree form.

No, you'd go to your town's central library and look up in a (no really) set of drawers called a ""card catologue"". Each drawer held a bunch of cards... organized according to the Dewey decimal system... representing books that the library had on hand.

So you'd go and search on books all about ""Belize"". You'd get a hit on a economics text book on late 19th, early 20th century south/central american exports and trade. You'd maybe get a hit off a Zugat or Michelin guide from the 1930s when Belize was a top European tourist destination.   You'd get a hit on some sociology/anthropological book from a researcher who spent 6 years living amongst the Bwungaro tribe on the river Mwoa that happened to be in Belize. And 7 references to National Geopgrahic magazine articles about Belize.

The surrounding Arab states were constructed over night on very flimsy ground, based on modern european models of how a nation-state should be defined.  

Now, all of this is important background to the Palestinian plight. Palestinians are currently under siege economically, politically, and militarily. The West Bank is in ancient Israel, which is why the Israeli right wing religious fanatics are actively settling it to push West Bankers to the margins. This is perhaps the closest comparison to Kashmir, but only superficially. The resources for Arab West Bankers is but a fraction of what is offered to the Israeli settlers from America and Europe. It is a global gentrification, that openly discriminates.

Gaza on the other hand suffers a level of abuse unparalleled. Gaza historically was mostly uninhabited until the later 1/2 of the 20th century. Today, it is literally a refugee camp that became a permanent city-state with no recognition, and almost every inhabitant is a refugee or the child of a refugee.  This also is not comparable to Kashmir.

There is no comparing Gaza with any place on the earth. It is the world's largest prison with the world's worst human rights abuses in modern history. The people there have access to electricity just 2 hours PER WEEK. They are bombed every few years. They have the threatening humming of drones overhead at all times of the day and night. And the situation right now is actually worse than it was during the recent war waged by Israel. The rest of the Arab world has abandoned them, because it had no infrastructure to establish a state at the same time as Egypt, Syria, and others. 

I understand that people want to talk about the suffering of others and not just the Palestinians, but very respectfully, I believe it is an injustice and an appropriation of suffering to compare the misery of any nation to the misery of homeless, stateless, powerless, and friendless Palestinians who are currently being erased from history.

The most obvious are the firebombing of civilian population centers, and nuking Japan twice... and the Soviet treatment of German civilians was especially brutal.

&gt;Isn't it pretty clear to everyone that Germany was taking territroy?

Not as clear as you seem to think. Do you realize Germany was offering peace, withdrawal and an independent Poland after it had removed the aggressive government there, four weeks into the war? Do you realize they were continuously offering generous peace terms from 1939 to 1943? Not once did the Allies seek to move negotiations forward and see what would come of it.

As for Germany's actions after Poland, this was the defensive occupation of lands that were being overflown to bomb Germany, and which Britain was attempting to use to gain a foothold to better attack it. Germany's invasion of Norway, for example, was a counter-invasion staged after they found out Britain was moving to occupy it -- they ended up attacking the British invasion force and driving them off. The invasion of the SU preempted a Soviet invasion of Europe by weeks.

&gt;Isnt Nationalism actually bad? I think patriotism is just as bad.

Nationalism =/= patriotism. I would only consider myself a reluctant nationalist, and only because nationalism, at least, ensures nation-state sovereignty, and is the most obvious defense against internationalism, i.e. international plutocracy.

Dude, I don't have the time to guide you through all this stuff. I've provided quite a few resources, and many more are available online.

We are pretty much an ""anything goes"" society.  Spring break type wild partying has now been extended to 52 weeks of the year by some.

The problem is that sex within marriage is important.  Marriage, or maybe coupling in general, was done in recent times so a man would know, or at least have a strong hope, that the children he fathered were his.  With loosened sexual morals, men are going to be skeptical of their alleged fatherhood.  Now DNA testing will show if more women are lying and cheating.  If this becomes a big issue, more and more men will opt out of the traditional 'settle down, marry, and be a provider' type role.

We also have feminist types in a civil war.  Some are for legalized and regulated prostitution, some against.  Some are for porn, some against.

Then you toss in sex robots and similar things, a lot of men, especially the more introverted types, will just give women a pass altogether.  I wouldn't even be surprised to see regulated prostitution spread to other states, possibly in hopes of allowing the non-party lifestyle type young men a way to have their fun in hope they will be able to commit to women later in life.  If our country is going towards a more European look at human sexuality, some of those countries have brothels, and some countries have legalized sex escort prostitution (no street stuff allowed).  Australia has similar laws.

Basically, it seems that the sexual revolution favored women, mostly young women, much more so than men.  There was this idea that all men were already sluts, so they didn't need liberating.  I can tell you that wasn't the case, and now we have a good % of good, decent young men who are scared of committing to a young women they know nothing about.  We also have an obesity epidemic where lots of young people are just not sexually attractive to others.

The extension of hookup culture is also part of the problem.  I put most of the blame of hookup culture on intoxication (though ultimately the two individuals involved are responsible).  We push this hard party, most get drunk lifestyle on our youth and we end up with non-commitment, or minimal commitment sexual relationships.  Young people are having a hard time forming bonds needed that will help them with marriage down the road.  Then you add to the fact that people will leave college and might need to move away, the process starts all over at 22 years old, so another four to six years of this lifestyle that might involve one-night stands, friends with benefits, or actual monogamous relationships.  This extension of dating/mating with others just means everyone has more baggage in their past, which can cause concern in both men and women.",t3_314zlh

Daarnaast weten we ook not niet hoe die anti-misbruikbepalingen verder worden ingevuld. De algemene anti-misbruikregeling is misschien wel veel strenger dan de andere landen momenteel hanteren. 

Daarnaast gaat de hele discussie omtrent dit alles juist om de vraag: ""Wat horen de bedrijven te betalen, wat is de 'fair share'"". Het probleem is dat iedereen dit anders invult en alle kanten wel ergens een punt hebben. Het is absoluut niet zwart en wit.

Verder was Starbucks trouwens aan de ene kant één van de badguys(namelijk in engeland), maar effectief betaalde ze (globaal) een vrij fors tarief belasting(als ik het goed herinner iets van 30%). Je kan dan eerder kijken naar google, die globaal effectief 2% betaalt.

It happens. 

Point 2- platformers like 3D World and NSMBU don't have online because of latency. It's easy to coverup lag and latency in FPS and racing games because of how much of those games are smoke and mirrors. Something like 3D World would be impossible to play online with anything more than a few milliseconds lag. It's not just Nintendo, almost no publishers have tried including online multiplayer in platformers. 

Point 3- Metroid has never been a big seller. A Prime 4 would be more expensive to make than any previous game, and there's no guarantee it would sell any better. In fact it would probably sell worse, given the size of the Wii U fanbase. Same with F-Zero.

&gt;

&gt;The __long 19th century__, defined by [Eric Hobsbawm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hobsbawm), a British [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) historian and author, refers to the period between the years 1789 and 1914. Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in *[The Age of Revolution: Europe, 1789–1848](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Revolution:_Europe_1789%E2%80%931848)*; *[The Age of Capital: 1848–1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Capital:_1848%E2%80%931875)*; and, *[The Age of Empire: 1875–1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Empire:_1875%E2%80%931914)*. The concept is influenced by [Fernand Braudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernand_Braudel)'s idea of the ""long 16th century"" (c. 1450–1640).

&gt;According to Hobsbawn, the long 19th century begins with the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) that established a republic in Europe and ends with the start of [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.

&gt;A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used notably by textbook author and Professor of History at [George Mason University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason_University), [Peter N. Stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_N._Stearns).

No one is saying anything about a ""right to the land."" Stop strawmanning. It's incredibly dishonest. 

&gt; Do you think the United States will return all of the US to the Native Americans?

Answer my question, then I'll answer yours. Can you name another group of people that ""were"" indigenous to an area, but are no longer, besides Jews? 

&gt; Again, I'm not saying that Jews themselves aren't indigenous

That's exactly what you're saying. You're saying that they WERE indigenous, but aren't any more. That's what you said here: [""Sure Jews were indigenous to Palestine, but how does that make the\[m\] indigenous today?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/311t1g/passover_hagaddah_conclusion_next_year_in/cpxvmau) You seem to be speaking out of both sides of your mouth. 

If Jews are indigenous, then Jews living in Europe and Jews living in the US are also indigenous. They are all one nation, and one people. 

&gt; Arabs have been in Palestine long before Islam.

How does a small presence of Arabs in the country give the Arab nation the right to the land? Double standard alert, as usual. 

&gt; Moreover, Arabs have inhabited as the majority (and intermarried with the original inhabitants) for the past 1,400 or so years.

The argument that there is something inherently wrong with a group (blacks, women, conservatives) that justifies their exclusion or explains their absence from a particular field  has caused untold misery to mankind. Even Aristotle is not exempt from the allure of such an argument when he says in Politics that ""slaveness"" is inherent in the slave. 

* Simply asserting that Hinduism is a religion is as vacuous as asserting that it is not. The fundamental problem is that Religious Studies as a discipline is so obsessed with Semitic Religions that it has failed to develop an adequate definition and (more importantly) an adequate hypothesis about this general category called Religion. In short, we still have no idea what makes an entity a ""religion"". 

* By ""for granted"" if you mean ""assumed to be true"" then things can get pretty ridiculous: a religious studies scholar when referring to Aquinas' Five Ways must then waste godknows how many pages to demonstrate the validity of the arguments. If a scholar is expected to demonstrate as coherent **every single** concept he uses in a paper then the number of papers published per year would deccrease dramatically. Why shouldnt we be allowed to assume concepts like ""actuality"" or ""causality"" or ""class"" to be true while developing a argument? Some crazy Popperians would love to apply the Principle of Falsifiability to all and sundry, but then they would run into the problem to falsifying the Principle of Falsifiability (and end up begging the question). 

* I am fond of Samkhya and Advaita. Both are very ""rigid"" and ""orthodox"" and ""conservative"" and ""brahmanical"". Both are uninterested in nations, demographies, ebb and tide of politics, increase and decrease in the no. of atheists etc. Advaitins dont give a toss about the BJP because they are busy meditating on the Mahavakyas. 

* None of the criticisms I have read of Doniger either call for a ban or use the hindutva perspective or try and defend nationalism. I am referring to the following:

* For a more comprehensive survey of the ideological undercurrents in American Hindu Studies which make scholars like Doniger and Courtright possible, refer to the essays in *Invading The Sacred: An Analysis Of Hinduism Studies In America* .  

* The ""burden of proof"" game is a popular one among Christians and atheists here on Reddit. I am simply asking you to substantiate your claim that ""peer pressure"" is entirely absent. Or are you expecting others to substantiate your premises for you?

There were priests put to the stake and factions inside the church began using the inquisition to get at each others throats. So it was in part self-interest to put this into law, but one has to remember:

No church is a homogenous mixture of power hungy, pedophiles. Many churchmen really tried to do good and of course as an intellectual in that time (honest or not), your best bet was to become part of the clergy, because there you would have access to books and books mean thoughts that no one outside the clergy had access to. Of cource many thoughts were supressed by some part of the clergy, but other factions did not. Just think of Toledo in the middle ages, before the reconquista. That melting pot of christian, jewish and muslim cultures where they had the famous idea that god was truth, so no oldthink should stand in the way of philosophers (as science was called natural philosophy at that time) finding out new things about the movements of the heavens and the earth... Toledo was the place where most of the old greek texts, for the longest time beeing translated and carried on by intellectual muslims, while the catholic church condemned them, found their way back into european culture, through christian scribes who translated them back again. Just because the catholic faction in Toledo at that time was a whole lot more open minded than later spanish catholics. 

Because of that there are many more examples of good things that came from the catholic church. Even progressive (at that time) things. It's just statistically impossible to do NO good when people who are smart and want to do good do exist in the church.

That beeing said... humanity today has advanced its culture to a point where religion has become more of a hinderence than a boon. In a scientific community, superstition has no place anymore. But just because we have no need for superstition and because religion is a detrimental force today, we should not cloud our eyes for the good things the church did in the past.",t3_314qnc

The U.S. does have one of the better regulatory agencies out there, to be sure, but other countries and regions also have excellent governmental oversight, of course lots of places don't. In my experience flying long international routes, the danger comes more from what you are flying over than the regs at your country of origin. The US has almost total radar coverage (in the lower 48), lots and lots of airports able to take a big jet in an emergency, and very skilled controllers. Compare that to Africa that uses HF for communication in lots of places, and almost no radar coverage in many countries and you can see the difference. Add in not great controllers and very few airfields and what could be a well handled emergency in the States turns into a total cluster. MH370 would have been found in the US almost instantly, sure, because of the radar coverage. Conversely if it had been a United or Delta 777 that went missing in SE Asia we would probably still feel looking for it. 

The point I'm trying to make is that there are a lot of factors involved above and beyond the FAA (Also many many countries base their regs on the FAA). I love flying over Europe, just as easy as flying in the US, South Asia gets a bit harder, India is worse still, China is an adventure and Africa can be terrifying.

The NA scene is already way too much about personalities and huge egos. People should care about real competitive players not about who has the best stream. Hiko got it right, he's streaming a lot now that he's not on a team, but for players who want to compete with a team this double dipping between pro gaming and streaming is just a cash grab and won't get them anywhere in tournaments.

Just look at the difference between NA and EU, the only big streamer european pro CS has is Pasha, and even he who does it to support his family doesn't do it for 10 hours straight, instead he does it without a specific schedule for 2 to 3 hours at a time and is fine with it. Meanwhile NA has Tarik who streams throughout the night and then oversleeps for his league match the next day, or shroud who probably spends more time ingame with natawhee and Polen than with the other 4 members of C9.

Don't get me wrong, I think for them personally it's a smart decision, it's a good way to make more money and even though I don't have the skills for either, I'd pick being a streamer over being a dedicated pro everyday, but then let's be honest and start seeing it for what it is.

Take Thailand for instance, you cannot own Thai land unless you are a citizen.. which is actually a bloody good policy, Scotland is the only place in europe where the vast majority of land is owned by wealthy elites who only use it to host parties and shoot deer.

i apologize, i didn't mean to sound so rude. 

you being from egypt, i now understand why you were confused. this is a language barrier thing and i totally get why you are confused because english isn't my first language either. i'll copy paste something for you:



&gt;**Dinner** is considered to be the ""main"" or largest meal of the day. Whether it takes place at noon or in the evening is mostly a cultural thing. For instance, many people who grew up in the American South and/or on farms traditionally ate larger meals at noontime to give them the strength to keep working through the afternoon.

&gt;**Supper** is more specifically a lighter evening meal. Rooted in the word ""to sup"", it comes, again, from farming traditions — many farming families would have a pot of soup cooking throughout the day, and would eat it in the evening — specifically, they would ""sup"" the soup.

&gt;**Lunch** is almost the midday equivalent of supper — it's also a lighter and less formal meal than Dinner, but is used specifically when referring to a midday meal. So whether you use lunch/dinner or dinner/supper is heavily determined by when your culture traditionally has its largest meal.


but these are terms that were used in the past. in modern times breakfast is what they eat in the morning, lunch is what they call a midday meal, and dinner is what they eat before bed. some people still use the term ""supper"", but at this day in age it usually means 'dinner'. 
and.. this, paired with the fact that 60% of america is now overweight and thus they eat way more often than three times a day is why you were confused! (not to mention the constant snacking. where i live a snack is an apple or an orange... not so much in america.)

&gt;We have quality with good quantity. They have very poor quality in extreme quantities.

that seems to be the american way when it comes to food, yup. and countries which look up to america seem to be following this path as well! some parts of europe are very americanized and i noticed this to be the case.

&gt;And sorry if I offended you, friend, please don't be a sad shitlord

no worries! i wasn't offended, i've just been lurking this sub for a while now, and i am aware some people from eating disorder subs come here. these people are battling a real mental issue when it comes to eating and food, so i don't want them to be nudged back down the wrong path by thinking of the food as the enemy. :( i care about our fellow shitlords. &lt;3

again, sorry if i came off as rude! spread the fat hate indeed. &gt;:D

I used to live in a rural area until I moved to Montreal. It is a noticeable change. But i think that Canada is more open to immigration than our European counterparts. While immigration might be a contentious issue, even our conservatives have difficulty arguing against it and we don't end up with vile racists like UKIP.

And the segregation is kind of always how it has been. No one wants to immigrate to Canada to live on a farm. Heck, even my grandfather wanted to settle in Montreal until he was booted out West. I can see why modern immigrants would much prefer living in one of Canada's big cities.

Finally, my point was a values question. I think as a whole Canada benefits from immigration and we should continue to accept it. That's not to say we don't have any problems.

La respuesta estaría en la diferencia de peso ante la Comisión de los sectores representados en el grupo de expertos. “Aunque es cierto que este grupo está más equilibrado que otros de la Comisión”, argumenta Pia Eberhardt, de Corporate Europe, ONG que investiga y denuncia la actividad de los lobbies en Bruselas, “este comité asesor sobre el TTIP incluye a algunos de los más poderosos lobbies europeos, los cuales han realizado en el paso guerras de lobbies contra políticas de interés público, como la regulación sobre productos químicos, sobre reducción de CO2 o sobre el etiquetado en los alimentos”.

They also really ignore the fact that in order to build anything you need money, a lot of money. You can't expect your city to boom and have growth and development (which would help fund public transportation and the other issues discussed) without having outside investors who want to build.

I also have an issue with the whole 'biking, walking, public transit' issue. This isn't an issue unique to Denver - it's American culture. We are too spread out and disjointed to use a functional transportation system like they gave in major European cities. In Europe public transit is huge because it's unaffordable and impractical to have a car. The same goes for cities like DC and NYC - the difference with Denver being that, as a metro area, we are very spread out. Relying on buses or biking just isn't practical here. People in Denver want to get out and enjoy the outdoors, which frankly basically requires a car. We could have a better transit system, especially in certain areas, but I don't think the fact that people here enjoy the freedom of having a car is a bad thing. 

Its contradictory to say ""stop building condos downtown - we want more affordable housing"" and then to say that everyone should be using public transportation. If you try to pack everyone in to the downtown area where it would be feasible to take a bus around (sorry I just don't think the type of people who live in Stapleton have the luxury of time to be taking the bus to work, the grocery store, etc.) someone is going to have to build a place for people to live. And when you pack people in the quality of the condos (whether they are luxury or not) doesn't really matter when setting the price - that's driven by demand outpacing supply.

I actually agree with your base argument but I feel like it stops making sense when you apply greater degrees to the automation. 

You're saying that I should discontinue being concerned with whether or not I or anyone ""should"" be living a life in which 80-90% of what they do daily is obligatory and demanded by others. 

How can I do that when I can see people who are passionately doing what they love everyday or have enough money that they can extract themselves out of the daily grind? 

Or how about other people stuck in the daily grind who actually have lives because the rules they live under are different? [China is considering 4-day work weeks and many places in EU have had &lt;30 hour work weeks for years.](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/915125.shtml) 

The type of thoughts that are ""holding me back"" are also the only type of thoughts that can bring us back to a society where working adults have actual lives where they have time to do things. If I refrain from these thoughts, what separates me from a slave or automaton? 

Taking your analogy of urination, most people urinate less than 10 times a day. Nobody sees this as a big problem. But imagine a person whose urinating took up 90% of their waking life each day. Would you tell them to continue doing this automatic action to preserve their willpower and say ""Yup, working as intended"". Or would you start to question whether their their life should be this way?

I feel terrible making this argument because all this talk of ""should"" and ""could"" makes me out to be a childish idealist. I realize that most people DO surrender 90% of their waking lives in order to survive, I just can't accept that people think thats OK and that the time for personal self-improvement, creative projects or interaction with family/friends HAS to come from the scraps of that 10% that you have left at the end of the day. 

EDIT: Its probably unfair of me to criticize your advice with large sweeping topics like work/life balance and society's treatment of the proletariat when the original question was simply about personal motivation/discipline/willpower. It is good advice and my failure to keep that 10% more disciplined is probably my own fault. But it is my awareness of issues like these that overwhelms me with a sort of hopelessness that keeps me making excuses instead of actually doing something. ",t3_30b3ak

&gt;The EU has a strict system for deciding whether to allow companies to sell any given GMO in the EU. This is entirely separate from trade negotiations.

&gt;The EU basic law on GMOs - including the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) safety assessment and the risk management procedure - is not up for negotiation. It will not change as a result of TTIP.

&gt;Scientists at the EFSA assess all applications to sell GMO products in the EU. EU governments then consider their findings before deciding whether to approve the application. So far, they have authorised 58 GMOs.

&gt;Regulators in the EU and US already exchange information about GMOs - on policy, regulations and technical issues. TTIP could help them do so more effectively. This would help limit the effect on trade of our different systems for approving GMOs.

If you advocate for the right for us Europeans to have our own homelands free of mass immigration, then you must also afford that right to others. It is horribly counterproductive to treat other peoples as if they're worthless or be needlessly hateful toward them.

I try not to hate anyone -- whether they be Middle Easterners or Africans or whatever as long as they're in their own countries and continents, and not irreversibly changing the demographics of European nations. Literally have no hatred for them and would like to visit their countries and have spent time in many already, and, in my opinion, they're welcome to visit here. Note the word 'visit'. 

I have respect for the Japanese and to a lesser extent Koreans because they don't do mass immigration and preserve their culture and people. I have respect for many different peoples: Persians, especially their pre-Islamic history, and many of the North African peoples prior to the Islamic conquests too. I am a bit of a history buff, and many of those peoples played integral roles during the Roman era so I have always been interested in them. 

Being a pan-European nationalist (what I count myself as) shouldn't preclude you from appreciating some of the other wonderful cultures worldwide. Don't put blinders on. 

In saying all that, I can understand the hatred that people feel sometimes. We, as Europeans, can feel helpless that this is all happening, and that can manifest itself as extreme hatred or even violence. I am far from a pacifist, but I wouldn't advocate violence or anything like that to reach our goals unless it was 100% needed. Maybe one day it will be needed... But we must work productively first to put our plight out in the open. We can't be painted as stereotypical thugs any longer. It sets us back so far.

I'm not tracing the steps of ascent from a specific civilization, I'm tracing the methods of ascent of literally every large-scale civilization on the planet of which there are many.  

Egypt had deserts to protect it, and the Nile and Mediterranean for transportation, they had farming, flooding like clockwork, and a highly skilled metallurgy (although yes they had to import lots of metal).

Mesopotamia and the Levant had mountains on the Zagros and to the North, deserts to the south, and the Mediterranean to the west but a relatively flat internal territory.  They had plenty of farming, especially in northern Mesopotamia, while the climate was not always predictable in southern Mesopotamia (it was for most of the area), irrigation techniques were able to more than compensate for that.  There was plenty of access to metals.  The reason Mesopotamian civilization in the south eventually went into decline was quite likely related to irrigation which made it impossible to grow crops and ruined one of those factors that let civilizations grow.

Indus River Valley civilization had a great climate for exactly this sort of thing, they had the monsoons.  They had access to metals, barriers in the Himalayas to the North, and mountainous areas of Iran and Afghanistan to the West.  Fertile soil like most river valleys and crops to grow in them.  Their civilization some have proposed, collapsed in part because their climate suddenly stopped being so regular.  Almost all of this also applies to Magadha in the Ganges River Valley where many of India's largest empires started out.

China had the Himalayas to the south and west, the Ghobi Desert to the North, and while there is lots of room for invaders to come from the North and this was a destabilizing influence for a long time it eventually led to the Great Wall of China (which shows just how important this is, the mere possibility of the natural barrier criterion not being important led to the largest architectural feat in history).  They had fertile soil on the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and rice among other crops to sustain a massive population.

There is a reason after all that until Macedonia and then Rome, Europe was on the edge of civilization.  Greece has far too many internal borders, the same is true for Iberia and Italy, and the North of Europe has no internal boundaries.  That is why after Alexander the Great's death the first empire to fall of his successors was in Macedonia and Greece proper and the last was the Ptolemaic Empire in Egypt.

Greece got its alphabet from a Levantine civilization and then gave it to Rome, another example.",t3_30jchi

I hate to break it to you, but the entire idea of keeping a set of runes and runecasting (I assume you mean for divination?) is pretty much entirely ahistorical. 

I do not say any of this to discourage you or convince you not to try, just to let you know that *any* runic practice is going to be largely modern to various degrees. We know pretty well that runes were used as magical inscriptions and for writing, but the details of *how* they were used for magic are lost to us. 

There is no mention in any historical source that supports people keeping a set of runes. There is no mention of runes being used for divination historically, though in my opinion the fact that Germanic peoples (and most IE peoples, really) put stock in divination and omens and that that they had a native symbol set makes it not too much of a leap to combine those two bits of information. However, Tacitus' mention of divination using symbols carved on wood makes it fairly clear to me that carving a set of symbols (in our case runes) was part of the ritual itself, otherwise he would have mentioned that they kept a set of runes for such occasions.

So with all of that out of the way, I'll try and tell you something that might actually be useful, haha.

&gt;First and most simply, are there any good, reliable sources to begin learning runecasting?

I would suggest trying to stick mostly to academic and primary sources, the rest is dependent on you to develop a practice that you feel is closest to said sources. So, as us Heathens love to do, here is a book list:

Stephen Pollington, ""Rudiments of Runelore."" Not academic or primary, but a good, simple ""just the facts, ma'am"" intro to the runes. (http://tinyurl.com/km2kpk7)

R.I. Page, ""Runes: Reading the Past"" and ""Runes and Runic Inscriptions"" (http://tinyurl.com/q6qyb4w and http://tinyurl.com/mpkmang)

Mindy MacLeod, ""Runic Amulets and Magic Objects"" (http://tinyurl.com/kt4hhh2)

There are many other good books, in fact there is an entire academic discipline about runes which you should familiarize yourself with prior to studying any modern Neo-Pagan texts, which need to be evaluated and read critically in order to get any quality use out of them.

&gt;Second, I have a runeset, one that I've had for years now and never used, because it's carved (probably machined) from hematite and the set has a blank stone (which from some sources I'm told was not used in ancient runesets). I'm not sure how reliable this runeset will be, if I'm being reconstructionist.

I wouldn't really suggest stone, unless you're erecting a runestone for a dead relative or something. Also, see above where I point out that there is no such thing as ""ancient runesets.""

&gt;Third, if I were to make my own runeset (after appropriate research and understanding, see item the first), would carving or Dremeling it out of wood be useful?

I would say using wood would be the most historically sound approach. Whether modern electric tools should be used is something you'll get different opinions on, so you'll have to decide that for yourself.

&gt;And is there an ideal species of wood for me to look at?

I actually have a theory about this. I was reading a book about German Folklore and came across a mention of the German word for ""letters"" being ""buchstaben,"" which literally means ""beech staves."" 

So I did a little looking into beech trees in Northern Europe and it turns out that the common European beech is native to the area of southern coastal Norway/Sweden and the North Sea coast of the continent (Denmark, BeNeLux, and Northern Germany especially), which corresponds to the territory of the earliest speakers of Proto-Germanic. 

What's more, the beech is a ""fruit bearing tree"" (with fruit that looks like a nut) and Tacitus' description of divination mentions that the staves were cut from a fruit or nut bearing tree. So, in my opinion beech would be a good wood to use, however depending on your local climate any fruit or nut bearing tree would be good.

To some people, it likely is. There are a decent amount of hate groups in Europe and the United States that use it. I certainly thought it was before I moved down South. 


Where I ended up, people didn’t fly it to support some hidden racist agenda. Most people don’t' see it as racist, which is why they see no issues with flying in it. There were no backroom discussions about keeping minorities down by flying what many consider to be a symbol of oppression.  Many don’t know that others have taken the flag and used it for hate. While you may judge them for being uneducated, maybe this should be seen as a failure of the system. 


Instead, you had a bunch of lower class, uneducated (beyond high school), people living in a rural area. They want to fly something that represents what is common to them. Something based in a rural culture that is unique to the area. You could fly your respective state flag; however, the South is still its own entity in many ways. This is not a bad thing. The South is flavored with a wide variety of different cultures and people. You'd be leaving out a lot of people by just flying your state flag. The South is bigger than a single state. As a concept, the one being held by those who are part of “Southern” culture, it is a collective of poor white people who work mostly in a rural environment. 



What about its history as a racist symbol? Many people in the South don't see the flag that way. The majority that fly are lower class, and rural (have I repeated that enough yet?). History education ended in high school. Unfortunately, many will use the ""History not Hate"" as a knee jerk to criticism, but if you press beyond that they shut down and get defensive. They don’t comprehend what happened during the Civil Rights era. They also will blindly use the historical states’ rights excuse. In reality, they only know what happened within their own life. Many people will admit this if you know them well enough. The flag has been part of their community and culture since birth. That is the deeper reason. To them, you're calling a representation of their life unclean.  They only spout off historical nonsense because others are calling them bad for doing what is familiar.  


Many cannot comprehend the larger implications of what the flag could mean. This is not necessarily their fault. When you live a primarily rural lifestyle, you've got more important things to worry about. 


In my travels, I've talked to quite a few people about the topic. Mostly white, but a good mix of poor and wealthy. The older generations are the most likely to fly the flag as a sign of racism, and even then was rare to find. Most flew it because they were proud of what they saw as an undervalued part of the United States. Which again, is not unreasonable. The South is a beautiful place in a lot of ways. The landscape is breathtaking. I've never met a place where community was so important. 


Those older people who do know their history would tell you that the flag everyone hates is not actually the Confederate Flag. It is a battle flag. They stand behind it for that reason. In that way, while still being a connection to the Confederacy, it stands for something else. Bravery for example



The people my age (late teens and twenties), flew the flag for a host of different reasons. Rebellion against authority was first and foremost when it came to the least educated/ wealthy. A few others flew it because they were looking to belong. When you're really poor, community is all you've got. When you embrace that aspect of Southern culture, you now have a family covering several states. You then had a few who flew it because they were proud of where they were from. Like the adults, some used it as a racist symbol, but it was rare. 


Between the two, you had a large subset of people flying the flag to protest the federal government. Many of the older people will claim that the flag is historically good for that (based on perceived reasons for the Civil War); however, their knowledge is not sufficient to back up that point. Many of the younger people can see that the old arguments are insufficient, so those that fly simply see it as symbol against the federal government with no historical backing. It is simply a sign. It also stands for fighting for maintenance of a culture  seen as disappearing in the industrialized world. (though the attempts can be misguided. 


When I moved to the South, I never thought I'd take interest in the Confederate flag. It grew on me though. I immersed myself in the culture, and it took on a regional meaning to me. I would never fly one, as I am back in the Midwest; however, I do own one. I keep it as reminder of home.


It’s too complex of an issue to simply shun anyone who flies a Confederate flag as racist. It a historical symbol for the preservation of slavery and segregation, but not everyone who flies it can appreciate that. Even those who can, such as myself, often have exterior motives for their utilization of the flag. It can be a boring as it being a symbol of home. While some do have racist motives, I feel as if you're shunning a lot of otherwise good people by making such broad assumptions.

España se encuentra en el objetivo de la Comisión, pues la mencionada Directiva no se encuentra adaptada a nuestra normativa nacional en su totalidad.   


Hungría ha sido el primer país de la Eurozona que recibe su sanción; 15.444 € mensuales.  


Los niveles de multas se establecerán en función de la duración y la gravedad de no transponer la Directiva al favorecer con este retraso alcanzar los objetivos propuestos.  


El proceso sancionador consta de tres fases: una carta de emplazamiento, un dictamen motivado, y finalmente la remisión al Tribunal de Justicia Europeo"".

Tainan was the first major settlement since the aborigines arrived. And it wasn't settle by Chinese; it was the Dutch. They couldn't get enough Europeans interested in sweating their balls off in the tropics, so they attracted Chinese peasants who were eager to escape wars and other gross governmental failures in China.

Both books are accounts of the pirate king, [Kongxinga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koxinga) (aka Zhèng Chénggōng, 鄭成功), conquering the Dutch settlement. One was written by the Dutch governor of the time while he was living in exile as punishment for losing the colony.",t3_313khm

Its like how a lot of Eastern European/Russian publishers are still using Starforce and the like: We know, we just don't care.

And as for the people who DO care: Nintendo has a LOT of loyal customers. When they screw over their customers, said customers have a tendency to not only accept it, but to also defend it and pretend Nintendo are doing it to help them (just see all the people who defended something as idiotic as not selling a charging cable with the new gameboy by pretending that Nintendo were saving CONSUMERS money).
