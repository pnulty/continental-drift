The United States entering the war was a turning point in the Western theatre, providing the manpower and materiel needed to supplement the British survivors of Dunkirk in retaking the European mainland. 

Not to mention, the Americans, along with some contributions from British Commonwealth (mostly Australia, NZ, and Canada), and the resistance in China, essentially fought the entire Pacific theater against Japan. Due to Western bias, most people don't realize in terms of civilian and military casualties, it by far was a more significant and difficult war compared to the Western theatre (minus the brutal Eastern Front/Russian theatre). Not even considering the Asian holocaust, where the Japanese Empire committed the same atrocities and estimates of up to 2-3x more murders than the Nazis, the Pacific Theater was a crucially important fight with Russia fully pre-occupied on the Eastern Front. Without the United States entering the war, even had VE Day eventually been achieved by the European powers, Japanese hegemony throughout Asia and Oceania would've been virtually guaranteed, potentially prolonging the war by years or decades. 

(To be fair, there are mixed lessons to be taken from the nuclear bombings and the subsequent century of war and blowback effects we face today, but in theory, Japan could've defended the home islands for years, which would've cost potentially millions more lives in any subsequent land invasion.)

If all you've seen of the AltRight is /r/AltRight, there's much more to read and learn. Despite the very trolly AltRight presence on Reddit and Twitter, it is a deeply-rooted intellectual movement which has produced much worth exposing yourself to, even if you disagree.

Jobs: Most Italians say that there are no jobs or that the available jobs are underpaid or in bad working conditions compared to the jobs available to them in other countries. The Italian economy has not been doing well compared to other European economies where Italians are freely allowed to work (as well as many other countries that of course accept some Italians with visas). There is very little meritocracy, and employment/success in both the private and public sectors depends a lot on personal connections (who will give you a ""raccomandazione""). All of this is worse in the South, at least according to perception (but many statistics can confirm this, too.)

Taxes/Corruption: Italians pay a lot of taxes and receive very little for them due to corruption and mismanagement of funds. Again, bad everywhere but probably worse in the South.

Cultural conditions: some Italians complain about the lack of social capital among Italians. Common complaints are that people litter a lot and treat public spaces badly, that it always seems that people are ""out to get you"".

He stated more than once that he did not intend to remain in power after the war and that a younger generation would need to take command, so he probably would. I imagine it wouldn't be Himmler, though. 

Let's set up some background:

German victory comes very early. With the fall of France and the evacuation at Dunkirk, Great Britain sues for peace. The peace negotiations involve the creation of a French Fourth Republic based in Paris, opposite a fascist French State in Vichy. Relative peace on the Western front gives Hitler a free hand in the east and he uses it. The full might of the Wehrmacht, undistracted by Balkan folly or Westerly occupation, lands on Stalin's doorstep. The Russians fight back, but the terms of the peace mean that the west can render them no assistance. Isolated and enraged, Stalin fights back with everything he has, but with several counterrevolutions in the Baltics and a resurgent Finnish front the Red Army is suffering. The Germans are *almost* halted at the gates of Moskva, but are able to break through. A concerned military clique deposes him and the Red Army retreats to make a better stand in the foothills of the Urals, where a greatly-shrunken Russian SFSR defiantly capitals itself at Novosibirsk. Though the Anglo-American war with Japan begins while this is happening, it is treated as a separate conflict. With the British far more free in lieu of a North African theater, or, indeed, a European front, more forces can be committed to the Pacific. Likewise, the U.S. gives Japan its undivided attention, and the Home Islands are invaded in 1944 after a long and costly campaign for everyone involved. The first atom bomb is dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima, the second is dropped by the British at Kokura. Japan is defeated, the U.S.S.R. is fine with this, and while the Reich sent support in the form of jet engines and engineers, they aren't *too* broken up over Japan's fall.

Anyway. Back to Himmler.

Only eleven years Hitler's junior, Himmler is part of the same generation and would be ruled out. 

Let's say this rankles Himmler, it *really* rankles him. He wants power. He wants all of it. Hitler's desire is not to be succeeded as Fuehrer-- he wants the Reich to return to a Kanzler//Praesident dichotomy, and so he needs *two* successors. Martin Bormann becomes Reichskanzler, while Reichspraesident is handed to a fanatical and still-alive Reinhard Heydrich.

Himmler is jealous, but cannot act while Hitler is still alive. Fortunately for Himmler, this changes-- a car accident in Berchtesgaden kills the former Fuehrer. Two days after the largest state funeral in German history, Himmler and the SS stage a coup. Bormann is arrested early on, but Heyrdrich, wily Heyrdrich, is not taken down so easily. A firefight breaks out at the Reichspraesident's estate between the SA and SS, an the fighting spreads throughout Berlin and the Reich as the SS and SA turn against each other. Initially, the Wehrmacht protects the civilian populace but does nothing to halt the fighting between the Nazi factions. Goering flies air support for Heydrich, seeing an opportunity to finally get rid of Himmler once and for all. While in transit, however, Goering is ambushed by SS forces and killed, and von Greim with him. This leaves the Luftwaffe fractured, and moderate squadrons begin operating to block the activities of their more politically-committed brethren. This escalates into dogfights over the alps, and it is now that the Wehrmacht makes its move. The Heer move to arrest any SS and SA units known to be involved in combat. The Ghost Division marches towards Berlin, intending to seize control of the capital. 

As the German Civil War grows, it spreads to the very edges of the Reich. The Finns lend their support to the Wehrmacht, as do the Baltic states when fighting between the SS and regulars breaks out within their own borders. The Soviets begin to launch their own tentative counteroffensive against the Second Russian Empire (the Nazi puppet state set up in conquered territory). As Heyrdich's estate is stormed by Albert Kesselring's troops and SS bases in the north are shelled by the *Kriegsmarine*, the Allies go on high alert. Uprisings in Czechoslovakia and Norway are met with limited resistance, and Heinz Guderian emerges at the forefront of a ""Neureich"" movement within the Wehrmacht's highest command. Elite Wehrmacht troops storm Wewelsburg, and the Civil War grows more and more intense by the hour. A border incident in France sparks renewed hostilities between Paris and Vichy, dragging the Western Allies back into it.

&gt;Even if that were true, it would do nothing to legitimize their claim.

What do you mean? I'm pretty sure the fact that all of civilization and the entire human species all over the world went in the same direction pretty much legitimized modern society. 

&gt;This doesn't mean anything;

Of course it does. You weren't at personally at the dawn of civilization if you approve of civilization and therefore it's illegitimate to you. 

&gt;legitimacy is when (most) everyone agrees that something is the case, be it property rights, borders, a contract, etc. Everyone agrees that you exist.

That's literally not how it works on any level. You just made up your own definition.  Hahaha. You, didn't agree to be born and by your own definition this makes your life illegitimate.

The fact that you long for a plebs way of life is weird though. 

&gt;I don't. I love all people :)

Then why does your society literally feudalism with less protections than even that offers? Hahah 

Fuck, at least with feudalism you could address your problems to your lords. Here, you are absolutely fucked in everyway. 

&gt;The rich can *at most* subjugate only all the people that are already under the thumb of the State (or de-facto private State). If you don't like it, start a worker's revolution.

I don't disagree.  The problem isn't that voter ID and anti-fraud measures are inherently wrong, but that Republican politicians aren't actually interested in any of that.  It's simply a means to suppress voting populations that disfavor them.

Which is the basic point I was getting at.  Cynically selling the public on policies under the guise of an otherwise reasonable desire (preventing voter fraud, preventing gun violence) despite knowing that the specific policies they advance have absolutely nothing to do with the stated goal.

Likewise his whole idea of ""bullet labeling"" is completely useless for solving gun crimes, an otherwise laudable goal, and major gun control organizations have to know that. They just don't care, because that's not the point.  The point is to make legal gun ownership and use as expensive and restrictive as they can, because they fundamentally disagree with the notion of gun rights.

Sure you can argue that's still ultimately in service of the goal of ""reducing gun violence"", but at least be up front about what your goals actually are.

Personally, I like the pairing of Jhin and Kassadin. It allows CLG to easily get picks with the Kassadin + Jhin combo. Imo CLG's comp in G3 vs IMT was pretty good. However, the comp required good execution, which CLG failed to do.

You had Shen and Kassadin as the split pushers for the 1-3-1, Braum to peel for Jhin against the diving Ekko and Vlad. Not to mention, IMT's only form of engage was a Flash E combo from Gragas.

Yes, the small percentage of them, the same ones that are also destroying their own communities and killing their own people. 

&gt;Yes, petty crimes. You're assuming people who sell or buy drugs don't have assets, but they do. What's more, governments have seized property of family members, hotel owners, etc. because drugs were used, bought or sold on site. Seriously, do your fucking research.

Those aren't petty criminals. Try again. They are also the small minority. Most are low level thugs. Prisons are filled with mutiole offenders most of which have been convicted of violent crimes. 

&gt;1) As ""white"" as a concept expanded, Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans were eventually brought into the sphere of whiteness, especially once they language assimilated.

Yes, because they are compatible with society unlike blacks and their low IQ handicap.  Blacks aren't assimilating for reasons I have already outlined.

&gt;As black person can't aesthetically assimilate unless they have a large amount of European admixture. 

Ironically enough the more European blood they have the higher their IQ gets. That's why hispanics are higher IQ than blacks.

&gt;2) Again, they had low IQs. If it's ""genetic,"" then why were their IQs so low and why are they higher now? Explanation?

Your maximum IQ is limited genetically. If we could go back in time and throw you into an abusive family that neglected you, didn't feed you properly and detached emotionally from you your your IQ potential would be lowered. That's the nurture component of IQ. It's the reason why white IQ has risen as well as black IQ. But the gap remains. Many blacks in the U.S also have European blood which boosts their IQ.

&gt;More likely due to rapid economic expansion. You have rural low-skilled Chinese moving into the cities and working in sweatshops. That's not IQ. They're doing shit work and in a few generations they'll become more economically advanced. Expect IQs to shoot up among the peasantry despite being low right now.

Rapid expansion can't boost IQ to that level. Blacks have had decades of modernization and higher living standards. Their average lifespan is higher than many other people who still have higher IQ. Do you really think the average Asian lives better than the average African American?

&gt;First, do you know how disabled a person would be with a 60 IQ? They wouldn't even be able to cook on a stove without a lot of instruction. They're not that mentally disabled. This shit really proves how silly IQ is because it's obvious they're not disabled like someone with a 60 IQ.

https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country#

&gt;And by low, I mean 84.

So 50% of blacks are low IQ and it gets much worse when you factor in black Africans.

&gt;You don't understand what I'm saying. We both agree environment plays a role, perhaps a very large role. But you've decided black people are ""done,"" that this is just who they are, and your basis for that is pretty weak. Adoption studies don't remove all the environmental factors in play, just some.

It plays a role. But genetics plays the main role. If you can't muster an IQ over a certain threshold you end up severely handicapped as people with sub 90 IQ are far less likely to provide net gains to society, 90 IQ barely gets you a job that can sustain a family let alone afford to save money, invest and contribute more than manual labor to society.

&gt;No shit, Sherlock. The issue is that you think ""slavery &gt;150 years ago"" and maybe voting are the sum-total of factors that may create poverty or other bad outcomes. What do you think Jim Crow was? Just voting intimidation? There were many more pernicious effects than voting.

You haven't reached that no shit moment. Blacks have had decades to recover from discrimination that would cause them to shit all over their own communities. And it's not just about voting, as I already brought up. Voting rights effectively put an end to Jim Crow laws.Voting rights came with desegregation. Apparently I needed to spell that out for you.

&gt;Spelling errors don't happen on phones. Typos do. Yours were just straight-up spelling errors. And again, it doesn't matter, but when you call another person illiterate, you should be on your game. Don't blame me that you resorted to that insult and I threw it back in your face.

Typos  that aren't corrected are. And I'm not afraid to admit to spelling errors as well. Insult me all you want, I can already see you are losing your cool. Just let it go man... let it go. 

&gt;And when did they mix with black Africans? Citation?

The Arabs were more mixed, they conquered the Persians/Irianans/Indo europeans. That's why Iranians look much like souther Europeans whereas Arabs have much darker skin and less European features. So I was wrong, Muslims were always backwards as they have much closer African ties than most Iranians, Europeans and Asians.

ASEAN + 3 also discuss many of the same things that the EU does, however in a much less politically binding way. Again, it would appear to a Japanese person that membership to an organisation that tackles these issues is a good thing because their membership to APT is much less all encompassing than membership to the EU.

The history of colonialism is the reason why much of the violence in our world exists - its scars are deep and its wounds fresh.

Well, I was being hyperbolic. Maybe I shouldn't have been. More plainly; any marriage with any degree less than consent, effectively, might as well be slavery. I mean, even some slaves got lucky and had benevolent masters, but that didn't make the position ideal or ethical.

So, I do agree that pre-consolidation of power by the church, medieval Europe was a much more egalitarian (and healthier, and wealtheir) place. I wouldn't say they were equal, but they were much closer to equality than any other time until the 1900s. But, I would say there were still problem areas, and once the church took over, forget it.

&gt;However there are lots of examples of exceptions to this. King Richards sister told him off when he tried to marry her to a Muslim for example. Richards mother Eleanor of Aquitaine is another example. She married henry the 2nd for love and went on to have the most dysfunctional relationship in history. Look it up, its insane.

I don't doubt that you know more than me about this time period (though I'm not clueless by no stretch; related: you didn't react to the womenless German towns), but I do think you're making the mistake of thinking that because a few women got to do X, their standing was very equal.

England's laws of succession were agnatic primogeniture, so Mary would inherit but she was Catholic while Edward was protestant. Elizabeth was protestant but couldn't be queen as she was second in line. However, Northumberland convinced him to make him both of his sisters illegible to inherit and give Lady Jane Grey, Edwards cousin, the crown of England. Edward agreed to this. Edward dies and Northumberland married his son to Jane Grey. This gave them negative opinion from the vassals. Mary created a faction to put her on the throne and won. 

Some of her vassals were happy as they were still Catholic but others were angry because they were protestant. The Pope was happy as England was now Catholic. However, he wanted papal investiture but Mary wanted free investiture so this causes some conflict. 

Mary married Philip of Spain her cousin, but Philip was more concerned about wars than marriage, though he was always faithful. This marriage caused many of her vassals to dislike her, as Philip may become king of England and Spain would rule England. Mary became ill and died and as per the succession laws of England, Elizabeth became queen. 

This was problematic. She was protestant so broke  with the church again. Philip was also angry because he was Catholic and he and Mary never had a heir. Also, there were rumours Elizabeth had the bastard trait. Meanwhile, Philip had a strong claim on the Netherlands as he was a member of the Hapsburgs who were related to everyone in Europe. Spain conquered the Netherlands, and Elizabeth had many requests from the Dutch to be part of her court. This angered Philip. However, at this point nothing happened. 
Later though, Elizabeth joined a war between Spain and the Dutch revolt in favor of the Dutch. 

While all this happened, there were some interesting developments in Scotland. Margaret, Henry's sister who married James IV, had a son James V. He married Mary of Guise and had a daughter who inherited Scotland, called Mary Queen of Scots. She married Francis II of France. The French and Scottish rulers were Catholic and had the auld alliance where both were allies against England. Mary also had a strong claim to England particularly as Elizabeth had the bastard trait. 

Unfortunately, a protestant faction removed Mary from Scotland and put her son James VI as King. He was only a child and was educated by a protestant so he became a protestant. Back to the Netherlands. Philip supported Mary's claim to England until she was ousted by the faction. Elizabeth imprisoned her but would have received negative opinion if she killed her. Elizabeth's spy master found a plot to get Mary out of prison and make her queen of England, so Elizabeth killed her. 

During this war between England, the Netherlands and Spain, Philip was opting for an intrigue approach towards winning the war, but he now had to use military force. He raised a large fleet and sailed to England. Unfortunately he landed in a low supply limit zone and had to quickly leave, but was attacked by the English. His forces separated and fled and were killed by the English doomstack. England won the battle. 

Elizabeth got older and when she died the closest relative was James VI of Scotland who was a protestant, and now Scotland, England and Wales were United. In order to create the empire of Alba, they had to capture Ireland, but that is a tale for a different time. 

I had to alter some of this to fit ck2 logic. The Spanish armada was actually defeatedon Sea, because the English armada were able to get behind them and Spain weren't able to do anything as the wind was pushing them up the east coast of England. They came around Scotland and down the west coast of England. The wind was against them now so they couldn't move, and were given the order to withdraw but did so chaoticly crashing into one another.",7,,0,t5_2tgic,1472709213,0,t1_d751zbz,LadyLikeWings,7,,False,CrusaderKings

A cargo train left south China's Guangzhou City for Vorsino, Kaluga Region (113 miles south-west from Moscow) on Aug. 28 , China’s Xinhua reported.

""It is the latest freight train route China has launched to boost trade ties along the ancient Silk Road,"" the agency reports. ""The train will travel 11,500 km over 14 days before reaching its destination. Its cargo includes garments, shoes, hats, cloth, lamps and lanterns, electrical appliances, and electronics.""

According to Xinhua, Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, has traditionally depended more on maritime freight services. The new cargo train service saves 30 days compared with shipping services, and it costs just a fifth of the price for air transportation.

Russia’s Kaluga Region has set up a major logistics center in the Vorsino industrial park to handle 150,000 to 350,000 containers a year, the Russian media report.

Around that let's say it generates another 2,000 jobs at about the same rate (which is a generous assumption as most of these jobs are low pay jobs). Ireland won't get any more than (25% x €30k) x 7,000 in taxes out of these jobs. That's $52.5M per year.

Now compare that to the 12.5% x $50bn of net profit that Apple should pay each year, i.e around $5bn. That's 100 times more. 12.5% is already a very low tax rate, still attractive compared to the US and the vast majority of European countries. It's 2 to 3x lower. But Apple effectively pays zero taxes.

If Ireland didn't cheat like that, it would be the richest country/inhabitant in Europe. But you can be sure that all isn't lost on everybody. You have a highly corrupt government.

d7540cz,t3_4zv5za,,False,1475224907,"&gt; The numbers do not make any reference to deforestation, of which animal ag is the leading cause and of which we know is reducing carbon sequestration globally.

The report does include deforestation and it's a major source, which is why in the US/EU the emission levels are much smaller and meat is even less of an issue in climate change:

*From a climate change point of view, deforestation is the land-use change process generating most GHG emissions (IPCC, 2007). The debate surrounding the key drivers of deforestation is ongoing and so is the attribution of GHG emissions to these drivers.*

*In  the  current  version  of  GLEAM,  land-use changes  are  considered  as  the  transformation  of forest  to  arable  land  for  feed  crops  and  that  of forest to pasture. Emissions are generally quantified  according  to  IPCC  Tier  I  guidelines  (IPCC, 2006).*

Especially when you consider that these numbers don't include the carbon sinks from grazing which would reduce emissions by a few percent (a 3% decrease when when you're talking 5-10% emissions is pretty big):

*The analysis shows 
that  permanent  grasslands  may  represent  a  sink of 11.5 ± 69.0 million tonnes CO2-eq per year, or 3 ± 18 percent of GHG emissions from the ruminant sector in the European Union.*

&gt; That's not the stance of the source you cited. The EPA cites that all agriculture takes up 24% of the US in terms of GHG emissions (https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)

That's global numbers and includes more than just agriculture.

&gt; 14.5% - noted that this will be far higher in the US as it is developed - is more than the 14% taken by the entire transport sector, again before considering deforestation.

It's far less in the US as I've explained or as the FAO/IPCC puts it:

*From a climate change point of view, deforestation is the land-use change process generating most GHG emissions (IPCC, 2007).*

In the US/EU we don't burn down rain forest so the numbers are going to be lower than globally.

[Sector emission chart](http://imgur.com/r9qavFg)

*EPA,* [""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions""](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources.html).

&gt; A reasonable comparison would be between meat and soybeans, or processed meat and tofu.

Soybeans was included in my post, it's at 1.2 kg CO2eq/kg for the US and upwards of 17.8 kg CO2eq/kg for South America.

&gt; To see what vegans eat for protein you can google 'vegan protein sources.' There are entire food groups (legumes &amp; grains) that we eat which contain heaps of protein and are among the foods which have the lowest GHG cost.

I did google it, and specifically said:

*If you google ""common vegetarian protein sources"" these pop up on almost every list with some variations*

What I listed *is* common sources. You seem to have missed that I have included legumes, the only thing really missing is quinoa but I haven't seen any numbers on that. What the list does show is that veg. sources of protein isn't a big difference compared to meat, and some can even be worse.

When you combine this with animal agriculture not being a major part of emissions to begin with there's no meaningful benefit to reducing GHG emissions by eating less, or no, meat.",1,,0,t5_2qh13,1472712831,0,t1_d73s2gu,gogge,1,,False,worldnews

For *them* -- the second/younger half to two-thirds of ""millennials"" &amp; post millennials (basically anyone under age 30, and especially under age 25\*\*) -- the ""turning of *that* corner"" and level of emasculation/de-masculation &amp; beta-male cuckoldry is not only in the proverbial rear-view mirror -- but is seen as being in the ""far far away and long long ago"" distant past; basically a time *before* they were ""conscious"" if not before they were (literally, physically) ""born,"" and definitely before they reached puberty and any sense of ""young adult"" status.

---

\* I think your perception of what is [currently] ""mainstream"" is the biased perception of people who are a bit older and/or more rural, aka the mindset of people in ""flyover land"" -- and (no offense intended, because I am of that mindset myself, I'm just aware that it ISN'T ""mainstream"" in the younger generation) but even one could say a bit ""behind the times"" so to speak (and thus at least not going with the *en vogue* cultural-fashion mindset).

\*\* Keep in mind that virtually everyone under 25 (and of at least moderate affluence) not only **don't** remember life ""before the internet,"" but for all practical purposes they cannot personally recall a time (as even a quasi-adult) before ""smart phones"" and pervasive wifi -- to them Facebook (et al) has *always* existed as part of their adolescent-to-adult lifetime. (Most people really don't recall much of *anything* from the first 5 years of their life, and have very little {and often distorted and thus readily dismissed/forgotten} idea of the larger world during their first decade+; the general ""awareness"" and ""mindset/attitude"" doesn't really begin to ""gel"" until the teen years, which for most of these kids has been entirely during the Obama Administration, they have only a *vague* and rather limited recollection of even the ""George W.

Murder frenzy? Yes, with Poland and we have repeatedly apologized for Katyń and deportations. Do you know how many times that movie has been showed on government channels? I could write the transcript from memory. And no, we did not ""enslave"" anyone. You call being a satellite state enslavement? Then I guess Germans and Japanese have been enslaved by the Americans for decades now. Learn the meaning and connotation behind the words you use before making silly exaggerations. And we did not kill ""millions"" of Eastern Europeans. Perhaps a few hundred thousand were killed all across Eastern Europe (Poland especially) during WW2 due to Soviet repression. (Same kind everyone in the Soviet Union experienced.) 

Just an FYI, many of those poor little Eastern European states you talk about assisted in a war of extermination against Russian people in Soviet Union. States like Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria got off easy, being ""slaves"".

&gt;Virtually no one expects nothing from you, beside hatred and violence. If you could, you would do that again, right now- just like you try in Ukraine.

Ah yes, we are inherently barbaric now? Good to know that Polish opinion of everyone East of the Bug river hasn't changed in over a thousand years. Whats even more pathetic is the fact that you base your assessment of the situation in Ukraine on preconceived notions and age-old stereotypes instead of facts on the ground. You pay no attention to the political history of Ukraine, the unfolding of events, or the demographics of the country. Instead you just blame everything on the ""Russian barbarism"" you ramble about. Its surprising, I would expect a Polish person to be able to relate due to things like Volyn, but I guess previous government's version of history has done its job.

Germany did much worse. (I hope you realize that, I wouldn't be surprised if a person like you acted as an apologist for their crimes just to inflate the significance of Soviet crimes. It wouldn't be the first time I have met anyone like that.) and have managed to make up for it in a period of 70 years or so.

Before you attempt to misconstrue my words or base your argument off of the idea that I am defending Soviet crimes, allow me to make things clear. I am anti-communist to the core and have always resented the Soviet Union no matter what amazing contributions it has made to humanity.

As for your other comment, which gave me brain damage.

&gt;**In history we tried to walk with russia many times.**
But they never wanted to work together. Its always ""serve us or die"".
And they are surprised we dont like that...

No you have not. Twice in history you have tried to destroy Russia. Once with the Lithuanians and once with Napoleon. It is also because of Polish and Mongol aggression that Rus was separated into several states. (Russia has been trying to unfuck this for centuries.) So no, you have never tried to ""walk with Russia"". In fact, Poland is considered to be our mortal enemy by many historians. We have been fighting wars for centuries. The only time you ever ""walked with us"" was WW2 and a few instances of war with Sweden. Now that you are capable of making your own decisions (until the Americans throw a leash on you too) you have resorted back to traditional Polish attempts at opposing everything Russia does and claims to be.

When typing your response, just remember who built you that grand Palace in the middle of Warsaw.


Edit: The main point of my original post was to convey to people that the reason why Russians get so upset over this is because it represents the ultimate sacrifice ordinary people gave to prevent the extinction of their nation and neighboring nations. Most people in Russia, like in Poland or Eastern Europe, lost someone. Those monuments are a memorial to them, not to Stalin or communism. To deface and destroy them is not erasing Soviet past. (Even Russia has repeatedly done that) Its erasing the memory of the people who gave up everything to keep their own safe. Its dishonorable.

Apple set up their sales operations in Europe in such a way that customers were contractually buying products from Apple Sales International in Ireland rather than from the shops that physically sold the products to customers. In this way Apple recorded all sales, and the profits stemming from these sales, directly in Ireland.

The rules that permit multinationals to shift profits out of the country where the goods are physically sold are not of Ireland's making. Ireland seems to have received a good level of tax on apples Irish profits. It's the sales in other countries where the problem lies and this is nothing to do with Ireland and everything to do with tax laws in other countries as well as international laws and trade agreements to do with transfer pricing and the like.

There is no ""secret deal"". What they are referring to is several tax rulings from the revenue commissioners based on what they believe the law to be. Again, the problem lies elsewhere with the failure of other countries to collect the taxes due on sales of goods in their jurisdictions. Ireland is not responsible for those rules.

And if you eat more veggies (what I normally did) and more fruit it just adds up. It might only be 50 kcal, but that adds up. I typically ate around 1600-1700 calories when I last checked. I still lost weight but it might have slowed down. Depending on your size, height and age you just don't lose weight on 1500+ kcal.

It didnt really matter when I was really overweight. I started with 56 points which is about maybe roughly 2500 calories, but if you weigh 320 pounds you're gonna lose weight on 2500 calories.

Yes, we're only allowed to deport people who pose an actual threat, and to places where they'll not be killed. Sounds awful. Good job we're leaving the EU and can just deport people for no good reason.

&gt; Had we continued with another decade of unwanted mass migration and stagnating/reducing living standards I fear were public opinion would slip to.

In china basically every guy is what chinese people call a ""big guy"". No matter if he is a looser, unemployed or rich. The guy is always right, the woman has to handle housework and get pregnant. Of course thats culture already given by their parents... while every small boy in china is treated like a small king, girls maybe are kinda cute but in the end only maidens.

So women in china only know this one kind of man... her grandfather was a big man, her father is a big man and her partners are big men.

Now comes the westener... even the biggest machos here look like good guys to them because at least they have a small sense about that they have to treat a woman good sometimes too. The average ""soft"" guy looks like an angel to a chinese woman... they want to get treated good.

In the west its a different story... especially above-average women are often treated like princesses their whole life, so they want the ""bad boy"" as a partner. They want to be treated bad, if the guy treats them too soft they loose interest because they are bored by it as they got treated soft their whole life.

Of course this is not always true, but thats the observation i made when i compared china and the west.

Another is the new bank bailout system put in place in case Spain's banks fail. Had that been in place for Ireland's banks we wouldn't have needed a bailout. When we asked for it to work retroactively so the EU could bail out Ireland's banks directly instead of letting the Irish taxpayer (who had nothing to do with these banks failing) taking the hit Barroso said that they have to pay and he explicity said the Irish people deserved it.

Then there was the bailout itself. The Irish government wasn't ready to take it (although they definitely would have taken it eventually) and the EU basically forced Ireland to accept the bailout on its terms.

---

&gt;* Turkey's Defense Ministry says it has discharged another 820 people from the countrys land and naval forces as a purge of its military continues in the aftermath of the failed July 15 coup.

&gt;* Before the discharges that were announced on September 1, Ankara had alreadypurged thousands of personnel from its armed forces in response to the failed coup.

&gt;* Those targeted within the military of the NATO-member country have ranged from senior generals to rank-and-file soldiers.

&gt;* Including the civil sector in Turkey, the government has removed about 80,000 people from public duties for what it says are suspected links to the coup plotters.

&gt;* The European Union and the United States have expressed concerns that the mass arrests and crackdown on political dissent have targeted individuals simply because they are political opponents of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

&gt; Apple chief executive Tim Cook says the European Commission ruling that Apple should pay billions of euros in back taxes to the Republic of Ireland is &amp;quot;Maddening&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Political&amp;quot;.

&gt; He said Apple paid income tax on products sold in different European countries to those countries, and an additional income taxes on profits in the US at a rate of 35%. In addition, Apple has provisioned &amp;quot;Several billion dollars&amp;quot; from its profits in 2014 to be repatriated to the US, he said.

&gt; After a three-year investigation, the Commission said Ireland had enabled Apple to pay substantially less than other businesses, in effect paying a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. Apple said on Tuesday that the decision would be harmful for jobs.

I'm not saying KFO will become a god, just that the way he plays may fit a different roster better. 

Forgiven was a beast and everyone knew it due to his laning stats even with some pretty shit tier supports... But that didn't stop him getting 3 adc banned and look considerably worse in terms of performance or stats because of this. Also nostalgia tends to warp perception of how you felt about things in the past, I think people even now still dispute that forgiven is like top 2 ADC of all time in EU. Lol. IMO maybe not the best player to have on your team, but the best ADC no doubt.

I think DL was always a beast and in the same vein as forgiven it showed in his laning stats but he had some of the best laning supports in the game (also possibly the worst as well) but CLG was always centred around him. He got more resources because of this and that inhibited his team. Even though he was beast and in some ways he deserved that gold share for his performance, it didn't change the reality that it hampered his teams ability to grow. His teams only started to win anything when he took less and less resources in his career. 

How does this relate to KFO? I think people may look back and say KFO was a hidden gem or a beast but didn't have a chance to shine in EF because of whatever circumstances. Or it was a mix of both him being diamond in the rough and his team not utilising him properly. E.g. EF doesn't really play strategically as much as try to claw late game. I don't remember EF ever pulling off any amazing manoeuvres with top TP. But honestly, I tend to sleep through EF matches and don't remember much at all. 

But that's the worst position to be on a team as a top laner to showcase your skill, you can't reliably aggress on the enemy with a weak jungler, can't try to go for macro tp set up plays. You just try to slowly outlane your opponents and hope your team doesn't have heads up their asses. 

IMO your example smeb is a bit of a fairytale that no one has come close to because he was indisputably the worst in a region with the best and turned into the best. I don't think KFO is that story. I don't believe that the mentality is there in the same way the Koreans have (they work their asses off). So that's my main argument, smeb doesn't even come into it because I don't think it's a question of ability so much as a question of compatibility. I also don't think he's number 1 top lane calibre.

Joining a club would be a nice thing, but there are plenty of people that just shoot at private ranges and I don't think why we should impose those laws. Why not let people choose what they should do in their private time? If you want to shoot your guns in Switzerland you can only do it at a gun range anyway!

The main issue that I see is that the EU has written a set of laws that are open to interpretation. One of the cases is that they have refused to explain if they want to ban **magazines over 20 rounds** or if they want to ban **semi automatic guns that can accept magazines over 20 rounds**. There are other stuff like internal magazines

This will basically mean that every semi automatic gun with magazines would be banned. Even if they ban magazines over 20 rounds it would mean that the Stgw 57 (used widely for sports) would now be useless since the standard is 24 round magazines. Furthermore they want to ban semi automatic rifles that look like military rifles, which means that we would say goodbye to any modern sporting rifle such as the AR15, AKM pattern rifles and even the PE90 which is widely used for sports. It's just a cosmetic ban on a guns that are not a problem in Europe.

The laws currently state they these guns already in the possession of law abiding gun owners would be confiscated without reparations. This would also create a huge black market of guns throughout Europe!

Anyways, the principle is that it's our country and we have gun laws that are made for our country. I don't like to have an ""union"" which we are not part of trying to impose laws that we cannot vote for.

The EU is basically applying gun bans and other crap under the excuse that it will somehow prevent terrorism. I don't see how you will prevent terrorism by banning online sales (which already work just like person to person sales), medical checks, mandatory gun club membership and banning semi automatic guns from legal gun owners that already have to pass all the bureaucracy in order to get their legal guns.

Not to mention that EU wide gun laws are already extremely strict, and last time they did a study they found that around 1k people are murdered with guns each year in the EU (out 500+ million citizens!) and they didn't disclose how many were done with legal vs illegal guns.

A lot of the research and provisions for autism involves autistic people on multiple levels. Perhaps we got a headstart because (I think) The National Autistic Society was the first official autism charity set up in the world (although it went by a different name initially). I know Adam Feinstein writes about provisions in different countries around the world in ""A History of Autism"" - I will see if I can locate the specific section when I get a chance.  
  
Edit: Found the book and section, here are some quotes from it relevant to autism provision in EU countries:  
  
&gt;When Bruno Bettelheim’s 1967 book, *The empty fortress: Infantile autism and the birth of self*, which blamed the parents for their child’s autism, became an acclaimed bestseller, there were worldwide repercussions: it was the first book about autism ever to be published in Spanish, for example, leading to years of misconceptions in Spain. About three quarters of French psychiatrists continue to treat autism with psychoanalytical methods - although, to me at least, most of them claimed not to be admirers of Bettelheim himself.  
  (...)  
&gt; In continental Europe, the French remained backward in their thinking—parents continue to be held responsible for their child’s autism by many professionals and even today, around 75% of autistic children are still cared for in psychiatric hospitals. This explains why so many parents take their children across the border into Belgium.  
  (...)  
&gt; One target of the French parents’ outrage is the continued use of an approach known as *le packing*, in which autistic children are wrapped for between 30 minutes and an hour in wet sheets which have been kept cool in a refrigerator. The technique—for autism, at least—was pioneered by Pierre Delion, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst at Lille Regional University Hospital, in northern France, who suggests that the child in the pack undergoes a regression, replaying in a secure environment the relationship between a mother and her new-born child, and that, when used as a therapy for autistic children who self-harm, the treatment allows the child to rid itself progressively of its pathological defense mechanisms.

Blair won over #3 but towards the end of his time #1 was flirting with the Lib Dems, #2 was staying home and #3 was looking at Cameron thinking maybe.

Corbyn, and to a lesser extent Miliband, has re-enthused #1, but turned away the other two groups.

Nobody here is disputing that parliament is *ultimatly* soverign. The question is only how much it has abdicated its responsibility to block laws that it opposes by not repealing the ECA. 

Suppose I hire a lawyer and empower him to make legal decisions on my behalf. I agree I chose him, I can fire him, hence I am the ultiamate authority. But that doesn't mean that I'm actually chosing the course of action. Detailed decision-making power is actually important.

It's unambigious that parliament has never given direct consent to our migration policy as a whole, having left most of it to the EU. Hence that policy as a who has no direct democratic mandate. It has only the very weak mandate of ""parliament decided that it was not worth leaving the EU over"".

This sounds good in theory but we have tried this in the EU where we have a lot of second/third generation muslim immigrants. The large majority don't assimilate, form tight communities in poor neighborhoods and don't raise their kids at all. The result is large groups of muslim youths who have zero respect for the law or the country that they live in and usually become more religious than their parents. Western society has a lot more freedom and relies on mutual respect of each others freedom which in turn requires a basic amount of upbringing which is less necessary in a country with stricter law enforcement. The second/third generation of kids (especially males) are often never corrected by an authority figure and completely derail. We have neighborhoods where busses stopped driving through because muslim youths threw bricks through the windows on a regular basis. 

Obviously I'm generalizing and there are plenty of succes stories but that doesn't change the fact that we have a huge problem with crime, assimilation and a general lack of respect for the country and individual freedom from 2nd/3rd generation immigrant youths. Maybe the dynamic will be different due to the US already having a larger number of poorer Hispanic and Black communities which might alter the dynamic but I don't think it's going to be pretty.

Ces derniers, issus des courants salafistes internationaux, voyaient d’un fort mauvais œil les pratiques particulières de l’islam de Bosnie-Herzégovine, parfois teintées de syncrétisme, et le « relâchement » des musulmans locaux. Des centaines de ces combattants firent souche, reçurent souvent la citoyenneté bosnienne et développèrent des activités prosélytes sans être inquiétés, du moins jusqu’aux attentats du 11 septembre 2001, quand les forces internationales présentes dans le pays commencèrent à s’attaquer aux réseaux islamistes. L’implication de ces djihadistes dans la guerre de Bosnie-Herzégovine a longtemps été occultée ou minimisée, notamment dans le traitement journalistique du conflit, tout comme la pénétration en profondeur de leur doctrine dans la société bosniaque. On supposait un peu vite que cette greffe étrangère ne pourrait pas prendre dans le cadre d’un islam « intrinsèquement tolérant et modéré ».

En réalité, l’islam pratiqué dans les pays de l’ancienne Yougoslavie porte avant tout la marque du socialisme, qui lui a permis de trouver un compromis spécifique avec la modernité. Cependant, la capacité organisationnelle, réglementaire et normative des structures islamiques officielles, tout comme leur légitimité théologique et spirituelle, est mise au défi tant par les jeunes imams revenus des pays arabes que par les nouveaux moyens de communication et les réseaux sociaux. Les prêches radicaux circulent sur Internet, et la « foi vécue » l’est parfois plus dans des groupes fermés sur Facebook qu’à la mosquée… Les conflits violents qui déchirent les communautés islamiques, notamment en Macédoine et au Kosovo, sont en bonne part des conflits de générations, entre vieux imams attachés à un modèle traditionnel et jeunes zélotes sous l’influence de doctrines importées des monarchies du Golfe. C’est un conflit entre deux visions de l’islam moderne : celle qui a prévalu en Yougoslavie socialiste durant la seconde moitié du XXe siècle et celle, nouvelle et « globale », qu’impose la mondialisation. Dans les autres pays de la région, la reconstruction difficile des communautés islamiques après le communisme ouvre un boulevard aux prédicateurs radicaux.

Employing people doesn't reflect on tax contributions at all.

From http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/publications/corporation-tax.pdf, the top 10 corporate groups contributed 33.57% of all CT paid 2008-2012.  For the same period, the same group contributed 1.62% of the workforce.

Something I found interesting from the same document (although keeping in mind it's looking around 2012),

&gt; The statutory CT rates in Ireland are low when compared to the average rates across the European Union (EU). However, CT receipts in Ireland as shares of both total tax revenue and GDP are reasonably close on the EU average – CT as a percentage of total tax in Ireland is 8.5 per cent, 1.2 percentage points above the EU average.

This really looks like it's working.  I know multinationals are never going to be popular, but the math does work out.  We offer them deals to come here, and they contribute 80% of all corporate tax.  The alternative isn't that they pay more - it's that they stop coming here.

&gt;* Hundreds of opposition protesters were gathered outside of Kosovo's parliament building in Pristina on September 1 amid expectation that lawmakers would vote to ratify a border agreement between Kosovo and Montenegro.

&gt;* The border deal has sparked harsh reaction from the opposition for more than a year with opposition politicians repeatedly setting off teargas in parliament to prevent a vote.

&gt;* Supporters of the opposition Self-Determination Movement have also held demonstrations outside the legislature repeatedly to protest the deal, saying that the demarcation plan would give away a swath of Kosovo's territory.

&gt;* Passage of a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro is one of the preconditions set by the European Commission for Kosovo to be granted visa liberalization privileges by the European Union.

I don't see Trump as a crystal ball at all. I think he tells people what they want to hear. He has no clarity at all. It's all generalisations and ""I'll make this the best ever"". He's not straight talking. He changes his mind all the time. I can't understand how anyone finds any consistency or sense, or any idea what he stands for. He's all things to all men and when he gets in you're going to be furious. Because he won't do a damn thing he says.

UK has yet to start implementing Brexit in any meaningful way (article 50 needs to be signed off and that will not happen until 2017 and MAYBE not until the French elections in spring 2017 or the German ones in 2018).

The trouble with Indian Govt didn't start in 1966 when IG order air strikes in Mizoram. It started with the Bamboo death of 1958 when flowering of Bamboo led to increase of rats who in turn ate all the food. Mizo Govt urged India for help. However all requests went in vain. This forced Pu Laldenga to form Mizo National Famine Front which later became MNF. MNF created Mizo National Army and together they captured the strongholds of Indian army. This led Indira Gandhi to order air strikes in the disguise of dropping rice bags. Peace came but at a costly price.

Mizos still dislike Indians and they have reasons to. Of all the NE communities Mizos have the hardest time in mainland India. They are called chinks, chinky etc and are racially abused because of their progressive culture and values. Most of the Mizos call Indians Vai which is essentially Bhai and a derogatory term for mainland Indians.

The things I really loved about Mizos is their trustworthiness and discipline. At time you will feel like you have come out of India. People don't try to push each other in queues. They will stand in line without any shuffling. The markets are clean. To a large extent Mizos follow traffic rules too. At times, you won't find shopkeepers in the shop. If you want to buy something just buy and put the money in the box. Compared to the rest of India Mizoram felt like heaven in these regards.

I have had some issues with the food though. Mizo food is heavy as in really heavy. All meals consist of rice and as a guest they will feed you till you feel like choking like rest of India. Pork and beef are quite common. Most of the food feels a bit watery and no masala.

Again I am not sure when /u/fallingtopieces says that there is not a lot to see. I found Mizoram to be one of the most beautiful Indian state. You can stand anywhere and take picture and the picture will feel like something straight out of Europe. Zokawhthar, Khawbung, Lunglei, Reiek etc are must visit places for anyone. Sure nightlife is a 0 but then again I was running away from urban India for mental peace. So I didn't mind that.

I will add more when I remember. However one sincere request to all of you who are reading this. Please stop judging people of NE based on their looks, frankness, honesty and progressive culture.

Some paragraphs from the article:

 The first overland travellers who might be described as hippies appeared in about 1967, when the term became shorthand for just about anyone with long hair. The concept of the ""mystic east"" was gaining interest, and after The Beatles visited India in a blaze of publicity in 1968 the number of young people hitting the road from western Europe began to increase dramatically.

And they weren't all Europeans. Americans and Canadians crossed the Atlantic to take part, Australians and New Zealanders had a strong backpacking tradition and found the route convenient. Westerners of all nationalities were represented.

They had many reasons for going: some sought spiritual enlightenment, some were escaping from a rigid conventional lifestyle, some saw opportunities for profit, and some just wanted to see the world. They all had a sense of adventure, but not all of them could be described as hippies - many were simply keen to explore the overland route to the east, first blazed by Marco Polo.

But from the late 1960s onwards the largest contingent, united by a common interest, were the young people with long hair who gave the hippie trail its name - and what defined the hippie trail was that it led to the major hashish-producing centres of the world.

Afghanistan, Chitral, Kashmir, Nepal - familiar names to the pot-smokers of the sixties and seventies, most of whom knew very little else about the countries where their herb of choice was cultivated. But for the next ten years or so they set off in their thousands to look for it.

[...]

 The classic hippie trail came to an end in 1979, when Islamic revolution in Iran and the Russian invasion of Afghanistan closed the overland route to western travellers. Lebanon had already lapsed into civil war, Chitral and Kashmir became less inviting due to tensions in the area, and even Nepal eventually lost its peace and tranquility.

Air travel had by now become affordable and Goa became the main centre of the hippie scene, based around the village of Anjuna, where hippies had been renting houses for many years before any hotels were built to accommodate the massive influx of tourists in the 1980s.

Those who flew to Goa in later years to partake of the hippie lifestyle doubtless enjoyed themselves, and the more adventurous will have travelled around India and learned from the experience. But the overland hippie trail, which lasted little more than ten years, was gone forever.

I am an intern working on a Single Estate Cognac producer. Comparable like wines with the ""Vigneron Récoltant"" mention on their stamps, it means that the whole Cognac production process is done on the same estate, even the bottling.  
Now speaking about Cognac, we're producing three different brands. Namely ABK6, the young, modern one, definitely aimed towards the Whisky drinkers. If you ever tasted Rum or Whiskeys that aged inside Cognac casks, you could mistake the ABK6 VSOP for one of these. Whenever I have casual Cognac drinker coming for a visit on the estate, this is one of the things I recommend first at the tasting. This is a no-brainer for a lot of people, and it got the World's Best Cognac Award by thedrinksreport.com in 2014, against XO's (!).  
  
Since you're already a bit into Scotch, you could build some bridges with that.

Take VW for example (which was fined 120 million in 2003 under the a similar premise). When they get illegal aid, they can produce cheaper and thereby damage for example the french car manufacturer by selling cheaper cars. Ouside of a single market, the French could esily either help their own constructor with even less taxes or just could restrict the import of VW. Within a single market, the second option is not possible, and the first one would create a race that would finally damage all parties envolved.

The RMx is semi-passive, it will only spin up its (silent) fan under load (and thus it helps to get a bigger version). The R5 is another isolated case and an alternative, but I'd actually keep the be quiet. The Silent Base comes with very quiet case fans and is generally very high quality. 

Instead of the 1TB HDD + 500GB SSD I'd get one bigger SSD, HDDs are often the noisiest part in a pc.

&gt; Also what is the noise of the GTX 1080?

&gt; Would an i7 be overkill with this budget even in the near future?

Not normally, but together with a GTX 1080 and a focus on silence it is not in your budget.

&gt; Will my PC be quieter or louder if I install more fans?

It depends on whether having more fans allows them to run slower, and how loud the fan itself is. I would see how the ones that come with the case perform alone.",1,,0,t5_2rnve,1472737542,0,t3_50jqz0,onliandone,1,,False,buildapc

In an email interview, Thomas Hoerber, a professor at the ESSCA School of Management, discusses the ESA’s mission and its relationship to the European Union.

WPR: What are the European Space Agency’s space capabilities and who are its major international partners, in terms of space diplomacy and commercial ties?

Thomas Hoerber: The ESA is a technical agency that brings together the best space engineering expertise Europe has to offer. This ethos is important for the implementation of major space endeavors, such as the Galileo satellite navigation system, the Copernicus earth observation program and, most recently, the Rosetta mission to land on a comet. This expertise is also the reason why major European space actors such as France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Britain see the ESA as the best platform for their space programs. For example, France first proposed the Ariane launch vehicle, but could not have afforded to develop it alone. The ESA’s expertise is also the reason why it is a key partner of NASA and the Russian space agency, whose Soyuz launch system is frequently used by the ESA.

The founding director of the ESA, Roy Gibson, said on the 40th anniversary of the agency in 2014: “We were helping to construct Europe.” The ESA has built up European space companies, such as Arianespace, while companies with national roots often in the military sector, like Thales or OHB, have become European multinational aerospace firms.

WPR: What have the major priorities of the ESA been historically, and how are those changing?

Hoerber: The ESA’s space engineering expertise is uncontested. Space engineering is why the organization was created, and it remains its purpose today. Under its previous director general, Jean-Jacques Dordain, the ESA was considered the implementing agency of the European Union’s space policy, despite the unease about the political consequences of Europe’s growing space capabilities. The ESA was created in 1975 deliberately as a nonpolitical organization. At that time, the European integration process was not held in high esteem, and therefore the ESA was created as an intergovernmental institution that allowed member states to stop any activity they wanted, with the exception of a few core functions.

The discussion about the relationship between the ESA and the EU—the latter being a political organization with democratic legitimacy—highlights the pressing question of whether or not growing space capabilities necessitate increased political leadership, sanctioning and accountability. It also shows the current doubts about whether the ESA, under its current charter, can fulfill that political role. This is why the ESA has become interested in closer cooperation with the EU on space activities, especially since the EU has proven it doesn’t have the technical expertise to implement space programs, as shown by its clumsy management of the Galileo program. 

WPR: How big of a political priority is the ESA and space policy to the EU, and to what extent is there overlap with other EU policies?

Hoerber: Space capabilities have become an important tool for many other EU policies. Earth-observation capabilities are essential for EU climate change policies, and Galileo will be Europe’s independent geopositioning system, which is important for motorists, precision farming and shipping.

Satellite intelligence is vital for border control, monitoring the migration crisis, crisis management and defense. That is why Galileo has received EU funding under the Trans-European Networks budget line, which finances major European infrastructure projects.

For the moment, it seems that the EU is content with space technologies serving other policies with more immediate benefits. We are not in an era where even the Starship Enterprise could lead Europeans to aspire to space exploration. Current EU policies are much more utilitarian, which is what the member states ask of the EU. We are also no longer in the Cold War, where the space race pushed the superpowers to spend more and more on prestige space projects. 

In the EU, in contrast to other major powers, there is no member state that can afford such a large space program by itself. Therefore, the European option is the only one available for countries such as France, Germany and the U.K., which would remain a member of the ESA even after Brexit. The question is, beyond these immediate benefits, is there a space policy that could contribute to the fostering of a European identity?",4,Slovenia,0,t5_2qh4j,1472737948,0,t1_d75cpd7,U5K0,4,SLOV,False,europe

I don't think Scotland could tolerate a hard Brexit - unlike what most people claim it's not just about economics and trade - immigration is viewed as a positive thing in Scotland (differently from England) and free movement is valued too (Scotland has a very high amount of emigration). The unionists seem to be forgetting the social aspect of the decision - most likely because they can't win that argument. 

Also, the trade argument is irrelevant unless rUK has no trade deal with the EU.

It's not possible to say right now how long it would take for Scotland to join the EU - because EU law already makes the foundation of Scots law, it could very easily be fast-tracked so long as both sides are willing (Which they would be - Scotland for obvious reasons and the EU because having Scotland would benefit them economically - [tell me if you're one of the believers that Spain would veto Scotland and I can explain why they wouldn't])

Not GERS again - I've been over this so many times but those figures apply to Scotland in the Union, not iScotland. iScotland would have a deficit, but like almost every country in the world it would tackle that deficit (bear in mind as a percentage of GDP the UK has had a higher deficit in the past)

Lastly I don't think you can say with certainty that Scotland wouldn't vote for independence - bear in mind that the weeks following the EU vote were showing majority support for independence. I think that if we get a hard Brexit those levels of support could return (see 2nd paragraph). The irony is that it's the assumption that Scotland will never vote for independence, and that therefor hard Brexit is an acceptable option, that could potentially lead to Scottish Independence.",1,,0,t5_2qhcv,1472738230,0,t1_d75cdms,Zoroark0511,1,,False,ukpolitics

Its easy with hindsight being 20/20 to look back and see all the dead people and point the finger at the leaders in charge. I get it. But like it or not the French people believed in Napoleon and what he stood for. They liked him especially because they knew he was not a wallflower. Soldiers fought and died for the merits of the French Revolution. They risked it all and changed everything. The other nations of Europe knew that if France saw success in a post revolutionary world it would give other nations the inspiration to overthrow their monarchy's. Believe me they did not want that. So of course England did everything they could to undermine the French Republic. You have to appreciate the fact that if it were not for Napoleon standing his ground and maintaining his vigor in times of war we would not have learned from the Napoleonic Code which is very progressive for its time and pushed for prosperity and equality of the middle class. (Women more or less earned and lost liberties and obviously colored people were not treated the same but those were the times) France was at that point the most progressive nation in the world. Napoleon was able to wipe the national debt clean after years of practical bankruptcy. He did so much good and its most important to remember that he lead his people in a non coercive way. They WANTED him to lead. I honestly cant tell you the exact sentiment of the average civilian back then but one thing I know is they did not want England to come back with a monarchy system. Also many of the countries Napoleon took over would be restructured under his regime based on French Revolution merits which obviously England hated. So its not as easy as people died and leaders should be treated like Hitler. I don't think there is much to learn from that. Clearly and without a doubt Napoleon had an ego. I do not deny that at all whatsoever and eventually it was his gusto in war that was his undoing. For me I think its part of his charm as a historical figure.

d75dq7i,t3_50l3xc,,False,1475231335,"If you're a student, I don't recommend putting much money into a mutual fund. When you invest into anything equities, you should be prepared to perceive the money as ""out of your hands"" for another 10+ years. Remember that they're investments, not a savings stockpile that you can dig into when you need it. Students need money on hand more than anything. You're more likely to move often in the next few years, perhaps buy a car. You'll need to put a down payment on a car, or first and last on an apartment. You're also at an age where it's common and healthy to treat yourself to new things. You might want to travel after school. It's very likely that you may want or need the money in under 5 years. With that short of a time frame, I highly suggest keeping the bulk of your savings safe.

It might not seem logical at first - mutual funds tend to go up right? Well as long as they've gone up since I put it in, why can't I remove it anytime I want? Well you can. It's just a bad practice to put yourself in a position where you will *need* that mutual fund money on short notice. You want to invest in such a way that you can pick and choose when you'll want to sell your investment - and at what unit price.

I just finished school over a year ago, and I'll tell you right now: there's a good chance that in the year after you graduate, $5,500 on hand can come in *very* handy.

Lets assume this $5500 in a mutual fund is all of the spare change you have to your name (it may have grown a bit but lets just call it 5500). You graduate from University and you move back home while you look for a job.

A month later you're driving and your car's transmission blows. The replacement/rebuild cost is $4000. You either pay for the rebuild or you have to sell the car with no transmission for $4k less than it would've been worth yesterday. No matter how you look at it, you're suddenly out $4k. 

You know that without a functioning car, you're not going to be able to find a job.
In order to afford the repair costs or buy another car, you need to pull your mutual fund. This is a sudden need of money, and you are not able to control the unit price that you withdraw at. Chances are your fund is fine, and you'll be okay with a withdrawal. There's also a chance that the markets took a hit in the past week or two, and your initial $5500 investment is temporarily only worth $5000. Now you're scraping closer to the bottom of the barrel. Between the tow truck cost, the repair work, and any extra unforeseen costs, you're almost broke and the mutual fund lost money you'll never get back.

I finished school in May 2015. At the end of June, I was 5 hours from home when my transmission ripped itself apart as I tried to pull out of a parking lot. Thankfully my dad opted for CAA Plus (200km towing/yr) because that got me back to a closer major city. We opted to fix the car, that way I'd have a working vehicle for the next few months while I looked to sell it and purchase a beater car.

With that breakdown, I had to blow most of my savings and had to officially throw out my plan to vacation in Europe before finding work. Employment became priority number 1.

My point is that it was completely unpredictable. My car was in good condition, I maintained it well, drove it safely, and had no previous transmission problems. I am really fortunate that I had a few thousand bucks saved up from coop jobs throughout university.

Putting money in a mutual fund isn't a large risk, but if there's any chance that you might need the money on the spot, it's not a good idea to accept risk.

Pretty much every form I fill ever? Sorry to clarify, this isn't just the census I was talking about. In there I do have that option though I still find it kinda icky, most of the time (i.e. when starting a new job) I don't.

&gt;Government forms are written to be as politically correct as possible, if something isn't there it's not because they ""don't care"", that's a childish false narrative that fails to acknowledge the efforts of people in government to avoid causing offence.

Speaking broadly South America is a continent that is completely ignored politically and historically, particularly in Europe. Ask the average Joe on the street anything about South America and they'll likely say 'uh, the Amazon?' despite the fact that European history (including the UK's) is very closely tied to South America. From colonisation to [UK involvement in teaching torture techniques](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27625540). I said myself that I understand why they don't have every single ethnic option on a UK form, it doesn't make it any less frustrating and othering. I don't really think that's childish.

Which is the issue. I am none of those things. I am not white, I don't consider myself mixed race (who isn't mixed race at this point). I'm definitely not Black nor Asian. I'm Latin. Again it is frustrating to be told what I am or what I am not. Many countries *do* contain that option and is particularly frustrating when you have 'hispanic' but not 'latino' in some UK forms - they're different things! I do understand that there is very little consensus on (similar to the debate on whether 'Jewish' is purely a religion or also an ethnicity). I do think that's partially caused exactly by trying to define what people are or not without having their input, I suspect even with the Latin community you'd have a mixture of answers. [This article, though discussing the U.S. sums it up pretty well](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/15/is-being-hispanic-a-matter-of-race-ethnicity-or-both/). Like I said before most of the time I have no idea what to fill in that form.

&gt;It's something that arose in the Americas purely as reaction to distinguish white and mixed South Americans from white Northern Europeans.

Which is precisely my point, we are different. Most latinos *are* an absurd mix of races to the point that 'mixed' becomes an irrelevant while 'white' in an European context is also not accurate. Again, like I said before back where I was born I would be considered 'white' but our view of race is different to the European view and I don't identify with the term at all over here. I don't really think is at all positive to erase a whole continent's worth of race or trying to force a definition on anyone. I feel really weird about it personally. I don't see why you think it would be a negative to have a clearer definition.

&gt;Actually it's really easy. Firstly we can look at people to filled in ""Latino"" on the census form. Obviously there weren't many of these or there would be pressure to add it to the form

No not really. There [is pressure](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/22/london-latin-americans), [here's the report from Queen Mary's mentioned on the article](http://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/news-and-events/news-and-comments/londons-growing-latin-american-population-face-high-levels-of-exploitation-and-discrimination/). There's organisations that campaign [especifically](http://www.clauk.org.uk) to have our ethinicity recognised. Part of not being recognised is becoming invisible.

&gt;Furthermore we can look at all the people to defined as white or mixed South Americans.

Which isn't accurate and doesn't reflect how a large segment of that community feels. Is like trying to define every Black person as 'African' - sure, but then every human came from Africa. Where are you drawing that arbitrary line?

&gt;That's why a racial definition based on appearance (white/black/asian/mixed) + ethnicity makes far more sense.

Again, to you. Not to me for example. Broadly I guess I could be defined as mixed race but I don't feel like that's accurate at all. 

&gt;You are not being oppressed by Europeans because they fail to recognise pseudo-scientific distinctions, if anything it's done deliberately to stop discrimination and further pigeon holing of people.

No need to be a dick.

&gt;You should be glad that UK isn't like the US where differences are made a huge deal of and everyone is listing off their heritage as if it were a genetic map to where they belong in society.

Actually they are made a massive deal of, particularly in the past few years, particularly since Brexit. It's done in a far more insidious manner but it does absolutely happen. 

&gt;Frankly I think more immigrants would be more disenfranchised being told ""You're a Persian"", ""Your a Latino"", ""You're an Eastern European"" rather than being defined as ""Arab British Iranian"", ""White British Colombian"" or ""White Polish"".

Thanks for telling me and my community what is better for me. I linked an article above that tackles exactly how difficult it is to deal with issues a community faces if they aren't recognised and are made invisible. Plus it isn't up to you to define what I am or not or how I choose to define myself. I'm British. I'm Latin. I'm not white. You don't get to define who I am or not.

&gt;Latino is not a recognised ethnic definition in much of Europe, not because people don't care or want to dismiss it, but because highly racial aware people from a mixture of backgrounds have concluded that including it would be less politically correct than leaving it off.

I worked my way up to the Glycolic 40%! I started out using various 5-10% AHAs for about a year, then started dabbling in peels. The first peel I used was a low concentration blend of AHAs (Glycolic, Lactic &amp; Pyruvic Acids) and Kojic Acid.

If you have experience with AHAs and tolerate them well, you could also start out with a gentle peel like MUAC's 25% Mandelic Acid.

After using that for almost a year and my skin handling the strength well, I move up to 30% Glycolic peels from MUAC, and after going through a bottle of that I've bumped it up to 40%!

I have tried the American (the European formulas are different) La Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreens, specifically the Fluid and the Milk in the larger squeeze bottle. I didn't enjoy them at all as a daily sunscreen for my face or body because they were honestly pretty greasy and very shiny. They also stained my white clothes yellow. :/ However, the protection level is probably the highest you can buy in American stores, so it can be a good choice for beach days (as long as you aren't swimming, these are not waterproof) and other outdoor events where you don't mind being shiny and greasy haha.

Vitamin C will work best if you use it after cleansing and leave it on! If you opt to remove it because you have very sensitive skin, I would instead look for a lower concentration so that you can leave it on. CSI Youth Serum for example is a 12% L-AA serum. Very gentle!

Évidemment qu'il y a d'autres écoles d'application qui rémunèrent leurs stagiaires. Elles le font toutes : c'est réglementaire.

D'une part tu réserves les concours de la FP aux plus riches, parce que tout le monde ne peut pas passer un ou deux sans être payé. Et plus tu grimpe dans la hiérarchie pire c'est, car tu passes plus de temps en formation, fais plus de stages en administration, sur le territoire national et pas dans ta région etc.

D'autre part tu les réserves aux petits jeunes issus des bonnes écoles et tu décourages les gens déjà dans la FP et se passer au niveau au dessus. Donc moins de mobilité sociale et plus de reproduction. Dans mon école d'application on avait 30% d'internes, des gens de 30 à 50 ans qui ont réussi à passer au grade supérieur par leur mérite. Et quand on leur parlait on découvrait que le principal obstacle pour les gens de leur niveau au concours était économique. Parce que passer ces concours implique de déménager, donc d'avoir un double loyer comme ils ont des enfants, et en plus de gagner moins car ils sont au tarif stagiaires. Sans cette rémunération ils ne passeraient pas le concours, et l'État se priverait d'un professionnel qu'il aurait pu avoir autrement.

&gt;I don't think Scotland could tolerate a hard Brexit - unlike what most people claim it's not just about economics and trade - immigration is viewed as a positive thing in Scotland (differently from England) and free movement is valued too (Scotland has a very high amount of emigration). The unionists seem to be forgetting the social aspect of the decision - most likely because they can't win that argument.

I am not disputing Scots may feel a emotional/'social' attachment to Brussels that is strong enough to make them choose Independence regardless of the consequences - so far though in the scientific polls (not self selecting ones) Indy sentiment hasn't really moved so its not apparent if that is the case.

&gt;Also, the trade argument is irrelevant unless rUK has no trade deal with the EU.

Trade argument is not irrelevant at all - its key to the econmic case for remaining in the Uk even if the UK is outsaide the common market.

&gt;Not GERS again - I've been over this so many times but those figures apply to Scotland in the Union, not iScotland. iScotland would have a deficit, but like almost every country in the world it would tackle that deficit (bear in mind as a percentage of GDP the UK has had a higher deficit in the past)

So still no factual dispute over gers....I am sorry but until this is addressed honestly is just makes nationalists sound like dishonest fantasists to come out with these evasions.

&gt;Lastly I don't think you can say with certainty that Scotland wouldn't vote for independence - bear in mind that the weeks following the EU vote were showing majority support for independence. I think that if we get a hard Brexit those levels of support could return (see 2nd paragraph). 

Any actual proper scientifically selected polls showing this? I must have missed them?

I do not want hard Brexit and I do admit it would cause problems in Scotland and NI but I dont accept its as straightforward as you seem to think,

The problem is, when you encounter people like RagTimeViolins you make your arguments about the economy and sovereignty, they'll claim you're talking bullshit and don't know how the EU works ( When in reality they know even less, I've argued with people who actually think MEPs can pass laws when that's all done by the European commission ) they move onto immigration which is a serious issue and then immediately start calling you racist if you even suggest the idea that we should maybe be a bit more careful about who we let into our country.

The viewpoint above though is enough for them to make it out like I'm some sort of neo-nazi and that is exactly why they lost the vote.

I do but that's only because I dance a fairly active tango, rather than the shared hug and a walk version. It's probably more fair for me to say that my embrace (with my wife in particular) can be highly variable even within one song. 

I like the figures and many simply need some space, so I'll often open up the embrace if I have some room on the dance floor and the music is giving me an idea. 
 
&gt; Do we hold our held-hands high because tango canyengue was Europeanized?

The behavior almost never bothers me because it's the culture I was raised in, too. I rarely try to be humble about something I'm actually good at, and I rarely express sympathy for people because I feel full of shit when I do, and lying is absolutely worse than bragging to me. No question. If I'm good at something and know it, I feel so fake to act like I'm not good at it or like I don't know it.

Re sympathy, I prefer to do things for people. When I say words instead, in my head I'm like ""these words don't accomplish anything; you are not helping, and you're pretending like you feel these feels."" But I don't let myself feel bad feels because feeling bad feels feels bad man.

So anyway, I think largely it's a cultural thing + he was hot shit at such a young age. Even Rafa had an older guy take it to him for a while there early on. Novak certainly wasn't a 20yo rapin urrbody. So they learned a humility that Fed never did.

That's the positive spin you can put on it. He's not humble. But he's not really *arrogant* in the way we mean when we say someone's arrogant, and he's not *bad*. It's cultural and to a certain extent his behavior is a product of external factors. It's like when Western Europeans look at Novak, some of his behaviors look fucked up, bad-spirited, etc. Because E. European and W. European cultures are different.

d75hgnj,t3_50e8yk,,False,1475233786,"I think your first paragraph is ignoring context again. As I said, his lane is in stasis while his team decides what play to make; gank and push top or tp play bot or fight at drake or jungle. They do practically no proactive play. That means he doesn't do anything either, it's not safe to go aggressive in lane or go do damage on bot. That means he just farms and has very low KP or DS on his team. Because EF just doesn't fight enough for him to do damage. They just wait til they get rolled. 

Also if you aren't seeing that in a game between top tier teams they'll force the enemy top laner to tp out of lane/force him from CS that's going to crash into tower then Idk what to tell you. Just watch the games more closely. That's wave management and ALL top tier teams are doing it. 

EF doesn't even do the basics right so kfo freezes more because his jungler isn't there to push with him. Also freezing makes it easier to reactionary TP to other lanes. I think it's the aspect that highlights the problem in their macro play and perfectly encapsulates how bad they are.

Also I say semi-coherent because he should arguably look worst on his team if he was as bad as big or hard.

Also froggen has excelled on plenty but carried rarely. That's my point, he only looks good enough not to drag his team down most of the time. He'll play passively in lane rather clobber his opponent to death. I can imagine bjergsen or jensen going for solo kills if their teams were going to lose, I can't see froggen taking the chance and losing his kda. It's not his playstyle. I don't mean in teamfights, EF is usually losing way before then, but in laning phase where he dicks around. 

Also I think you are having a blind spot for froggen while being biased for kfo. The same reasons I believe kfo is stuck in an impossible position where he can't shine, you say froggen can't go aggressive. While true, I was never saying froggen was a bad player during that. I was just saying that his playstyle doesn't accrue leads in a team like EF to win the game. Someone who was more aggressive would be positive for EF while he'd work better on a team like C9 or TSM. Also while his stats looks remarkable he is still a liability to his team because it's the wrong approach when 3 of his teammates are looking to him for miracle plays early on... Rather than trying to grind to late game where he'll look like a star from the old days.

Looper took tp in solo q but that doesn't matter in professional. His stint in LPL he didn't have good TP timings while once he co-ordinated with mata he actually looked super good.

So stuff that changed for seraph doesn't change for Kfo? What does that even mean?! Yea it may not change for him, but that makes no sense when judging a players potential because that's the whole point! It's about the possibility of that player progressing!

Sven has had games where he has taken over the game in every point of his career even in shit tier teams. His lee sin is legendary in EU. There has been multiple cases like this, dandy's rengar, spirits nidalee, clearlove eve... In modern league, unless a champion is a broken piece of shit like GP or fiora or ekko top laners haven't had a chance to be as dominating in a head to head match up. Even then the player with the better jungler to snowball or macro to give them gold properly wins out. The reason I give shit to the jungler is because in the early ganking and power farming meta, junglers are the most even. The most they have had to deal with is invades in lane swaps when they are attacked by supports. Top laners have much worse case scenarios because they are more reliant. I agree jungling is much easier to look worse on (the snowball is much higher from denying buffs early or being warded), but it's much easier to look good on too. Which means it's a pure skill match up so that's how it should be. 

I think you are overating ray and lourlo and quas (the guy builds like 5 dblades if he can get away with). But that's just my opinion. 

So he's competing with huni/hauntz/seraph/darshan next year (I think darshan will bounce back or retire). He just has to knock down 2 to be top 3. Probably seraph is the one he has potential to be better than and he'll have to compete with darshan.

There are four archaic human species in the Homo sapien genepool:  Homo erectus, Neanderthals, Denisovans (identified by a few teeth and maybe a finger bone), and an as yet unknown, unidentified fourth species.

As u/dcarvak pointed out, all Europeans/Middle Easterners have some level of Neanderthal ancestry and East Asians have Denisovan ancestry.  So the only ""true"" Homo sapiens are sub-Saharan Africans.

Another interesting thing: Neanderthals never lived in Africa.  What scientists now believe is that Homo erectus left Africa and the populations in the Middle East and Europe evolved into Neanderthals and the populations that went further east into China evolved into Denisovans.

So yes, in a way, I suppose that it does mean that people from different areas of the world are different.  ""Race"" isn't really a good word to use.  The problem is, you have to remember that there was a lot of migration (read: inter-racial banging) going on even thousands of years ago.

&gt;  parce que tout le monde ne peut pas passer un ou deux sans être payé.

Et pourtant c'est comme ça pour 90% d'étudiants. C'est leur quotidien. Je trouve honteux de payer un doctorant moins qu'un enarque alors que le doctorant a des obligations, faire de la recherche qui profite à tout le monde. 

&gt; Et quand on leur parlait on découvrait que le principal obstacle pour les gens de leur niveau au concours était économique.

Bah c'est la vie. Moi aussi j'ai du faire des choix. J'ai pris telle formation et pas l'autre parce qu'il y avait plus de débouchés. 

Si on donne 1000 euros a tous les masters demain, ça sera mieux pour eux c'est claire et net, y a pas besoin de me convaincre. Mais désolé pour la France ce n'est pas bénéfique.

You acknowledge you do not know how the law works.  Somehow your ignorance is completely irrelevant?

&gt; There are 4 examples here:

You consider two paragraphs in wikipedia enough information to understand a case that took years and millions of dollars to adjudicate?

&gt; For example, the tribunals are secretive and they and the public may not even know of current or past cases because there's no obligation to reveal them to the public.

Provide a link to an article that broke the news of a secret case in the ISDS that involved the US government.  ISDS is part of about 3,000 trade agreements worldwide.  How Egypt - Yemen (just an example no idea if they have a BIT) decide to conduct business in no way reflects or influences how the US operates in international affairs.

Arbitration in general is not conducted in open forums, can not really tell you why.  I guess it is an agreed upon system by the two parties before they sign an agreement.  Probably cost of proper facilities, security, etc.

[The ISDS Blog (odd for a secretive system to have a blog?) talks about the issue and more transparency is being added to the system](http://isdsblog.com/category/uncitral/).  Plenty of more information can be learned about ISDS from this source.  

[NGOs can file to be a ""friend of the court'](http://isdsblog.com/2015/09/04/ngo-voices-in-isds/), very odd for a secret organization?  How do NGOs learn about these secret cases?

[Database of ISDS cases](http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ISDS), where is the secrecy?

[Public access to documents form ISDS cases](http://www.italaw.com/), terrible secrecy!

&gt; Anyway, investors and corporations should not have this right at all. So a country behaves badly. Then investors don't invest. The semi-free market in action.

We have found a basic difference we have.  You think that will make for a better world, I don't.

&gt; You reject all evidence like a climate denier. It happens in front of your eyes and still you have to go back to the document. It's like me saying, ""look, I see a start millions of times bigger than the sun (Cynais Majoris)."" And you responding, ""The laws of physics don't allow that so no, it's not possible."" Ridiculous.

I have no idea what you are even trying to say?

You keep using sources such as HuffPo and Buzzfeed?  The two most common issues I see regularly miss reported by media sources are legal and scientific issues.  Through in political ideologies and they become a waste of time.

[Facts about a few common cases cited on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/390p5l/over_2000000_europeans_have_now_signed_the/cs0hyfx), shows reality is more complex than a sentence or two in a blog.

&gt; Above people even use ISDS to escape criminal convictions. All this is to illustrate the reality.

They sound odd / suspicious but again a sentence or two from a blog post mean nothing to me.  The only thing they might do is cause me to do more research and ;learn what the cases were about.

I can assure you there is no court system in the world that I could not find cases that I question the outcome.  Upon more research I might understand how they came to the decision but still may not agree with the decision legally or based on my own personal beliefs.  The ladder and two dollars will get me a cup of coffee.

I have no idea how/why you think the world would be a better place if governments can just screw over anyone without repercussions? ",1,,0,t5_2cneq,1472747027,0,t1_d75fv0j,ImInterested,1,,False,politics
d75k05v,t3_50mytn,,1472747672.0,1475235520,"Oi. Vou iniciar para a semana o meu quinto ano a viver numa residência universitária pública em Lisboa.

Há muita coisa que posso dizer portanto não vou aprofundar muito a não ser que perguntes especificamente. O que vou dizer aplica-se as residências da ULisboa (inclui ex-UTL).

As residências públicas da Universidade de Lisboa são ou 130€ ou 74€  se bolseiro (mas se es bolseiro esses 74 são te reembolsados todos os meses. Quase toda a gente nas RU é bolseira)

Partilhas quarto. Com 1 ou 2 pessoas a não ser que estejas lá há bué tempo e tenha quartos individuais podes ficar um ano num.
Partilhas casa de banho. Pode ser só com a malta do quarto se quarto com casa de banho ou então a casa de banho está aberta ao piso mas a média de pessoas por casa de banho deve estar à volta de 3-4, mas isto depende também do tipo de residência, se for uma feita de raiz que da ULisboa acho que é só a da Cruz Quebrada provavelmente tens a casa de banho exclusiva a 1 ou 2 quartos. A maioria das residências são apartamentos ou edifícios convertidos.

A arquitectura da residencia influencia também o ambiente, contrariamente ao desejado as residencias de raiz, neste caso só me refiro à da Cruz Quebrada não têm um ambiente tão bom como as convertidas. Muitas festas, muito barulho, pouco respeito, espaços comuns acessíveis a demasiada gente e pouca confiança. Os apartamentos convertidos resultam melhor, porque normalmente cada piso é isolado, ou seja em condições normais só está acessível às pessoas daquele piso (excepto quando há uma maquina de lavar roupa de outro piso q avaria ou coisa do género) então o ambiente é muito mais familiar, não hão de ser mais de 20 pessoas naquele piso dá para confiar e por exemplo deixar o computador nos espaços comuns sozinho o dia todo, algo que não se faz em muitas residências tipo a cruz quebrada ou edifícios convertidos em que toda a gente tem acesso a todos os pisos. 

Tens a tua prateleira na cozinha, congelador e frigorifico.
No quarto tens uma estante e guarda roupa não muito grande, uma secretária pequenina com uma cadeira e a cama com lençóis e almoçada.
Tens também uma sala comum e sala de estudo cujo acesso depende muito da tipologia da residência.
Normalmente não há controlo de acessos. Há uma encarregada que está lá durante o dia mas vai embora à noite. Não podes levar pessoas a dormir lá mas a não ser que alguém faça quiexinhas não há problema, e que já tenha bazado (ou pareça q acabou de chegar) quando a encarregada ou senhoras da limpeza chegarem.

As cozinhas e casas de banho são limpos todos os dias e os caixotes de lixo despejados também todos os dias, incluindo o que está no teu quarto, o que significa que entra lá alguém todos os dias pelo menos para tirar o lixo.

Se fores da UL aconselho a ires a este site e na barra de cima: Alojamento&gt;Residencias para Estudantes&gt;... e veres as várias residências de Lisboa. Se fores para o polo universitário da Ajuda aconselho a residência de Benfica.

EDIT: Outro apontamento em relação ao ambiente, depende muito das pessoas. No meu caso nos primeiros anos as pessoas com quem estava conviviam muito e o ambiente era muito familiar e havia sempre pessoas na sala ou cozinha para falar um bocadinho. Nunca te sentias sozinho. Neste últimos anos, alias desde a fusão da UL e UTL as pessoas que lá estão são muito mais variadas, de escolas diferentes e acaba por não haver muito convívio, também há pessoas que quando estão em casa estão a maior parte do tempo no quarto (é um bocado chato quando partilhas quarto com essas pessoas). Mas do outro lado da moeda agora, apesar de estar na mesma residência, o ambiente é muito mais calmo e fora das horas de ponta da cozinha, não se vê muita gente em casa, pelo menos fora dos quartos, o que também faz com que te sintas um pouco sozinho, pelo menos depois de te habituares aquele ambiente e fora as poucas pessoas que ainda lá estam dos meus primeiros os anos o resto sinto-os como estranhos, simpáticos e respeitadores, mas estranhos, mas isso também pode ter a a ver com a disposição que eu tinha quando entrei para lá e a que tenho agora para conhecer as pessoas.

If the person was taller than the bed was long, he would chop off as much of them as it took to make them exactly fit the length of the bed; but if they were shorter than it, he would use a hammer to smash and stretch them across it to make them fit. He was ultimately killed by Theseus.

A ""Procrustean bed methodology"" refers to when someone tries to make the facts conform to a specific narrative or arbitrary standard, stretching the truth and cutting out any details that don't fit their agenda. In the videos referenced, Gaijin Goombah makes the fairly interesting and initially reasonable claim that *Undertale* is largely inspired by Irish mythology (specifically, the story of the Tuatha de Danaan: the magical beings who are supposed to have inhabited Ireland before the first humans arrived and drove them underground); but then, to make his hypothesis more of an overarching slam-dunk, he tries to a establish a perfect one-to-one relationship between almost every character in the game and an element of Irish (and then later just generally medieval European) folklore; often demonstrating a somewhat half-assed understanding of both said folklore and the game in the process.",7,"""Three hundred gamers felled by your gun.""",0,t5_33oia,1472747087,0,t1_d75anpe,Pflytrap,7,,False,GamerGhazi

Race is complicated even if you factor out sociology.

d75k7n5,t3_50nsca,,False,1475235663,"Casimir Moreau sits in his home, in Paris, mulling over the terms. To his right stands his chief advisor, a bitter and broken veteran called Claude. 

""Who do these pigs think they are, offering us our country back and expecting us to be grateful?"" He spat, through his ruined jaw, still visibly scarred by the wires holding his replacement jawbone in. ""They should be begging forgiveness for the children they starved!""

Casimir looked the man over. This was why he was here. Claude was a very clever man, very persuasive. Casimir knew very well that if he left politics and retired to the Riviera or somewhere, that Claude would have no difficulty stirring up the people. The centre-right would be routed. This man, or someone like him, would no doubt re-build the economy, but it wouldn't be a peaceful economy. Not at all.

Compromise pained Casimir, just as it pained him not to be able to enforce the isolation of France as he sincerely wished to.

""Claude, if we reject this deal, what do you think the Germans will do?""

""They'll keep killing our children, won't they? Starving us, and leeching funds meant for France!""

""Why do you say that, Claude? The Germans have been better occupiers now than they were 100 years ago.""

""Well then, why is France still poor? $27,000 GDP? You know better than anyone, Casimir, that we should rightfully be on $60k or even $80k by now! This Northern League ""bailout"" - what are they doing with the rest of the money they stole from us? What are they doing about the art we lost?""

""Claude, be calm. You know how war affects us. I lost people too. I supported complete autarky, as you know, Claude. We both fought NATO even after we couldn't fight any more. France simply cannot survive by itself, we've seen that.""

Claude stood straight, his jaw clenched and his fists tight on the broken files they were using while the supply chains from India were being re-established. 

""Look at us, Claude. We're broken. Our nation is in ruins.""

""And it's all THEIR FAULT!"" Claude raised his voice, gesticulating wildly, pointing East - towards Berlin.

Casimir sat patiently while Claude seethed. Perhaps, in hindsight, he should have told the frightened young German diplomat to wait and meet at their Embassy. Walking the streets in new clothes showed everyone who you were, but having the door opened to an angry man with half his face missing would be enough to scare anyone. Asking for Casimir Moreau in obviously-accented English wasn't such a great move, either. But, the diplomat came and went, despite dirty looks from the locals. 

""It's not their fault. But that's not what we're arguing here, Claude. We have a duty, to ourselves, and to France. Imagine the suffering we've been through - remember your wife? How she went hungry for days during the Siege of Paris to feed your little Henri? We have a responsibility never to allow something like this to happen again.""

""How?"" Claude demanded. ""This deal is nonsense. It's nothing. It's the *Germans* trying to get out of the mess they caused!"" 

""No, Claude. Lady France may be broken, but we're still better off than much of Eastern Europe. Our lives here, now, - this is every day for people in Poland, in Slovenia, in Hungary. The Germans are extending a hand, to cooperate. To work with us. The Government already chose that path. We can choose it, too. They're offering to work with us - imagine the possibilities, Claude. Your descendants will never have to go hungry again. We can eradicate war from Europe permanently. You and I can ensure the horrors of starvation and misery never stand at a European's door again. Imagine it, Claude - imagine the warfighting machines of France, Germany, Italy, all under one command, unified, unable to kill each other, unable to starve out a great city like Paris ever again. Paris was once the largest city in Europe. It still is one of the largest, even with half the population gone.""

Claude said nothing. 

""Claude, listen to me. Your hatred of the Germans - it's not beneficial. Yes, they seized Strasbourg, and took our border on the Rhine; but France is so much more than L'Hexagone or just a place. France is an idea, Claude - she is Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood. She is freedom from want and a sense of pride in your achievements, not whoever happens to fly their flag over Lorraine. The Germans aren't offering us ""our country"", they're offering us so much more. They're offering us the chance to work with them, to shape Europe, to mould it in the image that Napoleon wanted. Tie France and Germany together, Claude, and who can stop us? Expand that to the whole of Europe and we will shape the world! Imagine **that**, Claude, when you think about the future. Europe, holding hands in freedom, and equality, guiding the world towards peace and brotherhood. Don't imagine the jackbooted neo-Gaullists taking pot shots at Germans in the ruins of Cologne. I've always said war is the worst option, and keeping France's ideas alive is the best - but this is the best compromise we're going to get.""

Casimir leant back, his eyes unreadable. ""Now go home, Claude. Take the evening off. Go for a stroll along the Seine. Go and visit your wife's grave. Pray that one day the war memorials are simply relics and historical points of interest. Make the phonecalls, to Marianne, and Martel, and whoever leads the errant partisans in Bourges. Call the ""Resistance"" in Strasbourg, and get them to come home. Let them know about the terms, and let them know what we're doing. If they don't want to trust the Germans, tell them to trust me - give this plan until the end of 2046. Let them know that if there are still Germans in France by then, they can take up arms once more, but first get them to wait and see.""

""Go, Claude - I have an offer to accept.""
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Dear Ambassador,

Casimir Moreau is pleased to accept the offer extended by the Germans and the Occupation Forces. We will dissolve the armed groups as far as possible and will  trust you for this period. Your offer is very much appreciated as we were beginning to hear rumours of a resumption of attacks on Government and Occupation forces.

However, should this deal be breached, or should the Occupation remain after 2046 without reasonable excuse, we will not hesitate to take up arms again.

Yours,

d75kesz,t3_50mmgh,,False,1475235798,"It's not Ireland's job to collect taxes for the world. This is a US company. It's headquartered in the US. It has brick-and-mortar shops all over Europe, with real cash registers ringing up real sales. This is also the case in Ireland, whereby the Irish government levies the appropriate and legislated tax upon any profits made. We collect the money that is owed to us, nothing more. 

Revenue have repeatedly stated in very clear and unambiguous terms that Apple received no special deal, treatment, or consideration. They have also stated that Apple asked if their tax setup was legal in Ireland - which it is and was - which Revenue confirmed for them. That's the sum total of it, despite everyone wanting to shit all over our 'useless politicians' for the 102nd time today. 

If European countries allow monies collected from sales within their jurisdiction to leave their state without tax being paid on it, that's not Ireland's business. If the US political system is so fundamentally fucked that they have to arrange for American companies to 'repatriate' money home - and never at the 35% rate - every five years or so because they can't fix their byzantine tax code, that's not Ireland's business. If American politicians cannot enforce ethical standards of business practices on American companies (so a head office is resident nowhere on earth), that's not Ireland's business. 

This is a perfect storm of US political corruption coming home to roost, an EU looking to expand its authority into member-state's tax regimes, and a patsy nation no-one gives a shit about really and of whom everyone would willingly believe fucked up: Ireland. 

When was the last time you ever heard any EU commissioner complain even half-heartedly about the UK, whose dependency of the Cayman Islands is *literally* short-hand for financial corruption, and where Facebook paid less than £5,000 in tax for 2015? What was the name of the last EU bureaucrat to slam the tax policies of the Netherlands, or Luxembourg, or any other EU country who have long-standing and internationally recognised systems in place to facilitate up-front tax avoidance? Doesn't happen. Won't happen. 

The EU - and by 'the EU' I mean Germany and it's mouthpiece the Netherlands - want tax regimes within the bloc to be 'harmonised'. That means they want the EU (again, Germany) to be able to tell countries how much tax to levy and on what. It's the last semblance of sovereignty member states have. This is not some secret, they've been heading for it for years. This is just the first big play they've made in pursuit of that aim. Naturally, Merkel is staying stumm to avoid it looking like what it is, despite issuing statements almost daily from the recession to the migrant crises.

Now, you might argue the minutiae of the case: shell corporations, sub-companies, residency, tax laws, etc., but none of those details is the point. The EU is finally testing out a mechanism by which to dictate tax policy to member states. They are doing this via a competition-law channel which should have nothing to do with tax. They are doing this via an arm of the EU entirely staffed by people whose wages are paid by the EU and no EU citizen ever elected. 

The technical rights-and-wrongs of the case are, to my mind at least, almost irrelevant. The EU doesn't know when to stop. It keeps going and going, driven by a bureaucracy seeking new ways to justify its own existence and fuelled by a central power that holds efficiency and conformity above all else. It's a project that has morphed beyond all recognition from what it was intended, and voted, to be. They have no compunction over announcing to the world that Ireland is a tax haven. That Ireland is siphoning off money that belongs to the masses of Europe. That Ireland is in some form of corrupt cahoots with the evil mega-corps. Fellow member states are even encouraged to seek their own slice of the pie (when apparently it *also* is entirely owed to us, like Schrodinger's debt). They know we universally loathe our politicians, so they adroitly let it be known that we could spend all that lovely money on *anything we want* (despite on the other hand insisting that we still owe them tens of billions in debt for money that doesn't exist). They are also hanging Ireland out to dry for a tax system that has not existed for four years. And saying we need to penalise Apple retroactively for breaking laws we told them they weren't breaking and for not collecting taxes owed to other countries. It's appalling.

I sincerely, deeply, hope that Ireland fights this tooth and claw, if it costs us another €13bn to do it. To paraphrase Michael O'Leary (something I never though would happen), the EU needs to be told to 'Fuck Off' every once in a while, for its own good.

No but the principle is the same. A State tells you one thing is legal but feds disagree, ultimately you go with the feds because they are supreme. Same here.

d75m0v7,t3_50k7m7,,False,1475236898,"So I was also considering my options for a long time and decided on Skyla (Jaydess here in Europe, hormonal IUD like Mirena) which I got inserted 2 days ago. I'm very happy with that option, though I'm going to have to wait and see if there are any side effects. I chose it for the same reasons I'd recommend it for you:

**1) Reliable**

Like you, I am very forgetful and while the pill is reliable when taken regularly and non-intrusive, it's just generally a pain in the ass to remember in my experience. I ended up forgetting in a handful of times and had to take the morning after pill. The IUD or the implant are a much better option instead since once inserted you are good for the next 3 or 5 years (&gt; for copper IUDs). The implant has a stupidly low failure rate, with the IUDs having a failure rate comparable to tubal ligation ([wiki chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_birth_control_methods#/media/File:Effectivenessofcontraceptives.png)).

**2) No/ as little hormones as possible**

While I was generally fine on the pill for ages, after 5-6 years I noticed that it did have a negative impact on my sex drive :(. I just didn't like the idea of flooding my body with unnecessary hormone anymore, and for this the implant, the copper or hormonal IUDs are the best options. 

The blood hormone concentration is much smaller than the pill (since they don't have to go through the digestive tract) and they all use only the single progestin hormone rather than a combination. You could go with the mini pill (progestin only), but the concentration is still higher and it's even more important to take the damn thing on time than the combined pill, which sucks (see point 1).

The reason why I went with the hormonal IUD rather than the implant is because I like that the hormone release is local and the serum concentration is lower, especially for Skyla (though reliable data on this is damn near impossible to come by, but here's a [blog](https://bedsider.org/features/317-all-about-hormones)). I figured the smaller the concentration, the better for me. 

While I thought the copper IUD was actually the best choice (no hormones, acts the longest and cheapest considering it's effective for up to 10-12 years), after seeing 3 doctors they all recommended the Mirena or Skyla instead (they are smaller, less problems with inflammation according to their personal experience) so I decided to go for a hormonal one. 

**3) Better periods**

The pill and the hormonal IUDs are all supposed to give you better periods on average, with them stopping all together in many women with Mirena and some women with the implant and Skyla, while the copper IUD gives you worse periods. So in your case I'd stay faaaaaar away from the copper one and look for the hormonal methods instead. 

While some women do report bad periods with the IUDs and the implant, they are much fewer than those that report the opposite. Even with your very negative experience with depo-provera I'd say you could still give them a go, since it uses medroxyprogesterone acetate which could be the progestin which causes you so much trouble, whereas the implants use etonogestrel and the IUDs levonorgestrel. It could be also that depo causes higher serum concentrations than the implant or IUDs, though data is *very* difficult to come by it seems.

**4) Cheap**

This is going to vary depending on your insurance, but for me, copper IUD was the cheapest option, cheaper even than the pill, Mirena was next, and the implant and Skyla costing about the same (just ~7€ per month). I went with Skyla for the reasons listed above. The pill can also be very cheap, depending on which is covered by insurance. 

After considering all the above, I went with the Skyla, even though I was terrified of uterine perforation. All went much better than expected, now I'm going to see if there's any side effects. If you are not too worried about the difference in concentration

Also a tip: if you go for an IUD, insist on a pill to soften the cervix and take ibuprofen before hand.

You did. I said brownshirts and you're trying to say I was talking about all Nazis. 

&gt; And if wikipedia's reliable enough for you, it's not difficult to end this conversation really quickly..

Once again you are trying to change the argument by listing a stat for all Nazis when I clearly said brownshirts. 

&gt; Is it?

Your link backs up what I've said from the beginning. The party shifted after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives which saw Hitler destroy the left wing of the Nazi party. 

Take a step back and re-read our conversation. 

 My First sentence to you- Is Russia considered Europe? How about the horrifying acts of the Nazi **brownshirts**?

Your first response to me- ... there's no academic definition of 'leftism' where it makes any degree of sense to describe Hitler's Nazi Party as 'leftist', come on.

My second response to you- On the contrary. Hitlers **brownshirts** were without question socialists and communists. They were the ones who helped Hitler seize power in Germany. They existed from 1920 to 1934 and grew to over 3 million members. The Nazi movement was to implement socialism in Germany as far as the SA was concerned. The majority of them were former communists. Once the left put Hitler in power he had them eliminated on the ""Night of the Long Knives"" in June of 1934.",1,,0,t5_2uxtj,1472749890,0,t1_d75kx46,Lonsdaleite,1,,False,standupshots

It gave one example - Switzerland. As a Swiss, I can tell you that the mandatory service is far more contentious than it is being portrayed here. Further, Switzerland has a strategic culture that makes it far more amenable to mandatory service due to its neutrality and history of fighting ""people's wars"". Canada does not have a similar strategic culture at all.

It's also worth keeping in mind that the trend in Europe has been away from mandatory service since it is a callback to the days of nationalistic fervor that led to the World Wars, costs a great deal of money and imposes a negative economic impact, and produces soldiers that are largely incapable and who drag down regular unit morale who would much rather be there.

&gt; I really don't see a downside other than it being massively unpopular.

http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html

*1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.*

More or less done, still some argument about whether or not Parliament gets final say but the intention is there and it is in line with our own 'constitutional requirements'

*2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention.*
At first this needed clarification.  Did the PM saying ""We will honour the referendum"" on TV notify the EC of our intention?  In fact, no. Can't remember who but someone senior said they needed to receive something in writing to trigger it.

*In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.*

The EU appointed negotiators sit down with David Davis and come to some sort of agreement as to how all the current EU-UK bits will work after we leave. If there is a way forward on this, it is put to the vote of the remaining EU members who must agree in majority.

Again, some dispute on whether parliament and/or another referendum should take place for the UK to agree it as well.

*3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.*

And here's the timer.  Supposing it was all friendly and straightforward - 6 months into negotiations all is agreed and this included a 'UK to leave the EU on 1st Jan 2018', before the two year period is up.  If everyone's happy, that's when we leave.
Otherwise the various negotiations, and member voting continues until Article 50+2 years is up, when Britain's treaties with EU lapse and we're out of the club.  (Unless the only thing that is agreed is an extension to the 2 year deadline, but this needs to be unanimous across member states)

The nobody knows bits are:

- whether we'll reach an agreement within 2 years

- whether we'll conclude it early, or get that unanimous extension beyond 2 years

- what can be agreed, esp on the key points of freedom of movement and single market access.

If budget is a concern then consider even going as far as San Diego or Fresno and grabbing Greyhound. It sucks, but you can save hundreds sometimes (not usually in the case of LAX). Please note it also takes forever to do the shopping which is why I didn't do it for him. also because 175 seems very reasonable. the other thing to look for is where the tickets have layovers if they are not non-stop. That layover may signify a ""hub"" for whatever discount airline you'd be using and you can again score some super sweet deals. So if Spirit airlines has a hub in lets say Las Vegas, you might be able to find an extremely cheap flight to LV and then greyhound to LA. you can also sometimes find a much cheaper LV to LA flight which combined with your separate NOLA to LV flight could be cheaper than a ""direct flight.""

For example if you ever buy a last minute ticket to Europe and you're no picky about where you land. Copenhagen is the place to look. Norwegian must be subsidized because they can offer some ridiculously cheap last minute tickets to either Oslo or Copenhagen.

The quote wasn't said until 2010, but it is utterly disingenuous to suggest that the 'stop Obama at any cost' sentiment only started after the 2010 election. It started literally the moment he was elected, and we've know this for years.

On the night of Obama's inauguration, Frank Luntz - the now infamous Republican strategist - organized [a private meeting of top tier Republican lawmakers and other party members](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/the-republicans-plan-for-the-new-president/). 

 (**Bold** emphasis mine throughout)

&gt; “The room was filled. It was a who’s who of ranking members who had at one point been committee chairmen, or in the majority, who now wondered out loud whether they were in the permanent minority,” Frank Luntz, who organized the event, told FRONTLINE.

&gt;Among them were Senate power brokers Jim DeMint, Jon Kyl and Tom Coburn, and conservative congressmen Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan.

&gt;After three hours of strategizing, they decided they needed to **fight Obama on everything**. The new president had no idea what the Republicans were planning.

They literally from day one conspired to be completely intransigent. And before you try to cast this as a principled opposition that could have been overcome by Obama being willing to compromise,[ let's get more specific.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/robert-draper-anti-obama-campaign_n_1452899.html)

&gt;“If you act like you’re the minority, you’re going to stay in the minority,” Draper quotes McCarthy as saying. “We’ve gotta challenge them on **every single bill** and challenge them on **every single campaign**.”

&gt;The conversation got only more specific from there, Draper reports. Kyl suggested going after incoming Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner for failing to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes while at the International Monetary Fund. Gingrich noted that House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) had a similar tax problem. McCarthy chimed in to declare “there’s a web” before arguing that Republicans could put pressure on any Democrat who accepted campaign money from Rangel to give it back.

And...


&gt;The dinner lasted nearly four hours. They parted company almost giddily. The Republicans had agreed on a way forward:
Go after Geithner. (And indeed Kyl did, the next day: ‘Would you answer my question rather than dancing around it—please?’)
**Show united and unyielding opposition** to the president’s economic policies. (Eight days later, Minority Whip Cantor would hold the House Republicans to a unanimous No against Obama’s economic stimulus plan.)

&gt;Begin attacking vulnerable Democrats on the airwaves. (The first National Republican Congressional Committee attack ads would run in less than two months.)
Win the spear point of the House in 2010. Jab Obama relentlessly in 2011. Win the White House and the Senate in 2012.
“You will remember this day,” Draper reports Newt Gingrich as saying on the way out. “You’ll remember this as the day the seeds of 2012 were sown.”

For the record, those economic policies mentioned in the second to last paragraph of the quote, that would include the stimulus that not only was a continuation of the same kind of fiscal stimulus enacted under Bush, but has been near unanimously considered to have been essential to the US riding out the global economic downturn that devastated parts of Europe.

So no, there was nothing Obama could have done. You should educate yourself before trying to imply that others are ignorant of the full context.",12,,0,t5_2sfmf,1472753091,0,t1_d75mhv4,toweldayeveryday,12,,False,PoliticalDiscussion

Usually, not very far in advance.  For example, I have a rough list of the places I plan to be between now and the end of the year, but am pretty flexible about time and sequence.  I have a few events like conferences and birthdays where I know in advance where I'll want to be at what time.

&gt;Do you look for flight deals or does that not matter so much for you? 

Usually, not very much, though I do sequence things to avoid over-paying.  For example, I do most of my European travel in the off-peak season.  For example, flying SFO to AMS (return) can cost $1700+ in the summer season, and around $1k in the off-season.  Similar for SFO-TYO.  Flying SFO to Colombia or or Peru remains cheap during the summer around $400-500 return.

Usually, when I have a couple big corporate projects, I don't think very much about deals and just travel where I like.  One of the things I love about DN living, is that you can quickly adjust your cost of living.  For example, I just finished an 18mo project with a Fortune 100 company, and my monthly income dropped by quite a bit.  So, I go spend some time in lower cost-of-living countries while I pitch the next projects.  Once the next big project comes through, then I can go back to the more expensive places...

Le PKK est né au début des années 80, un mouvement indépendantiste qui a pris racine dans la répression et le ""génocide"" culturel et identitaire kurde, commencé réellement sans raison par les nationalistes turques. Kurdes et turques vivaient en harmonie, tout le monde était content avant que la répression totalitaire ne se soit abattue sur les minorités en Turquie. En effet, la langue kurde était interdite. Si tu parlais kurde dans la rue, tu risquais la prison, ou de disparaitre. Bref, s'il y a bien un truc à ne pas faire, c'est venir faire chier des montagnards qui aiment vivre en liberté. Le PKK a porté les armes pour libérer le peuple kurde de l'oppression. Voilà ce qui s'est passé: 

&gt; According to human rights organisations since the beginning of the uprising 4,000 villages have been destroyed,[42] in which between 380,000 and 1,000,000 Kurdish villagers have been forcibly evacuated from their homes.[244] Some 5,000 Turks and 35,000 Kurds,[42] have been killed, 17,000 Kurds have disappeared and 119,000 Kurds have been imprisoned by Turkish authorities.[38][42] According to the Humanitarian Law Project, 2,400 Kurdish villages were destroyed and 18,000 Kurds were executed, by the Turkish government.[244] In total up to 3,000,000 people (mainly Kurds) have been displaced by the conflict,[44] an estimated 1,000,000 of which are still internally displaced as of 2009.[245] The Assyrian Minority was heavily affected as well, as now most (50-60 thousand/70,000) of its population is in refuge in Europe.

La lutte armée est une continuité d'une lutte politique échouée. La Turquie jusqu'à la fin des années 90, et maintenant de nouveau depuis 2-3 ans, n'a jamais été une réelle démocratie. Tout mouvement pacifiste kurde à été réprimé par la force. Les politiciens du parti progressiste pro-kurde HDP ont perdus leur immunité parlementaire et risquent de se faire jeter en prison à n'importe quel moment. 

Moi ce que j'adore c'est les turques qui me disent ""mais tout ça c'est dans le passé, maintenant vous avez des droits"". Ah mais dis donc, mais c'est génial ça!! Oh tu sais quoi, on va tout oublier, parce que maintenant si je parle kurde dans la rue je risque pas de croupir en taule, les femmes de mon village ne se feront pas violer et en plus il ne sera pas détruit! Trop cool, merci les gars, je vous remercie du fond du coeur. 

En plus dans les récents clashs, des villes comme Nusaybin ou Sirnak ont été détruits à plus de 80%. Il y a quelques mois, des gens ont été brûlés vifs dans leurs caves. Brûlés vifs. Un avocat pro kurde s'est fait descendre en pleine ville. Voilà ce que ça veut dire la démocratie en Turquie, voilà le choix que l'on a en tant que Kurde: 

https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1tZkEHCz2LLLIs12D2d0514rUhec

Tu peux cliquer sur chaque point, tout est vérifié. Chacun de ces points montre une attaque violente contre un bureau du HDP. Soit des incendies volontaires, soit des drive by, enfin bref, de la violence gratuite.

Quand tu as en main des cartes de merde, tu ne peux que jouer une partie de merde. Tout, littéralement **tout** pourrait être résolu, si seulement les turques acceptaient de négocier avec les kurdes, pour leur donner leur putain d'autonomie. C'est pas trop demander quand même, non? Après tout ce qui s'est passé, c'est si inacceptable de nous accorder de l'autonomie? Bordel.

Arab people who happened to be Islamic absolutely did, but it was probably more in spite of Islam than because of it, in the same way that the West's great contributions to modernity (democracy and capitalism) were largely secular developments. 

You will hear some claim that democratic thought and early capitalistic theory have their root in Judaeo-Christian values or work ethics, but you will mostly hear it from religious fundamentalists - people who have studied neither democratic nor economic theory, and who have a mostly mythological understanding of historic 'Judaeo-Christian values'. The need to attribute the Middle East's 'Golden Age' to Islam is much more pervasive among secular and mainstream religious people for a number of reasons, which I won't get into unless prompted.

I'm not taking a bigoted stance here, or arguing that Arabs simply maintained European and broader Mediterranean innovations while the West struggled with its own bout of theocratic hysteria (see also: The Dark Ages). Middle Easterners weren't mere 'custodians' of Western scholarship. They were inventors and innovators on their own. Arabs and Persians (that is to say 'non-white', 'non-European' peoples from the Middle East) have had and continue to have a huge impact on mankind's continued quest to understand the mysteries of our shared existence, through the natural and social sciences, through art and literature, through reason and spirituality. (This is my disclaimer I feel obligated to employ whenever I try to make this point in real life, so bear with me fellow internetters if you've heard it before.)

Nobody is implying that Arab people in general OR Muslims in particular will be forever doomed to live under regimes that take advantage of the technology of the modern age yet deny their subjects the more value-laden benefits of modernity. Nobody is implying they need to be saved or civilized by white culture founders or state builders. They're just saying that, in general, Islamic (and possibly by extension all) theistic thinking holds people back. It works the same way for groups of any race, creed, color, sex, disability status, gender or sex identification, or any other sometime-protected status one might bring up.

Supreme Court 101: defenders of the constitution


The entire function of the Supreme Court (scotus)  is to oversee the interpretation of laws to ensure they do not interfere with the basic rights afforded us by the constitution or the bill of rights.


Any case can be appealed all the way up to the supreme court, and they are also able to decide of their own accord to hear a case,  enabling them to react quickly and decisively to ""legal emergencies"" that may arise.


Every single one of our constitutional rights is protected only by the supreme courts interpretation of existing laws and the founding documents.


During any case about any topic,  the Supreme Court can radically change the definitions of almost any of our basic rights through the simple act of interpreting words.


Assault weapon bans become semi-auto bans,  and civilian gun owners are immediately 100 years technology behind criminals with modern weaponry.  


Hate speech laws get expanded so that all criticism becomes criminal.  ""free speech zones"" become widespread,  by definition restricting free speech.   Basic thought police actions begin blowing up the first amendment.


Church and state and equal protection go out the door the first time the Supreme Court decided that a religion needs protection from other religions. For example,  the first time anyone is legally stopped from praying because it inherently offends a muslim who is nearly there they go,  2 more basic rights gone.


These things aren't unlikely.   They are being done in Europe because they don't have our system and our freedoms.

Hillary has no problem with what Europe is dealing with right now.  She wouldn't lift a finger to stop it from happening in here.

I have considered their points but i see that they have left out many crux points based on real world practical applications of taxes. 

I dont think its a straw man i feel its a precedence. There is no way to prove either way without taking the ""wait and see"" approach.

I do understand that it is argued as irelands own call. And i know for a fact that of course it is. The EU is a league of nations but each nation is still their own sovereign. 

But i also understand that before, when the EU was ratified. Or during the EEC. Everyone came together and clarified ""hey, this is my law, is that like our agreed law?"" And it was oked by the EU then! I believe this because this is literally what the EU is for. 

It could be that some things were lost in communication, or some one was negligent then in their presentation and/or their review of the presentation. But either way, that means no one was trying to ""shirk tax"" in any illegal manner

Clearly the EU has 2 different sets of Tax structures, one in their head and one in practice. 

Because i attribute the mistake originally by the EU, and by some other real world observations, i feel apple should not be the only one crucified for this. 

If apple is guilty, so is most every business in the world. 

I think the EU, Ireland and minimally so, Apple, and by extension every business in the EU, can and should be responsible to reform tax in the EU. 

The world also need to relook their tax structure. Tax breaks are given by every government because they are greedy for more business. Think low tax by high volume as opposed to high tax by low volume. 

I hope that i, including the 2 comments i linked to you, have sufficiently explained how i unified all aspects of this debacle.

&gt;  This is a vital decision for the future of our country, and I believe we should also be clear that it is a final decision...

&gt;...I want to spell out this point carefully, because it is important. If the British people vote to leave, there is only one way to bring that about, namely to trigger article 50 of the treaties and begin the process of exit, and the British people would rightly expect that to start straight away.

Is you look at total weighted greenhouse gas emissions China is clearly in the lead today. But a few other options:

* Historic emissions (counting all greenhouse gas emissions since the industrial revolution): US a clear first (&gt; 1/3 of ask human made emissions ever), Europe second. This is the main argument BRICs countries use to justify emissions - *you* (=the west) live off the wealth you created with emissions, we have the same right to give or citizens a decent standard of living.
* Per capita - Arab countries far ahead in first place, followed by the US.
*Actual emissions consumed (=current emissions minus all the emissions caused for export products, plus all emissions caused for imported products) - again US far ahead. The argument here is simply that EU and US have outsourced most of their dirty industries to developing countries.
* Emissions caused by a country's economy - here again the US fares badly as its companies have many emission-rich factories, mines, etc abroad 
* Emissions caused for food production/transport/etc - very different results showing how some countries have enormously polluting sectors.
* Net emissions - take all emissions and subtract all attempts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - China has huge reforestation efforts ongoing, being actually the only country in the world that is succeeding at shrinking a desert 
* Attempts to improve: this one is probably the most interesting. China is installing more new coal power plants than anyone else, but it is also, ever year, installing both more new solar power and more new hydro power than the rest of the world combined (apart from also producing most of the world's PV installed anywhere else).
* Honourable mention: reducing actual energy visiting - only western Europe is making attempts and massively succeeding at this. Mostly through every efficiency in electrical devices, less wasteful grids and strict building codes. The US is just getting worse every year (as is China, nur still far behind US).

Tl;dr: it all depends what you look at. Imho the most shameful poluter is the US (Australia definitely second on the scale of shame, followed by the Arabs), simply because it's one if the few countries in the world that has the level of development ad wealth that would allow it to improve but instead it's just poluting worse each year, while pointing at China as an excuse. If the same resources as are used to subside shale gas were used to try hydro or wind or even solar (the least cost effective green energy) it could really make an impact, at least balance out the pollution newly generated by countries reading a decent level of development, if not actually help a global reduction and set standards eg for energy efficiency of devices or cars, like the EU does.

Well, okay, so this takes a different bit of thought.

Okay, so the initial wave of colonization of the New World that produced colonies in Greenland was ridiculously successful and encouraged more exploration further and further down the Atlantic coastlines until they reached the Caribbean.

The Erikson Exchange (Columbian Exchange, OTL) brings sheep and goats first to the new world, and maize, and later potatoes to Scandinavia.  With such caloric bounty the Kalmar Union endures, and what we know as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland and Greenland remain as one union.  The Kalmar Union also encompases territories and client states along the Atlantic coast.

Norse treatment of the skrælingjar is different than happened by the Iberians, OTL.  At first the Norse just want to establish their own colonies, and have little desire to interact with the native population.  Eventually trade develops and this is how the Erikson Exchange occurs, slowly and over time via trade, and natural assimilation.

[Skrælingjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skr%C3%A6ling) are still considered lesser people, but probably not subjugated as nearly as thouroughly as by the Conquistadors. 

When the Black Death hits Europe in the mid 1300's there is enough contact with the new world that it moves through New World as well.

Curiously this only increases immigration from the Scandinavian homelands - many families want to get away from villages and towns that they associate with horrific memories of the plague and make a new life across the Atlantic.

So there is still plenty of death for the indigenous peoples of the new world, because they lack immunity to plagues. But they eventually integrate into the greater Scandinavian culture.

Their pantheons get re-interpreted to be extensions of the Norse gods; written language is with Runic characters, and not Roman letters.

Self-determination by the Jews was a response to continuous ethnic cleansing of Jews, and yet Jews offered this same self-determination to Palestinians who supposedly claim that's what they want too. 

I guess Palestinians are racist for not wanting to be occupied??

You mention the 1800s, but you don't know what else was going in then. 


The establishment of Israel never required any ethnic cleansing of land. Jewish immigration in the 1800s attracted Arab populations into the region, increasing their numbers. Previously uninhabitable areas were rebuilt by the Jews and turned into modern cities. Who's land is that? Arabs just because they say so?

Israel's independence offered peace with its  new Arab citizens (and you can hear this independence speech for yourself) who then denied full rights handed to them on a silver platter because Arab neighbours told them to leave and make way for the destruction of Israel from river to sea. Only after that were there 400,000 refugees. So in 1948 you could have had 400,000 more Arab citizens of Israel, plus a never-occupied state of Palestine in both Gaza and West Bank. 
Arabs could have also stopped ethnically cleansing their countries of Jews, but you are FOR that type of ethnic cleansing.


Instead, the Arab countries got greedy, and never allowed citizenship of the Arabs who came to them. Jordan occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank, destroying as much Jewish historical archeology as possible like what ISIS is doing to Christian history in Syria. But you are one of those people who think Syria must be 100% Muslim land too.


The Arab Muslim world had been extremely imperialist and expansionist since the industrial use of oil, and began colonizing Africa and the rest the Middle East, but have fooled people like you into thinking all the land they have conquered was always their home as if it were never conquered by force, and never ethnically cleansed. 

Don't deny yourself history because to those in the know, you come across as what is called ""a useful idiot"". It would probably blow your mind if you knew there was another country in the Middle East that used to have Star of David on its flag. Before that country's ethnic cleansing of Jews that you fully support. I see right through you. ",2,,0,t5_2qh13,1472758744,0,t1_d75elvk,NoveltyName,2,,False,worldnews

The discovery of a living bipedal relative is like, insanely historic and a very serious contribution to anthropology. It's a discovery that is up there with alien life or something. I don't get the sense from this paper that they even understand the intellectual landscape in which they are playing.

For example, the first few pages have photographs of a sasquatch footprint, a shelter, and a still frame from the Erickson Porject video. What the hell? Since there is no way to validate any of this, it's sort of like leading off with a clown nose. Having novel hybrid DNA alone would be massive enough and demonstrating this alone might lead towards the conclusion the DNA was associated with sasquatch, but do you see how this claim is secondary and unnecessary? 

Per the mitochondrial DNA, the haplotypes (mostly T and H) are consistent with modern European women. How do they explain this? The Solutrean Hypothesis. Ugh. This ""hypothesis"" has no serious support and is remains discredited by genetics. So here we have one extraordinary claim being ""supported"" by another. Big mistake.

Also of note, they tested an area of the genome for the sagittal crest in apes and it came back human, not ape. Many other phenotypes for hair color etc. also came back similar to human. When the DNA came back with ""novel"" structure, the conclusion is that this is sasquatch rather than contamination. They did ""pre-contaminate"" human DNA to get a handle on what they think this would do to a sample, but this again relies on transitive logic to accept. Meaning, even though the conditions of the sasquatch DNA we largely unknown (collected under field conditions by non-biologists) they took some human DNA and degraded it and claim therefore to know how the Sasquatch DNA was altered during its degradation. This isn't how it works.

If I have any wish at all it would be that somebody besides Melba was the leader of this project. For all I know there WAS some sasquatch DNA here, but this  project already knew the conclusion it wanted to make and forced this endpoint.

Then, in 1986, they started writing up a series of replays of a Lodoss D&amp;D campaign and publishing them in Comptiq. The popularity of the replays was such that they lead to the creation of the franchise, starting with the first novel (which would come to be considered one of the first light novels ever) and a video game in 1988 and the first RPG source book in 1989. There are now eight video games, various RPG books, radio plays, books on tape, and short stories, in addition to the anime, manga, and light novels. Yutaka Izubuchi's illustrations for Lodoss were also the origin of the Japanese style of elf ears.

(Also, TIL that Lodoss War was one of the first light novels)",2,http://myanimelist.net/profile/rhetz,0,t5_2qh22,1472760692,0,t1_d75twbj,_rhetz_,2,MAL,False,anime
d75unxn,t3_50jl8d,,False,1475242906,"I don't get such feminists that want rape to be a thing that, by definition, is male raping women. I know that it happens both ways. We need better methods to discovering the truth in rape claims, both in the methods of proving it, and making people aware what rape is, and that it should be reported immediately. It's a big issue. There was a case of a known and popular dancer sexually assaulting and raping dozens of women over the course of two decades, but not until last year did he get sentenced, for several reasons, one being that he acted so differently from the dark, violent shape in an alley that many thought rapists were. It's a fucked up system.

I'm from Europe, and the situation is probably different from America. Though there are similarities. I'm also not in a active feminist community (and since there isn't really one society for it, as far as I know) I can't account for all the things certain groups say and do. I disagree with a lot of the feminism on campuses in America (and on the internet, you're American unless stated othewise). Their ''safe spaces'' (kindergartens for teens) are just silly. Their actions towards ''hate spreading'' misogynists are childish too. Disagreeing isn't hate speech. Let's disagree, discuss and find solutions.

A big problem of rape on men is that being ''feminine'' is negative. Throw like a girl, being beaten by a girl (in wrestling etc), doing as a girl says. Being raped by a girl. If we're to fix rape on men, we need to fix that view that women are weaker than men. Sure, women don't get as strong as easily as men, but we're in the 21st century. Being strong is becoming irrelevant in a way. That's a big reason that I'm a feminist.",0,,0,t5_2qhlh,1472760769,0,t1_d75gzm8,arackan,0,,False,Documentaries

I would probably not headline it on turn 1 if I had any of the good US headlines I mentioned, and with most US hands I would rather headline things like Europe/Asia Scoring or Romanian Abdication in order to save ops. 3 ops is a lot to give up for something that provides zero immediate benefit. Ops are at their most precious on turn 1 and it's unlikely you're going to be able to get NORAD set up in time for turn 2. I'd be hesitant to give up the 3 ops on Turn 2 as well. NORAD is a stronger play as an event later in the Early War, especially if Special Relationship and/or Marshall Plan has been played as an event and you're closer to controlling Canada.

Similarly, ops are so precious for the USSR on turn 1--at least in most games--that playing NORAD is often worth it. If NORAD's 3 ops can change the Asian battlegrounds from a 3/3 split to a 4/2 split in your favor, it's probably worth triggering. If I draw the card on turn 2, I more often space it (and I would strongly consider holding it till turn 3 and spacing it then).

Reddit had a HUGE thread about it: https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dwolw/wikileaks_ready_to_drop_a_bombshell_on_russia_but/?

Moscow sent VERY SERIOUS threats to WL and they haven't said a ***SINGLE*** bad word about Russia since then:

http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html

&gt;So far Russia has had no official response. But on Wednesday, an official at the Center for Information Security of the ***FSB, Russia's secret police, gave a warning to WikiLeaks that showed none of the tact of the U.S. reply to the Iraq revelations. ""It's essential to remember that given the will and the relevant orders, [WikiLeaks] can be made inaccessible forever,"" the anonymous official told the independent Russian news website LifeNews.***

Now its been some years since the blood thirster change and it isn't the power house it used to be but in that time Riot agreed that champions shuold be built with meta in mind since everyone is playing that way. 

Follow that up with the ADC change last year and the role is now basically set.

Tl:dr

Bloodthirster needing stacks, Adc doing consistent dps, tower taking, champion killing based champs, late game scale, then meta fixes have made adc the preferred late game dominates to be pretected in the late game.",1,,0,t5_2t9x3,1472762340,0,t3_50o34l,Spanish_Galleon,1,,False,summonerschool

The script for Deadpool just works, and Ryan Reynolds' delivery was consistently spot on. Deadpool also tends to break the 4th wall a lot, so the kind of jokes that work in Deadpool don't work in Ghostbusters.

The funniest parts of Ghostbusters were when the humor derived from the situation, and not when the script tried to artificially insert humor into the movie.  

Leslie Jones trying to nonchalantly walk away while a ghost is perched on her shoulders, getting stopped by two kids to take a selfie? That's funny. Some reviewer (can't remember who) made a great point: Her delivery and that scene is somewhat reminiscent of Bill Murray seeing Slimer for the first time. ""It's right here, Ray. It's *looking* at me"". That humor is derived from the scene, not inserted by the script.

Kate McKinnon dancing around and negligently lighting things on fire with her cutting torches? The receptionist repeatedly not answering the phone? That's not funny because that's not how real people act. Or at least people we're supposed to believe are the protagonists. Egon Spengler was a PhD and a physics professor at Columbia University. Kate McKinnon's character, whatever her name was it's that forgettable, works at some for-profit shithole and the dean can't spell the word science. And yet we're supposed to believe both of them are capable of creating the proton packs? Melissa McCarthy literally tells the rest of the team that a device *she created* is doing something she didn't know it could do...

Ghostbusters struggles the entire time with this kind of thing. It just simply doesn't understand how to be funny, and how to be consistent. A movie can succeed with gross-out, low-brow humor serving as its staple. Plenty have done it. Trey Parker and Matt Stone made careers out of it.

Effective for who though? And how would this matter to an AI/Algorithm moving the maximum amount of mass/people it can?

&gt;I'm trying to explain the science here for you, coming from someone who's been working in this field for a while now.

I still haven't heard a good scientific explanation. I've heard subjective assertions, but nothing quantifiable. For example you've [posted videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/50gyi7/cgp_grey_the_simple_solution_to_traffic/d75lqij) of people diversifying their transportation in Europe. But is that more efficient and better? 

The Drachten Intersection would not work in any major downtown I've been in because there is too much volume. If you took the Drachten Intersection and increased the amount of people, bicycles and automobiles by 5 times what we see in the video, it would be a cluster and efficiency would be lost. 

The pro's and con's of each system are obvious, and I don't feel there is much to be argued. Removing human control from primary infrastructure is far more efficient on every measurable metric there is.

So who are we? **Well..We are the Marauders, an International Multi-Gaming clan.** A clan that is devoted to ensuring that every member is at least decent in whatever game they join us for! We are a mature, fun, friendly, and skilled clan and plan on keeping it this way for the duration of our time as a group. If you are interested in joining a clan, allow me to be the first to welcome you to ours. Rocket League isn't the only game our clan plays on a regular basis. Some other notable games are Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, CSGO, and League of Legends. 

As of right now we have **80+ active members for Rocket League** with rankings from Prospect through Super Champion. We have members who are looking to create teams or to play casual. Many of our teams compete in tournaments such as **ESL, Mock-it, Gfinity and VVV,** so if you are looking to form a team there are many people willing and able. And we have quite a few players that are sponsored, play for professional teams, and coach pro teams as well! We also offer **Coaching** for anyone who is interested! Just let us know what you want to work on in the coaching forums and someone will get with you to help you improve! I can speak from personal experience that the coaching in our clan is some of the best; and it helped me out a ton.

Not sold yet? How about weekly game nights with respective times for EU players and NA players on separate days; where we play the new maps, crazy mods, and (for those legally allowed to drink) drunk tank game nights. 

So if you are looking for a fun community that likes to play both casual and competitive, can help you get better, and just enjoys playing the game like you do then check out the Marauders!

**If you wish to apply**, you can register at our site [HERE](https://www.marauderclan.com/register/?core_pfield_16=Bask3tCase) and apply under the applications page. The Rocket League section can be found under the *""RPG and Misc."" tab.*

Before I finish up this post, feel free to check out this cool little clan montage one of our members created for us!

d75y5a4,t3_50g7lr,,False,1475245372,"Oh, absolutely, I like what he's saying, but he (or his media strategist. Or both) is absolutely terrible at getting across to people who don't already agree with him. He's not even that far left - in most other European countries, he'd just be a centrist - and I think if you told people about many of his policies without saying there they came from, they'd be broadly supportive.

But it feels like there's very little gameplan, and that's what he needs to convince people he can do the job. Now, I think he's been up against it from the start with the media and the PLP, but he's not done himself any favours because he's just not very good at communicating. I very much liked what I heard in his 45 minute interview with Owen Jones - it wasn't perfect, but there were great ideas and it's not like he doesn't have time to work on them - but most voters simply won't invest 45 minutes in listening to a politician talk. I like that Corbyn considers that every issue is important enough to be worth discussing at length, but his desire to debate the hows and wherefores of every single question that gets put to him makes it very hard to pin him down on what he actually wants, and makes it easier for him to be misrepresented. I think he tries to come across as thoughtful, but it ends up being more like 'ambivalent', and that's not an inspiring quality for swing voters to attach to.

And he does have this issue with not being willing to engage with nay-sayers. Now, a lot of MPs have come out and said that they find him impossible to co-operate and negotiate with, and a lot have said that they have always found him extremely open to compromise and debate, so I've no idea what's going on behind their closed doors at all. I don't blame him for being angry at the press, because they really go for the jugular in quite vitriolic ways that they don't seem to extend to far more deserving, shittier politicians, but he just needs to fucking grin and bear it and his inability to do that convincingly is not encouraging.

But I feel like the Labour Party has dug its own grave on this one. Corbyn, and his supporters - and I suppose I'd say I'm broadly a Corbyn supporter, although I don't agree with everything he says and won't vote for Labour simply because FPTP makes it pointless in my area - are symptoms of a serious disenfranchisement and disgust for politics in this country that's been rumbling away for years, and getting worse and worse all the time because most politicians just refuse to acknowledge the possibility that by and large people fucking despise them, so they keep on abusing their positions and voting themselves pay rises and cutting public services while telling us we're all in it together.

Corbyn may well be the man who fails to win the GE in 2020, but if you want to know the reasons why Labour is going to lose it, I think you've got to go back to the Iraq War, and the 2008 financial crash, and then Ed Miliband and his Party's complete and total failure to give any kind of consistent message of what they were actually standing for.

I think the Tories are appalling and their failings are catastrophic, but they're just so much better-organised about it than Labour has been for the past 10 years or so.",1,,0,t5_2qhqb,1472765563,0,t1_d75xe27,YouHaveAWomansMouth,1,,False,unitedkingdom

China is the number 1 economy by purchasing power.
China is the number 1 economy by productivity and manufactured product
China is the fastest growing economy by consumption in 4th or 5th (depending on how you count EU) and poised to surpass the US by 2030 (at the earliest 2025).

If you take China's GDP growth from 2007 (~10%) and assume a downward trend to today (7.7%) China will still be growing at a staggering 4+% per year by the time they over take the US as the largest consumer market in the world.

Its not even a contest. China is currently surpassing the US in economic power...which we all know also translates into Military Power as well.

I didn't say that, go back to my comments and read again.

&gt;You're going to evolve in your own little meta

Hu, it's not because you denied one scrim against a team to play another team once more that you will evolve in your own little meta, it's not like Splyce has done that since week 1.

&gt; typical 10 times in a single day

This is bullshit, Jarge(ex FNC and TSM coach) said that when you scrim (especially in EU), you just take a big block with another team and you don't scrim with more than one team/day. 


&gt;Splyce would rather face FNC and FNC wants to beat UOL so let's give them only 1.5 days notice that we're both cancelling our scrims with them 2 days before the tournament hehexd.

There is no other teams to scrim with so like YC said, give them 1.5 days notice or 10 weeks notice, that wouldn't have change anything.

&gt;Like I was saying somewhere in this thread, this is either laziness on the part of Splyce/FNC to set up a more complicated scrim schedule to stick to their word

If you are Splyce and FNC, you have 2 options: 1) Do a fair scrim time for everyone but you will loose time when you aren't scrimming, when you are ""spectator"". 2) Have 100% time of scrimming and this means: FNCvsSPL, FNCvsSPL, FNCvsSPL instead of FNCvsSPL, FNCvsUOL, UOLvsSPL. Your objective is to make world and not to make friends so why would you waste time and not scrim just to give a fair scrim time for everyone. It's business, if the only cost to have more chance to go to world is not sticking our word, why the fuck would you stick your word?

I would like to see a system where if a player is not doing well they get demoted from the ""varsity"" team and have to work their way back up from the ""junior"" team.

At the moment it is just far too risky to be a pro gamer in the west. Only the top % make it. And the second tier players never get the chance to join the best, simply because of financial reasons.

To be fair, Korean teams can do stuff like this because they are backed by big corporations with a lot more sponsor pull. And they redistribute sponsorship money, not just free mouses and gear, back to the players.

There is absolutely nothing - nada - ex post facto revisionism in EU law on illegal state aid; it's one of the cornerstone rules of the single market.

There is nothing novel or ex post facto in acknowledging that it is not legal for a member state of the single market to give special tax breaks to a single company.
