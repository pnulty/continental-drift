Well, they do get a cut of the prize pool so... Yeah, we kind of do that already pal.

And semis do matter. If you want to go off victories alone, NA hasn't won shit besides IEM (who literally no one cares about or sends their best teams - sometimes the fans even choose the teams, clearly a serious environment eh?) whereas KR has won MANY worlds, All-Stars (back when it was MSI), and now MSI.

Not really, it is already proven by your link, thank you very much, different cultures integrate differently. So its not false.

&gt;So, you quote a sidebar that lists exactly 5 nations from Asia, and you think that proves something about Asians as a whole?

So you met one refugee (laotian) and think that its the same for the whole refugees issues as a whole?

&gt;Hypothetically, what do you think would be the reaction if you stereotyped an English person, based on statistics from Germany, Ukraine, Norway, Greece, and Ireland? Do you think they'd be particularly happy with being treated as if they are a monolithic group? Asians don't like being stereotyped like that any more than Europeans would.

Nice strawman, 

1. no one stereotyping asian. This is stereotyping asians: all asians are backward thinking, have slint eyes, bad driver.

2. I'm mentioning vietnamese or laotian as specific examples, you can see for the statistics that different ASIAN countries integrate differently but ASIAN countries in general integrate better. But of course you wont believe facts, that you provided yourself, that doesnt build up your point.

&gt;Even if that were true, it would do nothing to legitimize their claim.

What do you mean? I'm pretty sure the fact that all of civilization and the entire human species all over the world went in the same direction pretty much legitimized modern society. 

&gt;This doesn't mean anything;

Of course it does. You weren't at personally at the dawn of civilization if you approve of civilization and therefore it's illegitimate to you. 

&gt;legitimacy is when (most) everyone agrees that something is the case, be it property rights, borders, a contract, etc. Everyone agrees that you exist.

That's literally not how it works on any level. You just made up your own definition.  Hahaha. You, didn't agree to be born and by your own definition this makes your life illegitimate.

We already have. It's called modern civilization. Specifically, America.

If you'd like to go develop your own shit hole where no one does, you're free to do that. 

We've already decided as a species that we would prefer to have recourse than live at the mercy of the rich and powerful.

The fact that you long for a plebs way of life is weird though. 

&gt;I don't. I love all people :)

Then why does your society literally feudalism with less protections than even that offers? Hahah 

Fuck, at least with feudalism you could address your problems to your lords. Here, you are absolutely fucked in everyway. 

&gt;The rich can *at most* subjugate only all the people that are already under the thumb of the State (or de-facto private State). If you don't like it, start a worker's revolution.

We already did silly. Why do you think we have the system we have today?

Cause we had a workers revolution. Hahaha this is hilarious. You've already lost.

Remember the industrial age? Of course you dont. 

You lost. Lol

I just find it funny how easy it would be to commit voter fraud and the standard come back from leftists does not make sense because how can we know that there is fraud when we are not checking for it nor can we legally.

I don't disagree.  The problem isn't that voter ID and anti-fraud measures are inherently wrong, but that Republican politicians aren't actually interested in any of that.  It's simply a means to suppress voting populations that disfavor them.

Which is the basic point I was getting at.  Cynically selling the public on policies under the guise of an otherwise reasonable desire (preventing voter fraud, preventing gun violence) despite knowing that the specific policies they advance have absolutely nothing to do with the stated goal.

Likewise his whole idea of ""bullet labeling"" is completely useless for solving gun crimes, an otherwise laudable goal, and major gun control organizations have to know that. They just don't care, because that's not the point.  The point is to make legal gun ownership and use as expensive and restrictive as they can, because they fundamentally disagree with the notion of gun rights.

Sure you can argue that's still ultimately in service of the goal of ""reducing gun violence"", but at least be up front about what your goals actually are.

* Tagore was one of the first to support and bring together different forms of arts at Santiniketan.

* Shal Bithi,a mud path lined with a row of Shal trees, was the favourite walking route of Tagore at Santiniketan.

I spend a LOT of time in the field looking for the big dude, and have been doing so for over 20 years... Still, I have to concede that the objective verifiable evidence is tragically thin. Eyewitness accounts are evidence, yes, but unfortunately a very weak form of it. It's the kind of evidence that points where to look for further confirmation. It can't confirm on its own however.

I think Meldrum is not the sharpest tack in the bag, and I feel he argues from a position of almost child-like wanting to believe. To me this colors his work with a bias. I disagree, for example, on the PGF and the Freeman evidence. I think it is crap. I mean, there is an eyewitness account video posted TODAY on this sub that I find more compelling than the PGF. Sightings are the best evidence we have in my opinion. Many of them seem legit.

But still not enough... We need a verifiable DNA sample. Melba's work by the way, concluded that human female DNA is one half of the sasquatch genome. And not only that, the primary haplogroups are European. Now, if this hybrid species was something that evolved in North America, wouldn't the haplogroups be those associated with Native Americans? How does one argue this female human + male squatch thing without getting into some kind of problem around speciation and genetic distance? The depictions of sasquatch, if we are to believe them, describe an animal that withstands extremes of temperature without fire, is massive, hairy, and is at least as different from us as the apes. The better explanation is the samples were tainted by modern American females of Eurasian origin.

Her paper makes almost no sense and lends with a conclusion it cannot support. The idea that scientists wouldn't jump for joy to find another extant hominin species is ridiculous to me - they would love it. And thankfully Sykes and Disotell are open minded enough to test samples for us. But so far, nada.

KR top laners apparently love to play GP (like Rumble) and so most of them have it in their pool when it's meta and can dominate. If you have a top laner who can play GP at a high level, he's an extremely powerful power pick at high elo (60% win rate in KR Master+ Solo Queue, the 2nd best top laner behind Jax in pro play Summer with a 57.3% win rate). Any teams with good GP players should practice comps using him effectively. Only 5/18 LCK/LPL top laners have losing records on GP.

LCK had 4 top laners with 6+ GP games, EU LCS had 1 - Expect (who's KR). 

LCK had 7 top laners with 4+ GP games, EU LCS had 3 - Odo/Soaz + Expect. If you go down to 3+ games, you can add Parang (KR) and Ssumday.

Using the 3+ GP, only 2 EU players can use GP top lane (Soaz/Odo) while 10 KR top laners have him in their pool. Kikis/Vici have used GP, but are both 0-2 on GP, which explains the lack of GP priority in EU LCS.

Not that it matters since he's nerfed into the ground now and won't see Worlds.

So many people in this thread saying "" well metroid never sells in japan"" and patting themselves on the back like they solved the case. That's so simpleminded and basic.

it couldn't have anything to do with the fact that there was absolutely 0 advertising or promotion for this game outside of the few videos on the 任天堂公式チャンネル (youtube channel). No way that the people who i talk to, and kids i know, who always flip out over the newest games, literally had no idea that this existed. I went to stores that normally have huge displays for this and absolutely no, advertising at all. I just wanted to check the price and that leads me to...

2) Theres no way that this has to do with the fact that it released later here in japan than in america (august 25th?). It couldn't be that people who were interested in the game, would see reviews in america or europe and decide to avoid a purchase. Especially when a new 3ds game will run you 50$ here (like what was mentioned in that region locking thread, games are more expensive in asia). Perhaps people would watch videos on youtube and think the game stinks,

3) it deffinitely couldn't do with the fact that the videos promoting the game were awkward and clunky. The voice acting, the demeanor, like they were talking to children, the awkward atmosphere that was built around a life or death fight against monsters. It was all very strange and offputting

4) It 100%  could NOT have anything to do with this game just not looking great in the first place. Not graphically, but did you rush outside of your house at 8 am, line up for 3 hours to buy this game? do you even own it? 

anyways it couldn't have anything to do with all that. Its just that japan hates metroid, and it never sells over there. Yeah thats gotta be it. And fps games, eeeew.

anyways i look forward to buying this on sale for 10$ next month.

The European Commission decided that Dublin’s application of Irish tax law to an American company violated European antitrust rules. Orwell would understand.

At issue is how Ireland has taxed global companies with Irish subsidiaries. Apple in the 1980s established two business units in Cork to manage global sales. These units held the rights to much of Apple’s intellectual property such as product designs. In payment for those licenses, the units remitted large portions of their profits to the U.S. each year to fund research at Apple headquarters.

The rest of those profits generally weren’t taxed under longstanding Irish law, since the money was earned overseas. The money wasn’t taxable elsewhere since the laws of other countries held that it was up to Ireland to decide whether and how much to tax it. In the case of America, the tax was deferred until Apple repatriated the profits. That’s it. That’s the supposed tax evasion. Apple paid all the taxes it owed under existing tax laws around the world, which is why it hasn’t been subject to enforcement proceedings by revenue authorities.

Then again, this case isn’t about tax law. It’s about tax politics, and in particular the bureaucratic and left-wing frustration that low-tax governments are using normal accounting principles to deny high-tax governments more revenue booty.

Ireland has stood firm for years against continental pressure to abandon its competitive 12.5% corporate-tax rate. So having lost the debate over tax rates, Brussels now wants to use antitrust law to tell Ireland and other low-tax countries how to apply their own tax laws. In this case it is forcing Dublin to collect €13 billion in revenue and interest that the Irish government never wanted.

The tell here is the legal pretzel into which Brussels is wrapping itself to make these cases. Since these arrangements are legal under national laws and widely implemented accounting standards, Brussels is deploying its antitrust gnomes to claim that taxes that are “too low” are an illegal subsidy under EU state-aid rules.

Brussels points to correspondence between Irish tax officials and Apple executives to claim that Apple enjoyed favors not available to other companies, which would be tantamount to a subsidy. But all Apple received from Dublin, in 1991 and 2007, were letters confirming how the tax authorities would treat various transactions under the Irish laws that applied to everyone. If anyone in Brussels knew more about tax law, they’d realize such “comfort letters” are common practice around the world.

Inconvenient facts aside, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager still thinks she has a political winner that plays well with anti-American and anticorporate Europeans. She’s pursuing a growing number of these spurious antitrust tax cases, mainly against U.S. companies.

Yet the biggest victims will be Europeans. Brussels knew about these tax arrangements for years and never complained until the public mood turned. How safe is any business if entirely legal behavior can be subjected to retroactive antitrust enforcement a decade after the fact? Ms. Vestager is turning the EU into a banana republic on high-speed rail.

She is also doing her best to vindicate the British decision to leave the EU. This case is a prime example of why so many European economies can’t seem to grow: a deadly combination of high taxes, legal uncertainties and political grandstanding. One immediate opportunity is for Britain to pursue the corporate-tax-rate cuts proposed by former Chancellor George Osborne, which would turn Britain into a 15% tax-rate mecca immune from Brussels’s antitrust shenanigans.

As for the U.S., the Treasury Department pushed back against these tax cases, which it rightly views as a protectionist threat to the rule of law. But it’s hard to believe that Brussels would have pulled this stunt if Treasury enjoyed the global respect it once did. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have also contributed to the antibusiness political mood by assailing American companies for moving to low-tax countries.

The EU panjandrums may think they can roll Messrs. Lew and Obama, but they should be wary of feeding Donald Trump’s nationalist, antitrade narrative. His impulse will spread if Americans see more U.S. companies subjected to this kind of tax sandbagging. A transatlantic trade deal could be one casualty, but European companies could easily become political targets in the U.S.

Dublin and Apple say they’ll appeal the Commission’s ruling, and we hope they succeed. Otherwise Apple’s outrageous European tax bill could become everyone’s low-investment, slow-growth problem.",,False,1475223613,t3_50lo2w,d751zxd

And once upon a time, had a friend of the family that was Swedish and they had 'em with real Lingonberry sauce.  ...But, the reality is my visits to the IKEA food court have left me a big disappointed in the quality of (not sure, but guessing), either the meat used, or the Lingon sauce they have, or both.

So, here's a bunch of recipes for us to discuss.  I'd like to suggest that there should be three main goals here:  (A.)  What, exactly, makes them ""Swedish"" meatballs?  (B.)  Can we either reduce the pork/beef ratio or otherwise make them at least moderately healthier so as to enjoy them more often?  And (C.)  How to get Lingonberry sauce that has a more authentic flavor and/or no fructose, etc.?

*  [Food Network / Alton Brown] (http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/swedish-meatballs-recipe.html)  ...He suggests baking &amp; sautee-ing them to improve flavor.  ...Notice that he has allspice &amp; nutmeg in the meatballs, and heavy cream in the sauce.

*  [The Kitchn.com](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-classic-swedish-meatballs-with-sour-cream-gravy-231595)  ...They again recommend a 1:1 ratio of Beef to Pork.  Suggest white pepper, allspice, &amp; nutmeg.  But, suggest sour cream vs. heavy cream for the gravy.  ...They note that choice of sautee vs. bake is determined by size of the meatballs.  Smaller is Ok to sautee to cook through.

*  (Serious Eats)[http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/how-to-make-the-best-swedish-meatballs.html]  ...Here they recommend a 2:1 Beef to Pork ratio to make more solid/springy meatballs (better to spear with toothpick).  They say the Swedish official website lists allspice &amp; nutmeg as the standard spices.  Also, recommend frying them for better overall even-browning.  Lastly, they note that, after testing, including regular, white bread gave best texture vs. breadcrumbs, etc.

*  [Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/swedish-meatballs-367157)  ...They note allspice &amp; nutmeg.  Recommend sour cream for gravy.

*  [SkinnyTaste](http://www.skinnytaste.com/swedish-meatballs/)
This one uses 93% lean beef only, no pork.  Add garlic to allspice &amp; nutmeg.  Uses cottage cheese vs. cream (not sure of effect of that).

*  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatball#Europe) Shows meatball recipes from all over.  They note that typical seasonings are white pepper &amp; allspice 

*  [Scandinavian Cooking](http://scandinaviancooking.com/articles/swedish_meatballs.htm)  They suggest that either white pepper or black pepper can be used.  ...Also, alternate spices can include dry mustard, parsley, or even dill in the gravy.  ...Preference again here for sour cream.

*  [Saveur Daily](http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Swedish-Meatballs)  Note here that red currant preserves can be swapped for lingonberry preserves since similar tartness.

*  [Mark's Daily Apple](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/swedish-meatballs/#axzz4IyZ9npU6)  Again notes that allspice &amp; nutmeg are subtle, but give a particular flavor.  Recommends heavy cream.

...Well folks, this looks like enough for now.  I'd like to suggest going with the 2:1 ratio of beef to pork (or more), and trying to get it at least a little leaner, using the allspice, nutmeg, and black pepper (white pepper, if you have it), remember that regular bread &amp; milk seems to beat breadcrumbs, use 1 egg / lb. of meat to help bind, use about 1/2 to 1 small onion / lb. in the mix, if possible try to sautee or fry the meatballs in about a 1-2"" diameter (smaller = more traditional), and lastly, use either heavy cream or sour cream for the gravy.

I am a pretty spot-on 48 in recent-season Rick (which, for Rick, is an S because of [his weird EU sizing conversion](https://www.rickowens.eu/en/US/products/ru14s1762lg-09) where 48=S, not M), though I need to take a 50 in some of his heavier leathers sometimes (and in most clothes, I fit a 46 in the chest and a 48 in the shoulders). I find that current-season Rick jackets fit true to the letter size...that is, my size 48 Rick jackets fit like an S in most other designers. My Crust jacket is an S, and it fits similarly to a recent-season Rick 50, certainly larger than a 48. So, from that experience alone, albeit with a different leather, I would guess an XS leather from Crust would fit similarly to a current-season Rick 48, maybe a bit smaller...or, in other words, equal to or a bit smaller than an S from most other designers.  
  
FWIW, I can fit into Rick jackets that are almost a full inch smaller in the shoulders than most other designers because of the wide armholes and underarm gussets...on mine, the shoulder seams sit a little further in than my shoulder joint. I also usually look for 43cm across the shoulders in most leathers, but I've gotten away with Rick jackets as small as 16.5 inches across the shoulders.

* UK's position in the context of the WTO reference framework in the event of a Brexit is far from clear (see [here]( http://www.ictsd.org/opinion/nothing-simple-about-uk-regaining-wto-status-post-brexit))

* What you call WTO rules as if they were a set of default rules that can be applied in the event of everything else failing does not correspond to anything like reality

* The UK currently imports and exports to EU countries under a set of very favourable conditions (ie, the Single Market). Any FTA will contemplate worse conditions (otherwise there would be no point in being a member of the EU). As such, the UK's export producers will have to adapt to less profitable conditions, something which will certainly depress (to an unknown extent) trade for UK-produced goods

* Finally, two words: ""services"" and ""passporting"". The former relates to the bulk of the UK's exports, which are not covered to any meaningful extent under the mythical WTO rules that you refer to, the latter refering to something that is essential to the continued viability of the firms that account for circa 10% of the UK's (current) GDP, and which most certainly is not included in the ""WTO rules"" or even in any conceivable FTA that does not include Freedom of Movement.

Big companies like that in poland know that they can't get anymore state help without firing off EU law. Getting sweet deal with Irish goverment that can't be given to any other company is literally state help.

In EU if you give state help it needs to be strictly connected to certain aspects of company. Like loan for investing purpose.

If i have multibilion company and i would make a deal with state so that he will give me money to pay my debts or just for next 3-4 year to have money to pay people. EU would do exactly like in Irish case and would make me give back money to goverment citing illegal state help.

Ireland won't get any more than (25% x €30k) x 7,000 in taxes out of these jobs. That's $52.5M per year.

Now compare that to the 12.5% x $50bn of net profit that Apple should pay each year, i.e around $5bn.

Hi, /u/baskets101, I am a medical student, so I hope that you take this response as seriously as I am. Please, please go to your nearest Emergency Department at your local hospital. This is nothing to be ashamed of, we see it every day of every week of every month of every year... we will do whatever is in our power to help. Do not worry about the costs if you don't have insurance, that is less important.

You are not a horrible person, by any means.

If you cannot go to your local Emergency Department, please call one of the sources below, depending on where you live.

Otherwise... I am here to talk.

He put up 8 points in 20 minutes in the Euroleague, which is pretty good for a 20 year old kid off the bench. Plus he shoots 38-40% from 3pt. 

We could have a Turkish lineup with Osman/Ilyasova/Kanter. 

The problem is that I think Cleveland actually values him relatively highly and a recent article I read quoted Giannis saying that he's gonna be a great player, since he has played with him in Europe.

Since we're just throwing out ideas, I thought I'd try. Don't worry what some people think on an online forum lol, keep doing you 

Edit: I think the negative response might be because the thread is about trading Kanter. I also think Kanter needs to stay on this team.

Vreau sa arunc cu cacat in oamenii astia, dar nu cacat uman, cacat de elefant pe dulcolax. 
Romanii se descurca, de la inceputul istoriei, romanul ciupeste de unde poate, mai face un ciubuc, mai fura din fabrica, mai gaseste un portofel pe jos si il da inapoi gol, mai gaseste un 3310 pe jos si se bucura ca de o mana cereasca. 

Nu conteaza foarte mult sa ai caracter si coloana vertebrala in ziua de azi, cu cat mai gelatinoasa coloana vertebrala, cu atat esti mai ""Descurcaret"" sa te invidieze tot caminul de nefamilisti.

Iar, inainte sa imi spui ca ""saracia"" or whatever, bunicii mei, ce au trait toata viata lor la tara in zona Moldovei, si au trecut printr-un razboi mondial si o mare foamete, aveau coloana vertebrala cand venea vorba de astfel de situatii. Saracia, foamea nu sunt scuze, sunt pretexte. Vrei mai mult, munceste.

Ma indoiesc, sincer, ca bucatareasa de acolo ia 1000 lei pe luna, iar in alte parti se plateste de la 3000 lei in sus, ca sa poata spune ca sufera de foame si trebuie sa fure din mancarea pacientilor.

NU FURI MANCAREA PACIENTILOR, IN CONDITIILE IN CARE ALOCATIA DE HRANA ESTE DE 7 LEI PE ZI PENTRU 3 MESE PE ZI PER PACIENT. 

Eu, personal, le-as rupe mainile, iar apoi i-as da afara, si raporta la politie pentru furt. 
In 90% din situatii, chestiile astea se ascund sub covor, sa nu iasa scandal, furi din firma, te dam afara si punem batista pe tambal. NU! Ai furat, puscarie. Mai ales cand furi de la bolnavi. Una din marile companii de subansamble automotive din Brasov avea problema cu angajatii care furau nimicuri de prin fabrica, pana la urma, de inteles, poate aveau nevoie de rulmenti, tacheti, garnituri, prin casa. Au dat afara 10-15 oameni, i-au reclamat pentru furt, s-a facut dosar penal, nu s-a renuntat la plangere doar pentru ca aia au inceput sa se milogeasca in genunchi pe la poarta fabricii, si brusc, ca prin magie, n-au mai furat restul de 2000 muncitor, toate cacaturile pe care le puteau mota in cotetul gainilor.

1: keep fighting islamic terrorists abroad after settling the disastrous situation within its borders (Dagestan, Chechnya). Pacifying and stablising the Caucasus and the 'Stans in general is a top priority for Russia and China. Iran and maybe Turkey seem to be slowly coming around to play along instead of advancing their solipsist regional foreign policy. Turkey should be sitting in the east whilst extending a hand to the the west. It's still early days to see if this is what the Erdogan regime is aiming at and if it will succeed.

2: keep Assad in power as a consistently loyal ally in a fractious region. Syria has been THE market of the world when the silk road was still a thing. The economic rise of China and India will require peace in the region for millenarian trade to resume. Why should these economies leave protection of world trade under the security whims of the only naval superpower?

3: bridge an land arc spanning Arabian Sea to the Mediterranean for economic development and goods transport that relies on the Russian security umbrella.

In short, there are strong economic incentives for the big economies (China, Russia, India, Germany) to exert effort and pacify the region. The US less so because its economy is built on sea trade and it finds a land based asian economic corridor threatening. If anything the most baffling and counterproductive actions seem to be coming from Europe. I have only distaste for the likes of Merkel. She's little more than a Manchurian Candidate of US foreign policy.

Really? You're linking me to a post? No evidence or nothing whatsoever. Only some random dude posting some accusations based on assumptions.

TAK was created because of party members that disagreed With PKK's policy changes 20 years ago, of it deciding to direct its attacks mainly on security forces. They (PKK and TAK) are not the same. Quit making up lies. 

&gt;1 so called ypg terrorist captured wears an uniform with pacth ""Rêber Apo"" and portrait of PKK leader Öcalan

""Terrorist"", yeah, like the terrorist state of Turkey?

The fact that they have Pictures of Ocalan says nothing. Ocalan si a prominent figure among YPG, as they follow his poltical ideals. That still does not make PKK and YPG the same thing. 

&gt;From Wiki: ""A few days later on 17 March 2016, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) claimed responsibility. The group had already claimed the previous Ankara bombing in February.""

Again, not PKK.

&gt;Of course they will be arrested if they are traitor or terror linked.

You gotta be extremely stupid and naive to believe that all those jailed journalists and dissidents are jailed because they are ""traitors"" or linked With terrorism. Maybe it's about time you read the reports given by organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, etc. about this very thing.

What did Can Dundar do, besides revealing that Turkish Intelligence was supplying islamic rebels weapons? What about the guy who compared Erdogan to Gollum? How come he was convicted. What about Mehmet Çetinkaya, a poet, convicted of ""insulting Erdogan""? 

The fact of the matter is that any form of dissidence against the government is cracked down upon, and newspapers are taken down or journalists jailed for made-up reasons like ""propaganda for terrorists"", ""spying"", ""incitement of violence"" and all other made-up lies and bullshit. 

As the Wikipedia page says i:

&gt;The legal framework on organised crime and terrorism is still imprecise and contains definitions which are open to abuse, leading to numerous indictments and convictions. Moreover, its interpretation by prosecutors and courts is uneven and is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights or the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, according to the European Commission. No clear distinction is made between the incitement to violence and the expression of nonviolent ideas.


There are 3 types of journalists targeted in Turkey:

1) investigative and critical reporters (victims of the anti-state prosecutions) : The government’s broad inquiry into the Ergenekon plot ensnared investigative reporters, where the government punished critical reporters.

2) Kurdish journalists : Turkish authorities call any support for the Kurdish cause with terrorism itself. When it comes to Kurdish journalists, newsgathering activities such as fielding tips, covering protests, and conducting interviews are ""evidence of a crime"" according to the Turkish state.


3) The authorities are waging one of the world’s biggest anti-press campaigns in recent history. Dozens of writers and editors are in prison, nearly all on terrorism or other anti-state charges.

Concerning to teachers:

* Teachers in primary/junior school aren't very good on maths, but they teach it.
* Secondary/high school teachers did a degree on something -Spanish, Philosophy, Maths, ...- so if they don't find a job in their field they become teachers. Well, many of them set the teaching career path from the beginning, but others don't and end up to schools. I find English teachers were the most involved ones in my opinion.
* If a teacher is bad, you have to ask for an inspector that comes to class to check it, *in front of the teacher*. So he/she suddenly improves his/her classes and ""everything's right"".
* College teachers share the same defects with their school counterparts. They don't update their knowledge. When I saw some *basic* errors from them, I just wanted to get them expelled and not being paid with my taxes. My sister had to study a Master's degree because of this.
* Vocational schools are on the same *system* along with high school teachers. They make a little more effort in updating, but they should improve much more as well.

Other factors:

* As some people have already told here, the level is up to the lowest achievers. Here in Spain we evaluate from 0 to 10, 5/10 as pass, while in most countries is 6/10.
* In every autonomous community -region-, there's a different curricula. So you can study way much better in Cantabria than in Andalusia.

Consequences:

* 23.5% of dropouts from school by 2014, the highest of all Europe.
* Students *vomit* the information, instead of *actually understanding it*. That's how there's a 80% of dropouts in some Engineering degrees, and loads of people joining Journalism.
* Not any Spanish university in the top rankings. *But very good business schools.*

I do agree we have very much went for a facelift and image change. I don´t think its that bad as we are still thought of as a Baltic region and what benefits one of us will benefit everyone in the long run.

Still as a market Latvia/Lithuania have an edge as they have larger populations. Also Estonia is slowly becoming too expensive so the competitive edge of a cheap Eastern European country is already somewhat lost. For example minimum wage increased to 430Eur in 2016 and in 2017 it is set to be 470Eur. Latvia will probably stick with 370 Eur but it gives a competitive edge as there are plenty of minimum wage workers at least in Estonia.

First off I'm going to assume your friend is in the USA (I'm not, getting guns and parts in Europe is a bitch anyway).

In an AR15, the lower is the part that requires a serial number, and legally constitutes a ""gun"" (any other part : barrel, trigger groups, stocks... are just considered everyday items you could buy from anyone without restrictions). Magazines could be the only exception (but not because of any ATF rule, more like state level laws against ""high capacities"" in some places).

So buy an 80% lower. It's the lower from a gun that is not totally machined yet but is missing very little work (drilling a few holes) to be a functional ""gun"". No serial number, no registration... An 80% lower is basically a piece of metal as far as the law is concerned.

Of course to get a whole gun one would have to buy all the other parts I spoke of before, which are available anywhere without restriction, or any need for registration.

[Check this video on how finishing an 80% lower can be quick and easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccO1Day60sA). The tools, skill, and effort needed are probably way lower than what you'd need to properly scrape serials off a finished gun.

Add to that no legal risk from owning all the parts needed to make a serial number free gun. The only legal issue arise if someone wanted to sell it, or build a gun in a way that is forbidden by one's own state's laws or the BATF. But since you were already asking about something that's a felony, I think your friend wouldn't care much if their gun build was not totally legal in the first place.",,False,1475226887,t3_4ya6ab,d7573l3

Ich gebe zu bei dem Thema voreingenommen zu sein. Habe als Kind 4 Jahre im Jemen verbracht. Mein Vater hat in der Entwicklungshilfe grearbeitet. Bereich Agrarwirtschaft. Meine Grundeinstellung ist eben eine für globale Solidqarität. Nationalismus lehne ich ab. Deshalb sehe ich es mit dem ""wir zuerst"" nicht so eng. Uns geht es als Gesellschaft einfach so viel besser als den meisten anderen. Ich bewerte die Ernährung und Sicherheit, also das pure Überleben von Menschen in ärmeren Ländern einfach höher als die Frage, ob die vergleichsweise winzige Unterschicht bei uns ein paar € im Monat mehr oder weniger hat. Ist eine Grundeinstellung, die sich nicht so einfach ändern wird. Und das Ziel dürfte dir ja eigentlich gefallen: Geht es den Leuten in ihren eigenen Ländern besser, tendieren sie weniger dazu zu uns zu kommen. Ob man das nun zu ihrem oder unseren Wohl macht ist unerheblich. Der Effekt ist der gleiche.

&gt; Die Ärmsten dürfen es zahlen, Solidarität ist was für Innenpolitik.

Sehe ich nicht so. Ich zahle ordentlich Steuern, von denen vor allem die ärmsten bei uns profitieren. Das ist auch gut so. Aber wenn ich als Steuerzahler und Wähler auch nur minimal darauf hinwirken kann, dass Menschen anderswo geholfen wird, tue ich das. Aus Überzeugung. Ich zahle Steuern. Ich gehe wählen. So wie die meisten. Und das Ergebnis sehen wir gerade. Ob sich das bei der nächsten Wahl ändert bleibt abzuwarten. Es wird spannend.

ABER ich muss hier auch ganz klar anmerken, dass ich noch nie CDU gewählt habe. Ich mag die Merkel nicht besonders. Ihrem eingeschlagenen Weg was die Flüchtlinge angeht, also die Strategie, dem großen Ziel, stimme ich zu. Finde aber natürlich das da operativ einiges zu wünschen übrig lässt. Bleibe aber optimistisch. Und fakt ist, dass die Partei, die ich gewählt habe schon viel früher, viel mehr getan hätte, um der Krise entgegenzuwirken. So lautete zumindest das Versprechen. Bin ja nicht naiv.

&gt; Bring mir eine finanzielle Gleichstellung von Investment und Arbeitseinkommen, von Zeitarbeitern und Tarifern, höhere Steuern für Vermögen und Konzerne, eine Steuerfinanzierung von Sozialbeiträgen und wir können reden. Aber erst wenn das Geld in der Kasse ist.

Da sind wir uns wohl einig. Aber diese Lösung suchen weder CDU noch AfD. Deshalb finde ich es schlecht, dass viele den populistischen und teilweise unumsetzbaren Forderungen was die Flüchtlingskrise angeht folgen, ohne sich darüber im Klaren zu sein, wie das Wahlprogramm im Detail oder sogar grob aussieht.

&gt; Ich kenne die negativen Effekten der Globalisierung auf meine eigenen Leute, damit weiss ich alles was ich wissen muss.

Schade. denn genau dieses Problem hat uns hier hingeführt. Denn wenn die Leute in ihrer Heimat keine Chance sehen, brechen sie eben in schönere Gefilde auf. Ob das nun rechtlich in Ordnung ist macht für die keinen Unterschied. Da gehts ums überleben. 

Kleines verrücktes Beispiel: Hier wollen die meisten nur Hähnchenbrust, Flügel und Keule essen. Innereien und Füße schiffen wir Containerweise nach Ghana. Für uns Abfall, für die Menschen dort Nahrung. Das kommt bei denen so günstig an, dass der heimische Geflügelmarkt mit Dumpingpreisen dagegenhält. Die Leute werden arm, hungern und leiden. Weil wir Abfall im Container über die Weltmeere schicken. Ist doch wahnsinn.

Weiterer Denkansatz:  

1 Kilo mehl von Ja! kostet bei uns 20 cent. Fallen uns 20 cent in den Gulli bleiben wir nicht mal stehen. Kurzes schulterzucken uns weiter gehts.

In Indien kostet das gleiche Kilo Mehl, so viel wie mancher Tagelöhner an einem Tag harter Arbeit verdient. Nicht weil sie arm sind und schlecht wortschaften. Sondern weil der Westen mit Getreide spekuliert und die Bauern in Indien lieber an uns exportieren, als es ihren eigenen Leuten zu vernünftigen Preisen zu verkaufen. Auch das: Wahnsinn.

Über sowas denke ich nach. Das beschäftigt mich. Deshalb mache ich mir über unsere ""armen"" im Vergleich weniger Sorgen.

&gt; Ich hab keine Illusionen über die AfD. Es ist ein asozialer Haufen. Das ich trotzdem ernsthaft erwäge mir die Nase zuzuhalten und die zu wählen, nur um CDU/SPD/Grünen zu zeigen, dass es so nicht weitergehen kann, sollte dir sagen wir angepisst ich bin. 

Und genau das macht mir Angst. Wenn relativ vernünftige Menschen, mit denen man sich (1-2 Ausfälle mal ignoriert, ist ein emotionales Thema) einigermaßen über sowas unterhalten kann, das erwägen. 

Auch ich bin mehr als leicht frustriert. Ich habe bisher nie am Rand gewählt. Aber egal was kommt, nach Rechts kann ich und werde ich aus Überzeigung niemals abweichen. 

Warum nicht in die andere Richtung? Habe ich bisher nie gemacht. Aber Frustration mit der Mitte könnte man so auch zum Ausdruck bringen. Und wenn ich mir beiden Seiten ansehe, ist Links für mich eindeutig das kleinere Übel. Ganz pragmatisch betrachtet:

**Rechts:**

Die Forderungen was Flüchtlinge angeht, sind zum Großteil nicht umzusetzen. Niemand wird mit denen Koalieren (hoffentlich). Ist eh zu spät. Die Leute sind hier. Schnellere Abschiebungen sind in Arbeit. Das wird auch die AfD nicht beschleunigen.

Steurn für Reiche sollen gesenkt werden! Da wird ein großes Loch an einnahmen vorhergesagt. Soziale Gerechtigkeit, die uns beiden wichtig erscheint, wird so nicht entstehen. Sich der EU abzuwenden habaen die Briten gerade versucht. Sind so gut wie gescheitert. Auch das wird bei uns niemals passieren.

Restliches Wahlprogramm haben die zu großen Teilen in der Mitte abgeschrieben: Bildung fördern, Familien unterstützen etc. Nichts besonderes.

KO-Kriterien: Fremdenfeindlichkeit, Homophobie, Schulterschluss mit Neonazis.

Fazit: (Kommt für mich prinzipiell nicht in Frage) und für Dich würde es eine verschenkte Stimme bedeuten. Keine Nenneswerte Änderung herbeiführen.

**Links:**

Flüchtlinge: Klar, die sind eher dafür zu helfen. Aber für alles andere ist eh zu spät. Sie sind gegen Bundeswehreinsätze im Ausland. Weniger Krieg --&gt; weniger Flüchtlinge. Könnte also durchaus einen positiven Effekt haben. Könnte man auch von der AfD behaupten, aber mit den Linken besteht eher die Chance, dass jemand Kompromisse eingeht.

Soziale Gerechtigkeit: 

Da sind sie wirklich Laut. Mehr kann man für unsere Unterschicht nit machen, als was die Linken vorhaben. Teilweise nicht realistisch un zugegebenermaßen auch populistisch. Aber eher mit dem Gewissen zu vereinbaren.

I'm not saying KFO will become a god, just that the way he plays may fit a different roster better. 

Forgiven was a beast and everyone knew it due to his laning stats even with some pretty shit tier supports... But that didn't stop him getting 3 adc banned and look considerably worse in terms of performance or stats because of this. Also nostalgia tends to warp perception of how you felt about things in the past, I think people even now still dispute that forgiven is like top 2 ADC of all time in EU. Lol. IMO maybe not the best player to have on your team, but the best ADC no doubt.

I think DL was always a beast and in the same vein as forgiven it showed in his laning stats but he had some of the best laning supports in the game (also possibly the worst as well) but CLG was always centred around him. He got more resources because of this and that inhibited his team. Even though he was beast and in some ways he deserved that gold share for his performance, it didn't change the reality that it hampered his teams ability to grow. His teams only started to win anything when he took less and less resources in his career. 

How does this relate to KFO? I think people may look back and say KFO was a hidden gem or a beast but didn't have a chance to shine in EF because of whatever circumstances. Or it was a mix of both him being diamond in the rough and his team not utilising him properly. E.g. EF doesn't really play strategically as much as try to claw late game. I don't remember EF ever pulling off any amazing manoeuvres with top TP. But honestly, I tend to sleep through EF matches and don't remember much at all. 

But that's the worst position to be on a team as a top laner to showcase your skill, you can't reliably aggress on the enemy with a weak jungler, can't try to go for macro tp set up plays. You just try to slowly outlane your opponents and hope your team doesn't have heads up their asses. 

IMO your example smeb is a bit of a fairytale that no one has come close to because he was indisputably the worst in a region with the best and turned into the best. I don't think KFO is that story. I don't believe that the mentality is there in the same way the Koreans have (they work their asses off). So that's my main argument, smeb doesn't even come into it because I don't think it's a question of ability so much as a question of compatibility. I also don't think he's number 1 top lane calibre.

Joining a club would be a nice thing, but there are plenty of people that just shoot at private ranges and I don't think why we should impose those laws. Why not let people choose what they should do in their private time? If you want to shoot your guns in Switzerland you can only do it at a gun range anyway!

The main issue that I see is that the EU has written a set of laws that are open to interpretation. One of the cases is that they have refused to explain if they want to ban **magazines over 20 rounds** or if they want to ban **semi automatic guns that can accept magazines over 20 rounds**. There are other stuff like internal magazines

This will basically mean that every semi automatic gun with magazines would be banned. Even if they ban magazines over 20 rounds it would mean that the Stgw 57 (used widely for sports) would now be useless since the standard is 24 round magazines. Furthermore they want to ban semi automatic rifles that look like military rifles, which means that we would say goodbye to any modern sporting rifle such as the AR15, AKM pattern rifles and even the PE90 which is widely used for sports. It's just a cosmetic ban on a guns that are not a problem in Europe.

The laws currently state they these guns already in the possession of law abiding gun owners would be confiscated without reparations. This would also create a huge black market of guns throughout Europe!

Anyways, the principle is that it's our country and we have gun laws that are made for our country. I don't like to have an ""union"" which we are not part of trying to impose laws that we cannot vote for.

The EU is basically applying gun bans and other crap under the excuse that it will somehow prevent terrorism. I don't see how you will prevent terrorism by banning online sales (which already work just like person to person sales), medical checks, mandatory gun club membership and banning semi automatic guns from legal gun owners that already have to pass all the bureaucracy in order to get their legal guns.

Not to mention that EU wide gun laws are already extremely strict, and last time they did a study they found that around 1k people are murdered with guns each year in the EU (out 500+ million citizens!) and they didn't disclose how many were done with legal vs illegal guns.

Edit: Found the book and section, here are some quotes from it relevant to autism provision in EU countries:  
  
&gt;When Bruno Bettelheim’s 1967 book, *The empty fortress: Infantile autism and the birth of self*, which blamed the parents for their child’s autism, became an acclaimed bestseller, there were worldwide repercussions: it was the first book about autism ever to be published in Spanish, for example, leading to years of misconceptions in Spain. About three quarters of French psychiatrists continue to treat autism with psychoanalytical methods - although, to me at least, most of them claimed not to be admirers of Bettelheim himself.  
  (...)  
&gt; In continental Europe, the French remained backward in their thinking—parents continue to be held responsible for their child’s autism by many professionals and even today, around 75% of autistic children are still cared for in psychiatric hospitals. This explains why so many parents take their children across the border into Belgium.  
  (...)  
&gt; One target of the French parents’ outrage is the continued use of an approach known as *le packing*, in which autistic children are wrapped for between 30 minutes and an hour in wet sheets which have been kept cool in a refrigerator. The technique—for autism, at least—was pioneered by Pierre Delion, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst at Lille Regional University Hospital, in northern France, who suggests that the child in the pack undergoes a regression, replaying in a secure environment the relationship between a mother and her new-born child, and that, when used as a therapy for autistic children who self-harm, the treatment allows the child to rid itself progressively of its pathological defense mechanisms.

Son enracinement dans les Balkans à la faveur des conquêtes ottomanes l’a enrichi de compromis particuliers avec une modernité marquée par le socialisme. D’une grande diversité selon les pays, il n’échappe pas aux contradictions, aux tensions entre générations et aux influences extérieures.

*par Jean-Arnault Dérens &amp; Laurent Geslin*

Fin octobre 2015, le premier ministre hongrois Viktor Orbán affirmait : « L’islam n’a rien à voir avec l’Europe. Il s’agit d’un ensemble de règles qui ont été créées pour un autre monde, et l’islam a été importé sur notre continent. » Il s’est aussitôt attiré une verte réponse du chef de la communauté islamique de Bosnie-Herzégovine. Le reis-ul-ulema Husein Kavazović lui a rappelé que le judaïsme et le christianisme étaient également nés hors d’Europe.

Les dignitaires musulmans de l’Europe du Sud-Est tiennent souvent à se distinguer des communautés d’Occident, initialement formées par des immigrés, en insistant sur la longue histoire de l’islam dans les Balkans. Ce souci d’enracinement renvoie bien sûr aux prétentions à l’« autochtonie » des nationalismes balkaniques, toujours enclins à prétendre que les droits les mieux fondés seraient ceux du peuple le plus anciennement présent sur un territoire. Mais il fait aussi écho aux obsessions islamophobes, qui considèrent la religion musulmane comme un corps étranger. Un troisième niveau de discours, plus subtil, laisse supposer que l’islam des Balkans serait culturellement différent de celui pratiqué dans le monde arabe, en Afrique ou en Asie, et, à ce titre, mieux conciliable avec une hypothétique identité européenne.

La longue histoire de l’islam en Europe débute dès le VIIIe siècle. Après la période d’Al-Andalus (711-1492), dans la péninsule Ibérique, et l’émirat de Sicile (948-1091), il s’installe dans le Caucase, en Crimée, puis dans les Balkans à la faveur de la conquête ottomane. Avant même que les troupes turques franchissent le fleuve Évros, en Thrace (1371), certains récits prétendent que des derviches gyrovagues arpentaient déjà les Balkans, convertissant les populations locales, plus ou moins christianisées et souvent tentées par les hérésies, comme le bogomilisme (lire le glossaire). C’est néanmoins la mise en place, à partir du XVe siècle, des structures administratives ottomanes qui fit de la conversion une solution prisée.

L’Empire ne fit jamais de celle-ci une obligation, mais elle entraînait une série d’avantages, notamment fiscaux, tandis que les non-musulmans devaient s’acquitter de taxes spécifiques en échange de la protection que leur accordait le sultan. Ils subissaient des restrictions dans leurs droits à la propriété et se voyaient interdire l’accès à certaines fonctions de commandement, civiles ou militaires.

Les conversions furent rapides et massives en Bosnie-Herzégovine, où, dès le XVIe siècle, elles avaient touché une grande partie des élites. Un phénomène que certains historiens expliquent par le souvenir de l’Église bosniaque, qui professait des orientations « hérétiques » proches du dualisme des bogomiles ou des cathares, et contre laquelle le pape Honorius III avait appelé à la croisade en 1225. Insister sur les traces laissées par le bogomilisme permet à l’historiographie bosniaque d’acclimater l’islam, en faisant de la conversion moins le résultat d’un facteur exogène (l’invasion ottomane) que le produit d’une spécificité nationale. En fait, le lien est difficile à évaluer. La rapidité de la conversion s’explique surtout par la faiblesse des structures ecclésiastiques, tant catholiques qu’orthodoxes (1). C’est dans les régions historiquement disputées entre chrétientés d’Occident et d’Orient, le long de la ligne de partage de l’Empire romain tracée en 395, que l’islam put le plus facilement prendre pied — en Bosnie-Herzégovine, mais aussi au Monténégro ([voir la carte page 13](http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/cartes/musulmans-balkans)).

En revanche, dans le monde albanais, le phénomène de conversion fut lent et progressif. Au Kosovo, dans certains villages, les Albanais se déclaraient publiquement de confession musulmane tout en pratiquant les rites chrétiens en secret. Les hommes, qui possédaient et transmettaient les biens, étaient musulmans, tandis que les femmes, qui enseignaient aux enfants les rudiments de la foi, étaient chrétiennes. Dans la région de Viti/Vitina, la tolérance religieuse proclamée en 1839 avec le hatt-i sharif de Gülhane, premier édit de réforme de l’Empire ottoman, eut paradoxalement des conséquences tragiques : des villageois jusqu’alors considérés comme musulmans crurent qu’ils pouvaient désormais professer librement leur catholicisme ; une apostasie qui entraîna une répression immédiate. Les habitants du village de Binac/Binçë et de Stubla furent ainsi déportés en Anatolie (2). Au-delà des projections rétrospectives des nationalistes, tant serbes qu’albanais, cet étrange syncrétisme éclaire la complexité identitaire du Kosovo, au moins jusqu’au XIXe siècle.

Dans les pays bulgares, roumains ou serbes, les Églises orthodoxes, puissamment structurées, furent reconnues par l’empire comme des interlocutrices, prenant la tête de « communautés protégées » par le sultan, les millet. Saint Sava, fils du prince serbe Stefan Nemanja, avait obtenu dès 1219 du patriarche de Byzance la reconnaissance d’une Église autocéphale de Serbie. Après la conquête ottomane, en 1557, l’autonomie ecclésiale serbe fut restaurée par le patriarche Makarije, frère ou cousin du grand vizir Mehmet Pacha Sokolović, lui-même issu d’une famille aristocratique des confins bosno-serbes et converti à l’islam. Les millet devinrent des structures protonationales, qui servirent de cadres au développement des nationalismes modernes, à partir du XVIIIe et surtout du XIXe siècle. Cela explique le caractère national des différentes Églises orthodoxes.

Mais ce processus laissa les musulmans à l’écart. Ils étaient des sujets de l’empire, sans pouvoir se référer à des structures communautaires particulières, qu’elles soient linguistiques ou « nationales ». À ce titre, ils restèrent longtemps fidèles à la Porte (gouvernement ottoman) et s’opposèrent même aux nationalismes des peuples chrétiens, qui, pour leur part, percevaient l’ensemble de ces musulmans comme des « Turcs », même quand ils étaient de langue albanaise ou slave.

**D’incessants déplacements de populations**

Visitant Belgrade, « une ville si magnifique qu’il est impossible de la décrire », en 1660, le célèbre voyageur ottoman Evliya Çelebi s’émerveille devant les ouvrages d’art d’une cité qui aurait alors compté pas moins de 17 000 maisons musulmanes et des dizaines de mosquées (3). Aujourd’hui, seule subsiste la mosquée Bajrakli, édifiée en 1575 et fortement endommagée lors des émeutes antialbanaises de mars 2004 (4). En 1804, la première insurrection serbe, bientôt suivie par le soulèvement grec, annonce la décomposition progressive de l’Empire ottoman et la rétraction drastique de l’aire d’implantation des populations musulmanes des Balkans. C’est toutefois après la seconde révolte serbe, en 1815, que les « Turcs » sont promptement expulsés des territoires arrachés à l’Empire ottoman, vers lesquels affluent en revanche des chrétiens des régions restées sous contrôle ottoman. La progressive extension de l’État monténégrin, avec son lot de massacres et de conversions forcées à l’orthodoxie, entraîne aussi le départ des musulmans (5). Dans les territoires touchés par la guerre d’indépendance grecque à partir de 1821, le même sort attend leurs coreligionnaires. Tous viennent grossir le flux des réfugiés (muhacirs) qui fuient le « pays de la guerre » (darülharb) pour rejoindre le « pays de l’islam » (darûlislam). La progressive affirmation des États nationaux dans les Balkans au XIXe siècle se solda donc par des déplacements massifs de populations.

Dans le monde albanais, la formation de l’identité nationale ne put se calquer sur le modèle suivi par les chrétiens orthodoxes, la majorité des populations albanaises étant de confession musulmane. L’« albanisme » se confondait avec l’« ottomanisme » : les promoteurs du nationalisme albanais défendaient l’existence d’une double loyauté, envers l’Empire ottoman, la « patrie générale », et envers l’Albanie, la « patrie particulière ». À la suite de la guerre russo-turque de 1878 et du congrès de Berlin, qui entérina un partage des territoires ottomans d’Europe, des notables venus de tous les territoires albanais de l’empire se réunirent à Prizren, au Kosovo, le 10 juin 1878, pour affirmer leur volonté de rester sous le contrôle de la Porte, mais au sein d’une région (vilayet) unifiée et autonome.

La « question albanaise » fut pourtant négligée par les grandes puissances. La Ligue de Prizren est considérée comme la première manifestation du nationalisme albanais moderne, transcendant les clivages religieux. Les historiens albanais soulignent également l’appartenance des pères fondateurs de la « renaissance nationale » à la confrérie soufie des bektachis, comme Naïm Frashëri (1846-1900), auteur de la Qerbelaja, un long poème épique sur la bataille de Kerbala (680), point de rupture entre la conception de l’histoire de l’islam qu’ont la plupart des sunnites et celle que partagent les chiites et les derviches soufis. Le bektachisme deviendrait ainsi une « foi nationale », distincte de l’islam sunnite et susceptible de singulariser l’existence de la nation.

What has that got to do with my reply?

&gt;Ffs this is completely contradictory to your first point. You just said we don't make our own trade deals because it's a trade bloc for negotiating strength. And then you say ""oh well we'll just make several deals with different countries in this trade bloc"".We can't make independent trade deals with the seperate countries because they're in a trade bloc. That's why we're leaving remember?

Sure - which is why it is part of the debate - why do you not get that?   What bit of ""tariff free access"" is not a sovereignty issue, exactly?

&gt;No it wasn't it very clearly says ""350 million for the NHS"".

Not on the bus it didn't - you are confusing an internet meme with the truth.

&gt;Leaving that aside, the EU doesn't tell us how to spend our tax money

Of course it does - that was the whole point of the ""fees"" discussion.  The EU tell us how to spend the money we pay them - the argument was over the amount we pay, not the fact we pay them some in the first place.

If you want to go over arguments that are months old then do it on another thread - it is beyond boring now to be trolled by people who can't accept the arguments put forward.

Because you don't yet have the visa, you are in fact just traveling. However, if you want to tell the officers that you're just traveling, I'm guessing that a lot of your story will sound fishy.

**How long will you be staying in the EU (Schengen zone)?** [any amount of time less than 90 days but they will ask more questions if you are staying longer than 3 weeks. A common followup question is ""what date is your return flight?""]

**Where will you be staying?** [They don't care what cities, they want to know if you'll be in hotels/hostels/apartments. If you say apartment, expect lots of extra questions because that indicates you'll be staying long-term. If you say family/significant-other, this too will bring on more questions.]

**What will you be doing?** [This may be the hardest to answer. A real traveler will have planned to fill their time with activity and travel but you had planned to work.]

Above all else, you need to pick a story and stick to it. If you go with the fake traveling story and they catch you in some lie, you cannot switch gears and tell them about the pending visa. 

If you do go in as a traveler, it may be smart to have some documentation for your plans. A hotel reservation (that can be cancelled if not needed).

---

&gt;* Hundreds of opposition protesters were gathered outside of Kosovo's parliament building in Pristina on September 1 amid expectation that lawmakers would vote to ratify a border agreement between Kosovo and Montenegro.

&gt;* The border deal has sparked harsh reaction from the opposition for more than a year with opposition politicians repeatedly setting off teargas in parliament to prevent a vote.

&gt;* Supporters of the opposition Self-Determination Movement have also held demonstrations outside the legislature repeatedly to protest the deal, saying that the demarcation plan would give away a swath of Kosovo's territory.

&gt;* Passage of a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro is one of the preconditions set by the European Commission for Kosovo to be granted visa liberalization privileges by the European Union.

Vets have not been treated well, but that is a separate problem than immigration. That's our own senators and congressmen denying them the healthcare they need. The illegals don't come into it. Trump is scapegoating them. How is it their fault that our government can't look after our Vets?

I don't see Trump as a crystal ball at all. I think he tells people what they want to hear. He has no clarity at all. It's all generalisations and ""I'll make this the best ever"". He's not straight talking. He changes his mind all the time. I can't understand how anyone finds any consistency or sense, or any idea what he stands for. He's all things to all men and when he gets in you're going to be furious. Because he won't do a damn thing he says.

He didn't predict Brexit, he said he thought it was a good idea. UK has yet to start implementing Brexit in any meaningful way (article 50 needs to be signed off and that will not happen until 2017 and MAYBE not until the French elections in spring 2017 or the German ones in 2018). He was right about migrant backlash - and that is a trend that is going to call many of the EU elections. If far right groups get in based on migrant concerns we'll see how UK's post Brexit economy does then. I think the EU will turn the screw - how can they allow Britain to do well out of this? There would be a rush to the exit.

Hillary's health conspiracy is mental. Especially since Trump's health proof is a single page that sounds like he wrote it. Not that I'm questioning his health - I just hate how he reduces it all to such rubbish ideas. It's all a smokescreen.

It doesn't. The Commission's beef is not even with the Double Irish scheme by itself, which may indeed be considered to have been ""available"" to other companies (even if not particularly useful to most of them), it's with the fact that, to use the Double Irish, Apple attributed nearly all the earnings of its two Irish-registered companies to two ""head offices"" without any real economic activity. *That*, technically, wasn't available to *anybody* (because illegal under Ireland's own transfer pricing rules), and was nevertheless signed off by Ireland's Revenue.

This is why both Apple and the Irish government are so embarrassed by this situation. They can't say it was a deal (even though it was), because under EU competition rules, Irish Revenue isn't allowed to make such deals. And they can't say it was available to everybody, because Irish taxpayers know all too well it wasn't.

EDIT: And, yes, there are plenty of other countries that can still be left very red-faced over sweetheart tax deals, and have indeed been in the past: this isn't the first time the Commission attacks such deals. For instance, it made Spain scrap a scheme of tax breaks for customers of struggling Spanish shipyards and reclaim the back taxes.

Now speaking about Cognac, we're producing three different brands. Namely ABK6, the young, modern one, definitely aimed towards the Whisky drinkers. If you ever tasted Rum or Whiskeys that aged inside Cognac casks, you could mistake the ABK6 VSOP for one of these.

Since you're already a bit into Scotch, you could build some bridges with that.

Despite multiple clarifications on payment requirements by League Officials including an official warning in March 2016,  HUMA remains unable to meet their contractual obligations with both former and current players. We conclude that HUMA does not meet League standards for a professional organization and as such, they will not be permitted to continue participating in Riot-sanctioned leagues.

**CONTEXT**

After an investigation during the Spring Split, HUMA received a warning in regard to negligence in their duties of ownership. Since March 2016, there have been verified instances of late payments towards their players and HUMA not meeting all of their contractual obligations towards their players.

Minimum Player Compensation (MPC): Over the course of this year’s Spring and Summer Split HUMA has been chronically late in paying its players the League-mandated Minimum Player Compensation. In the beginning of August League Officials learned that multiple players on the current HUMA roster had not been paid for the duration of the Summer Split, and were forced to intervene to ensure that MPC owed to date will be paid in full for all players.
Meeting contractual obligations: As part of the Team Participation Agreement, which owners sign with Riot, they are required to fulfill all the submitted payment terms in their contracts with their players. This is to protect players from false promises as well as ensuring a healthy and stable environment within the League. Our investigation revealed that HUMA did not comply with the Team Participation Agreement and were unable to fulfill their obligations financially.

**RULING**

HUMA’s management has repeatedly violated its Team Agreement, and is hereby disallowed from participating in the Challenger Series or any other Riot sanctioned League. In order to minimize disruption, HUMA’s management will be granted a grace period until 11:59pm CEST on October 1st to sell their Challenger Series spot, meaning a finalized transfer agreement must be presented to League Officials and the new owner must pass the standard approval process. This grace period is contingent on HUMA cooperating with League Officials in any requests/communication around payments and/or the transfer process, and is subject to revocation.

Further, HUMA’s owner Behdad Jaafarian is banned from his position and will not be accepted in any official position for any team in a Riot-sanctioned League for the period of 1 year.  

**RELEVANT RULES**

2.1 Player Compensation:

Each team must distribute the required Minimum Player Compensation (€2,250 per starting player per split during the 2016 Challenger Series season) to its starting players, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Team Agreement.

**Q&amp;A**

**Q: Can you help the players get the money they’re owed?**

A: We approached HUMA’s management regarding this issue and they are working together with potential new owners of the slot and the players to resolve this amicably. Our highest priority is to ensure all players are getting paid the Minimum Player Compensation for the respective Split. The potential re-entry of HUMA and their management - after the ban has expired - will be partially contingent on them being able to fully resolve this issue in a swift manner, amongst other ownership criteria which will be assessed at the time of application.

**Q: Why does HUMA have a whole month to sell their slot?**

A: Given the time remaining before the start of the 2017 European Spring Split, we believe it to be in the best interest of the players to provide a generous time window for the sale so HUMA and the new owners have time to resolve the open payment issues.

**Q: Why not give the slot to the HUMA players?**

A: While we appreciate the work that the HUMA players have put into their team’s success and continued performance in the European Challenger Series, the slot belongs to the HUMA organization. By allowing HUMA to transfer the spot to an established ownership group (who will still need to qualify through our vetting process), we can bring closure in the most efficient and amicable manner.

**Q: What happens if HUMA fails to sell their spot by the deadline?**

A: We will have follow up steps should a new owner not be found (and deal agreed upon) within the timeframe. Our primary concern is to facilitate a smooth sale process that protects the players as much as possible, and we will be transparent about further steps in the event that a sale is not made.",,False,1475230454,t3_50n114,d75cet5

I also didn't want anything with hormones, or to have the hormone dose as low as possible. This left me with either copper or hormonal IUDs since the hormones are released locally, rather than throughout your whole system. I didn't like the idea of having a hormonal implant in the arm since that seems to have higher hormone concentration ([according to this](https://bedsider.org/features/317-all-about-hormones) it's 0.18 ± 0.07 ng/ml for Mirena and 0.08 ± 0.02 ng/ml for Skyla vs 0.26 ng/ml for the implant). Vaginal rings are veeery expensive here and also they are combined hormonal contraceptions, whereas the IUDs only have the progestin hormone. 

If you *do* decide on an IUD with hormones, I'd recommend you go for Skyla since it's smaller (easier to insert for nulliparous women) and has a smaller hormone concentration if hormones is something you are worried about, like me. It doesn't last as long as Mirena (3 years vs 5 years), but I figured it's probably worth it if there are less complications with insertion and hormone levels. 

I heard a lot about the copper IUDs, and though plenty of women seem to have a lot of luck with it, after 3 doctors saying they would really recommend Mirena or Skyla instead, I went with it. They said that few women have problems with the hormones, especially from Skyla, and I had heard enough stories about pain upon insertion and inflammation caused by the copper IUDs to decide otherwise, though I don't know how much of that is supported by data rather than the personal experiences of these gynecologists.  

Also a tip: if you go for an IUD, insist on a pill to soften the cervix. My doctor said she refuses to insert the IUDs on women with no children without them taking the pill since the failure rate is so much higher without it.

I worked my way up to the Glycolic 40%! I started out using various 5-10% AHAs for about a year, then started dabbling in peels. The first peel I used was a low concentration blend of AHAs (Glycolic, Lactic &amp; Pyruvic Acids) and Kojic Acid.

If you have experience with AHAs and tolerate them well, you could also start out with a gentle peel like MUAC's 25% Mandelic Acid.

After using that for almost a year and my skin handling the strength well, I move up to 30% Glycolic peels from MUAC, and after going through a bottle of that I've bumped it up to 40%!

I have tried the American (the European formulas are different) La Roche Posay Anthelios sunscreens, specifically the Fluid and the Milk in the larger squeeze bottle. I didn't enjoy them at all as a daily sunscreen for my face or body because they were honestly pretty greasy and very shiny. They also stained my white clothes yellow. :/ However, the protection level is probably the highest you can buy in American stores, so it can be a good choice for beach days (as long as you aren't swimming, these are not waterproof) and other outdoor events where you don't mind being shiny and greasy haha.

Vitamin C will work best if you use it after cleansing and leave it on! If you opt to remove it because you have very sensitive skin, I would instead look for a lower concentration so that you can leave it on. CSI Youth Serum for example is a 12% L-AA serum. Very gentle!

I don't use any traditional ""toners"" in my routine, but depending on the ingredients, they can be a great way to deliver nice ingredients to your skin without being heavy.

In a world in which Finland had become an SSR, such an option would not be on the table.

In the 1950s, the absence of the option of ""Finlandization"" might have complicated the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Austria.  This, in turn, would have done further damage to the ""free at home, slave abroad"" model.  

In the 1960s, a long border with the Soviet Union would have made Swedish intellectuals a little more realistic, thereby saving the world from the self-satisfied sermons of Gunnar Myrdal and his ilk.

&gt; This is illegal under EU state aid rules: Tax rulings cannot use methodologies, no matter how complex, to establish transfer prices with no economic justification and which unduly shift profits to reduce the taxes paid by the company.

&gt; Starbucks Manufacturing EMEA BV (""Starbucks Manufacturing""), based in the Netherlands, is the only coffee roasting company in the Starbucks group in Europe. It sells and distributes roasted coffee and coffee-related products (e.g. cups, packaged food, pastries) to Starbucks outlets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
The Commission's investigation showed that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave a selective advantage to Starbucks Manufacturing, which has unduly reduced Starbucks Manufacturing's tax burden since 2008 by €20 - €30 million. In particular, the ruling artificially lowered taxes paid by Starbucks Manufacturing in two ways:

&gt; 1. Starbucks Manufacturing pays a very **substantial royalty** to Alki (a UK-based company in the Starbucks group) for coffee-roasting know-how.

&gt; 2. It also pays an **inflated price** for green coffee beans to Switzerland-based Starbucks Coffee Trading SARL

Starbucks did not set up a headless corporation to dump profits into, the breaking of the law was *Starbucks Manufacturing* charged inflated prices the actual stores so that all the profits would appear to be only made by *Starbucks Manufacturing* which was in the Netherlands with a low tax.  The result was that instead of having stor earnings taxed where the stores are located, all profits were taxed in the netherlands.

1. This is illegal, to fix prices in this way.

I never really understood the whole patriotic thing you have going about people who serve in the Army. Let's get one thing clear: they are mercenaries. They are viewed that way in Europe. I mean hey, yea it's tragic if someone dies in an IED attack in Iraq or Afghanistan...But they kinda chose to go there. Better pay, career opportunities, stuff like that. We only see as heroes those who defend their country. 
Now you can't tell me that,  under any circumstances, that Iraq had any means to threaten the security of the United States. Same goes for Syria. I'll consider Afghanistan payback for 9/11, I won't include it in the discussion.
So basically you have an army fighting occupation wars. As in any war the most affected is the local civilian population. This army, representing a true super power, doesn't fight for democracy, freedom and all that propaganda, it fights to protect American economical interests in key parts of the world; it does so regardless of how it affects the countries it does war in.
It's nice to think of your soldiers as peace keepers, as those who bravely fight terrorists...But they really don't do that.
No western army set foot in Africa to stop the Rwandan genocide, the civil war in Congo...Nor did anyone try to solve the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan. Civil war rages on in Burma. You see where I'm going with this...
So basically you have trained mercenaries(it's the correct term, they get payed for their service; they don't join through conscription) going to kill whoever they are told to.

But I have not seen a single thing which convinces me that the way to do that is to vote for Smith. Someone who very much represents the party establishment and style of leadership which the voting public have already overwhelmingly rejected. And someone who would put us at odds with a majority of the voting public on the EU referendum, there is no way that campaigning to overturn the result at a general election wouldn't do us more damage than Corbyn could ever do. I think sticking with Corbyn for now, continuing to change the terms of political debate in this country and presenting an argument which really strongly resonates with a lot of the general public who have been disaffected with the tory government and politics in general for the past few decades. And convincing them that we can actually deliver on that, partly through a vast social campaign movement utilising the hundreds of thousands of members Jeremy has inspired, similar to Syriza and Podemos. But that has to be worth a try, right? Certainly compared to returning to the status quo, and inevitably seeing everything Corbyn has brought to the table quietly swept under the rug within a year or two. Even if Corbyn's personal reputation is irreparable, we need to stick with him now so that we can reform the party, prove to the public that we have changed from the party they rejected in 2010 and 2015 and go forward at some point with a fresh face who can present those ideas we all believe in, someone like Clive Lewis or Cat Smith. Because heed my words - if Corbyn loses now, the left and these policies will not see the head of the party for decades.

The tales of a lack of cooperation in the shadow cabinet are worrying, but I wouldn't take them at face value. There seems to be a lot of factors at play here, and a lot of conflicting information. There are people who resigned claiming the leadership never listened to them, there are people who resigned thanking them for always having the time to listen to them. And there are people like Thornberry saying they've always been happy to get round the table if there's any disagreement. On the one hand, Corbyn and his team were not exactly traditionally prepared for the role, and I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped the ball occasionally on balancing how to give everyone the attention and assurances they need to stay happy. But there's no reason that couldn't be improved with time and actual help from the wider party. On the other hand, it seems likely to me that many of those who made these complaints didn't see Corbyn as willing to compromise simply because they're politically opposed to him, and in their eyes ""compromise"" would be a complete U turn on pretty much every policy or position.

**Penny Dreadful**: Former child prodigy who failed to become an adult prodigy and snapped under the pressure. Unbelievably megalomaniacal, literally wants to take over the world. Took over the villainous group called the World Enders by killing its last leader, who had a contingency planned for that exact scenario. Figured out pretty quickly that trying to herd sociopaths is harder than herding cats, and bitterly settled with destabilizing the global order one city-wrecking party at a time, and turned the World Enders into a franchise instead of just a singular mob for good measure.

She has the power called 「Gestell」, which allows her to mentally control machines to a degree that scales positively with a machine's complexity. Though she normally has a range of about 50m, her power can ""piggyback"" on existing networks to reach farther.

**Doctor Devil**: Street orphan turned priest-in-training turned KGB bureaucrat turned major supervillain. He has simple wants: drugs, fast cars, women, and power, and never really grasped the idea that hurting people to get what you want is wrong. Controls the lion's share of the Eastern European underworld (and quite a bit of its overworld) either directly or through his Diabolicals, his mutated servitors.

He has the power called 「Deal with the Devil」, which expands the scope of a willing superhuman's powers, at the cost of random physical mutation that ranges from freakish to debilitating. Using his power on himself gave Doctor Devil the ability to transform his subject's mind as well as their body, and made him into a skeletal albino.

**Heaven Shaker**: A vicious Japanese nationalist inspired by Yukio Mishima's suicide. Sought out surviving elements of the Black Dragon Society, as well as his Yakuza connections, and forged them into the international criminal organization that would come to be called the Ring of Fire. His goal was to destabilize the nations of the Pacific Rim through infiltration and sabotage, and thereby prepare them for an eventual resurgence of an imperial Japan.

He has the power called 「Caduceus」, which allows him to control the physical and mental healing process of a touched subject.

**Zahak**: One of the extremist mujahideen who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, but was marginalized by the region's more secular factions after the war. Angry and isolated, he fled with his followers into the mountains and became a warlord. With his power he carved out a hidden Shangri-La for fundamentalists, which persisted for almost twenty years before capturing the attention of the Western world and collapsing under the sheer culture shock (and bombing campaign). Zahak outlasted his dream, and shifted his focus from creating paradise on Earth to launching suicidal attacks on those he felt were responsible for its failure. He met his end on the third of his attacks, fighting the local superhero stable of Washington.

He has the power called 「Landscaping」, which allows him to shift the nature of a broad swathe of land within a set of categories, like urban jungle to actual jungle, rugged mountain to fertile fields, and so on.

**Red Vector**: More of a hive mind than an individual at this point, RV is concerned with little except his own continued survival, which involves assimilating more brainwashed goons and attempting secret takeovers of governments. Best known for his kidnapping of Queen Elizabeth in the '80s.

He has the power called 「Messy Memory Transfer」, which allows him to transfer his own or another's memories by using blood as a medium. In conjunction with extensive though mundane brainwashing, Red Vector uses this power to make his victims into mental duplicates of himself.

**Cocytus**: AKA Marianna DiMucci, one of the Rivers of the Underworld, and matriarch of the DiMucci mafia family. Believes in old-fashioned values like respect, family, and nigh-feudal lordship over the masses. Under her leadership the DiMuccis came to dominate Italy from the shadows during the Years of Lead, and spread into organized crime across Western Europe and North America. She lived long enough to see her children turn to squabbling and fratricide, and died deeply disappointed in them.

She has the power called 「Icy Stare」, which allows her to arbitrarily lower the temperature of water within her field of view.

**Murderverse**: Everything you need to know about him is encapsulated in the fact that he's the kind of guy who calls himself Murderverse.

He has the power called 「Murderverse」, which manifests a Hellraiser-esque pocket dimension into reality.",,1472752985.0,1475232745,t3_50muvr,d75fvs5

Europe is in big financial trouble. First the financial crisis that the world recovered from but Greece and other European countries never did. Now it seems that the common currency is in danger. Greece can't recover with such a high value euro, the north would hurt badly allowing Greece to sent us into massive inflation and devaluation of our currency. While mainly self inflicted by Greece the 2007/8 crisis starting in the US broke the camels back. How could the crisis of 2007/8 happen? Because Wall Steet lobbied in 90s to remove Glass-Staegall, the act that was a protection against the a 1930s style meltdown. Both parties worked together to allow wall street to go wild and Bill Clinton signed the new legislation with a big speech how this will help all people. Now in 2016 I hear Trump who says he can and will regulate Wall Street again because he dosn't take money from them and I hear of Hillary who says she will use Bill's expertise in her economic policy because he was very successfull in the 90s. That scares me a lot.

Then the middle east. Europe is suffering under millions of immigrants fleeing the middle east. Thats a fact no matter if you are for or against open borders. It currently breaks up our people's friendships and our European Union. Britain is already about to leave, France has the font national, a real hardcore right wing nationalistic party rising, that really wants to leave the EU, same for Eastern Europe, Germany and some other countries still want to help everybody but over long or short Europe's great Union will shatter. The solution? End the madness in the middle east. So far the US has ended multiple regimes, leaving room for terror and warlords everywhere and then armed moderate rebells, that torture, execute and terrorize just like the others. Clinton was secretary of state and kept this policy going. Bomb Lybia, arm Syrian civil war parties. I think the only solution is to work together with the UN, Russia, the local war parties and even Assad. End the war by finding conpromice. Maybe Syria will not become a great democracy soon, but please be reasonable. Make sure there are no genocides, no invading other peaceful countries, no building a bomb to end Israel and no haboring terrorist after you leave and it's a win in my book. Stop removing dictators just because they are terrible, the middle east will get worse and worse if that is you policy. And please start holding the gulf states responsable. They fund a lot of chaos and refuse to help any refugee? How can that be acceptable? How can the rational and diplomatic superpower America let that madness go on for so long?

Last, I have a very different perspective on immigration. I own a house in south America and really like it there, but see that Mexico is really struggeling. I am convinced, if it wasn't for the eternal drug war, Mexico could easily be as stable and prosperus as Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica. The problem is the drug transit. Mexico has a smuggle industry driven by very dangerous cartels, just because of the northern border with the US. Secure that border and it helps Mexico the most. Sure Mexicans hate the idea, who would want to lose the option to move to the US whenever it gets real bad? But nothing will change if drugs continue to move from South America through Mexico into the US and money and guns come back over.

So to answer you question, what personal qualities resonate:

* Trump is not part of the machine, as Teddy Roosevelt called it. He has no special interest that lead him to do the same as all the other politicians before him no matter what party.

* Trump is a negotiator. He is not arrgoant and thinks he can solve problems alone, he will work with Mexico on the border, work with Russia on Syria, work with independent experts on economic reforms. Thats what he did all his life, find the parties involved, make a maybe not perfect but reasonable deal.

* He is willing to use the negotiation power of the US to force good solutions. If Turkey refuses to negotiate with the Kurds, the strongest US allie in the middle east besides Israel he will put reducing NATO cooperation on the table. He is not crazy, but he knows how to make crazy machos like Erdogan listen.

* He has a stake in the future. He truely cares, what happens in this world even if it is just for his kids and grandkids sake. He seems to be very family oriented, handing the business he build with his father over to his daughters and sons. An old saying comes to mind: ""A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”

This is due to Apple's decision to record all sales in Ireland rather than in the countries where the products were sold. This structure is however outside the remit of EU state aid control. If other countries were to require Apple to pay more tax on profits of the two companies over the same period under their national taxation rules, this would reduce the amount to be recovered by Ireland

The exception to this was on the way back from a big day out and we were tired, otherwise even on the day out we would get a light lunch or go to a pub. I think it was because my granddad was a farmer and my dad was a driver and went to Europe but we got used to paying a bit more for better fresher food. It was never a mindset that we had to do it to support these people or that it was annoying because we wanted to have fast food. We didn't have much money and regularly bought subpar shopping so we knew the difference when we spent a little extra to get good food on a day out and loved the odd days we got it at home. It's so different between shaped ham slices and the thick salty ham from the butchers that was striated like beef. My dad used to get white bread and nobody ate it so it went off until he started getting brown granary bread, it's so springy and has it's own taste and vegetables just got put with everything because of texture, we loved having the crunch plus it palate cleansed.  
The thing was that I didn't notice so when I started going to town with mates and getting mcdonalds I sort of loved the indulgence of it but after a while I started to get sick of it, it just coated my mouth and the flavours were designed to taste nice all mixed together in your mouth not like good ingredients where you can also taste them separately as well as a whole.  
Another thing was that I tired of how soft they were, I missed springy, crunchy, chewy, tangy things also crisp vegetables that were like water given form in your sandwich specifically to help you eat it. I also didn't realise until someone pointed it out that everything tasted sweet even the bread and not that nice brioche bun sweet either. I stopped eating fast food pretty handily having tried a few BK, KFC, I liked a toasted subway though.  
I wouldn't have remembered this if I hadn't gone to uni and had to have a good lot of cheap food to fill my quota but even so if you know how to cook it's only a little bit hard eating nice food.  
I don’t think people should stop eating mcdonalds or any fast food, because it gives you a contrast to what you're normally eating plus I don't know how mums do it because I burn out on ideas sometimes. My mum used to make us tired of eating roast chicken dinners, then use the legs/thighs for curry/Thai, then make a soup from the carcass, apparently it was cheap but I do the same when I've ran out of ideas plus I always add a shit ton of veg to get some more servings if it will freeze so on 1 night a week it's freezer night where  they get what they want.

As u/kamrouz aptly pointed out, a lot of these peoples' ancestors were not ""Turks"".  They were Muslim Slavic peoples who were brought to Turkey a little after the Genocide who quickly lost their previous identities.  They were already Muslim and spoke Turkish (as they were under Ottoman rule).  It was easy for them to lose whatever vestiges of their previous Balkan heritage was left over and become assimilated into the greater ""Turkish"" population.

So I've been thinking about this all recently and have started to put some stuff together.  You had rising nationalist movements in the turn of the last century.  This spanned throughout Europe and into the Ottoman Empire (it was actually one of the big reasons why WW1 was even fought).  The Turks (particularly the Young Turks) were trying to develop some sort of all encompassing Turkish identity--one that had not previously existed within the multicultural Ottoman Empire. Sultan Abdul Hamid was trying to do this too to strengthen the falling Empire.  While the Young Turks were secular, they were still Muslim.  The Christians did not want to give up their identities and become totally assimilated within this new ""Turkish"" identity.  They were, therefore, seen as a threat to the Empire.  However, it was really easy to relocate these Balkan ""Turks"" and integrate them into Turkish society.  As I said, they were already Muslim and spoke Turkish (as did everybody else in the area).  Within a generation or two they'd lost any sort of knowledge of their ancestors being Slavs, instead being told stories that they were ethnic ""Turks"" from Serbia, etc. 

And this is why Ataturk is Ataturk.  He assimilated these disparate Muslim peoples and reassigned them as ""Turks.""  The same goes with Muslims from the Caucasus like Circassians.  Ataturk himself was probably one of these reassigned Slavs.  That's why he looked so much more like Putin and not like Ghengis Khan (an actual Mongolian) or Dikran the Great (somebody that actually belonged in the region).

And this is why you see Turks with ski-slope noses, freckles, and red hair.

I'm not saying that this is the only reason for the Genocide, but I think it is one of them.  I think that there were a number of things that were happening at once that these myopic idiots decided would be best to blame on Christians and then massacre them in droves.

As I said, his lane is in stasis while his team decides what play to make; gank and push top or tp play bot or fight at drake or jungle. They do practically no proactive play. That means he doesn't do anything either, it's not safe to go aggressive in lane or go do damage on bot. That means he just farms and has very low KP or DS on his team. Because EF just doesn't fight enough for him to do damage. They just wait til they get rolled. 

Also if you aren't seeing that in a game between top tier teams they'll force the enemy top laner to tp out of lane/force him from CS that's going to crash into tower then Idk what to tell you. Just watch the games more closely. That's wave management and ALL top tier teams are doing it. 

EF doesn't even do the basics right so kfo freezes more because his jungler isn't there to push with him. Also freezing makes it easier to reactionary TP to other lanes. I think it's the aspect that highlights the problem in their macro play and perfectly encapsulates how bad they are.

Also I say semi-coherent because he should arguably look worst on his team if he was as bad as big or hard.

Also froggen has excelled on plenty but carried rarely. That's my point, he only looks good enough not to drag his team down most of the time. He'll play passively in lane rather clobber his opponent to death. I can imagine bjergsen or jensen going for solo kills if their teams were going to lose, I can't see froggen taking the chance and losing his kda. It's not his playstyle. I don't mean in teamfights, EF is usually losing way before then, but in laning phase where he dicks around. 

Also I think you are having a blind spot for froggen while being biased for kfo. The same reasons I believe kfo is stuck in an impossible position where he can't shine, you say froggen can't go aggressive. While true, I was never saying froggen was a bad player during that. I was just saying that his playstyle doesn't accrue leads in a team like EF to win the game. Someone who was more aggressive would be positive for EF while he'd work better on a team like C9 or TSM. Also while his stats looks remarkable he is still a liability to his team because it's the wrong approach when 3 of his teammates are looking to him for miracle plays early on... Rather than trying to grind to late game where he'll look like a star from the old days.

Looper took tp in solo q but that doesn't matter in professional. His stint in LPL he didn't have good TP timings while once he co-ordinated with mata he actually looked super good.

So stuff that changed for seraph doesn't change for Kfo? What does that even mean?! Yea it may not change for him, but that makes no sense when judging a players potential because that's the whole point! It's about the possibility of that player progressing!

Sven has had games where he has taken over the game in every point of his career even in shit tier teams. His lee sin is legendary in EU. There has been multiple cases like this, dandy's rengar, spirits nidalee, clearlove eve... In modern league, unless a champion is a broken piece of shit like GP or fiora or ekko top laners haven't had a chance to be as dominating in a head to head match up. Even then the player with the better jungler to snowball or macro to give them gold properly wins out. The reason I give shit to the jungler is because in the early ganking and power farming meta, junglers are the most even. The most they have had to deal with is invades in lane swaps when they are attacked by supports. Top laners have much worse case scenarios because they are more reliant. I agree jungling is much easier to look worse on (the snowball is much higher from denying buffs early or being warded), but it's much easier to look good on too. Which means it's a pure skill match up so that's how it should be. 

I think you are overating ray and lourlo and quas (the guy builds like 5 dblades if he can get away with). But that's just my opinion. 

So he's competing with huni/hauntz/seraph/darshan next year (I think darshan will bounce back or retire). He just has to knock down 2 to be top 3. Probably seraph is the one he has potential to be better than and he'll have to compete with darshan. I don't think that's unfeasible considering the meta may shift to carry tops again.",,False,1475233786,t3_50e8yk,d75hgnj

When Russia is hit so hard that they are on verge of ""not giving a fuck"" about sanctions, then how can you stop Russia from invading Ukraine and eating Ukrainians alive? Simply put, current sanctions are non-lethal punishments to show Russia that their actions will not go unpunished and unnoticed, which is actually important for Russia - due to heavy fall in oil prices and sanctions in place, Russian economy suffered considerably and therefore the need to ""remove sanctions"" or reconsider actions in Ukraine has arisen. Strengthening sanctions and essentially removing Russia from international trading scheme will totally free them - in the end, what do they have to lose when they've already lost all against West? What will, let's say, Germany or USA do if Russia invades Ukraine in this case? Attack them? Doubt it. This is why I personally believe that imposing harsher sanctions on Kremlin will do no good for EU &amp; NATO side. Russia has upper hand in military aspect - until you drain their ALL sources of money, they will probably have devastated Ukraine or anyone on their way.

The fact that lions (relatively) recently left the areas you mentioned seems to support what I am saying. If lions did not have stable habitats in other parts of the world, then they would most likely have gone extinct. 


Another thing that I hadn't considered when I wrote my first answer is the habitat. Temperate is a very general term and I believe you may be using it even more generally than it already is. As far as I can tell, the only large predator on your short list that occupies a similar territory to the types of forest that are and have been widespread in europe is the cougar (cougars are actually comparable in size to wolves, but are obviously quite a bit more powerful), which may well have thrived in the more mountainous regions if they had been present. Another animal that can often be considered a predator are members of the bear family. Although yes, they most often forage for food, and don't often hunt larger prey, they still occupy a spot on the food chain. What needs to be understood about selective pressure and evolution in that sense, is that survival of the fittest doesn't paint the whole picture. A more accurate statement would be ""survival of the fittest in your weight class"". Bears, although mostly foragers and fishers, are also capable of taking down larger prey when necessary, which puts them in direct competition with both the foragers and the large predators. Other large predators may have been forced out of their niche by the bears. The next big competitor for large predators are the wolves. Highly intelligent and social, and the way they hunt means they don't need to be bigger or stronger than their prey. 


I really haven't structured this discussion very well, and I apologize for that. I would have loved to have gone on and on about how similar things happened in north america and how bears really are a very well adapted family (aside from the panda bears, they're actually quite shit), because I absolutely love speculating about population genetics and evolution in general.

""Scientists concluded in the Journal of Glaciology that the loss of glacier mass in Antarctica’s western region is being offset by thickening of glaciers on the continent’s eastern interior, which has experienced increased snowfall. The result: A net gain of about 100 billion tons of ice per year, according to the report.

That increase in ice translates to about a quarter of a millimeter per year less sea level rise than was previously predicted,  says lead author Jay Zwally, chief cryospheric scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.""

Below 1500 meters, the elevation-change rate is –2.0 T 0.9 cm/year, in qualitative agreement with reported thinning in the ice-sheet margins. Averaged over the study area, the increase is 5.4 T 0.2 cm/year, or È60 cm over 11 years, or È54 cm when corrected for isostatic uplift.

Here's my Costco shopping list for the month. Take your pick!
 (for two people):

***Meat/fish:*** 

1. Steaks 

2. Three-pack organic ground beef

3. Lamb from New Zealand, vacuum packed, usually eat within three weeks

4. Pork chops. 

5. Joint of ham that lasts for a couple of months. Beware of the honey glazed ones. Best to get it in separate packet you can throw away.

6. Sausages. Get the vacuum packed ones, with no sugar. Last for a couple of months.

7. Bacon: Niman's ranch, Uncured, no added nitrates.

8. Chicken: couple of organic ones, eat one in first week, freeze the other.

9. Fish: wild caught only. Eat or freeze in first week.

10. Shrimp: cilantro and lime dressing. Eat within three days.


***Cold meats:***

 Sliced cooked meats: sliced beef/ham/turkey/chicken/salami.

Beware the cold meats with sugar added. (Why the hell do they add sugar to ***meat***? Gross!)

Hot smoked salmon.

24 organic eggs. (Much better nutrients than non organic)

***Dairy:***

Cheese - whatever you fancy.
Heavy whipping cream.
Half and half, butter,
Mayonnaise - full fat, real. Chosen foods avocado Mayo is delicious!

***Fresh veggies for cooking:***


Cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts (they last longer than other veggies), bok choy, baby squash, mushrooms, spinach, kale or collard greens  tomatoes, onions. 

**Salad veggies:**

Herb salad or lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers, avocado, spring onions, cucumber, celery.
Guacamole or other dips (check label for the dreaded sugar).

**Fruit:**

 organic berries. If getting strawberries they ***must*** be organic in USA. (Non organic strawberries in USA use a dangerous pesticide banned in Europe.)

I have a lemon tree, but if you don't, get lemons to make salad dressing with.


**Jars and cans:**


Mixed nuts, olive oil, capers, artichoke hearts, whatever spices arouse my fancy; (if you are not sure which to get, Oregano goes with just about everything!) 
Canned tomatoes, sardines, chicken broth. Salt, pepper if necessary. 

Drinks: depends what you drink. We only get loose leaf organic tea not yet available from Costco's. That's one thing I have to get elsewhere.
My husband gets his own coffee. I wouldn't dare :-)


Hope this list gets newbies started. Good luck and have fun!

Am dat la Unibuc la info simplu si am picat, desi la admitere am avut solutii identice cu un amic. El a intrat cu 7, eu cu 4. Poate mi-au scazut pt punctaj mic, habar n-am. Nu am intrat, oricum. Ca facultate tehnica, cred ca e cea mai OK din Bucuresti.

Fereste-te de Poli ca de ciuma. Nu merita. Da, se plateste bine, dar nu merita nervii pierduti. Am un prieten care e la Automatica, a avut printre cele mai mari note de pe acolo, si profii isi bat joc de el pentru ca cartof. Bataie de joc peste tot. Daca vrei fizica, vag am auzit chestii ok de Faculatea de Fizica. Nu bag mana in foc acolo, totusi.
 
Am intrat la UTCB, la Hidrotehnica, sectia Automatica si Informatica Aplicata (A.I.A., si da, chiar ii spuneam ""aia"".). AIA e o sectie din care, cum spunea si un prof de acolo, nu iesi nici cal, nici magar.  Nu prea ai cu cine vorbi, nu faci cine stie ce, e materie de Poli redusa masiv, dar tot e un fel de jaf.

La UBB e altceva. Sectia de germana merita, crede-ma. Nu stiu daca se invata mai bine informatica decat la limba romana, dar profii sunt decenti. Exista 2 firme care suporta facultatea. Vezi ca multe firme suporta facultati, dar la noi nu e ceva de forma pentru deductii din taxe. E posibil sa mai vina una. Iar cele care sunt deja sunt Porsche-MHP si EBS. Ei vor face diverse, jen: daca nu ai multi bani iti este imprumutat laptop folosit de firma (niste Thinkpad-uri destul de decente); EBS ne-a invitat la balul de Craciun, si la niste foarte multe workshop-uri.

Hastings Ismay stated the original purpose of NATO best in my mind, ""To keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down."" 

As of the end of the Cold War NATO is still fulfilling two of its original policy objectives, and has changed the third. I'm wording it poorly but I believe the third goal is now, act as a base in support of projecting and securing American hedgemony across the globe. 

The question to my mind is not, is it fair for the US to be subsidizing European economies by taking care of their defense spending, but rather is it worth it based on our current global position. To my mind the answer is maybe with a caveat. If we cannot get our budget deficit into some form of surplus and begin paying down the debt I believe the US will collapse under the weight of its own commitments.

With the rise of China and the rereise of Russia I believe we no longer are in a position to be a force for global hedgemony. We are going to need to pick and choose our battles and our friends. 

Does NATO need to pick up its ""fair"" share immediately in realpolitik terms? Probably not. But if European countries want America stable and in Europe long term they better get their shit together quickly because we're going broke. 

At the end of the day Hillary Clinton believes that we can keep the American Empire, if you want to call it that, and Donald Trump does not think that it's maintaince is sustainable. 

And frankly Zbigniew Brzezinski, the architect of our modern ""empire"" no longer thinks we can maintain it.

God damnit I just talked myself into actually supporting Trump. We can't afford the economic realities of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy.

Despite my proclivity of posting on /r/the_Donald I havnt actually been sold on a Trump presidency because of his position on trade. I got my degree in economics and free trade rises all boats period. It may take awhile for us to see the benefits, but it is mathematical fact that over the long term it god damn works. And yes I know that most other, read poorer, countries gain from trade more quickly than we do but we still gain. 

Also despite all the talk of 5d chess/whatever I genuinely didn't believe that Trump could interact with world leaders in a constructive manner. Good job on Mexico Mr. Trump you helped push me over the edge.

You acknowledge you do not know how the law works.  Somehow your ignorance is completely irrelevant?

&gt; There are 4 examples here:

You consider two paragraphs in wikipedia enough information to understand a case that took years and millions of dollars to adjudicate?

&gt; For example, the tribunals are secretive and they and the public may not even know of current or past cases because there's no obligation to reveal them to the public.

Provide a link to an article that broke the news of a secret case in the ISDS that involved the US government.  ISDS is part of about 3,000 trade agreements worldwide.  How Egypt - Yemen (just an example no idea if they have a BIT) decide to conduct business in no way reflects or influences how the US operates in international affairs.

Arbitration in general is not conducted in open forums, can not really tell you why.  I guess it is an agreed upon system by the two parties before they sign an agreement.  Probably cost of proper facilities, security, etc.

[The ISDS Blog (odd for a secretive system to have a blog?) talks about the issue and more transparency is being added to the system](http://isdsblog.com/category/uncitral/).  Plenty of more information can be learned about ISDS from this source.  

[NGOs can file to be a ""friend of the court'](http://isdsblog.com/2015/09/04/ngo-voices-in-isds/), very odd for a secret organization?  How do NGOs learn about these secret cases?

[Database of ISDS cases](http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/ISDS), where is the secrecy?

[Public access to documents form ISDS cases](http://www.italaw.com/), terrible secrecy!

&gt; Anyway, investors and corporations should not have this right at all. So a country behaves badly. Then investors don't invest. The semi-free market in action.

We have found a basic difference we have.  You think that will make for a better world, I don't.

&gt; You reject all evidence like a climate denier. It happens in front of your eyes and still you have to go back to the document. It's like me saying, ""look, I see a start millions of times bigger than the sun (Cynais Majoris)."" And you responding, ""The laws of physics don't allow that so no, it's not possible."" Ridiculous.

You keep using sources such as HuffPo and Buzzfeed?  The two most common issues I see regularly miss reported by media sources are legal and scientific issues.  Through in political ideologies and they become a waste of time.

[Facts about a few common cases cited on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/390p5l/over_2000000_europeans_have_now_signed_the/cs0hyfx), shows reality is more complex than a sentence or two in a blog.

&gt; Above people even use ISDS to escape criminal convictions. All this is to illustrate the reality.

They sound odd / suspicious but again a sentence or two from a blog post mean nothing to me.  The only thing they might do is cause me to do more research and ;learn what the cases were about.

I can assure you there is no court system in the world that I could not find cases that I question the outcome.  Upon more research I might understand how they came to the decision but still may not agree with the decision legally or based on my own personal beliefs.  The ladder and two dollars will get me a cup of coffee.

""Who do these pigs think they are, offering us our country back and expecting us to be grateful?"" He spat, through his ruined jaw, still visibly scarred by the wires holding his replacement jawbone in. ""They should be begging forgiveness for the children they starved!""

Casimir looked the man over. This was why he was here. Claude was a very clever man, very persuasive. Casimir knew very well that if he left politics and retired to the Riviera or somewhere, that Claude would have no difficulty stirring up the people. The centre-right would be routed. This man, or someone like him, would no doubt re-build the economy, but it wouldn't be a peaceful economy. Not at all.

Compromise pained Casimir, just as it pained him not to be able to enforce the isolation of France as he sincerely wished to.

""Claude, if we reject this deal, what do you think the Germans will do?""

""They'll keep killing our children, won't they? Starving us, and leeching funds meant for France!""

""Why do you say that, Claude? The Germans have been better occupiers now than they were 100 years ago.""

""Well then, why is France still poor? $27,000 GDP? You know better than anyone, Casimir, that we should rightfully be on $60k or even $80k by now! This Northern League ""bailout"" - what are they doing with the rest of the money they stole from us? What are they doing about the art we lost?""

""Claude, be calm. You know how war affects us. I lost people too. I supported complete autarky, as you know, Claude. We both fought NATO even after we couldn't fight any more. France simply cannot survive by itself, we've seen that.""

Claude stood straight, his jaw clenched and his fists tight on the broken files they were using while the supply chains from India were being re-established. 

""Look at us, Claude. We're broken. Our nation is in ruins.""

""And it's all THEIR FAULT!"" Claude raised his voice, gesticulating wildly, pointing East - towards Berlin.

Casimir sat patiently while Claude seethed. Perhaps, in hindsight, he should have told the frightened young German diplomat to wait and meet at their Embassy. Walking the streets in new clothes showed everyone who you were, but having the door opened to an angry man with half his face missing would be enough to scare anyone. Asking for Casimir Moreau in obviously-accented English wasn't such a great move, either. But, the diplomat came and went, despite dirty looks from the locals. 

""It's not their fault. But that's not what we're arguing here, Claude. We have a duty, to ourselves, and to France. Imagine the suffering we've been through - remember your wife? How she went hungry for days during the Siege of Paris to feed your little Henri? We have a responsibility never to allow something like this to happen again.""

""How?"" Claude demanded. ""This deal is nonsense. It's nothing. It's the *Germans* trying to get out of the mess they caused!"" 

""No, Claude. Lady France may be broken, but we're still better off than much of Eastern Europe. Our lives here, now, - this is every day for people in Poland, in Slovenia, in Hungary. The Germans are extending a hand, to cooperate. To work with us. The Government already chose that path. We can choose it, too. They're offering to work with us - imagine the possibilities, Claude. Your descendants will never have to go hungry again. We can eradicate war from Europe permanently. You and I can ensure the horrors of starvation and misery never stand at a European's door again. Imagine it, Claude - imagine the warfighting machines of France, Germany, Italy, all under one command, unified, unable to kill each other, unable to starve out a great city like Paris ever again. Paris was once the largest city in Europe. It still is one of the largest, even with half the population gone.""

Claude said nothing. 

""Claude, listen to me. Your hatred of the Germans - it's not beneficial. Yes, they seized Strasbourg, and took our border on the Rhine; but France is so much more than L'Hexagone or just a place. France is an idea, Claude - she is Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood. She is freedom from want and a sense of pride in your achievements, not whoever happens to fly their flag over Lorraine. The Germans aren't offering us ""our country"", they're offering us so much more. They're offering us the chance to work with them, to shape Europe, to mould it in the image that Napoleon wanted. Tie France and Germany together, Claude, and who can stop us? Expand that to the whole of Europe and we will shape the world! Imagine **that**, Claude, when you think about the future. Europe, holding hands in freedom, and equality, guiding the world towards peace and brotherhood. Don't imagine the jackbooted neo-Gaullists taking pot shots at Germans in the ruins of Cologne. I've always said war is the worst option, and keeping France's ideas alive is the best - but this is the best compromise we're going to get.""

Casimir leant back, his eyes unreadable. ""Now go home, Claude. Take the evening off. Go for a stroll along the Seine. Go and visit your wife's grave. Pray that one day the war memorials are simply relics and historical points of interest. Make the phonecalls, to Marianne, and Martel, and whoever leads the errant partisans in Bourges. Call the ""Resistance"" in Strasbourg, and get them to come home. Let them know about the terms, and let them know what we're doing. If they don't want to trust the Germans, tell them to trust me - give this plan until the end of 2046. Let them know that if there are still Germans in France by then, they can take up arms once more, but first get them to wait and see.""

""Go, Claude - I have an offer to accept.""

After Hitler decided to invade Russia he took alot of troops from the Mediterranean area to fight in Russia and at this time the allied had some momentum in Northern Afrika. This momentum came after many setbacks in Afrika, so thr allied knew that this was the time to begin the invasion of Europe, which until then seemed impossible.

France wasn't an ideal place to invade based on the massive troop support in western Europe, both from Spain and Germany. Also Hitler made himself famous by his fortresses which was dominating the western coast of Europe. So, the allied now knew with the momentum in Afrika + the momentum in Russia the northern Mediterranean was know open for an assault. 

The hope of a successful invasion of Sicily and the recent succes in Russia, would make it possible to attack Europe from 2 sides. The invasion wss tough, but the speed in which they progressed in Italy made Germany stand on their heels and the allied was know able to choke Germany, which lead to the invasion of Normandy.

It has brick-and-mortar shops all over Europe, with real cash registers ringing up real sales. This is also the case in Ireland, whereby the Irish government levies the appropriate and legislated tax upon any profits made. We collect the money that is owed to us, nothing more. 

Revenue have repeatedly stated in very clear and unambiguous terms that Apple received no special deal, treatment, or consideration. They have also stated that Apple asked if their tax setup was legal in Ireland - which it is and was - which Revenue confirmed for them. That's the sum total of it, despite everyone wanting to shit all over our 'useless politicians' for the 102nd time today. 

If European countries allow monies collected from sales within their jurisdiction to leave their state without tax being paid on it, that's not Ireland's business. If the US political system is so fundamentally fucked that they have to arrange for American companies to 'repatriate' money home - and never at the 35% rate - every five years or so because they can't fix their byzantine tax code, that's not Ireland's business. If American politicians cannot enforce ethical standards of business practices on American companies (so a head office is resident nowhere on earth), that's not Ireland's business. 

This is a perfect storm of US political corruption coming home to roost, an EU looking to expand its authority into member-state's tax regimes, and a patsy nation no-one gives a shit about really and of whom everyone would willingly believe fucked up: Ireland. 

When was the last time you ever heard any EU commissioner complain even half-heartedly about the UK, whose dependency of the Cayman Islands is *literally* short-hand for financial corruption, and where Facebook paid less than £5,000 in tax for 2015? What was the name of the last EU bureaucrat to slam the tax policies of the Netherlands, or Luxembourg, or any other EU country who have long-standing and internationally recognised systems in place to facilitate up-front tax avoidance? Doesn't happen. Won't happen. 

The EU - and by 'the EU' I mean Germany and it's mouthpiece the Netherlands - want tax regimes within the bloc to be 'harmonised'. That means they want the EU (again, Germany) to be able to tell countries how much tax to levy and on what. It's the last semblance of sovereignty member states have. This is not some secret, they've been heading for it for years. This is just the first big play they've made in pursuit of that aim. Naturally, Merkel is staying stumm to avoid it looking like what it is, despite issuing statements almost daily from the recession to the migrant crises.

Now, you might argue the minutiae of the case: shell corporations, sub-companies, residency, tax laws, etc., but none of those details is the point. The EU is finally testing out a mechanism by which to dictate tax policy to member states. They are doing this via a competition-law channel which should have nothing to do with tax. They are doing this via an arm of the EU entirely staffed by people whose wages are paid by the EU and no EU citizen ever elected. 

The technical rights-and-wrongs of the case are, to my mind at least, almost irrelevant. The EU doesn't know when to stop. It keeps going and going, driven by a bureaucracy seeking new ways to justify its own existence and fuelled by a central power that holds efficiency and conformity above all else. It's a project that has morphed beyond all recognition from what it was intended, and voted, to be. They have no compunction over announcing to the world that Ireland is a tax haven. That Ireland is siphoning off money that belongs to the masses of Europe. That Ireland is in some form of corrupt cahoots with the evil mega-corps. Fellow member states are even encouraged to seek their own slice of the pie (when apparently it *also* is entirely owed to us, like Schrodinger's debt). They know we universally loathe our politicians, so they adroitly let it be known that we could spend all that lovely money on *anything we want* (despite on the other hand insisting that we still owe them tens of billions in debt for money that doesn't exist). They are also hanging Ireland out to dry for a tax system that has not existed for four years. And saying we need to penalise Apple retroactively for breaking laws we told them they weren't breaking and for not collecting taxes owed to other countries. It's appalling.

I sincerely, deeply, hope that Ireland fights this tooth and claw, if it costs us another €13bn to do it. To paraphrase Michael O'Leary (something I never though would happen), the EU needs to be told to 'Fuck Off' every once in a while, for its own good.

The sad reality is that we can't really predict who's going to turn as these people aren't *typically* highly trained operatives that have been inserted.  They're someone who essentially wanted (or felt compelled) to do something violent, and then they see this call from ISIS that people should commit acts of violence for reason XYZ, and then they feel like they've got support and a reason for being violent.

Ils ont fait l'effort exprès de souligner tous les torts du monde  dont ils peuvent concevoir qui sont passés au cours des 300 dernières années (comme s'ils existent toujours) sans souligner, féliciter, avancer ou reconnaître le bon qui est en train d'arriver et l'évolution positive de plusieurs courants actuels à travers le pays.    

Et sur un niveau personnel, dans leur section sur l'Alberta, ils disent *""Il n'est certainement pas facile d'être francophone en Alberta.""*  Ils savent quoi au juste de moi, de mes amis, pairs, collègues, famille, voisins?  CEFAN nous traite, les francophones de l'AB, comme des rats sans espoir dans un bol de l'eau bouillante, sans jamais mentionner les réalités positives sur le terrain, les améliorations en AB, et les raisons pour lesquelles on est plus apte à garder / travailler dans / se faire eduqué dans / interagir avec le gouvernement provincial dans notre français en ce moment-ci que dans tout autre moment de notre histoire.

It's also worth keeping in mind that the trend in Europe has been away from mandatory service since it is a callback to the days of nationalistic fervor that led to the World Wars, costs a great deal of money and imposes a negative economic impact, and produces soldiers that are largely incapable and who drag down regular unit morale who would much rather be there.

And it provides them very little benefit. It's shite in comparison to what unionised workforces receive.

The law sets out minimum statutory obligations on both employers and employees, especially with regard to their rights. It does not set out to favour one or the other inherently, and it certainly doesn't intend to cover within its scope all the activities of both parties. That's what the contracts do.

There is no law, for example, regulating whether any employee is entitled to an annual raise, or whether a certain request is justified or unjustified. So requesting one, or receiving one, is a matter of contract between the parties.

Non-unionised workers left to the meager protections of labour law are in other words left almost totally to the whims of their employers.

And compensation determined by the labour market only has any value to employees when scarcity is involved. And scarce jobs aren't the only jobs that have value and should be protected.

&gt; The only function of a union in a regime that has strong labour laws (like .ie and most of europe) 

Ireland have terrible labour laws in comparison to many other places in Europe. An employee has a right to join a union, but the union doesn't have to be recognised. We have no collective bargaining rights. Any strong labour regime would have these.

&gt;Air traffic controllers need a union.  People who clean toilets do not.

It's the other way around. Air traffic controllers are scarce and can command a greater salary because of it. Toilet cleaners are not scarce and that's why they get screwed and put on zero hour contracts. And it's why they need to be protected so they can have some measure of job security.

&gt;it is the de-facto function of a union to always have an antagonistic relationship with the employer

That's not true. You can't blame the relationship of a union to management in a system that is set up to create antagonism in the first place. In our system currently there is zero onus on management to address concerns or requests from employees. There are no laws which state that either do they have to provide some standardised offerings (salary, yearly increase, benefits, etc), or engage with the union if the collective organisation which represents the employees seeks these from them. 

Unions would be redundant if there were standardised (or regulated) elements to every kind of job. But there aren't, and as along as it's a matter of contract, unions would be necessary to achieve the optimal result in all but cases where a certain employee is either so rare or so integral to success that the dependency is reversed.

&gt; Look at any shop steward in the country - it's always the most reactionary extremist at the workplace - if they weren't, they'd be replaced. 

But that's a bit irrelevant. Excusing for a minute the negative connotation of 'reactionary', it's the shop steward's job to be the most 'class conscious' or the most antagonistic of the bunch. Because the system is adversarial in general, someone has to be the one who purely represents the labour side. It's precisely their job to agitate for the most change they can get.

You forget that management in companies routinely stonewall unions until they are forced into industrial action. I will invoke the Luas situation here--as we watched it unfold together on this sub. Your man who represented Transdev, if you recall, first stated that Transdev could not pay *any* increases. None. And he stated that none would be forthcoming because the Luas wasn't profitable.

Later on, he came around to making an offer after the first series of strikes. And the union drivers rejected it because it paid new guys less for the same job. And so on until the Labour Court got involved, and a deal was reached.

So if he had space to pay increases, then there was no reason to stonewall at all. Unless of course he thought the unions would simply give up. Which they were resolved not to do.

Alternatively the parties could have sat down and haggled out the amount of raise without needing a strike. But it became necessary because Transdev management were just as antagonistic to the union as you say the union is to them.",,1472751422.0,1475237751,t3_50n1rb,d75n9va

Overall, about [three in four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_immigration_to_Mexico) immigrants to Mexico hail from the US. Millions of American patients [cross the border](http://www.chron.com/news/health/article/More-Americans-seeking-foreign-health-care-1819568.php) looking for affordable healthcare. With the passage of the TPP in the last months of Obama's second term, pharmaceutical companies--who had already been flirting with price-gouging in the US--found themselves in an [even stronger](http://www.chron.com/news/health/article/More-Americans-seeking-foreign-health-care-1819568.php) bargaining position, driving healthcare costs unprecedented levels. Trends like these converged with widespread anxiety surrounding then-candidate Trump's nativist rhetoric and hard line on illegal immigration to create a huge influx migrants crossing the border into Mexico from the US, many of whom were illegal.  The Mexican government struggled to stem the flow, but lacked the resources to do so due to ongoing drug conflict. By the end of Trump's first 100 days in office, the Mexican government had begun to construct a border wall, which it is fully paying for.

Meanwhile, President Trump is largely focused on responding the healthcare crisis in the US. Advisors are pushing him to intervene in the Middle East, but he's not interested in going back to Iraq; he's too focused on getting screwed. He hates getting screwed.

 ""These pharma guys, they're getting away with murder!"" he says. ""Let me talk to them. You know, I wrote this really great book, *Art of the Deal*, everybody should read it. I don't like to brag, but everybody knows I'm a master negotiator. So I think I should talk to these guys.""

But there's a problem: his advisors inform him that the US government is actually [forbidden](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/) from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. As it turns out, this is a fundamental problem with American healthcare, as it creates a dynamic in which US consumers [effectively subsidize](http://www.ibtimes.com/how-us-subsidizes-cheap-drugs-europe-2112662) cheaper drugs in Europe. This is exactly the kind of thing that drives the Donald up a wall. 

So he launches a campaign to fix it. In doing so, he finds an unlikely ally: Senator [Bernie Sanders](http://www.ibtimes.com/bernie-sanders-vows-fix-broken-prison-system-lower-prescription-drug-prices-2088837).  The two use their newfound influence--won during the previous presidential campaign--to work the miracle of miracles: creating a bipartisan consensus on a fundamental problem with American healthcare.

The problem is, even with the reforms, the US government can only negotiate prices for Medicare patients; insurance companies are left to negotiate their own prices, which they can't do as effectively. Furthermore, the limited availability of Medicare undermines the government's own bargaining position. Soon, Medicare patients paying lower drug prices translates into *even higher* prices for those with private insurance purchased through Obamacare exchanges. Allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for such a limited program isn't cutting it. 

Meanwhile, Mexico is making progress building the wall,  illegal American immigrants are finding it harder and harder to get into Mexico--yet they also find conditions in the US increasingly uncomfortable. The political will for major top-down reforms to the US healthcare system is growing once again: on the one hand, the people are alarmed by the rapidly rising costs of care, and on the other, they're encouraged by the ease with which the latest round of reforms passed through a for-once-not-gridlocked Congress.

Late one night, Trump is chilling in the President's Bedroom, drinking beer and doing his favorite thing: watching videos of himself. Wondering how he got into this mess, he pulls up a [clip](http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2016_CNN_GOP_Town_Hall_Donald_Trump.htm) from one of the primary debates:

&gt; TRUMP: Well, I like the mandate. I don't want people dying on the streets. The Republican people, they don't want people dying on the streets, but sometimes they'll say ""Donald Trump wants single payer.""

&gt;Q: Will people with pre-existing conditions be able to get insurance?

&gt;TRUMP: Yes. Now, the new plan is good. It's going to be inexpensive. It's going to be much better for the people at the bottom, people that don't have any money. We're going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare. Now, some people would say, ""that's not a very Republican thing to say."" That's not single payer, by the way. That's called heart. We gotta take care of people that can't take care of themselves.

Thinking back to his successful collaboration with Bernie Sanders a few months before, he realizes what has to happen: if he wants to bargain the pharma companies into a corner, he needs  a better bargaining chip. He needs Medicare to be even bigger.

""How much bigger?"" Asks Ivanka.

""The biggest,"" he tells her. ""Everybody will be part of it and everybody will love it. It's gonna be the greatest thing ever.""

The corporate Democrats find themselves backed into a corner: Trump or no Trump, there's no way they can publicly oppose Medicare-for-all without pointing the the specter of ""plunging this nation into another contentious debate over healthcare""--particularly when Obamacare is getting *farther* from its goal of universal, affordable healthcare, not closer. Some factions of the GOP decry the decision as a betrayal, but party loyalty--and growing pressure from Americans unable to either afford their premiums or escape to Mexico--is enough to keep most in line. 

Once again, foreign policy advisors are pressing Trump to get involved in a conflict int he Middle East; this time they want him to take action to support a coup in Latin America, too. But he doesn't have the attention span for that. During the debate surrounding Medicare-for-all, the insurance companies pissed him off. When his plan passes easily, he gives a press conference in which he gesticulates in the general direction of the insurance companies: ""You're fired!"" he declares. ""Now let's negotiate with these pharma guys. They're all scammers! Sad.""

The elimination of the health insurance lobby (and the sharp reduction in the influence of the big pharma lobby produced by strict new rules in the new Medicare-for-all reforms designed to ensure that the government actually used its ability to bargain for lower prices, rather than as a corporate giveaway for rent-seeking firms) had an unexpected side effect: state legislatures suddenly found it far easier--and far more politically feasible--to pass legislation legalizing cannabis. When asked to take a position on this issue, Donald mostly reverted to self-congratulation; after all, he'd expressed his support for [allowing legalization](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/29/trump-wants-marijuana-legalization-decided-at-the-state-level/) at the state level during his presidential campaign, and that they could do it now, thanks to him, was just great. Drug arrests plummeted, revenues began to climb, and prison populations gradually began to fall.

The speed with which these changes took place, however, created serious instabilities in the ecosystem of Mexico's illicit drug trade, as one of the cartels' major revenue streams all but evaporated overnight--particularly concerning since the wall had significantly raised the costs of cross-border smuggling. Competition over a smaller market led to increased infighting, and drug violence rose to unprecedented levels south of the border.

This time, however, the American population wasn't content to just shake their heads sadly at the violence they saw on the news: thanks to the Great American Exodus of 2016-2018, virtually every American knew someone, whether family member or friend, living in Mexico. Tragic stories of Americans trapped south of the Wall and victimized by escalating drug violence filled the airwaves.

Once again, Trump's advisors pushed for a military intervention--and Trump was tempted. But he thought of himself as a businessman, and he'd never liked the idea of spending American taxpayers' money to do Mexico's dirty work.  Besides, he'd always thought [the drug war](http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Donald_Trump_Drugs.htm) was bullshit anyway.

""Look, these cartel guys, these drug traffickers, they're not stupid,"" he explained. ""They're not like our politicians over here. They're very clever. Very sharp, very dangerous. And they know it's dangerous. And you know why they do it? I'll tell you why they do it. Because they like money. It's simple. Any idiot can see it. If they can't make money, you think they're gonna risk getting shot? Don't get me wrong, I would love it--love it--if they did, because these guys, I would shoot them in a heartbeat. But they won't. They're a bunch of cowards trying to get rich.""

And that's the story of how Donald Trump managed to get Mexico to build the wall and pay for it, get rid of Obamacare, achieve universal healthcare, and end the drug war, all in his first term.

Le PKK est né au début des années 80, un mouvement indépendantiste qui a pris racine dans la répression et le ""génocide"" culturel et identitaire kurde, commencé réellement sans raison par les nationalistes turques. Kurdes et turques vivaient en harmonie, tout le monde était content avant que la répression totalitaire ne se soit abattue sur les minorités en Turquie. En effet, la langue kurde était interdite. Si tu parlais kurde dans la rue, tu risquais la prison, ou de disparaitre. Bref, s'il y a bien un truc à ne pas faire, c'est venir faire chier des montagnards qui aiment vivre en liberté. Le PKK a porté les armes pour libérer le peuple kurde de l'oppression. Voilà ce qui s'est passé: 

&gt; According to human rights organisations since the beginning of the uprising 4,000 villages have been destroyed,[42] in which between 380,000 and 1,000,000 Kurdish villagers have been forcibly evacuated from their homes.[244] Some 5,000 Turks and 35,000 Kurds,[42] have been killed, 17,000 Kurds have disappeared and 119,000 Kurds have been imprisoned by Turkish authorities.[38][42] According to the Humanitarian Law Project, 2,400 Kurdish villages were destroyed and 18,000 Kurds were executed, by the Turkish government.[244] In total up to 3,000,000 people (mainly Kurds) have been displaced by the conflict,[44] an estimated 1,000,000 of which are still internally displaced as of 2009.[245] The Assyrian Minority was heavily affected as well, as now most (50-60 thousand/70,000) of its population is in refuge in Europe.

La lutte armée est une continuité d'une lutte politique échouée. La Turquie jusqu'à la fin des années 90, et maintenant de nouveau depuis 2-3 ans, n'a jamais été une réelle démocratie. Tout mouvement pacifiste kurde à été réprimé par la force. Les politiciens du parti progressiste pro-kurde HDP ont perdus leur immunité parlementaire et risquent de se faire jeter en prison à n'importe quel moment. 

Moi ce que j'adore c'est les turques qui me disent ""mais tout ça c'est dans le passé, maintenant vous avez des droits"". Ah mais dis donc, mais c'est génial ça!! Oh tu sais quoi, on va tout oublier, parce que maintenant si je parle kurde dans la rue je risque pas de croupir en taule, les femmes de mon village ne se feront pas violer et en plus il ne sera pas détruit! Trop cool, merci les gars, je vous remercie du fond du coeur. 

En plus dans les récents clashs, des villes comme Nusaybin ou Sirnak ont été détruits à plus de 80%. Il y a quelques mois, des gens ont été brûlés vifs dans leurs caves. Brûlés vifs. Un avocat pro kurde s'est fait descendre en pleine ville. Voilà ce que ça veut dire la démocratie en Turquie, voilà le choix que l'on a en tant que Kurde:

Quand tu as en main des cartes de merde, tu ne peux que jouer une partie de merde. Tout, littéralement **tout** pourrait être résolu, si seulement les turques acceptaient de négocier avec les kurdes, pour leur donner leur putain d'autonomie. C'est pas trop demander quand même, non?

Arab people who happened to be Islamic absolutely did, but it was probably more in spite of Islam than because of it, in the same way that the West's great contributions to modernity (democracy and capitalism) were largely secular developments. 

You will hear some claim that democratic thought and early capitalistic theory have their root in Judaeo-Christian values or work ethics, but you will mostly hear it from religious fundamentalists - people who have studied neither democratic nor economic theory, and who have a mostly mythological understanding of historic 'Judaeo-Christian values'. The need to attribute the Middle East's 'Golden Age' to Islam is much more pervasive among secular and mainstream religious people for a number of reasons, which I won't get into unless prompted.

I'm not taking a bigoted stance here, or arguing that Arabs simply maintained European and broader Mediterranean innovations while the West struggled with its own bout of theocratic hysteria (see also: The Dark Ages). Middle Easterners weren't mere 'custodians' of Western scholarship. They were inventors and innovators on their own. Arabs and Persians (that is to say 'non-white', 'non-European' peoples from the Middle East) have had and continue to have a huge impact on mankind's continued quest to understand the mysteries of our shared existence, through the natural and social sciences, through art and literature, through reason and spirituality. (This is my disclaimer I feel obligated to employ whenever I try to make this point in real life, so bear with me fellow internetters if you've heard it before.)

Nobody is implying that Arab people in general OR Muslims in particular will be forever doomed to live under regimes that take advantage of the technology of the modern age yet deny their subjects the more value-laden benefits of modernity. Nobody is implying they need to be saved or civilized by white culture founders or state builders. They're just saying that, in general, Islamic (and possibly by extension all) theistic thinking holds people back. It works the same way for groups of any race, creed, color, sex, disability status, gender or sex identification, or any other sometime-protected status one might bring up.

The current system as well as most others I've come across

&gt;Boards that keep checks aren't going to pop up on their own. The countries that have the kinds of boards you are talking about with stakeholders having representation as well as shareholders to balance out short term versus long-term interests mandate such representation in their corporate law. Left to itself, capitalism won't create boards that have a check on short-term profit-maximization share holder influences.

I don't recall advocating for ""leaving capitalism to itself"". Even so, I'm not sure I agree, but I'm not an anarchist.

&gt;Why isn't it corruption? An organization is being damaged by the actions of its leaders that are taken in their own self-interest at the expense of the organization's sustainability. We label similar behavior in any organization that's not a business as corruption so why do we have a double standard?

Fact of the matter is that in the current system, business owners rightfully own their businesses and they could fire their employees and burn the building down if they so wished. Whether you agree with it or not, comparing corruption to handling private property as you wish isn't very useful.

&gt;It is absolutely not mild. This practice is what made many of America's businesses uncompetitive in the global market and was instrumental in the decline of the American auto industry, which 14 million jobs are tied to. It was also instrumental in the decline of American manufacturing as a whole - compare the job loss in manufacturing as a percentage of total employment in America vs. Germany since 2000 (when China entered the WTO). It's not even close. Everyone blames unions for demanding higher pay but German autoworkers and their manufacturing workers in general make significantly more than their American counterparts, yet their car industry didn't have the kinds of existential crises that the American auto industry had. When executives and major shareholders make companies spend exorbitant amounts of money buying back shares rather than reinvesting in the enterprise, the enterprise becomes less competitive and loses its market share and/or its finances become a mess.

I still believe these to be mild compared to the potential consequences of a system like what you propose. Also, Germany has capitalism in just the same way that the rest of Europe and the US has capitalism. Something would indicate that capitalism isn't what's causing one country to fail and the other to work fine (not that I'd claim that one is failing and one is working fine but that seems to be your claim)

&gt;Because laissez-faire capitalism leads to enterprises being entirely governed by shareholders. There were certain regulations that existed prior to the late 80s that were undone which made it easier for shareholders to corrupt CEOs by tying their compensation excessively to stock price and made it easier for major shareholders to influence corporate decision making (whereas before stakeholders had more power in counteracting those short term interests).

I don't see how you can draw conclusions about laissez-faire capitalism from this, even if I just accept your claim.

&gt;Right and accountability won't exist unless the interests of capitalist shareholders and stakeholders are more balanced in influencing corporate decision making. For example, in German companies the board of directors is split 50/50 between shareholders and workers' representatives who are elected. Furthermore, many German companies are largely funded by banks vs. dependent on equity financing in comparison to American corporations. In the case of the manufacturing industry, German banks often have significant ownership of both German manufacturers and German suppliers. So banks lend favorably to the companies they have ownership in which means the German companies are less dependent on equity financing than an American company would be, so this limits the influence of individual shareholders who can just buy and sell large chunks of ownership in a short time to make massive money for themselves at the expense of the company.

&gt;Inconvenient facts such as the CIA spending 1 billion a year to finance, arm and train the rebels are omitted. Same for the TOW program, same for the US greenlighting the Gulf States and Turkey to weaponize the rebels at a conference in Riyadh in 2012.

U.S spent around 1.6 trillion dollars in Iraq/Afghanistan Wars.You can't achieve anything with spending a billion dollar or couple billion dollars.

&gt;No matter what happens in Syria these propagandists are committed to carrying away only one message: See, see what happens when the US takes a backseat on the world stage? This is why we need to be more involved around the world (destabilizing), this is why we need a greater military presence in X (creates tensions), this is why we need to go to war with Y (unjustified).

There are 2.7 million refrugees in Turkey, and around a million refrugees in Europe because of Obama's passive foreign policy.Again , this doesn't really affect U.S except pissing off American partners.Refrugee boats can't reach to American coasts.

&gt;The truth is much more complicated, but we don't get the truth - especially when the media is dominated by the same presstitutes who lied about Iraq and Libya and received career advancements in return.

Yes , ""Neo-con"" media lies but lets look at again the possible out come of U.S foreign policies:

1)Refugees created political chaos in Europe , and possibly/arguably triggered Brexit. Brexit is not good for U.S.

2)Since U.S refused to spend money only option was to support YPG. This pushed Turkey to Russian-Shiite Axis.

3)More and more people joined ISIS because the war isn't ending.

Against these reasons , I still believe U.S made the right decision for itself not for others. U.S interventionism gifted Iraq to Iran , Libya to ISIS.

É difícil falar quanto eu tiro por mês pois isso vária, tem mês que recebo uma grana que alguém levaria quatro meses para receber numa empresa trabalhando de CLT, mas tem mês que eu não consigo projeto nenhum, entende? 

A minha recomendação é que você comece trabalhando por hora em sites como o fiverr e o 99freelas. Eles não pagam muito bem mas é um bom lugar para começar a fazer contatos. É importante ter um site mostrando seus projetos, assim como um blog. A maioria dos clientes aparecem por recomendação de outras empresas com as quais eu trabalhei anteriormente, por isso manter uma boa relação com essas pessoas é primordial. Abrir uma empresa é algo que você será obrigado a fazer também, já que a maioria das agências só trabalham com PJ. 

Não sei qual é a sua área de atuação, mas se você quer começar a trabalhar remotamente, é importantíssimo que você tenha um lugar onde mostrar seus trabalhos anteriores e que você tenha participado de algum projeto open source. As empresas avaliam bem  esse tipo de coisa, sem contar que as pessoas envolvidas em projetos open source geralmente são muito fodas no que fazem, e ter amizade com esse tipo de profissional é incrível. 

No começo trabalhe por hora, não por projeto;

Você vai pegar vai ter que recusar projetos de R$ 30k porque você aceitou um de R$5k dois dias antes;

Você precisa ser muito disciplina (de preferência tenha um espaço só para o trabalho);

Faça o máximo de amizades possível. O número de projetos que peguei no começo porque um amigo já estava com projetos demais foi o que me ajudou a criar certa estabilidade.

As dicas que eu dei são baseadas na minha experiência. O mercado de iOS e Android estão aquecidos, por isso é mais fácil encontrar trabalhos, não sei quanto a área que você pretende seguir. Quanto ao dinheiro, você vai ganhar mais dinheiro do que trabalhando dentro de um escritório porque o projeto todo é seu, e com isso as responsabilidades, prazos e reclamações também são da sua conta.

False,WarCollege,mod,MI13,t3_50dpyd,9,1472757212,0,t5_39t8u,,0,9,"Paid service was a much more common (and the most reliable) way to raise troops in the medieval period than is often suspected. While institutions like the Assizes of Arms in England (laws which dictated what arms each class of society should own), the Anglo-Saxon *fyrd*, and similar practices in France are often pointed to as indications that most free men could be called upon for service, this belief should be viewed with skepticism. While these institutions could potentially provide troops, they were more often called upon for local defense or law enforcement/peacekeeping than for war. Edward I of England's commissions of array, where royal officials were supposed to raise quotas of soldiers from the shires, were not equivalent to a modern draft, being nowhere near as extensive and often lacking in serious enforcement. Even in Edward I's arrayss, the officers were quite often professional or semi-professional soldiers who repeatedly served in the wars, both as officers and as individual soldiers on smaller campaigns. 

The distinctions between mercenary and non-mercenary professional troops were blurry at the best of times. The dimensions of this debate have been established in the excellent volume *Mercenaries and Paid Men: The Mercenary Identity in the Middle Ages*. Even soldiers who had been raised by other means besides direct contract could often expect to be paid (for expenses such as horses and supplies like food). Does the acceptance of pay alone make a soldier a mercenary? In modern times, we might call non-nationals fighting in a foreign war mercenaries, but in the fragmented polities of pre-modern Europe, identity wasn't as clear-cut in the days before the rise of the nation-state. Sir John Hawkwood, an English soldier serving in Italy for fun and profit, is easy to identify as a mercenary, but as his career advanced, he owned lands in Italy and married into Italian aristocracy. Is his English heritage alone enough to distinguish his career as being totally different than any other Italian aristocrat-soldier in this period? At the same time, Hawkwood clearly maintained ties to his native country; he often served as a go-between for English kings who wanted to negotiate something with Italian powers. 

Likewise, we see Frenchmen of several regions serving in English armies and all sorts of backgrounds in French armies (Spanish soldiers not infrequently made their way north). While some of these are undoubtedly mercenaries, in the retinues and among gentlemen, we cannot discount the factor of social bonds between soldiers. A retinue could be a close-knit group and recruiting was often carried out within a fairly narrow demographic. From English military records, we see that the same families often contribute soldiers to both campaigns and garrisons, as both archers and men-at-arms. This implies that some families in England viewed soldiering as their trade. Military service in late medieval England was increasingly professionalized, although many participating men were not full-time career soldiers. There was a spectrum of service, from those who contracted for a single campaign and never fought again to those who lived their entire lives on battlefields and in garrisons. The military profession was a skilled trade and sometimes lucrative (although just as often ruinous). 

""Peacetime"" is something of a nebulous concept in the medieval period. While there were certainly times where no major war was active for particular countries, garrisons would still be maintained in border regions. Minor flare-ups, skirmishes, and raids were a constant concern along contested frontiers. A medieval soldier's military experience would more likely come from smaller fights like that rather than the famous field battles that history remembers better.  In the event that no companies or retinues were looking for men in the immediate region, soldiers could always travel elsewhere for employment. Out-of-work soldiers were a huge danger after the conclusion of major campaigns and the subject of much fear from ecclesiastical and secular authorities. The frontiers of the Iberian peninsula were excellent places for soldiers to find work, as was the constant tumult of medieval Italian politics. Conflict against non-Christian foes like the pagans of central/eastern Europe or against Muslim kingdoms in the Mediterranean could be profitable as well as spiritually beneficial. Some Christian soldiers found that money crossed religious barriers and found themselves in the employ of Muslim rulers. There was always a war somewhere for those who made a living from it.  

Militiamen, by definition, were not professionals, but that didn't make them incompetent. The status/competence/equipment of a militia would vary tremendously depending on their region, individual political circumstances, and nature of the urban center where they were raised. The guilds of Flemish cities were quite proud of their military skills and sometimes maintained personal relationships with the Dukes of Burgundy. The nature of their service would depend on the needs of the current campaign. In the event of a siege, everyone would be expected to contribute to the defense (which often included women). For field campaigns, militias were considered unreliable outside of their immediate locality and often discarded in favor of professional soldiers. Sometimes, smaller numbers of the most experienced or best members of the militia might be skimmed to supplement a field army. French writers in the Hundred Years War often criticized their aristocrats for not utilizing the urban militias more often, but this was not, in contrast to their claims, due to hubris and arrogance. Instead, the French aristocracy with military experience seemed to have viewed their urban militias as too varying in quality and disorganized to be of much assistance. Imperial Free Cities of the Holy Roman Empire raised full armies, with footmen, horse, and artillery. English cities like York had no need to field such complete forces and instead would contribute troops to a larger force led by the King of England or one of his lieutenants. 

This is a somewhat rambling, disorganized answer, but if you want to look at patterns of service in the medieval period, you should take a look at Mallett's *Mercenaries and their Masters*, which is a somewhat older text but a classic, as well as the book I mentioned above (edited by John France). Also try Bell and Curry' *The Soldier in Late Medieval England*. I'm not really that knowledgeable about early medieval affairs, but Guy Halsall's *War and Society in the Barbarian West: 450-900"" is excellent. ",,False,1475240943,t3_50dpyd,d75rwx9

I'm a new vegan originally from a European country where all the traditional dishes are based around meat. This was my first trip back in a few years and I had just converted to veganism, so I was really intimidated by this. I have so many fond memories of eating sausages and drinking beer with dear friends out of little stands that serve literally nothing else. It took me a lot of anguished introspection to realize that I was afraid I would now lose those moments/relationships. But then I also realizes that my friends were not assholes and would want to see me and not care about much else. So I went to the same stands, skipped the sausage and enjoyed the beer and camaraderie. 

The one thing that was more difficult was my family because they're so used to cooking with animal products. I just told my mom and asked her to break it to the rest of the family (I really didn't want to go to my grandma and arrive to a feast of dead animals that she spent half a day making and then sit there and be hungry and have her be mad at me for not eating it). We also have a family friend who hunts and I used to love eating deer, so he offered some to my mom and then gave me a piece of his mind about ""nutrients"" or whatever but it was overall way less difficult than I expected. My mom was kind enough to veganize a few recipes with my help (some simple googling) and my grandmas simply didn't make anything. One of them wanted to make me a blueberry pie to welcome me and got discouraged when my mom told her about no eggs or dairy, so she just left me the bowl of blueberries and I ate them all and it was literally the best.

Sure, I probably ate a few things that were baked with egg or cooked with butter. Just like I probably do at home because I don't investigate every ingredient of every meal. But overall I was able to maintain my new way of life while still enjoying all the things I love about home.

Sorry for the rambling response, but I hope this is helpful and relevant. All of this is to say: it's possible and probably easier than you might imagine (just like veganism in general :)).

While the canonity of the HL1 expansions is always in limbo until it takes place in an actual Valve-made Half-Life game, a lot of people seem to consider blowing up Black Mesa with a nuke very likely.

The question about returning to Black Mesa is quite often brought up and there's often discussion about if a single nuke could destroy the entire complex. Black Mesa is absolutely massive in size, most of it is built underground and it's filled with blast proof doors etc. so I think that it's likely some of Black Mesa is still intact.

However, Black Mesa does handle a ton of nuclear material and it's often handled poorly. During the tram ride in the beginning of HL1 you can see a container leaking radioactive green goop even before the resonance cascade.

The nuke might not turn the entire complex into ashes but it will create a crack that will let these radioactive materials into the air.

Think something like the Chernobyl disaster except it's not a single reactor, it's an entire facility filled with who-knows-what-experimental-materials released into the atmosphere. Also while the Soviet Union took a while with extinguishing, announcing and confining the Chernobyl reactor, the Black Mesa situation would be even worse. 

The sarcophagus to seal the area would need to be gigantic and all the nations in the world are still trying to fight the alien invasion. The Combine might be the only ones who would have had the chance to finally seal the place up and the exact timing of the Combines arrival after the resonance cascade is a bit hazy. Is it days, weeks or even months after?
So we have the Chernobyl disaster x1000 or something like that here. Imagine the effect it could have to the surrounding areas when the winds took the nuclear particles. I remember my dad telling me stories that the news were warning people about picking mushrooms when the info about the reactor finally surfaced, this was in Finland btw over 1000 km from Chernobyl.

So yeah, in my theory North America is pretty much a nuclear wasteland. Actually kinda reminds me of HL2 beta with everyone forced to use a gasmask and all.

The question about how all the former Black Mesa personnel end up in the same area seems to be popping up quite often. I don't get why this is so often brought up when to me it seems obvious. City 17 is the Combine HQ of Earth, Combines puppet human leader lives there and City 17 Citadel is the master Citadel of all the Citadels of Earth, even the Suppression field is brought down when City 17's Citadel is destroyed. So of course the key members of the Resistance want to focus on the most important Combine area on Earth.

Having Americans in European cities is just the Combine forcing people to relocate all over the place to confuse and control the people. Though if my theory has any merit they were relocated because US is now inhabitable.",,False,1475242226,t3_50j9ra,d75tqrb

Reddit had a HUGE thread about it: https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/dwolw/wikileaks_ready_to_drop_a_bombshell_on_russia_but/?

Moscow sent VERY SERIOUS threats to WL and they haven't said a ***SINGLE*** bad word about Russia since then:

http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2028283,00.html

&gt;So far Russia has had no official response. But on Wednesday, an official at the Center for Information Security of the ***FSB, Russia's secret police, gave a warning to WikiLeaks that showed none of the tact of the U.S. reply to the Iraq revelations. ""It's essential to remember that given the will and the relevant orders, [WikiLeaks] can be made inaccessible forever,"" the anonymous official told the independent Russian news website LifeNews.***

If they were honest about being anti-West, we wouldnt have to dodge about pretending to be objective sources of info. They filter whatever narrative they want to push. Anyone who offers you information, even if that information is true, should make you suspicious. What does that person have to gain from sharing it with you?

False,AskReddit,,gotthelowdown,t3_50osb0,5,1472761243,0,t5_2qh1i,,0,5,"Here are some tips I've shared before. 

In college, you have the power to add and drop classes at will.  I didn't fully take advantage of this my freshman year, and I got stuck with a Calculus 1 class I hated for a whole semester. 

The first day of school, go the registrar's office and grab a bunch of add/drop slips. Or maybe you can add/drop classes online now? 

I'd recommend **attending all the classes you are interested in** the first week of the semester. Both the required and elective classes. Even if it's the same class with different professors. I guarantee you'll like one more than the other. It will suck being so busy, but a little time invested now will pay off for the rest of the term. 

There's nothing worse than getting stuck in a class with a mean professor, while your friends are having a blast taking the same class with a better professor. You'll kick yourself the whole semester.

After the first week, drop the classes you like the least, and try to add the classes you like the most. You'll have to get the professors to sign your add/drop slips. Dropping classes is not a problem, but sometimes getting into the good classes can be hard. The professors have to prioritize upper-classmen who need the classes to fulfill the requirements for their major. 

Choose classes based on the professor and your classroom experience with them, not just based on the course description. This was a game-changer. 

As you make more friends, you can ask who the good professors are (upper-classmen will know). You'll start to hear the same names over and over. Try to get classes with the good professors and your college experience will be 10x better. 

For example, I'm not into philosophy, but I had to take a course in it as a graduation requirement. One guy got mentioned by friends over and over again. When I took his class, I could see why: he was as funny as a stand-up comedian, yet he got the ideas across. The professor makes the class, not the material.

More tips:

* Write down your assignments in a planner, whether digital or in print. I preferred to write in day planners. Cross off assignments as you finish them.

* Review your notes *right after the class*, or at least the same day. Does *wonders* for helping the information sink into your brain. Even a quick 1-minute glance-over would help a lot. Got questions? Even better! Write them down and ask the professor or a TA later. You'll look like a good student.

* Professors have ""office hours."" Use them. Get clarifications on things that confuse you, brainstorm ideas for future term papers, get their feedback on papers that were already graded and how you can improve next time. Almost no one else does these things. You'll stand out, get a better grade, build a relationship and hopefully learn more.

* When I was in college, I'd block out 2-3 hours to study in the library in the late afternoons, right before dinner. It was great time, since I was done with classes and nothing fun was happening yet. I'd get my studying in, then party and socialize at night.

* For big term papers, *start early.* Way before it's due. Small steps. Maybe write down ideas or an outline to develop later.  One tip I got from a senior as a freshman was to type in a smaller font, like 10-point font vs. 12-point font, so you'd write longer, better-developed paragraphs. Then go to the larger font when you're done (or periodically to check if you're hitting your page count).

* I also prefer to write my term papers in the computer lab, even though I had a computer in my room. Easier to get in working mode if you see other students working, and easier to avoid distractions you would have indulged in if you were in the privacy of your room. 

* For reading and memorizing, I'd go to the library.  My room is for relaxing; out of the room, I'm more productive.

* If you're typing in Microsoft Word or another word processor, set the ""auto-save"" to be as frequently as possible, like every 1 minute. It's a life-saver in case your computer crashes unexpectedly. So you won't lose the last few pages you wrote in a frenzy of inspiration.

* Back up your term papers in multiple places. Your computer, on external drives, in the cloud (like Dropbox), etc. You do not want to only have one copy of your term paper on a corrupted disk, infected computer, etc.

* For classes with a lot of rote memorization, consider using [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), a flashcard program. Hot tip: you can download ""[shared decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/)"" created by other users, e.g. Mandarin Chinese.

* Study with a partner. If you want go further, set rewards and/or punishments. ""Whoever has the lowest score on the next test has to buy the rest of us pizza."" ""Whoever gets the best grade gets his drinks paid for, for a whole night."" Public accountability and fear of shame can be big motivators. ""I want a free drink night!"" ""I'm not paying for pizza!"" ""I don't even care about the pizza, no way am I going to look dumber than them!""

* Consider taking required courses you don't like at a community college during your summers. An upper-classman gave me that tip and it worked great. I took a science class and economics class over two summers. The credit transferred as pass/fail, not affecting my GPA. Make sure to check with your registrar's office at your main college first. When your summer classes end, go see the CC registrar and fill out a request to send the transcript to your main college's registrar. You can get those classes out of the way and free up your semesters with more elective classes you're really interested in.

* Try to get some work experience while you're a student. Internships, co-ops, research projects, etc. Start researching companies and/or organizations you'd like to work for. See if they have any student programs you can get into. Take advantage of your summers for these. One of the biggest hassles graduates face is that employers want experience before giving you a job. So get some on your resume as a student, so you'll have a lead later on.

* Build your network. You can join the student chapter of professional associations. The key to networking is to meet people and build relationships *before* you need anything.  Read *[The Recession-Proof Graduate](http://charliehoehn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Recession-Proof-Graduate-by-Charlie-Hoehn2.pdf)* (free PDF) by Charlie Hoehn.

* Study abroad. It can be a financial challenge, but if you can do it, go for it. Many students say study abroad was their best semester of college. Visit your study abroad office and ask if they have ""sister school"" relationships with school overseas. This can really cut down on the amount of red tape, paperwork and bureaucracy you have to deal with. My college in the U.S. was able to transfer my financial aid to a school in England, while also accepting academic credits from the classes I took there. Those are huge headaches if you go outside your school's existing programs and relationships. I did a semester in England and backpacked around Europe. Awesome experience and lots of personal growth.

* If your dorm has coin-operated laundry facilities, keep a cup on your desk for throwing in quarters. Then you'll always have coins for laundry. There was a recreation room that had a change machine, but it was always empty because everyone knew about it. I had better luck getting rolls of quarters from the cashier window in the Administration building.

To look at the big picture, tie in how your studies relate to your goals. There are ""push"" goals and ""pull"" goals.

Push goals are about avoiding pain, e.g. ""I don't want to struggle to pay bills for the rest of my life,"" ""I don't want to live with my parents forever,"" ""I don't want to be working retail or fast-food when I'm 50"" ""I don't want to prove my ex-girlfriend/ex-boyfriend/mother/father right about calling me a failure."" The good thing about push goals is they're great for getting started. The downside is sometimes they're not enough to get you through when things get tough.

That's when you need pull goals stay motivated. Pull goals are about moving toward pleasure, e.g. ""I want work in a big nice office talking to important people every day,"" ""I want to be able to live in [insert your dream location]"" ""I want to be surrounded by cool, motivated people,"" ""I want to be a successful person"" (whatever success looks like to you). Pull goals are about keeping your eyes on the prize. So when things get tough, you can tell yourself, ""This will all be worth it when I [achieve result].""

These are just examples. Write down push and pull goals that resonate with you personally.  If you're properly motivated, you will *invent* tricks and tactics that will get you where you want to go. 

On an unrelated note, I'd also say to date a bit. College is a fantastic time for meeting people, really take advantage of it while you're there. Talk to your classmates, the other kids in your dorm, and people in student clubs and organizations. 

Don't hide out in your room and play video games all the time. Get to know what you want and don't want in a partner. Learn how to become a good partner.
 
To help you out, I have a list of hints and signs a girl likes you. Click on my user name and sort comments by ""top"" and ""all-time."" That list should be the top result.

I would have given anything to know that stuff about dating at your age. So many missed opportunities because I was too oblivious. Learn from my mistakes! lol.

And what good would that do? Long guns are the least common firearm to be used in gun crime or gun deaths. 

That was my question after all, many of the proposed laws wouldn't have stopped many of the recent shootings.

&gt;do you really not know about effective gun control policies around the world? 

I am aware of gun control policies around the world. I do not believe they are effective. They get guns of the street, but they ultimately cost loves and drive crime rate up.

&gt;And very few other places in the world have as high of rates of gun deaths as we do in the USA

So? You have to look beyond one single stat. Like I said, if you only focus on one stat, then you should focus on the one stat that is medical error killing 14 times as many people than guns. ""But doctors save lives!"" That's exactly my point. Guns save lives and are use more in lawful defense than they are in crime. 

Banning gun because of just the gun deaths stat is just the same as banning doctors just because of the doctors death stat. 

If you can show that guns cause more damage than they do good, then that's an entirely different argument, an argument that is disproven time and time and time again.

Look beyond the one stat you're focusing on. 

Guns are used between 500,00 and 3,000,000 times a year in lawful self defense compared to 300,000 times a year in crime according to Obama's CDC study. The same study shows that armed defenders are less likely to be harmed in an attack than unarmed defenders. 

Furthermore, if you take suicides out and gang on gang violence out of violence statistics, America would be on par with the most peaceful nations in the EU. America has a culture problem, a culture that encourages ""gang culture"" - that violence won't go away by banning guns, and Japan, along with other nations, have shown us that people can commit suicide at higher rates without guns - also showing that it's a culture issue. 

Gangs won't turn in their guns. They'll simply expand and become more violent when law abiding citizens are disarmed. And even if you magically could poof away guns, then gangs would still kill each other through other means. 

Furthermore, thanks to 3d printing, anyone can make a gun in their own home with commonly available materials. Heck, you can make a gun with PVC pipe and a nail. Drug prohibition and highly regulating and controlling various chemicals hasn't stopped meth production, how could guns be controlled when all you need is a metal 3d printer? 

Guns are used more to stop crime than they are to create crime. Removing guns in America would only empower criminals. 

America does have a crime problem. But that is a problem with culture, not a problem with an inanimate object. 

[Food for thought.](http://imgur.com/gallery/IluRw) Simplification of a complex topic, but it makes some very important points. Gun control isn't really about saving lives. If it really was about saving lives, then it would be a poor use of time as so many other things kill so many more people than guns. 

As for terrorism, banning guns won't stop those either. Just look at the Boston bombings or the van killings in France. Bombs can be made with the chemicals under your sink. What's after banning guns? Ban cleaning chemicals because they can be made into guns? Ban kitchen knives because of 100+ victim stabbing sprees in China? Ban big trucks because people keep on running each other over with them? Ban baseball bats and hammers because they're the most common instrument used in violent crime? 

America's violence problems are a culture problem, not an inanimate object problem.

This could be where these populations got their blue eyes from. Also, remember--for centuries Crusaders were in the region as were European merchants

You're absolutely right - though I think the European Crusaders did not leave any affluent genetic marks in the Middle-East; I believe they specifically came to the Middle-East to conquer Jerusalem specifically, and failed by doing so.

I can think of the Greeks and Macedonians though, having an influence in the Middle-East (from Alexander's time), but many historians described Alexander for example as being swarthy, and I think Greeks in general are very similar in appearance to modern-day Turks. 

I agree with everything else you've said though.

&gt;The questions: how do you account for older reports of Armenians with blonde/blue eyes? How do you explain old manuscripts where some of the men have red/blonde beards (I'd imagine these manuscripts to be the most accurate depiction of ancient Armenians)?

Just as in the old-days, there were blond/blue eyed Armenians accounted for in manuscripts, you can find Armenians to this day with these phenotype's, though it is in the minority, and I believe even back then (when the manuscripts were written) were in the minority. 

&gt;Why doesn't this appear as frequently now?

I haven't taken a biology course since high school, but I believe it just has to do with dominant genes. Brown and brown will almost certainly result in another brown eyed child, and so the cycle continues; there will always be that one child though who carries the recessive traits from their parents.  

&gt;I always assumed Aleksanyan was partially Russian. I guess I was wrong?

And you couldn't get more divided that Aaron Banks and Matthew Elliott.  They hated each other.  That was during the campaign, but they both still celebrated a win.

&gt;All leavers may want to leave the EU but they can't agree on what Brexit will look like.

Doesn't matter.  It's only a starting off point.  If we leave on January 1st 2019 whatever form our future relationship with the EU takes it needn't be the same five years later.   How we want to remold and develop the UK's EU relationship will be voted on in the General Election.

Want to sign up to the EEA and reenter freedom of movement for people?  Find a party willing to put an EEA referendum in their manifesto and then go out and campaign for them.  Same if you want to form an independent Yorkshire, for example, and to announce your intention to reapply to the EU.  Form a party and go and campaign for it.

I don't fancy your chances, but the Brexit solution for 2019 needn't be what the relationship is like  going forwards.  Parliament is sovereign.  That's the whole point of this.   

In all likelihood there will only be 15 months between the UK leaving the EU and holding a general election.   That's when people can air their grievances with the Brexit solution.   Brexit will look like the best deal they can get, as close to the campaign proposals in the Leave campaign (which the people heading the negotiations all campaigned for), from the best team we've got.

Except every other region is capable of scrimming multiple teams a day.  Just because EU is inefficient at scheduling doesn't mean it wasn't unprofessional.

NA top teams regularly scrim multiple teams, it's how you don't get stuck in your own little meta.

Regardless of the time period, they both made obligations and instead of working it out so everyone still made good on their word, they made an unprofessional decision that looks shady in a lot of people's eyes:

""If they were really doing this 'only' in the best interests of winning, they would scrim the team that is favored to win in the FNC/UOL match up.  Or scrim both teams so that you're prepared either way for either team.""

what's the difference between:


8-10 hours scrimming 1 team and doing analysis after?

or splitting that into multiple blocks with 2 teams and doing analysis in a break period and still getting 8-10 hours of scrimming with analysis?  This is 100% possible.

There isn't one(aside from maybe having to spend 1-2 more hours than usual scrimming[which they should want being in the 3rd slot tournament]), they just chose to not go with the option that gives all 3 of them practice because it benefits them both to leave UOL out of practice(you don't give your word and go back on it especially when your word is crucial for the other team).


Guarantee that if it was done to FNC there would be a huge shit storm on this sub about it because FNC has tons more fans than UOL.

Basically, you're going to need the business edition, which is more expensive. You're also going to need a solution for people sweating in it and to set aside money for new stuff when things break. 

Honestly, I don't really think it's a viable business. Just do the math on 10-15 bucks an hour with all the overhead that you'll have to make up for. You're going to need to rent a space out, 3-5 nice pcs to run the vives on and replacement parts for inevitable hardware failures/damages.

Instead, her message from that portion is that we have a right not only to vote, but to know who we are voting for.

The thumbnail is showing the top issues that Americans are concerned about. The environment isn't in the top ten because it's very much a long term issue compared with healthcare, terrorism, guns, and the economy.

So instead, here's some thoughts and questions from a political wanderer:

&gt; (9:00) ""Now it turns out that this is a--this basically pays for itself just if you look at how much healthier we get without these fossil fuels that in fact kill 200,000 people a year and create all kinds of havoc with asthma, with cancer, with heart attacks and strokes and then the diabetes and...""

Just watching through and I saw one point that seemed kind of confusing. She says that the Green New Deal pays for itself if you account for the improved health after we turn to green energies. While it's true that green energy will remove a lot of the burdens built into our system, it seems like the health benefits will only appear long after those investments have been made.

It seems to overlook the rest of the world's continued contributions to pollution, especially the huge populations of China and India which are as slow moving compared with the US as we ourselves are in comparison with the smaller European countries that have surpassed us in many areas. I'm also curious whether the math she's using for that example accounts for the permanent damages to health that we've suffered and the continuously increasing effects which we'll have to deal with for several years before the problem is removed.

I guess it's a timeline question. I know it's good to start as soon as possible and that in the grand scheme of things we'll save a huge amount but it comes across as a penny-in-the-bank style approach. Funding changes like these is usually a more immediate.

The other thing I kind of get put off by is the ""our survival actually depends on it"" part which she drives home repeatedly. The only reason that bothers me is because she starts the interview by criticizing other parties for fear mongering. I like the concerns and the sentiment behind what she's saying but the phrasing, especially in such a casual setting, is too hard. Later on she says that we aren't deciding what kind of world but whether we're going to have a world or not. She also says that it's ""game over for the American people if they aren't allowed a real choice in this election"". The do-or-die messages act as a buffer to people who actually are thinking about their options already.

Something all politicians do that I think Jill did a lot in this video was to claim to the be only one who cares about a subject, the only one who can change it, and the only one who can make things work. She presents a problem, makes it out to be the most important problem, then claims to solve it as effectively and efficiently as possible. It's how campaigning works, I know, but that's one of the political flaws I personally keep an eye out for (just as others are watching for their own concerns). Trump is most accomplished example of the semantic magic dust: I think by now he's solved every problem the human race has ever faced and cleared us for the next six thousand years. Hillary's explanations are perhaps more clear because her own campaign is more visible than Jill's. She's also not so much of an orator to begin with so she's more likely to descend into boring technical details which, to be fair, I zone out for anyway. In this regard, Jill is closer to Bernie for talking big when she's giving speeches and interviews. Just an idle observation.

Second, I think that there seems to be two trends towards MOUT or equivalent Police operations - Speed and violence of action, or slow and purposeful.    The U.S. and many western nations are decidedly on the side of the former, almost universally, likely because of the influence in how the SAS developed their CQB and CRW tactics.  

However if you look at situations where mobility is of lesser importance you will find a lot of military and police forces tend towards the latter.   

I would say that these situations are barely even MOUT in the sense that we commonly use the term - which involves multiple buildings and structures with intervening terrain.   When you are looking at clearing a known and limited number of rooms or buildings, it makes a good degree of sense to exercise the 'slow and purposeful option'.

If you look at forces like GSG-9 and GIGN, you will notice that they alternate between lighter and heavier kit depending on the situation they're deployed in - FSB as a predominantly internal force, have the same equipment sets.   There are plenty of photos of FSB and MVD/Russian Guard forces in either situation, and in some cases, only the first few pointmen are wearing heavier armor, while the rest are equipped with lighter kit to exploit the distraction that the heavier armored pointmen provide.

As a secondary note, I suspect that the U.S. tendency towards speed, surprise, and violence of action is also dictated by the differing infrastructure and building styles - In many parts of the U.S. there is more open space and buildings are not quite as densely packed, meaning more ground may have to be covered, and U.S. buildings may also have a tendency towards larger rooms and more open spaces, which require additional speed to assault through, so the challenges are decidedly horizontal.

In Europe,the construction is denser, and there may be more vertical challenges and less open exterior spaces to worry about.

...in response to the millions spent by organic firms to support mandatory labeling despite zero scientific rationale behind it. Check out who funds each of the major labeling efforts:

* [Vermont Right to Know GMOs](http://www.vtrighttoknowgmos.org/who-we-are/#supporters)
* [Just Label It](http://www.justlabelit.org/about-just-label-it/)

Here are some [quotes about labeling from anti-GMO advocates](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GLP-right-to-know-infographic.pdf) about why they want labeling.


Consumers do not have a right to know every characteristic about the food they eat. That would be cumbersome: people could demand labels based on the race or sexual orientation of the farmer who harvested their produce. People could also demand labels depicting the brand of tractor or grain elevator used. People might *rightfully* demand to know the associated carbon emissions, wage of the workers, or pesticides used. But *mandatory* labels are more complicated than ink - have a look at this [**checklist of changes required to institute labeling**](http://i.imgur.com/ntnGPFd.jpg). 

[Here is a great **review of labeling**](http://www.cast-science.org/file.cfm/media/products/digitalproducts/CAST_Issue_Paper_54_web_optimized_29B2AB16AD687.pdf), and [here's **another more technical one**](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20150618/103641/HHRG-114-IF14-Wstate-GiddingsV-20150618.pdf).

* There are many varieties of non-GE and GE corn with different characteristics - any given GE corn will be very similar to its non-GE parent, but that parent is very different from another non-GE corn *and they are all labeled ""corn""*. Moreover, GE soy doesn't resemble GE papaya *at all*, so why would they share a label?
* Many GE endproducts are chemically indistinguishable from non-GE (soybean oil, beet sugar, HFCS), so labeling them implies there will be testing which is simply not possible. 
* Most of the modifications made are for the benefit of farmers, not consumers - you don't currently know if the non-GE produce you buy is of a strain with higher lignin content, or selectively-bred resistance to a herbicide, or grows better in droughts. 
* We don't label other developmental techniques - we happily chow down on ruby red grapefruits which were developed by radiation mutagenesis (which is a USDA organic approved technique, along with chemical mutagenesis, hybridization, somatic cell fusion, and grafting). 
* Once again, there are *zero* ecological or medical concerns which are inherently present in all GMOs.

The European Commission: ”The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.” (http://bit ly/133BoZW)

American Association for the Advancement of Science: ”The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe.” (http://ow ly/uzTUy)

American Council on Science and Health: ”The consensus of scientific opinion is that the application of genetic modification technology introduces no unique food safety or environmental impact concerns and that there is no evidence of harm from those products that have been through a regulatory approval process.""

I would definitely be interested in a cheap quarterly subscription if it had cool patterns and were flashy (slightly seasons themed?)! I think monthly is way too much for an apparel based subscription. I don't care about socks enough and they would just pile up. 

I think you have the tech part down with anti slippage and such. But on the rebranding side I believe you have to combine the tech with fashion style that focuses on a niche. Look into happysocks, bold crazy flashy designs that have become huge here in Europe.

Sometimes being ambitious does require working longer hours; however, someone who is burning the midnight oil to achieve a goal will be much more motivated and productive than some overworked wage slave. 

As for comparing the happiness of different countries, once again, the U.S. ranks higher than 42 out of approximately 50 countries in Europe. The U.S. is much more comparable in population size to Europe as a whole than it is to any individual European country. Likewise, as a whole, America ranks higher in this category. It's stupid to focus on the 8 tiny countries that exceed America while ignoring the 42 countries that fall short of America. That's called cherry-picking and it's a textbook logical fallacy. 

Also, America is so large and culturally diverse that not all of the country has the same views on ambition, so it's difficult to make conclusions on this subject anyways.

Regardless, here's a few important notes I'd suggest both as someone that thinks of these things when I'm trying to converse, as well as someone who has run into people that fail to do these things.

1) Probably most importantly, **include in your message a natural way for the other person to reply.** This is most commonly achieved by asking questions (since answering a question is easy enough) but too many questions and it feels like you're grilling them. You can also set them up for empathy or a shared interest. For example, if you two like the same band, instead of immediately jumping in with ""Hey I like that band too!"" keep it in your pocket as a reference later e.g. ""yea, I like a variety of music. Band (xyz) had a new album out that I'm really getting into lately"". This way they can jump in with ""Oh, I love that band too!"" and have a natural way to reply where they feel like they are contributing.

2) **Reciprocity is a powerful force.** If you give them something about yourself, they are more likely to respond. Don't just dig after information on them or center the conversation on them. Give them info about yourself by way of an offering. For example, instead of ""So, what's your favorite movie"" try instead ""Man, I loved Jurassic park, that's probably my favorite. You have a favorite movie?"" (Side note, ""favorite movie"" is a terrible question, but without any context I'm keeping the example questions real vague)

3) **Go with the flow.** Even if it sounded like the perfect topic in your head, if it's not coming up, don't force it. You happen to like all the same food options, but food isn't coming up? Don't just blurt ""I like indian food, and so do you!"". Leave it alone, and it will eventually come up. When it does, the conversation topic will feel natural and lend to the ""we have a lot in common"" vibe.

4) **If the conversation goes dead, don't panic.** Take a minute or two to think over your previous topics or other areas you share. Try not to just abruptly switch to something else, instead use reference. For example you can say something like ""You said before you liked to travel but I never got to ask, did you ever go to Europe? I always wanted to see all those museums"".

As someone who has dropped people because of their totally terrible conversation skills I will say the absolute worst thing is abrupt, short, and direct replies. I can work with a bad conversationalist, but I don't want to be talking to myself. If all you give me is ""yes."", ""no."" and ""Yea, that is a good band."" there's nothing for me to work with, and I'm going to get tired of trying to talk to someone failing a Turing test. The best part of online conversation is you can take a minute to formulate your thoughts. Check your work for spelling and grammar, and read it over and see if you know how you'd reply to that message. If you read your message and go ""Yea. That's true."" that's not a good message. You want to read your message and have an immediate reaction as to what you'd say in reply.",,False,1475248914,t3_50o52z,d762z75

Scince you have an EU passport it means that you can stay and work in any EU country as long as you want to. There's usually some required paperwork like a residency or work permit, but these are just formalities so your employer can register you at the local tax agency. If you're only staying as a tourist you don't need any of these.

Eastern-European capitals are also great hubs for your european explorations scince most of these cities have great flight connections with most of the main destinations like Paris, Rome, London, Berlin for dimes.

Thanks again for the lengthy and detailed reply. You've covered all the bases plus more :)

The transition you made from Science to Industry in 2011 has obviously worked out for you. Like you said (and like I would imagine), it hasn't been an easy transition given the biases and other challenges not in your favor. 

Getting published in major journals is definitely the way to go. I know you stick to the more targeted non-general business journals which is great, and it also provides you with a more concentrated audience. Most of the major publications we find our stuff in (HBR, etc.) is more of a pay to include model, not really based on the quality of content as you can see when you read most of it.

You mentioned that you only recruit 5% straight out of universities. I can tell you if we followed the same strategy our work would be X times better than it is. The so called ""talent"" out of university just don't have the experience to cut it.

In the EU our rates can be up to double what you suggested, and in the US even higher as our brand and positioning is stronger. RB and a few others who have a very strong EU presence put pressure on pricing.


I've thought about what you said about networking and always building and expanding your networks to help you develop and eventually, in your case, to become ""the leader"", not ""a leader"". This is one of the advantages the Big 4 have over the competition, they have strong networks in nearly every place you could imagine.

&gt;France's prison population is estimated to be 70 per cent Muslim

From this article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11352268/What-is-going-wrong-in-Frances-prisons.html

You're simply wrong. My view is not skewed, migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, especially Muslim ones, tend to commit a greater proportion of the crimes in Europe than any other group. This is because they segregate themselves, fail to integrate and as a result end up poor and feeling rejected by society. Funny enough this never happened with other waves of migrants like the Italians or the Polish, both of whom had comparable language, religious and Ethnic differences from the native population as Muslims do to your average European.

&gt;Anyways, you're fighting your argument on a technicality. I recognize that foreigners dont have charter rights. However, if this is truly as big of an issue as your example states, then what separates immigrants and citizens from holding these views. If just holding these values poses a threat to Canada, then that alone should be enough to strip citizenship or detain them, rights be dammed, right?

No. People who are Canadian citizens can hold fucked up views because they are citizens, and persecuting them for their views would put us on a slippery slope the rampant censorship and a police state. However, barring foreigners from entry does not do that as they are a separate, easily distinguishable group of people from the citizenry. If you can strip someone of their citizenship for a view they hold, who's to say that you can't do the same to anyone who says things you don't like? Nobody.",,False,1475250030,t3_50pay2,d764i5o

As manifestações têm sido descentralizadas. Algumas ocorrem através de sindicatos, alguns partidos, ou grupos específicos. Mas desde a de 2013, como naquela época surgiu o sentimento apartidário das manifestações, as organizações não ocorrem sempre da mesma forma. Grupos de coletivos organizam uma data, rota e destino para a manifestação e vai se espalhando por entre as pessoas. Agora principalmente pelas redes sociais.

Difícil dizer, porque black bloc não é um grupo propriamente dito, é a conjuntura de comportamentos e táticas específicas em manifestações. Então não dá para saber quem é black bloc ou, especificamente a sua pergunta, até onde eles estão apoiando a manifestação.

Mas pelas características principais (uso de tecido para cobrir o rosto, [fazer barricadas com fogo nas ruas](http://i.imgur.com/tRdbEOX.jpg), resistir quando há abordagem policial), dá para dizer que houve alguns.

The power plants in Stade and Obrigheim were turned off on November 14, 2003, and May 11, 2005, respectively. The plants' dismantling was scheduled to begin in 2007.[31]

The year 2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act provided for a feed-in tariff in support of renewable energy. The German government, declaring climate protection as a key policy issue, announced a carbon dioxide reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%.[32] In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284 PJ of primary energy demand, which corresponds to 5% of the total electricity demand. By 2010, the German government wanted to reach 10%.[26]

Anti-nuclear activists have argued the German government had been supportive of nuclear power by providing financial guarantees for energy providers. Also it has been pointed out, there were, as yet, no plans for the final storage of nuclear waste. By tightening safety regulations and increasing taxation, a faster end to nuclear power could have been forced. A gradual closing down of nuclear power plants had come along with concessions in questions of safety for the population with transport of nuclear waste throughout Germany.[33] This latter point has been disagreed with by the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.[34]

Critics of a phase-out in Germany argue that the power output from the nuclear power stations will not be adequately compensated and predict an energy crisis. They also argue that only coal-powered plants could compensate for nuclear power and CO2 emissions will increase tremendously (with the use of oil and fossils). Energy may have to be imported from France's nuclear power facilities or Russian natural gas, despite Russia's not being perceived as a safe partner in much of Western Europe.[35]

In 2011, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that ""the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways"". There were many anti-nuclear protests and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022.[36][37] Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors. Between 2011 and 2014 Germany burned more coal, an additional 9.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent.[38] Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.[39]

The German Energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy from 2010. The term encompasses a transition by Germany to a low carbon, environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.[40] On 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.[41]

In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company’s chairman, Peter Löscher, said that ""Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades"".[42][43] Also in September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster ""caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power"".[44]

Antes de eu ser capaz de dizer se acho correto ou não, eu acredito que atos de vandalismos em manifestações sociais são diferentes de atos de vandalismo público, individual. Um é um ato cível, o outro é um ato político. Então deveria ser avaliado por nós como atos separados. Mas não é isso o que acontece, então as pessoas repudiam os atos com a mesma intensidade. Não estou me excluindo disso, também não gosto da destruição patrimonial e pública, mas mesmo assim tenho dificuldade em separar as duas coisas.

Porém, como respondi para outra pessoa, manifestações são atos que ocorrem quando grupos entram em conflito de interesses. Uma manifestação branda, com pessoas andando e cantando, chama a atenção mas não gera a tensão que é a responsável por fazer o equilíbrio destoar. É por isso que greve é tão efetiva e por isso que ela é tão desincentivada. Se você só tiver pessoas indo do ponto A ao ponto B, não é criada uma força de recuo.

Eu vou dizer então que uma manifestação não tem porque ter vandalismo, já que há outros meios sociais para buscar os direitos, mas eu vou também me questionar se eu consigo achar alguma grande manifestação que ocorreu na história sem que houvesse vandalismo ou algum tipo de dano que fomentasse a mudança de paradigma.

É um ato complexo demais para dizer se deve ou não acontecer.

Por exemplo, podemos dar uma volta de 180 graus e olhar para o outro lado: Será que toda contenção policial deve ser tão agressiva? Eu enfaticamente digo que não. Mas não é binário assim. Abuso de poder policial é um dos fatores mais importantes na aderência de manifestações. Se a mídia mostra a polícia jogando bomba em civil que só estava participando e não danificando nada, na próxima surge mais gente.

É como se o vandalismo fosse a variável que diminui a credibilidade de um movimento social e a força policial é a variável que tira a credibilidade do estado. Num você coloca em risco um prejuízo monetário, no outro uma vida humana. ",,False,1475251988,t3_50qais,d767905

I am claiming that in situations where no state exists a state quickly forms.  A large part of the reason for that is because people want states.  There is no contradiction here at all.

If you look at every point in history when there wasn't a state or the state was too weak to enforce anything what happens is that the person most willing to use force takes over and creates their own state, or their is just endless fighting and war.  That is literally the problem states arose to solve, yet you ignore that and act like somehow people would be able to keep others in control without violence.

Guess what?  That has never happened. 

&gt;You are claiming that there is demand for the existence of some or all of the functions of the state, which is enough to establish their existence in the absence of a state, e.g., that people would pay for them without being forced to.

Without being forced to is sort of a red herring, because the precise reason people want states is as protection from the violence that happens without a state.

&gt;Compare voluntary northern Native American society with the U.S.S.R., modern China, Nazi Germany, or the modern police state U.S.. 

So we are comparing a society in which basically everyone knows each other to a society that is supposed to work for millions of people?  

Also it seems you are somewhat ignorant of native american culture.  Ever heard of the term chief?  That was someone who was in charge of a particular tribe of natives, aka their government.  Of course it wasn't an elaborate system of government since the tribal groups were so small.  Native Americans also launched wars against other tribes all the time, the reason they didn't was that most of their time was spent farming and hunting to avoid starvation.

&gt;It is very Euro-centric, you don't seem to have have much of an idea of history outside of European and possibly Asian history within the last 2-4 millennia.

No, as a matter of fact it isn't.  One example of native tribes not having as much government due to their small size does not show the things you think it does.  

&gt;This has nothing to do with libertarianism, which proposes freedom from government, 

We can see examples of what happens when you do each of the individual things libertarians claim they want.  

If you remove the state entirely look at any period in history when there wasn't a state, all of which involved widespread war, famine, and death until a new state was formed and stability was regained.

If you want to see what happens when we have a state but there are no environmental or legal protections simply look at the beginning of the industrial revolution where smog killed thousands of people and children worked for 12+ hours per day in factories.

Libertarians claim that if we didn't have a state then everything would be great.  In order to claim this you need to provide an argument why everything would be great when every case of a country not having a government lead to bad things happening until a new government was formed.

Libertarians claim that environmental regulations and workers protections are not needed.  Well we have examples of what happened before we had those regulations.  Why should we think that removing those regulations is going to make things different than they were before we had those regulations.

It is extremely hilarious to me that you say absolutely every society had too much government and that they only example of something even close to like what you are suggesting existing is in societies with drastically lower numbers than ours that spend the vast majority of their time avoiding starvation.  

You might as well just say ""I get along with my friends just fine, why can't we scale that up to a society of 300 million people!!"".

---

&gt;* BERLIN: A refugee in a German shelter died Thursday while trying to set his wife on fire, leaving the woman seriously injured and part of the building ablaze, police said.

&gt;* The 45-year-old man, a Syrian, was previously known to police, said authorities in Ruedesheim on the Rhine river in the central state of Hesse.

&gt;* The woman, who had previously separated from her husband, was taken to hospital by helicopter, police said.

&gt;* The mass influx has forced Germany to accommodate the newcomers in hostels, sports halls and army barracks, where crowded conditions have at times sparked violent clashes.

&gt;* Separately, migrants around Greece staged demonstrations at four sites Thursday to protest delays in implementing asylum procedures promised under a European Union agreement with Turkey.

False,WritingPrompts,,CosmicFilth,t3_50pc76,16,1472781583,0,t5_2s3nb,,0,16,"“ANNA ZAKHAROV DEAD AT 36, SUICIDE”. That’s the headline of the day. Stick your favorite quarter into the newspaper vending box on your street corner and read, read, read all about it. “What a tragedy,” they moan. “A sad end to a sad life,” they say, nodding their heads slowly, the air of superiority exiting their mouths like halitosis.


Fuck ‘em. They don’t know the story. They don’t know Anna. Not like me.


Yeah, the rumor was true. She was expelled from the Bureau of Psychical Research. That’s a fact. I won’t deny it, and neither would Anna, if she could talk now. But it’s not why you think. She didn’t use her telekinesis to rob a bank, or her clairvoyance to dig up dirt on the Director’s sexual deviance. It was much worse.


All I can tell you is what she told me, and she told me lots in the past year since she moved into an apartment down the hall in my apartment building. You know Nirvana Suites, on 5th and Vermont? Yeah, that’s the one. Yeah, it’s a bad part of town. No no no, there was no murder there last year. You’re thinking of the Shangri La Apartments on Melrose.


Anyway, I remember when she moved in—last February. I helped her with her luggage from downstairs. She seemed so helpless. Oh, and she was a loopy thing--could hardly remember which door was hers at first.
I’d visit her sometimes, just to have a beer or smoke a cig. She’d talk about the Bureau. She was a Level 0 Agent, she’d say, the only one. I’d open my eyes wide and ask her about it. “Just humor her,” I thought, “It seems like she’s been through a lot.” 
So we’d have our little visits and she’d talk about the Bureau and I’d joke to break the tension. She’d laugh at those stupid jokes. I liked when she’d laugh. It seemed like the sadness that hung around her like the smog that chokes this god damned city would lift a for a moment. Like a spring afternoon after it rains for the first time all year. The air, so clear and fresh, you drink it up and drink it up and get drunk on it. 
Ha ha, yeah, we’re all getting emphysema. Why don’t we move? Ya know, we’re all addicted to misery.


What was I saying? Oh, right, the Bureau. She said they usually had her using her remote viewing to gather intelligence. No no, not the Russians. The Chinese neither. They were spying on our allies! NATO members, Europe, Canada. Anyway that’s whole ‘nother story. She said after a while of reaching into every big puffed up important brain in the Western world something… different talked to her. Not with words, well, she said like a tickle in her brain. A delirious electric thrill that ran through her spine into her cerebral cortex and showed her things. Things exciting and terrifying. She said she was addicted to her new conversation partner and got carried away and broke into the isolation lab too many times. They kicked her out after that. “Okay, she’s more a little kooky,” I thought. More than little kooky, sure, but still, harmless. 


One day in June, though, I was reheating some pad thai in my apartment when I heard screaming. I looked through the peephole in my door and saw two broad-shouldered suits with buzzcuts step in and shut the door to her place.
An hour later they were gone and I was the one at her door instead. I knocked and she let me in. She sat on her couch and got small. She’d been crying. I noticed the blood on her shirt and the pricks on her arm. I saw a syringe and needle and I told her off about using. Ya know, I lost my mom to that trash.


Anyway she looked up with her dirty wet face and told me off. She wasn’t using, she said. The men from the Bureau came and loaded her up with some psychotropic cocktail they’d mixed up in a white sterile lab downtown. Apparently they came every week and supplied her with this mixological nightmare. 
It deafened her, she said. Not her ears but her mind. It keeps her from talking to it. It? She called it the *VASTNESS*. She said it’s in her, and it’s in me, and it’s in everyone else and in every burning star and whirling galaxy and it’s in every dark corner of this stinking universe. She said it sees through her, and everyone else, and she’s the only one who can talk to it.


I admit it. At this point she was beginning to scare me. I told her off and stormed back to my pad thai. I know, I’m a real fucking asshole. The next day I knocked on her door to apologize. No answer. I tried again. Nothing. I guess she wrote me off, and she wouldn’t have been wrong to do it.


A couple weeks later I was walking to pick up some cigs and I heard a gurgling from under the blanket of a sleeping figure beneath one of the scenic underpasses our city is so famous for. Feeling a little morbid, I lifted the blanket to ask if this street person was alright. Imagine my shock when I saw Anna’s face. Filth. Absolute filth. Dirt impacted her every pore. Grime and god knows what in her hair. But her eyes, cloudy and spotted and grey. And her smile. Demented and so crooked and her lips bleeding and dry. I carried her limp body up the street and back to her place (thank god her key was still in her pocket) and laid her on the couch.


Two days later she’s back to Earth and comes knocking on my door. She says she can’t keep doing this, she can’t let the Bureau suits come and shoot her up again, she can’t be without her *VASTNESS*. She has a plan but she needs help, just a few dollars. I acquiesce and give her the contents of my wallet, just under $50.


What happened? Well, read the papers and you’ll know the rest. She loaded herself up with pills and now the Bureau men can’t get her. I don’t know if she really was straight or kooky after all. So many rumors about what they do behind those locked rooms in the Bureau. She really was a nice girl.

False,AskReddit,,FileEditViewSearch,t1_d7694dh,1,1472782271,0,t5_2qh1i,,0,1,"&gt;But when a drug that is used for no medical purpose, not regulated by the government, and remains unlimited except by criminal law such as heroin or meth MUST be a criminal issue. This non-regulation poses a danger to the users themselves and to other people. 

Not meaning to nitpick, but meth is actually marketed as Desoxyn, it's approved for children right here in the US. Since Desoxyn is made by professional chemists, there are less health risks associated with it. Heroin is legal in a lot of countries, heroin is actually the brand name and it's real name is Diacetylmorphine, it's only around 3 or 4 times more potent then morphine. And it's used for people in serious pain in Europe. Take a look at this chart, Diacetylmorphine is only a little more potent then Oxycodone (a very popular drug for seniors) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic

Meth in my opinion is going to be the most troublesome of the two, but I ask you again, what right does anyone or the government have to tell me what to consume? Sure, if I go on a meth binge and start running down the street naked then you have a right to arrest me and force me into rehab. But many many many people do keep their drug habit well under check. There was a survey in Holland I believe and they tested sewer water for 30 days straight. Do you know what they found? Drug use peaks on the weekend and flat-lines during the weekdays. This indicates that druggies can control their consumption very well and hold common jobs. They pose no danger to themselves or anyone else. 

So as hard as it is for you to imagine (yes, I know it's hard for you), many many many people only take drugs on the weekend and harm nobody. Their drug use is 100% harmless. But you see a different picture, you see the crazy nut who took meth and lsd and is know climbing up a tree. But just remember 10% of Americans admit to using illegal drugs. And 38% have used weed. I will provided a source if you wish. 

Now I think I have made a decent case that drug users are not scum, but simply regular people looking for a little weekend fun.

Also, let's not forget about the private prison industry. They literally profit off of imprisoned drug users. 

http://www.governing.com/blogs/bfc/corrections-cost-correction.html

&gt;The United States today is arguably the most incarcerated society in human history. Some 3.2 percent of the adult population is in the correction system -- either incarcerated or on probation, parole or some other form of supervision, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The cost of operating prisons is one of the fastest growing areas in state budgets. Since 1990, state corrections costs have increased about 7.5 percent a year, according to the National Governors Association. In 1972, state inmate populations were about 175,000. Today, they stand at an astounding 1.4 million.

So pretty much they tricked the Americans into think drug users pose an active threat to their lives, while the private prisons raked in the cash. Now that's criminal.

The government uses scare tactics to blame drug users and scapegoat them for the world issues. Gimme a break, a kid doing LSD is not hurting anyone. Speaking of LSD, did you know it is actually anti-addictive? This means the more you use it, the less you desire to in the future. In fact many Universities were conducting legitimate research with LSD for people depression, until you guessed it, the government shut them down.

&gt;Police are to protect the public right?

The police are to protect people from other people, they ARE NOT their to protect me from myself. When the government tries to tell people how to live their lives, quality of life always drops. In places where there are less laws and government, people are more wealthy and happier.

&gt;I have many stories of personal experience with victims of drug abuse that do not include the user. Here's one, I lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico where meth is a rampant problem and the vehicle I was in was t-boned because the driver that hit me was high off meth. Luckily, I was in a van with no passengers and she hit more towards the back end of the van so I was fine, although, she sent another driver to the hospital with an injured neck. Her drug use definitely put my life and anothers in danger. Stories like this, only less fortunate, happen ALL the time. 

I am glad your okay man, I really am, but how would you feel if she was drunk on Alcohol? Would you just accept the fact she senselessly put lives at risk, or would you want to ban Alcohol again? I don't think it matters what your intoxicated on, you just should NEVER drive while intoxicated, be it alcohol, amphetamine, heroin, meth, etc. I have no idea how you guys enforce intoxicated driving laws, but instead of busting hippies with pot, why not invest in preventing intoxicated driving?

&gt;I understand that you agree with the prosecution of DUI related crimes, but, how are we supposed to arrest someone for DUI unless they are doing it?

I think it should be enforced just like drunk driving laws. If they show an effort to drive while high, arrest them. I really have no patience for reckless drivers, so I think after their second offense they should lose their licenses permanently. Do you think that is too harsh or about right?

&gt;Or what about theft, robbery, and burglary? How are we supposed know when a drug addict needs his next fix, but doesnt have the money for it and needs to steal to get it, thereby putting innocents in danger?

That's actually a good question. Take a look at how much Tylenol costs at Wal-Mart, no more then 3 dollars a bottle. Yet Tylenol is harder to create then meth, but meth is much much much more expensive. Odds are, our toothless friend could support his habit for very cheap. You see once meth is legalized the free market begins producing (pure) meth and they can make it cheaper then Tylenol. Pretty much you could support your meth habit on a minimum wage job. But eventually everyone gets tired of this and they attempt to pull themselves out of their addition.

&gt;Could we get lucky and somehow catch him I'm the act? Maybe in a perfect world. Or we could prevent the problem altogether by keeping meth, heroin, and similar drugs illegal.

This statement right here tells me you haven't thought of our friends south of the border. An American druggie needing money for a quick fix is much LESS likely to turn deadly then the drug war in mexico. 164,000 people have been killed because of drug prohibition in mexico alone. So let me quickly summarize. After we legalize all drugs, drug costs plummet to Over The Counter costs, even a lower class worker can support their habit without crime. And there is also the added benefit of the drug war in mexico dissolving immediately after legalization, just read about the prohibition of alcohol. The gangs disappointed because there was no money in it for them. Man, there is no end in sight for the drug war, there is no way the police could ever win and during the conflict both citizens are harmed and the police are as well. The most rational thing to do is legalize the drugs and save lives. I would rather a mexican mother of 2 who does not use drugs, live because the violence ended. Let the meth heads die, as a last resort. It's safer for us that way. Cruel, but I would rather people OD (not likely if legal though) then innocent bystanders in your war get killed.",,False,1475253418,t3_50mcyc,d7695gq

Governments are closely connected to censorship on social media. Especially the European Union, who has worked with Facebook and Twitter to censor people critical of immigration. People have been *arrested* in Germany for FaceBook posts, and Merkel is using an ex-Stasi's organization to monitor social media. So, yes, censorship of social media by a private company is working in close proximity to censorship by governments.

So then you probably agree that they would. Which, I mean, how can't you? So, no. No one ever claimed it was YOUR job to protect people from stupid behavior. (duh.) But it  certainly IS the government's job. The are laws against stupid behavior all over the books. And you agree with these laws. Laws like, you need to have your car safety inspected to make sure you don't kill people (and yourself) when you drive. And you need to not drive drunk for the same reason. And you need to not bring guns and explosive liquids on a plane for the safety of everyone (including you) on board. It definitely IS the government's job to protect stupid people from themselves and others. Why else are narcotics illegal to sell on the street? So dumb people don't buy and sell (and kill for) and die taking them on every street corner in America.  You totally agree with these laws. Hell, who doesn't? So the notion that ""It's not the government's job to protect idiots from themselves (and others) is false and you know it is. What makes social security any different? Why is there a special place set aside in your mind for that? You have never used unemployment insurance or workman's comp or plan on using social security on principle? somehow, I doubt it.

And credit cards did exist in your parents time. Whether or not they used them is inconsequential to the discussion. You don't really believe a $12 a month netflix bill and a $30 a month phone bill (it's all I pay for unlimited everything. It's real cheap now) is the difference between why it was easier for your elders to do all the things that are FAR beyond the reach of so many Americans today, do you? Of course not. 

And the idea that a $24 dollar minumum wage would kill the economy is only believed because we all think CEO's should get $200 golden parachutes and earn 600 times the hourly rate of the average worker (not that way in Japan, btw) and have six yachts and 4 houses in the Hamptons. What if the minimum wage HAD kept up with the cost of living since the 70's? In tiny incriments? gradual increasing (as it should have) and today CEO's and their lackeys only made a million or two a year and could only afford one house in the Hamptons and one yacht? Why would that be such a bad thing? You just believe it would wreck the economy because you can't imagine it any other way. Europeans get one month a year off, and free child care and inexpensive health care. It can work. Canada has FREE health care and they are rated about 28th in the world as far as health care quality, and we have fallen from 30th to 36th or something. Capitalism failing big-time in this field too.

And your parents saved for a house and then bought it? I so doubt that. But again, it used to be that one man's 9-5 salary could pay a mortgage and keep his wife home and raise a family with that income. It was simply a lot easier to do and therefore not really something to crow about, like they had some special ""gumption"" or something. They just had a much easier path than we do now.

Don't blame people for living in a raw deal and not being able to make it ""successfully"". The game has been fixed and getting more ""fixier"" every year. And the rich get EXPONENTIALLY richer year after year. and now less than 1% own more than HALF of everything. And it will only continue to get more and more lop-sided.

Not really. When comparing North Korea to South Korea, the North had the vast majority of the industry and definitely had the leg up on the agrarian South at the very beginning, until the different economic management of both systems managed to close the gap around about the 1960's and South Korea managed to surpass North Korea by around 1980 due to the fact it had a much more efficient system

The East German-West German divide gave somewhat of a leg up to the West at the beginning, but the divide became greater and greater as time progressed. Most of Eastern Europe wasn't managed beforehand that great (Fascists have a tendency also to have bad economic management, and East Europe was fairly poor to begin with) but things slowed down especially once they adopted Socialism.

There's not really much point in comparing the progress made under Socialism to how things were going beforehand in places like Russia, where the economic structure wasn't Capitalist but a Feudalist structure which are laughably inefficient in general, or in China where despite efforts to develop Capitalism by the KMT (Which they ended up doing so in Taiwan which remains one of the most socially liberal and economically prosperous countries in Asia), overall economic growth was hampered by Warlords who practiced Feudalism as well as a lack of respect for the central government. 

In Cuba economic growth was higher before the Cuban revolution, which can be found looking at a variety of graphs and historical studies.

There's a reason why Vietnam, China, Laos, etc ended up adapting market reforms. Socialism could not provide the economic stability needed on its own. It wasn't some huge conspiracy by the West that the entire Eastern bloc collapsed in a Velvet revolution either. In general countries that are stable have very little chance of collapse except under war or very specific circumstances.

A small thing that bothers me about your retoric is that you think that rich people being anti gun is to keep control. It s just a mix of PR and a genuine believe in gun control as a way to curbe gun related homicides that targets mostly the poor, not the rich.

&gt; Eu vi algumas pessoas comentando sobre como manifestação está se tornando algo ""perigoso"" e que ""devemos tomar cuidado"" nela. Bom, quais ""precauções"" você acha que devem ser feitas por um manifestante?

**Antes de tudo, gostaria de enfatizar que estou falando entre uma situação manifestante vs choque.** A ordem que o choque recebe é de conter pessoas, não prender criminosos. Alguém pode ficar com a ideia de que se tem alguém comentando como fugir da polícia significa que a pessoa é criminosa. O que não é verdade. Após o choque cumprir a função ele sempre sai. Ele não prende a manifestação. Algumas prisões acontecem com manifestantes que reagem contra a polícia (e estranhamente alguns fotógrafos, como ocorreu ontem), mas eu posso por exemplo chegar numa delegacia numa boa hoje e não vão me prender por ter estado lá tomando gás na cara.

Mas ainda assim, se você participa de uma manifestação como essa você está sujeito a riscos. Ainda mais em nosso atual estado.

Você precisa saber os perigos que está correndo. Vou supor aqui somente o risco entre a tensão polícia-manifestantes, mas pode haver outros. Também vou supor que a intenção é apenas se proteger. Quando a adrenalina bater e dar aquele instinto ""lutar ou fugir"", vou estar pensando só no lado ""fugir"" nos que escreverei abaixo:

1. **Você tem que ficar alerta e sempre atento aos primeiros sinais.** O primeiro de todos é o visual. Se você é manifestante, a polícia sempre age uniformizada. E os veículos são sempre iluminados. E estão sempre lá. [Alguns até te filmam](http://imgur.com/JozX7sV). Quando eles estão em movimento e criando a formação, você tem pouco tempo para decidir o que vai fazer. As táticas da polícia são diversas, mas geralmente eles formam uma barreira, usam armas de efeito moral, avançam, repetem. Se você vir com antecedência talvez consiga um caminho de fuga antes que as pessoas comecem a bloquear.

2. **O segundo sinal é sonoro**: As pessoas gritam. Ouviu grito, saiba que não vão parar. A minha decisão é na hora fugir, porém não ir embora da manifestação em si. Algumas pessoas decidem agir contra, contra atacar. Os riscos são bem maiores.

3. **A proximidade com os policiais é perigosa**. Eles desceram ontem com motos e fazendo como naquele jogo Road Rash, assim que passaram perto de alguns manifestantes eles batiam com os cassetetes.

4. **As bombas:** O som mais aterrorizante que dá são os das bombas de gás lacrimogêneo. Elas são disparadas com espingardas. É uma cena bem comum de ver nas reportagens. Um PM dá alguns passos a frente, mira para cima e atira. Então sai a granada de gás que explode no ar. E tem fragmentos do cartucho que sai incandescente, bem quente. Esses são extremamente perigosos. Foi inclusive um fragmento que acertou o olho da moça ontem. É possível ver o tiro (ele brilha vermelho) e ouvir a bomba. Essa explosão em si não machuca (ignorando os estilhaços projetados). Mas ao ouvir, saiba que daquela direção vai vir o gás. Então é aconselhável ir na direção oposta. Só que na direção oposta vai ter outra granada, então não faz muita diferença haha! Mas é importante proteger as áreas mais vulneráveis. Então virar o rosto contra é importante. Se lembrar, andar com as mãos cobrindo os olhos e ouvidos.

5. **O gás:** O gás é uma delícia haha (/s). É impossível de descrever o quão cáustico ele é. Tudo o que tem de mucosa no seu rosto passa a arder. É insuportável. Eu sou químico, e eu sei que o melhor antídoto é água em abundância. Não tem muita escolha. Algumas substâncias dão um certo alívio, e por isso é comum sentir cheiro de vinagre. As pessoas lavam panos com vinagre e cobrem a boca e nariz. Há quem diga que ajuda. Mas o olho é um problema, e não sei se vinagre no olho é uma boa solução. Quando é spray de pimenta a solução é também água em abundância. Mas como o princípio ativo é capsiacina, é possível ter certo alívio se passar bases fracas como leite de magnésia (**não recomendado**). Melhor dica é ir para longe. E em nenhum caso passar coisas oleosas, só intensificam.

6. **O mais importante: Location, location, location** - Se você souber onde você está, saberá as rotas a tomar. Meu professor de história do ensino médio participou das manifestações contra a ditadura militar e ele dizia que nas manifestações na praça da Sé você já chegava sabendo todos os pontos de fuga. Poucas pessoas ontem sabiam para onde fugir quando nos cercaram. Estávamos todos seguindo o fluxo. E se o fluxo está sendo acuado para um lado, pouco importa se tem pontos de fuga mais eficientes.",,False,1475258033,t3_50qais,d76fdz0

In other words, there may be a group of ""Europeans"" and ""Asians"" that have differences in their allele frequencies. However, any two geographical groups are going to have differences. Further the distinction between what is ""Europe"" and what is ""Asia"" is arbitrary from a biological or genetic standpoint. So assigning Europeans and Asians into distinct groups makes about as much sense biologically as separating between ""New Yorkers"" and ""Californians"", or ""North Carolinians"" and ""South Carolinians"", or ""Midwesterners"" and ""Southwesterners."" These are pre-existing social groups that we have assigned certain people into based on something other than genetic code. There are differences between those groups, but the differences are not the product of the process by which we sorted them into groups. Therefore the process of analyzing people *after* sorting them into such pre-existing non-genetic groups, then looking for differences between those groups, assumes its conclusion that any differences found are significant and therefore define a discrete pre-existing group.

In the same way that the word ""businessman"" is used to blur what kind of business a person does, terrorist is used to blur what the group is fighting for. Before you downvote me, please read the rest of the comment. I don't deny the existence of terrorism, neither justify it.

First, what is terrorism? Terrorism is an attack on civilian population intended to prevent them from helping the enemy, force their loyalty to your side and in general make them fear you enough to do as you want.

If you simply define terrorist as someone that commits acts of terrorism, you come to the problem that every single army in modern times is guilty of targeting civilian population and infrastructure, and therefore every single part in a war can be accused of being ""terrorist.""

You can try using the mass-media definition where a terrorist is someone who has bombs but not an air force, it is someone that plants bombs in markets and such. But then you can't call al-Assad's army terrorist, and that's inconvenient when they commit acts of terrorism. 

You can use the more propaganda-friendly version of terrorist as any irregular force that is not on my side, but then you have the problem that from USA's and Europe's point of view, PKK is not a terrorist organization, while from Turkey's perspective it is.

At the end, you just end up with all sides accusing each other of being terrorist, while none cares to actually stop attacking civilians. 

And again, I don't say that all the parties are equally guilty, that they have used terrorism to the same extend, or that they are on the same moral level. I guess you, like me, consider PKK the sanest party in the clusterfuck that Syria is right now.

**TL;DR: Blood Elves started falling out of the Alliance in the Frozen Throne. In TBC the Alliance was doing more shitty things to them, including messing with Ley lines in the Ghostlands. Blood Elves are addicted to magic, night elves kinda tried to sabotage this. The Forsaken helped the Blood Elves against the issues with the Alliance. So basically they were an ally of the Forsaken, who were allied with the rest of the horde races, which caused them to enter the horde. Later events expanded on their relationship with the rest of the horde races but this is how it came to be in the first place. Forsaken were humans of lordaeron who were former allies/Sylvanas is a high elf from Quel'thalas.**

&gt;""Kael'thas, the prince of the Blood Elves, was for a short period of time under the command of a man called Garithos. Long story short, Garithos gave Kael'thas assignments that he found downright impossible to complete -- especially considering the fact that Garithos removed most of his forces from his command and placed under his own -- and Kael'thas found himself forced to accept help from Naga. This infuriated Garithos, who was a racist as well as a prat, and he declared Kael'thas to be a traitor. The Elven prince and his followers were imprisoned in Dalaran, sentenced to be executed at dawn. They were only saved by the arrival of the Naga who broke them out of there. Kael'thas having little choice, followed the Naga and their leader, Lady Vashj, to Outland, and agreed to serve Illidan -- Vashj's master.

&gt;A couple of events on Outland take place but are of little relevance.

&gt; Meanwhile, Lor'themar Theron, who was placed as Regent Lord of Quel'thalas in the Prince's absence, was quite predictably in Quel'thalas, coping with the Scourge. After some time, Grand Magister Rommath and his magisters returned from Outland at the Prince's behest, to teach the Blood Elves a new way of coping with their magic addiction -- siphoning magic from living beings (as well as feeding off Fel, but this was kept secret from the general public). Rommath and his magisters, wielding their new powers, succeeded in retaking Silvermoon and rebuilt it in a day, and went on to reclaim half of Eversong Forest, bar the area now known as the Ghostlands.

&gt; That's when the player character comes in!

&gt; Soon after that, we find a Dwarven ambassador present in Quel'thalas. Through the course of several quests we discover that he isn't the only member of the Alliance present in the High Kingdom. There we Kaldorei spies (which we discovered by killing them) who were observing Arcane Sanctums -- of note, one that was malfunctioning, although it was stated that the spies are not responsible for it. Regardless, espionage is not a friendly thing to do and the Elves decided to take care of it. Violently. Thus, the ambassador was killed.

&gt; Later on, in the Ghostlands, the Alliance turns out to be far bolder. It turns out that the Kaldorei seek to set up scrying devices in Quel'thalas, which would allow them to spy on the Blood Elves. To this end they shipped an undisclosed number of troops (actual soldiers, mind), occupied not-insignificant portions of the Ghostlands, ley lines in particular, and created military bases/camps in Quel'thalas' territory. There's a word for that. It's ""invasion"". The Blood Elves were predictably less than amused and dealt with the offenders.

&gt; Meanwhile, the Forsaken, who were members of the Horde, sent actual aid to the Ghostlands and forces to help the Blood Elves deal with Dark'khan Drathir, an Elven traitor and commander of Scourge forces in the area. The leader of the Forsaken also just happened to be Sylvanas Windrunner, the former Ranger General of Quel'thalas who died in the realm's defence during Arthas' invasion. All in all, the Horde made a much, much better impression than the Alliance.

&gt; Lor'themar was not interested in joining the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. At the time, the idea was to abandon Quel'thalas and move the Blood Elves to the promised land -- Outland. It's a long way from the High Kingdom to the Dark Portal, however, and met with outright hostility from the Alliance, Lor'themar needed to secure safe passage for his people for this exodus. The Horde was apparently willing to help, and Sylvanas lobbied for the Blood Elves to be admitted. Soon after Dar'khan was defeated all necessary paperwork was signed and the Blood Elves joined the Horde.

&gt; How they remained in the Horde after the civil war and killing their own prince is another story altogether.""",,False,1475259602,t3_50qx3g,d76hhxr

&gt; SCHWERIN, Germany - The German political establishment&amp;#039;s worst nightmare could become reality this weekend when voters head to the polls for an election in the northeast: the far-right Alternative for Germany might, for the first time, become the most powerful party in a state.

&gt; &amp;quot;First, it was the Euro-Retterei, the [flawed] rescue of the euro, then it was the energy transformation with Merkel overtaking even the Green Party, and then - which marks the low point - the refugee crisis, which caused a fear among people about what else might come,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; &amp;quot;The difference from the CDU is obvious: the SPD speaks out for the man in the street,&amp;quot; Rainer Albrecht, a member of the SPD in the state parliament, told a passerby who asked him about the difference between the two parties as Albrecht handed out flyers by a shopping center on the outskirts of Rostock.

Una cueva de ladrones y, para colmo, su presidente, Marianico, tiene algo parecido a un retraso mental. Pero aun así lo prefiero a Podemos, porque estoy convencido de que si este último toca poder no solo no se solucionarían los problema actuales (más bien empeorarían, como sucedió en Grecia con el chiripas), sino que además su revanchismo, su ira, y sus ideas sobre temas como el terrorismo o el ""derecho a decidir"" o el ""murallas fuera"" o lo mala que es la religión católica pero que buena es la Islamica y sus burkas (y si paga dinero para un programa de TV, entonces es buenisima, y el feminismo y los derechos de la mujer se olvidan, no vaya a ser que imán deje de soltar la pasta)...  pondrian a España al borde de una nueva Guerra Civil.

El Coletas ya demostró, con los ministerios que le pidió a Pedrito Sanchez, lo que realmente pretende: imponer un sistema totalitario al estilo Venezuela o Cuba apoyandose en los militares y en una policia política (recuerdas la idea de que los jueces fueran del partido?). Si este foro en el que solo escriben unos pocos cientos de personas ejercen la censuran de la manera con que lo hacen... te imaginas que harían con los medios de comunicación de masas? Ahora se están juzgando a los corruptos del PP.... crees que se juzgaría a los corruptos que aparecieran en Podemos siendo el propio Coletas el encargado de perseguir la corrupción? Y respecto a lo de que todos trincan la pasta.... es que realmente es así! Errejón cuando pudo hacer que un amiguete le creara un puestecito a su medida... lo hizo. Cuando en los ayuntamientos entra algún podemita.. el siguiente paso es que también lo hagan sus amiguetes, parejas y familaires. Eso de ""haz lo que yo te diga, que yo por mi parte hare lo contrario"" al estilo Echenique (no sientes verguenza ajena al saber que Echenique paga en negro a su asistente mientras en los mítines criticaba precisamente eso?) indica de que calaña están hechos. Podemos iba a dar el sorpasso y perdio 1.300.000... y la culpa es de los votantes, que son tontos! Estos de Podemos hablan de poder del pueblo y de democracia... pero cuando el pueblo vota lo que a ellos no les gusta... entonces el pueblo es tonto y hay que ""reeducarlo"". Ahora en Brasil el parlamento democráticamente elegido ha decidido expulsar a su presidenta POR CURRUPTA... pues ya están los de Podemos diciendo que aquello es un golpe de estado... que aquel parlamento no tiene derecho a votar eso... pero Podemos sí tiene derecho a votar, en España, en contra del partido que aquí ganó las elecciones.

Podemos empezó hablando de los problemas reales de la gente (que sabes perfectamente cuales son) y ahora a lo que se dedica es a hacer de abogado de la dictadura venezolana (no sientes verguenza ajena, también, cuando Monedero les llama ""golpistas"" al pueblo que se manifiesta contra Maduro?), de un terrorista que además es de otro partido político, de los independentistas catalanes, a justificar el terrorismo yihadista (pobrecitos, somos los europeos malos malisimos que los obligamos a que hacer esas cosicas) o a clamar por una peligrosa venganza sobre una guerra civil que aconteció hace casi cien años. Eso son los problemas reales de la gente? En los ayuntamientos ""del cambio"" (cambio, sí, pero a peor) ya perdieron un 25% de los votos... porque el pueblo ya ha visto lo que prometían y lo que en realidada hicieron!

Podemos era ""ni de derechas ni de izquierdas"" y ahora resulta que es una izquierda revanchista y totalitaria. En que se transformaría si tocan poder? Yo lo tengo muy claro... y por eso, de estar en la sarten o en el fuego, prefiero lo primero.

Every national identity crisis resolved itself in favor of the separatists instead.

&gt;Although this is an extremely unlikely scenario to begin with, I didn't want to just randomly subdivide the continent. I looked for regions which either:

&gt;1. administered themselves as autonomous nations at some point in American history, or ...

Name calling isn't really a rational objection... tbh it supports my case in that people like to cover this stuff up. 

When talking about immigration it is claimed that all cultural and racial subgroups of society do equally well. Then when that falsehood is challenged, it is shouted down with namecalling. This is exactly the reason I'm worried about PC politics + immigration. As a society we are systematically unable to get to the truth about how different types of people really impact us, so when we decide that mass immigration is a great idea we are living in a fantasy world where all people are equal. And then when reality generates a massive pile of evidence showing how mistaken we are, we can shout it down as racist.

1) Not all whites participated in slavery. Whites in the states are comprised of many European ethnicities such as German, English, Irish, Scottish, French, Italian, Polish, etc. With the exception of the English, French, and Spanish, none participated in slavery. Many don't even have a lick of English, French, or Spanish blood in them either, so to accuse them of being the ""oppressor"" is ridiculous to me. Many of these European immigrant groups also faced discrimination as well and weren't even considered white like the Irish and German when coming to the states.

2) It's a pretty well-known fact among Historians that both Africans and Europeans alike conducted the slave trade. There's a large myth that African slaves were easily taken by evil white colonists. Historian Henry Louis, a black man may I add, states:
&gt;The truth, however, is much more complex: slavery was a business, highly organized and lucrative for European buyers and African sellers alike.

The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred.

Which was out of control of the enslaved blacks, obviously, but it goes to show that 'whitey' isn't the only one out to get them. 

And at what point are we going to continue pointing the finger*? I do agree a lot of our downfall has happened as a result to enslavement. But we've had centuries of freedom and haven't gone very far with it. At some point we took personal responsibility for our actions and could no longer blame ""the powers to be"" for our problems. We continue to perpetuate a culture that's toxic for growth, and none of that is the white man's fault.

So, Musonius Rufus is not a Stoic, or a lesser one, because he doesn't say what you want him to?

As for your main question, I find it somewhat concerning how focused you are on yourself in this scenario. The prostitute herself is mentioned only one time: ""She is doing it freely. No human trafficking, drug addiction."" 

Given the fact that you are paying her in this scenario, chances are that she is not doing it freely, even if she has not been kidnapped and there is no drug addiction to pay for. There are other things to pay for, like food, shelter, medical bills, debt, children, elderly parents, and prostitution is often the last resort of a woman who desperately needs the money or the self-harming choice of one who has had damaging experiences and is seeking validation of some sort. Men like to believe the myth of the happy hooker, but the hooker, even a high end one, is rarely happy. ""I don't like my job much either, but I'm still there by my free will"" some respond, to which I ask: does your job almost entirely ruin your chances of finding happiness with another human being, does it leave you with emotional scars, does it minimise your chances of rising beyond your current situation socially and economically, and is it your last choice for survival?  

Your scenario assumes that you find the elusive ""happy hooker"". As a thought experiment it's hard to argue against paying for the legal services of the happy hooker. As a discussion about potential future actions, however, how will you know that you have found that ""happy hooker"", who will walk away from your encounter feeling safe and with no more personal damage than she arrived with?

I've done some translation work on a digital safety system for legal prostitutes in Ireland, sexual freelancers if you will, automatically checking in with the ladies and warning them of known dangerous Johns, dangerous locations, non-paying Johns, and Johns who don't respect boundaries. It's not a pretty picture, and the fact that they're translating the system into the languages of rich northern European countries tells me that uneducated women (because passing English grades is a requirement of applying to high school) who don't feel like they have many other options are going abroad themselves, by their ""own free choice"" to play the ""happy hooker"" while risking their lives.

I'd go as far as to say that paying for sex in 99.9% of all real world scenarios, even if no trafficking is involved, is not an indifferent but a vice because it's rarely anything other than choosing one's own pleasure over another human being's well-being.",,False,1475261462,t3_50qwq9,d76jw9p

Inflation has already started. You're just delusional. There's a reason why trucks cross the Europe, thorough France and take the trains or ferries in Calais : Because that's the cheapest way. If the trucks take a longuer time to cross, their cost increase, the products prices increases. That's Inflation.

Most of the trucks are probably not even French at all. France is just the highway.

So you want to play hardball but not so much huh?
Like you said, nobody is going to starve since you 

&gt; can get it cheaper elsewhere. 

So to sum up, you want to be out of the EU but stay in the single market. You want to keep the banking passport and  the touquet's treaty.

But you also want to send 400.000 Poles in Poland and refuse anymore Europeans. You want a special cheap status for migrants in the UK and you refuse all news migrants make them from your old colonies in Calais or from the Syrian war.

And we should accept all this because you belive in free trade?

What he said was important. He said that many of the people who voted to leave do not understand macroeconomics. So the economic benefits of the EU, such as being a member of single market, are not connected by these voters with the wealth of the nation which in turn funds things like healthcare and public housing. 

In contrast, this chap said that many of the 52 per cent do understand what they don't like or what they fear; under-funded healthcare and a lack of supply of affordable housing. And with someone like Farage, a very engaging personality, claiming that the EU is to blame for the problems in the UK, I guess it's not a surprise that many of the 52 per cent blame migrants as being the cause of healthcare and housing problems.

False,ukpolitics,,MARGIDDA,t1_d76kjc9,4,1472811796,0,t5_2qhcv,,0,4,"&gt;I haven't read all of eureferendum.com's monographs on the topic, but I understand that the main thrust is that the EEA/Liechtenstein option is just temporary, rather than a fixed destination.

Everything is temporary because Parliament is sovereign.  Want a different renegotiation from what Theresa May provides, vote for a party in 2020 that has an EFTA or EEA referendum in their manifesto.

But what the main thrust of this temporary EEA/Liechtenstein argument misses is that whilst the other EEA members have expressed that they'd be more than happy with the UK joining their model they don't want the UK coming in and fundamentally changing the rules of the dynamic either.  Neither does the EU.

The Liechtenstein argument is as bogus as they come when it comes to the UK so I'm just going to call it EEA from here on in (plus spelling Liechtenstein each time is playing havoc with my eyes).  It's provisions afforded to a microstate because they literally couldn't be a member otherwise.  They're dispensations to meet their limitations.  So from here on EEA.

There was/is a time to argue the EEA alternative.  It was either before a referendum for Leave was announced as a completely different referendum, or after a Brexit has already happened.   Much as Switzerland outside the EEA and EU regularly debates and votes on whether it should join either or not.

Trying to pass off the EEA as a temporary respite or a variation of Leave is like the waiter turning up to your table to apologise that the lemon sole is off the menu, but instead of offering another fish like haddock for your fish course suggesting profiteroles.  It's a completely different thing and it's not suitable in context.

&gt;The EEA/Liech option is just for the next ten to fifteen years, the temporary controls on immigration are reviewed every five years. 

It wouldn't even be that because there'd be a civil uprising.

Now a majority has actually voted to Leave, the very next time they're told they're going to be paying contributions for another decade, or are going to have to accept another EU directive, or that the EFTA court has ruled against the UK, or that EU immigration is still an issue - then it's going to be pandemonium.

NO.

The argument that we would just have to put up with it for just another ten years or so would go down like a pint of hot lead.  It is a flight of fantasy after a vote to leave to expect that to fly.

It's nearly as desperate as using the Liechtenstein case.

&gt;The benefit of eureferendum.com's monographs is that they are thought-through

And utterly detached from reality.  They're written from an academic bubble, from a narrow church, but without realities, current affairs, and practicalities taken care of.   As a researcher, which is what their author is, they're very good for understanding legal issues and EU frameworks.  I'm not knocking them for that.  Praise where praise is due.  As a political forecaster of what is possible or what will come to pass you might as well use the World Cup Octopus - *and it died.*

In 2016 they were still predicting the referendum would be in 2017.  They predicted Remain would win.  A few years ago they were even predicting that immigration would plateau out and wouldn't be that relevant an issue...

They're great for knowing where the rocks and sandbanks might be, but don't let them navigate, don't let them hold the compass, and never let them near the helm.

Right but feminists seem pretty happy to advocate abstinence for non-child desiring men when they would not do the same for women. That is simply hypocritcial, that aspect is straightforward really.

No it does really because if you advocate for freedom, justice and equality, and then try to promote those ideas through (say) violence, intimidation, bullying, discrimination, or whatever other underhand tactocs, you are not 'doing' freedom, justice and equality, so you are not only being hypocritical, you are actually working aginst your own stated aims!

Just like the UK and the EU, the trade agreements in place will depend on the negotiations and what is/isn't in the single market/financial passporting etc. 

If Scotland becomes independent there is a lot shared information/infrastructure with regard to a whole host of items it might not make sense to devolve/remove. Scotland might well ask for an interim or exceptional agreements with regard to certain areas, of which border control is one. the EU will maintain that Scotland cannot create new trade deals; however if Scotland wanted to leave the UK it might make sense to smooth the disruption. 

It doesn't matter, because we are so into the realms of hypotheticals. The idea that the EU is absolutely black-and-white on issues is ludicrous if you look at their actual approach over the last few years.

&gt;You're doing some mental gymnastics there in the 2nd half of what you wrote. I didn't say anything about making self-determination exclusive or giving special privileges.

Your comments about nationalism on behalf of 'oppressed' peoples (as though oppression bestowed the right), and Native American's Nationalism being justified whilst seeming to say that the idea of European nationalism was unjustified, was somewhat confusing. However, I don't think that constitutes 'mental gymnastics'; perhaps just a miscommunication.

&gt;Europeans already have countries with identities they take national pride in and feel safe in.

Not for much longer by the looks of it. As to the Native Americans, it's quite true, they are a people who have been thrown to the wind. Like the Palestinians. That's not a moral judgement it's just a fact. People compete, it is their unchangeable nature and is the beating heart of identity. Thus there will be a victor and a looser.

&gt;1. If serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature liable to persist are arising, a Contracting Party may unilaterally take appropriate measures under the conditions and procedures laid down in Article 113.

&gt;2. Such safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.

&gt;3. The safeguard measures shall apply with regard to all Contracting Parties. 

&gt;Article 113

&gt;1. A Contracting Party which is considering taking safeguard measures under Article 112 shall, without delay, notify the other Contracting Parties through the EEA Joint Committee and shall provide all relevant information.

&gt;2. The Contracting Parties shall immediately enter into consultations in the EEA Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution.

So they're not permanent controls, they're temporary.  They're privy to outside consultation, and they're only a safeguard for during times of difficulty.

Having immigration controls is not about staying permanently in a state of difficulty.

It's selling a pig in a poke out of a position of desperation to save the plan.

And you're saying you're expecting people to put up with this for 10-15 years at least.  And it still means using the court outside the UK.  It still means political integration.  It still means paying contributions.

There's no political capital to do that.  

Theresa May has even said that they shouldn't be seen to be attempting to wriggle out of the result - and this is very much wriggling out of what people voted for.

It would create a massive political backlash.  Likely as not it would mean a new Conservative leadership contest, where it would be promptly overturned and the EU states will know this so are hardly going to be happy wasting their time talking dispensation.

Most importantly it would go directly against the spirit of the referendum which would be hugely harmful to our democratic integrity.

Citing article 112 and saying that it comprehensively addresses the issue comes out of only two mouths; somebody who has not read it and has accepted it on face value from a third party, or someone looking for that Hail Mary Pass.",,False,1475262844,t3_50sa32,d76lsk8

Personally, I think it's important for dogs to be exposed to everyday life. Crutches, wheelchairs, people who whoop and move funny because they have autism, and that includes the occasional intoxicated person. My dog needs to be good with this because I use a stick and I faint and shake! I've had other people's dogs go spare when I've fainted when I'm out in public. I've even been bitten by other people's dogs while I've been out! 

This is a dogs forum, not a forum to moralise about drink or drug use. Perhaps it touched a nerve because 1. My dog goes everywhere with me. Hes not an assistance dog, but he does alert before I faint and that makes me feel safe :) and 2. Everyone assumes I'm drunk/ intoxicated because a young thin person who is wobberbly on their feet, faints and uses a walking stick causes some major cognitive dissonance in a lot of people.

It's not for other people to judge! Im allowed a drink once in a while, if my dog is out of control there's legislation for that. But speculation over whether someone is a good owner because someone thinks their intoxicated presses my buttons.

Im also European! Drinking in the park with friends is a staple of a good summer! It's no more irresponsible of taking my dog to the pub which I also do. or having people to my house.... I do that too!

&gt;In 2015–16 season, Palermo started their season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the Rosanero therefore relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino to play as a partner of Vázquez. 

&gt;On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results in the beginning of the season; he was replaced by Davide Ballardini. Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players. Palermo captain Stefano Sorrentino reported that during 1–0 victory against Hellas Verona, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match. 

&gt;Fabio Viviani became Palermo's caretaker manager in a 0–4 defeat against Genoa. Rosanero hired Guillermo Barros Schelotto as a new manager. Schelotto, however, did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by Primavera youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4–1 win over Udinese. 

&gt;Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match. Giovanni Tedesco named as Palermo's sixth coach of the season while Schelotto is still waiting for the paperwork. 

&gt;On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator.

&gt; Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager. On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as Walter Novellino was appointed as his replacement. 

&gt;Novellino was then sacked on 11 April. Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season. On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3–2, securing 16th place.",,False,1475263194,t3_50sp9r,d76m9o5

From reading NOWs opposition it seems to be opposed to shared parenting when it is not the wish of the parties present. Shared parenting legislation seems to drive for equal custody *independent* of the circumstances rather than because of them. I am not a lawyer so I would have to go and read the full legislation and try and grok it to understand what the exact wording says.

The abstinence aspect is pretty simple, but the nature of writing legislation for it is significantly more complex.

It is not racist to say that the cultural norms in different parts of the world are going to lead to different battles and perspectives on views.

You can't? What do you think the soviet did? How do you think the chinese beat the japanese? But retard, my point is that the US and the British empire had nearly 650 million people vs the soviets 190 million people. Okay retard? Not only that, the US and britain had far larger armies and control over FAR VASTER lands. Not only that, US + Britain had FAR GREATER resources. Okay retard? The US and britain could arm far more people with far better weapons. And given the control over the skies and seas, the soviets would simply be sitting ducks waiting to be nuked out of existence. Okay cockroach?


&gt; Germany had absolute control of the skies in 1941

Because they didn't have absolute control retard. That's why britain won the battle of britain. Go learn some basic history you worthless cockroach. If the germans had absolute control, they would have been able to conquer britain. But alas the brits made them look like jokes and that's why the germans decided to attack the soviets.


&gt; why didn't they win during Barbarossa?

Because they lost air supremacy you worthless cockroach. Their surprise attack gave them air supremacy in the frontlines you worthless filth, but the soviets had huge reserves of planes ready to deploy against the germans. Okay you filth? That's why the germans made such great progress initially, because they were able to gain air superiority. But as the war dragged on, the soviets were able to regain air supremacy against the germans. Okay retard?


&gt; T-34, KV series, and the IS-2 were all superior to American tanks.

No they weren't. But that's not the point. Were they superior against american bombers and fighters? Were they superior against american nukes? Of course not you worthless cockroach.

He knew that the colonial enterprises would likely collapse without slave-labor, so he was the first to suggest dispensing with the ""short, scrawny Indians"" whom the Spaniards were working to death, and replace them with the much taller, hardier West Africans that the Muslims had already been enslaving for centuries.

Remember: Spain had only recently expelled the Muslims in the same year that Columbus set sail to discover the New World [1492]. Though Spaniards, at the time, did *not* have African slaves, the Muslims south in Granada did. So Spain (unlike any other European country) associated Africans with slavery. See painting of Muslim grandee in Spain, with African slaves attending his harem: http://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/medium/greeting-card/images-medium-5/the-favorite-of-the-harem-gyula-tornai.jpg

So it was Las Casas who suggested ditching the Indians and ""making like the Muslims"" and sending millions of Sub-Saharan Africans to plantations in the New Colonies to replace them.

That's how Mexico got its original massive African population. (In the 1600s and 1700s, it dwarfed the African population of the British colonies in what would become the United States.) See African Mexican here: http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpsnxllqzy1qh2tc9o1_500.png

(The song ""La Bamba"" is a reference to the African population in Veracruz--drawn from the Bemba tribe in West Africa. So ""dancing the La Bamba"" was akin to ""Doing the African dance"".)

It's how Africans got into Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, etc. I remember reading Bernal Diaz del Castillo's account of his conquistador days in the 1500s, and having to remind myself, ""Oh, yeah. When he mentions 'the people of Jamaica,' you have to stop thinking of modern black people. 'Jamaican' meant 'Native American' at the time.

Up until modern times, armies usually consisted of a mix of professional household troops which were limited in number, and mercenaries. These could be supported by militia and levies, though such troops were usually seasonal or purely for defence and wouldn't fit in with the civ-system of making permanent units.

As an example, the population of Sweden in the early 17th century may have been as high as one million. During the Thirty Years' War, the total number of native troops, including the home guard and non-combatants numbered at most 38 000, which would mean less than 4 % of the total population; and this for a highly militarised country that's one of the main players in one of the largest conflicts Europe has ever seen.

To extrapolate, the same level of mobilisation in civ would equal one military unit per twenty five citizens, if one citizen is converted to one unit. Wow!

If we add in mercenaries and allied troops serving under Swedish command in the Thirty Years' War, the army size can be roughly doubled, giving us a staggering two units for our 25 pop empire.

That said, I really appreciate the idea of having a relation between military power and population, and the military economic decision that creates, in terms of distributing manpower between combat duties, non-combat military duties and production, and maintaining a civilian economy.

False,Quakers,,macoafi,t3_50rxic,11,1472824507,1,t5_2qqhr,Quaker - Hicksite,0,11,"&gt; 1) No necessity to believe in God:

This is a *very* recent change. Quakerism has *always* been a Christian denomination. It's only in the last generation that non-Christian Quakerism has become acceptable in the US Liberal branch and in Britain. And rejecting the belief in a deity *at all*? That's a matter of a couple decades.

&gt; 2) Silent, unplanned worship. 

I agree that this is traditional for Quakers and do find the idea of programmed meetings odd. They usually *do* have a period of unprogrammed worship, though! Semi-programmed, I find more interesting. That'd be usually one prepared message, and then let the silence come in. You could even think of the prepared message as being a centering aid.

&gt; 3) No ministers.

Another recent change, though more like 100 years old. Or more of a misunderstanding. George Fox was a minister. James Nayler was a minister. Edward Burrough was a minister. In the 1800s, John Joseph Gurney was a recorded minister in London Yearly Meeting (what is now called Britain Yearly Meeting) who stirred up all the mess in the US. 

Friends have recognized from the very beginning that some people have ministry as a strong spiritual gift. What was *not* accepted was that going to school could *substitute* for that spiritual gift. Today, some Quakers, after the spiritual gift has become clear, *then* go to school to supplement their understanding of Scripture and learn practical administrative tools/techniques that they can bring back to their meetings. That's not the same thing.

That also doesn't make them an intermediary like a priest. It simply recognizes that in any given meeting for worship, you've got 1% odds on me or you or Joe Shmoe over there standing up and 50% odds on Sarah standing up and giving a Spirit-led message (versus standing up and rambling, which is a thing that'd require a chat from M&amp;O). Sarah is clearly called by God to minister to us. She is a minister. In times past, every yearly meeting would have recorded that fact *after* it was revealed by God to be true. And in a traditional meetinghouse (at least in the States, I don't know about your architecture) there is a set of special benches that was called the minister's gallery (now usually called the facing bench among liberal Quakers), usually located under a sounding board. This is a bit of architecture that means the people sitting there will be very easy to hear throughout the room. If you know someone is likely to speak, and microphones don't exist yet, you *put them where people can hear them*. That's just plain good for the folks with bad hearing.

As to paying ministers: released ministry has always existed in Quakerism. In the early days, ministers would sell their pamphlets (more on that below) at a profit. All throughout, itinerant ministers have had their travel paid for and free room &amp; board. They might have labor donated to their farm or be given money to hire someone to work the farm while they're gone. Or ya know, shop, if in the city. If they traveled so long the seasons changed and they needed new clothes for the changing weather, they could expense that. The travel was a hardship, but like all Friends, ministers would receive the resources to keep from becoming destitute.

&gt; 4) No evangelisation. 

That's a later addition, circa 1800. A non-Quaker in the 1650s complained that we published and distributed so many tracts that our ""sinful Libels"" ""flye as thick as Moths up and down the country."" That is, as far as he was concerned, we were *flooding* England with Quaker tracts.

Oh, and the tracts/books/etc? They were written by those ministers. They were regarded as having the same authority as speaking in meeting. The ministers would travel around visiting other meetings, yes, but they'd also stand in a market place, pull out a copy of a pamphlet they wrote, and read it out. Yes, they were street preachers! And then they'd sell copies of the pamphlet.

Thomas Aldam went for a ""private"" meeting with Cromwell and *cough* just so happened to bring a big pile of pamphlets/books (they seem to call things books which are really quite small) with him. After he wasn't allowed in to see Cromwell, he handed out those books to the guards and soldiers and onlookers. Quaker trials for blasphemy? GREAT opportunity to hand out tracts and convince the masses!

Mary Fisher? She crossed Europe to go have a chat with the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and try to convince him.

-----

In the first half of the 1800s, inspired by London Yearly Meeting's sharp evangelical swing, American Quakers split into 3 factions (the orthodox one then split in the 1950s, which is where evangelical v. pastoral comes in). Each one emphasized some parts of Quakerism and threw away other parts. London Yearly Meeting swapped sides around 1900. 

Make no mistake, though: we all lost.",,1472826967.0,1475266355,t3_50rxic,d76qnd1

I have a lot to say about it, but before I begin: are you pixel-peeping? Looking at corner sharpness at 100% wide open? Then you can skip my post, because I don't care about that, and won't talk about it. I will talk about what it's like to *use* this lens.

The reason I picked up the a6000 in the first place was because I had a shoulder injury, and carrying my 6D with 24-105 was becoming a bit of a burden for travel. The a6000 with 16-70 is roughly an equivalent setup at less than half the weight (776g compared with 1670g, weighed on my scale, L-plates attached to both). 

I initially bought the 16-50 kit lens and 55-210 as a bundle. I liked the small size and light weight of the 16-50. I hated the power zoom. It wastes battery power, and it always starts up at 16mm; then if I want to zoom, I have to find the power zoom switch, and wait for the camera to zoom. Whereas, with the 16-70, I can use my fingers to zoom *while* the camera powers up, or even before, thus saving some time. Also, I noticed something: uncorrected images at 16mm with the kit lens are grossly distorted. The software needs to do a lot of correction in post on that lens at 16mm. This is not needed nearly so much for the 16-70.

I got a relatively high number of poorly focused shots with the kit zoom last year during my Ireland trip. Partly this was due to unfamiliarity with the gear, but partly because I just hated the kit zoom. I was very disappointed. I was also using my Canon EF-S 10-22 as my wide lens; I hated that, as well. It was bulky and tricky to focus with the adapter.

This spring I bought the 16-70 and Rokinon 12mm. I took them to Europe in July along with the 55-210. A trio which cannot be matched by my Canon gear in terms of light weight, by the way. I also brought an iPhone6.

I found the 16-70 to be an ideal travel lens. Out of 3118 photos taken with the a6000, 82% were taken with the 16-70. It's fast, small, fun to use, high quality, a great little lens. I took some of the best photos I've taken in years on that trip. Not a few satisfying shots, but a lot. I don't know if it inspired me, or just got out of my way, or maybe the places I went were more photogenic, I don't know.

But less and less possible as the gregorian reforms sought to 'clean up' compliance with Church law about celebate priesthood. 

I think one needs to be quite 'open' about solutions nobility had for these things. Families would live for generations together in the same estate, with one particular son being the 'lord', sisters being married off, and brothers being knights or leading aries or just helping to manage the business. And lordship was a business. In this, it's not so strange that these sons would become monks (thousands did, and they did not come from peasantry), or lawyers (thousands studied), or masters at university (hundreds did), or administrators in the growing apparatus of monarchs and the papacy, or canons at cathedrals.

We have this idea that nobility was an isolated class uninterested in the world. It's just not true: virtually the entire world of the Church (and it was VAST) was filled with minor nobility. Major nobility was such a small fragment of the population that it really had no consequence.

Two other notes: 

1. of great importance at this time was the development of what was deemed wasteland. The amount of former wasteland put into production (*assarting*) was astonishing. Medievals filled in swamps, cleared lands and made them usable, increased the productive capacity of existing lands dramatically through agricultural innovations. 

2. progressively through the high and late middle ages land was converted into rents for money (not labour) and so cash flowed into the chests of nobility; this allowed subdivision to be made easier and to have families split wealth by cash. Basically pay a child out into an independant life.

""Thank you for having us over so fast, it really contributes to our efforts to rebuild and reshape Oman to have such welcoming and open neighbours and partners.

To get down to bussiness, you migh have heard about the plans the Sultan announced for our nation. Basically, in political terms it means a reform to make our nation more attractive yo international investment by creating a system of check and balances to guarantee a functional and just legal system with clear rules. The Sultan will continue to be the Head of State, but will have to share his power with a Prime Minister. More details about this will follow in the draft constitution, which i'm sure we can send you over before it gets released to the public.

As for the economic reforms, they are perhaps our prime concern at the moment. We have several major infrastructure projects that we would like to begin with to inject more money into the system and this way reactivate the economy. But these projects will also serve to boost different sectors of our economy, such as our traditional oil and gas exports but will have a special emphasis in the diversification of our economy by reducing production and export costs of other commodities such as crops, food, spieces and finally tourism, which is on the rise in Oman.

Our goal is to carry out all this project with international help, as our finances do not allow for such big movements at once. However, as we intend to work closely with our neighbours and to contribute to the regional integration and cooperation between arab nations, we wanted to talk to you first, to see if Saudi Arabia could assist the Sultanate of Oman by promoting our projects withing the saudi private sector in order to botain financing.

We have also heard of a foreign aid program that your government offers. Perhaps it could also be used to contribute to this cause. Are we qualified to apply?

We are also discussing at the ongoing GCC Summit the possibility of extending the Qatar-Turkey gas pipeline to Oman and our port and LNG plant in Sur. This would allow our nation to lower the export costs of natural gas to Europe, and on the contrary, provide the arab nations with a new port to project our exports to the huge asian markets. The eventual route of this new stage of the pipeline would perhaps need to cross saudi territory, something we would like to discuss with you to obtain the permission of your nation.

Finally, we are deeply disturbed by the environmental disaster that occured in the red Sea, caused by extra-regional powers.

The first time around, the yes camp were keen to portray independence as a soft transition that wouldn't significantly alter the Scottish peoples' relationship with the rest of the UK. They promised no hard border, keeping the queen, and I distinctly remember Alex Salmond advocating that post-independence, the ""British"" identity would live on in Scotland in the same way that countries like Norway and Sweden share a ""Scandinavian"" identity. Not just through virtue of geography, but shared history and culture. A currency union ensuring Scotland could keep the pound and remain a consideration in its valuation would have been the final piece of this puzzle.

All of this would have been possible with both i-Scotland and the r-UK in the EU. Scottish people would have had the same freedom as before to travel around Great Britain and Ireland, move and work wherever they chose. It is likely that Scottish people would have kept rights like voting in the remaining UK as Irish citizens have done. Keeping the pound would have ensured no need for currency exchanges when crossing the border. In effect, none of the major changes people would normally associate with independence would have happened, and the emphasis on this by the yes side probably went some way towards swaying those on the fence.

Everything changes if Britain is outside the EU. None of these things are guaranteed, and are very unlikely if an independent Scotland joins the EU. Avoiding a hard border between Scotland and England, for example, would require the agreement of the entire European Union and would have very far-reaching consequences, as opposed to a simple agreement between two neighbouring states for mutual benefit.

So it is often said that the EU vote has meant some people who previously favoured no - to guarantee Scotland's EU membership - are now more likely to vote yes. However, it is possible that the consequences of having one state out of the EU and one state in, regardless of which is which, will also strengthen the arguments against independence. I am just speculating, however - only time will tell.",,False,1475266960,t3_50s4zs,d76retv

To outline some of the reasons why: The UK is exporting way less to the EU than it is importing and has an anual trade deficit with the EU of over a hundred billion dollars. In addition to that the UK export to the EU has been in steady decline for years now. Brexit enables them to form new partnerships with the other Commonwealth countries, the US, China and a lot of developing economies. Due to the UK economy being heavily service based they are also more flexible in that regard. In addition to that financial services will stay in the UK as the UK is the only European country using Common Law and has the most connections to tax shelters as well. The devaluation of the currency also boosts the economy in important areas such as tourism and export and some foreign goods being more expensive due to the devaluation leads to less imports and more compensation buys from products from the UK. The EU and especially the Germany are heavily dependent on export to the UK and would loose billions of dollars and millions of jobs if they put restrictions on trade with the UK while the UK would just have to go through a transition period. Of course this does not mean that it wouldn't be better for the UK to maintain trade relations as they still export a lot to the EU, which some of their industries needs but what I am saying is that the EU would take more damage if there were no trade relations, which by the way is not even a realistic scenario.

False,ukpolitics,,Hazzuh,t3_50tjbt,12,1472827150,0,t5_2qhcv,,0,12,"&gt;Listen to the crowing of Brexit supporters and you would think the economic shock from the vote to leave the EU was a figment of Remainers’ vivid imaginations. In August, UK manufacturing activity on the purchasing managers’ index jumped. At no time in the past 25 years has this measure seen a bigger monthly increase. Equivalent figures for the construction sector on Friday also bounced. Retail spending was strong in July and house prices are still rising.

&gt;So should we forget the warnings of an economic shock and mark this as a victory to those who said the Remain case amounted to “Project Fear”?

&gt;No. Far too much is being inferred from far too little data. There is no doubt the PMI figures this week were positive, just as their equivalents for July were negative, but they are not an infallible guide to either the present or future economy. The retail data were strong but indications of consumer appetite for large items, such as cars, has been weak. Much of the data remains conflicting and so far the noise outweighs the signal.

&gt;Proper caution about the data does not prevent comment, however. A significant range of indicators shows an improvement in August compared with July, suggesting Britain was cheered either by the initial stability of Theresa May’s government, the Bank of England’s actions to prop up the economy or the f
act that the sun is still rising in the east.

&gt;We are waiting for more important indicators, however. On Monday, we will learn about the PMI index for the services sector, which is four times as important as those from manufacturing and construction. The size of the August bounce in this measure will give a good indication of whether the shift in mood for the month was spread across the whole of business.

&gt;We will have to wait till late autumn to begin to know if company investment has held up as strongly as expected, which is the primary reason economists have reduced their forecasts.

&gt;There remain good reasons to expect an economic slowdown. Weaker sterling will lower real incomes as inflation goes up while uncertainty over the shape of Brexit will lead some companies to put projects on hold.
Some of these negatives will be offset by improved prospects for exports but the precise balance is simply not knowable.

&gt;Is Britain heading into recession? Immediately after the vote to leave the EU, when uncertainty was at its height, I thought it was. Now I think it probably is not. Growth is likely to slow but the extent to which the brakes come on is highly uncertain and dependent on both the general mood in Britain and the actions of the UK authorities in the months ahead.

The IRA ""murdered"" their way to freedom for my country from an occupying force, who was doing plenty of murdering themselves, why would Irish people have a problem with that? There's a lot more issues with the modern incarnations, but the PIRA didn't just spring into existence for no reason in the 1970's, I'm really sick of seeing this shite posted here and being used as an excuse to bash Irish people by Brits who don't appear to have any clue about NI beyond ""Fahking IRA cunts, innit"".

Northern Ireland was specifically created to have as much of Ireland retained as possible with a Protestant/Unionist majority kept in power within the UK after the Irish War of Independence in the 1920's. That power was then used to create an essentially [Apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segregation_in_Northern_Ireland) statelet, under the auspices of, and connivance with, the UK government. This state of affairs continued, for several decades, with Catholics/nationalists denied voting rights, education and housing, until the late 60's.

Inspired by the Civil Rights movement in the US, people began marching and protesting for equal rights, they were met with utter [brutality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_civil_rights_movement),beatings, and murder. Enraged by Catholic/Nationalist attempts to attain civil right, and backed by the sectarian RUC, Catholic/Nationalist homes were [attacked](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Northern_Ireland_riots) and Irish people were burned out of their homes, many fleeing across the border.

All of this resulted in a resurgence of the IRA, with nationalist areas begging for protection from both their Loyalist neighbours, and the sectarian RUC, incidents began rising and escalating. This resulted in the UK government sending the British Army to, in part, *protect Nationalist areas*. However, the genie was out of the bottle somewhat at this stage, with regular rioting and incidents of violence, The British Army began siding more and more with the Unionist government, raiding nationalist homes, harassing nationalists on the street, and doing things like [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Curfew). Illegal [Interment without trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius) was introduced, then the [Ballymurphy Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballymurphy_massacre) and [Bloody Sunday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1972)) happened, all in the space of a few years, dozens upon dozens of innocent civilians murdered by the Army


Nationalists in Northern Ireland marched for their rights and were beaten by a sectarian police force, then they were burned out of their homes by Loyalist mobs backed by that police force, the Army that was supposed to protect them harassed them, and imprisoned them without trial, it then started murdering them. The above is essentially ""How to create an insurgency 101"", it created a generation of Irish people determined to fight back, can you honestly say you wouldn't have? Thatcher's policies in the 1980's ensured that the conflict continued far longer than it should have, until we got to where we are today.

I'm sure you'll dismiss the above as a wall of text or something, but the fact of the matter is, the British Army, and Government, and by extension the British people who voted for those successive governments, created the IRA, and continued fueling the conflict for decades. The UK was found guilty in EU courts of carrying out torture, have been found to have been colluding with Loyalist murder squads, British soldiers murdered unarmed civilians in the street with no consequence. That's where the IRA came from, that's not excusing what they did, or condoning it, but any British person who dismisses the IRA as ""murderers"" hasn't a clue about their own country's dirty history....",,False,1475268012,t3_50sus2,d76sqr6

Now, moving on, the US and UK calculate poverty differently, and the US poverty line is almost certainly [too low](http://inequality.org/americas-real-poverty-rate/). Update it from 1969, then we'll talk.

That graph was not meant to show that France was richer than the United States. All it was meant to show was that adjusted for inflation, France's people got richer while Americans didn't. Sure, France was significantly poorer than the US in the 1970s (1970 was only 25 years after the end of World War II after all), but it has steadily caught up while the US has stagnated. Although there is the fact that France has a 35-hour workweek and 5-week vacation entitlements by law, as well as strong labor protections that provide job security, and most French workers are simply not going to give that up, even for more money and economic growth (there were riots in France not too long ago over a modification of labor laws by the government). It seems that to a certain extent, Europeans prefer more leisure time to more material wealth, but have been slowly but surely catching up to the US in material wealth anyway.

That's what you don't get. Europeans don't just have a better quality of life than Americans due to material wealth, it's mainly because of the sanity and peace of mind they have compared to Americans. Britons, Frenchmen, Germans, Swedes, Irishmen, etc will never have to worry about affording a health procedure, have plenty of leisure time, cannot be fired all of a sudden and have real power to stand up to their bosses, and are far less likely to end up on the streets. 

The age of mothers isn't that big of an excuse. First off, the US had an average age of mothers at first childbirth only two years ahead of Russia and identical to Iran, last I checked (Iran's people don't behave like you would expect in many ways). But the US is richer than those countries, having rates comparable to those places is inexcusable. There simply isn't enough of an age gap to justify this.

&gt;muslim ban

Would have no effect on religious freedom or practice whatsoever. Would also have no effect on Americans. The reason the ban is constitutional is because it's an immigration policies that would only affect foreigners (non-Americans) who send applications to the U.S. Trump wouldn't be making any laws about the practice of relligion.

&gt;deporting illegals

I'm a legal American with a license, ssn, passport, birth certificate, and all requisite documents. If someone tries to pull me out of my home, I will defend myself.


&gt;freedom of speech

Trump has been more open to questions, interviews and press conferences than any other candidates. He's also unable to unilaterally make laws regarding the media and the 1st amendment makes it very difficult to do so. Regardless, I thought progressives made the argument that none of the amendments are absolute? That they all have limits?

Let's assume Trump is going to push for a change in media law. Why should I reasonably believe this will lead to fascism or something dangerous?

Even if it's Donald ""Literally Hitler"" Trump that spearheads the ban. The reason for this lies in the overal tension (in Europe especially) that Islam creates.

Let's be frank, Islam does not get along with anyone. Europe is not an exception. 

After suffering terror attack after terror attack, mass rape after mass rape. Being forced to allow thousands of them to immigrate, having to put up with the consequences as the responsible politicians ignore the chaos they've wrought. 

When a crime happens, you can bet your ass it's a muslim culprit. Our prisons are filled to the **brim** with muslim criminals. 
There are huge, spreading muslim ghettos into which terrorists can freely disappear due to a combination of ""moderates"" hiding them and the intelligence units just being quite the opposite of what their name would imply.

The reason this is applauded in the UK and the similar burkini ban in France is because it gives the public a glimmer of hope. It shows that, however inconsistent the law may have been lately, Muslims are not *entirely* above it. Achilles the immortal has a weak spot.

We, the European people, are desperate. Backstabbed by our leaders and overrun by those sworn to destroy us.

People just want to be able to walk down the street after dark without being mugged or killed by a muslim. They want to be able to travel without fear of a muslim blowing himself up. Our children to grow up without needing ""terrorism drills"" from age 3 and up.

As a European, something so simple as a ban on burqas seriously lets me breathe a little easier, knowing we can still push *back.* They haven't won yet, we can still take back our land, our values.

That would have the pro union side in pretty serious trouble imo. There was a serious attempt by the Yes side to get people interested and involved. And that worked to a large extent. 

However, the high turnout was not just driven by that. It was also driven by massive media coverage which was hugely favourable to the No side. Those who never engaged with either campaign (low information voters frankly) were overwhelmingly more likely to vote No. 

A lower turnout would undoubtedly be better for a future Yes campaign because their voters would be more likely to come out. That's the same scenario as for the EU referendum vote. It never came close to the same level of turnout as the indyref, but it was those seeking change who were more motivated to vote.

For starters, you start at war against the *gringo* slavers of Tejas who want independence from your enlightened and slavery-free rule and are on the same damned continent as the USA. Who would intervene if ever the Texans are losing and they are on a friendly status with them. 

If you lose Austin in said war, which is part of Texas, the USA gets the option to use the Manifest Destiny decision, giving them free cores on half your country. Chances are you would lose in this scenario, leading Mexico to become as truncated as they are today.

I had the expansion DLC (*A House Divided* and *Heart of Darkness*) but I did not yet play the Historical Project Mod (different conditions for Manifest Destiny), so everything hinged on that first war. 

Get rid of some of the Irregulars, reduce naval spending and get some proper artillery and calvary. Let Texas siege some of your land so the US won't intervene, and avoid a direct battle against them as you send your properly equipped troops to cover all of Texas in a siege. 

You time it right, and all of Texas will be sieged down on the same day (siege down maybe one provinces and then divide your troops into four sieging forces with two mobile artillery units to alternate between provinces so as to control the siege rate).

If the US intervenes as you hit 100% war score, annex Texas and siege down Los Angeles. Use that little navy of your to make a small blockage to boost your warscore for a white peace.

Thereafter, you'll be free to do what you want with no Manifest Destiny looking over your head. Note that the US will still out-immigrate you on virtue of having provinces with life rating *45* where the average in Europe is 30.",,False,1475270398,t3_50ppnk,d76w07j

It also allows you to be open to meet new people and doing things that you might not have the opportunity to do in a group. You will be able to see/experience a lot more on your own, see exactly what you want and not what you don't want. 

So you have a week to come up with a general outline of your trip. The great thing about Europe, is that everything can be traveled by train and on short notice. Flights between major European cities are quite inexpensive when booked ahead of time, trains allow you to get up and go at your own leisure. Say you’re not into Amsterdam, you can book a train that afternoon and be in Paris that night or next morning. 

No doubt, you should stay in hostels, best way to meet people. There will be people traveling in groups as well as other people traveling solo; and travelers are the coolest group, so you’ll have no problem getting along. I used alltherooms.com/VB to book my hostels when I traveled solo through South America.

Exactly, people jump only one benefit, corporate tax, and ignore other benefits countries can offer to multinational companies that setup in their territory . Ireland offers the lower corporate tax to offset other disadvantages.

&gt;Ever since 2008 the potential ongoing benefits to EU states on the ""periphery"" are getting smaller and smaller.

The EU is still good to be in, unless we want to go back to being d a bunch of smaller countries at the mercy of larger ones, but parts of the EU, like the EU commission, also need to be kept in check in regards to the national sovereignty. ",,False,1475270924,t3_50sye5,d76wrbx

While I don't necessary agree with everything OP said, I do feel that this debate is extremely similar than the one social movements had in the 1960s and I thought we got through with these divisions.

As a white female, I do believe there's a kind of hierarchy of oppression. I do believe that white women have less privilege or advantages in the proletariat than white men, I do believe white women have more privilege or advantages than black women, etc, etc.  And I do believe that these issues need to be talk about and resolve. 

I think our movement would be much stronger if it could stop reducing everybody's oppression and if it could start listening to the different type of manifestation of oppression that capitalism can take. ",,False,1475270985,t3_50qeu4,d76wujl
