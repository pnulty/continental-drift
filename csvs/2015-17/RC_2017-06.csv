Russia is a petro state. Even if there are sanctions, they will still find customers for their oil and gas. Even if Europe puts more severe sanctions on them, which is doubtful.

Even if it all gets exposed, it probably reinforces Putin's power at home, who will be able to boast how he put America to its knees and is definitely the leader Russia needs.

The worst that could happen is being cut off from western technology and he'd just deal with China instead, who have knock-offs of nearly everything the US provides.

Sure, absolutely, but no country limited to only its native players will be better than a top european domestic league gathering the best players of other countries. Not 60s Brazil, not modern era Spain or Germany, not any era of England/Italy/Holland. Otherwise, it would have never been a criticism in the first place.

Also, your point about conditioning in today's game is almost completely irrelevant, everyone is at the same level playing field today and back then no matter what type of football you're looking at. Unlike my original point, that Pele in Brazil's best team dedicated hos entire life to football, while his opponents literally could not. Similar to your way of thinking, would Pele be just as dominant if everyone else is putting 100% into their career instead of having real jobs on the side? I highly doubt it

AAAAAACAAAAAA____J,,,"Customarily (at least in Europe/America), the bride and groom have their attendants (bridesmaids and groomsmen), two of which act as the official witnesses (for canonical purposes). But there's no requirement to have those attendants particularly or that they stand up there. They must be morally present at the ceremony and (Depending on jurisdiction) may actually need to sign that they were witnesses. 

Opposite-sex attendants is a fairly modern custom and probably much more commonly associated to same-sex weddings and secular ideas. But historically other than royalty/wealthy people, it would likely be more common anyways for a couple to have only one witness/attendant each. The reason why they usually are of the same-sex probably has to do with 1) mixed-sex socializing was less common and 2) close associates, especially of nobles were generally of the same-sex (lady-in-waiting for example). 

That said, there's also nothing preventing you from having your brother give a toast, etc instead of some female associate. ",True,0,1496277009,,False,0,diaoqca,t3_6eavx4,t3_6eavx4,1498962370,2,False,Catholicism,t5_2qi4f,

What I meant to convey was that nothing about how the final image appears on the canvas is gotten for free. So, for instance, I'm sure he looked up reference images of a machine gun, like [this](http://period5team1.weebly.com/uploads/4/3/7/1/43714593/6273008_orig.jpg) but it's not at the correct angle, under the right lighting conditions, etc... necessary for the painting to function. He has to look at that reference, understand how it's constructed in 3D space, draw it in the relevant perspective, and then paint the appropriate lighting and material attributes. 

I mean, let's just consider how the [photo](http://www.european-girls.com/uploads/photos/resized/article-detail/114-red-head-blye-eyes-european-girl.jpg) OP referenced might appear in Brad Rigney's painting. *Now* how is the shadow under her chin cast? Uh oh. We don't have that information. *Now* how do the anisotropic reflections on her hair react to the light sources? We don't have that information. We would have to imagine what it would look like being backlit by machine gun fire and neon lights and all the bounce light and color bleeding and cast shadows, etc... So, no, those questions are *not* largely answered by reference photos. 

We are talking about a whole other universe of difficulty.

I agree that, due to the stylized nature of Rigney's painting, it does not fall under the same level of scrutiny as absolute photorealism (although OP's painting is slightly stylized), but I don't think as much as you would think. You can easily see that other stylized artwork, like [this](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/006/098/656/large/mary-guo-11.jpg?1496060212) ,which someone might very well enjoy, is not hitting any of the marks as far as the principles of art are concerned (perspective, anatomy, lighting, materials).

Evil_Robot_King,,,"Think about it this way.  (And I'm working under the assumption that the ultimate goal of developed nations is to provide the highest median standard of living for their citizens through some combination of high wages, low prices, and low unemployment)  

Say you create a club composed of the US, EU, commonwealth, Japan and a few others.  All developed, high income, democratic regions.  Let's call them the Trade Federation.  

So the Trade Federation decides they're tired of having their markets disrupted by imports from low wage economies because they want to have high wage economies where people make a lot and spend a lot, and they know their workers won't accepted the same conditions as workers in low wage economies.  So they put an import tax not just on solar panels from China, but imports of all goods and services from all non-Trade Federation countries roughly equal to the price difference due to lower wages and regulations, essentially taking that out of the equation.  They have an agreement with each other to not tax imports at all internally.  Naturally countries like China will counter with their own taxes on imports from Trade Federation markets.  This is fine.  This will increase the price of many goods, but not by much, and will also increase wages.  There will be a net loss in production efficiency due to loss of specialization but a significant net gain in internal control and stability which will in turn also increase efficiency.  TF has a market of over a billion people spanning several continents and includes all the high productivity regions, they'll be perfectly fine without trade from developing economies.  

Except trade from developing economies is still easily possible.  Spain can still import Chinese solar panels if the Chinese process is actually more efficient, China can still import American microprocessors if they can't produce a domestic alternative.  

Given playing catchup is easier than innovation, China should still grow at a much faster rate relative to more developed economies and, one would expect, eventually join the Trade Federation.  

The slightly lower prices just aren't worth the disruption and taken as a single market, the developed, high wage, high hourly productivity countries simply do not need anything at all from developing countries (though it's not like this would realistically end trade).  

What's more I really do not want to deal with all of the complexities of unrestricted trade between wildly different economies during the impending automation revolution.  The developed countries are going to spearhead it because we have the most pressure to automate due to high wages, and the highest concentration of technical capability.  We need to work it out ourselves, in a simpler, more manageable environment.

KubrickIsMyCopilot,,,"The way people look changes continuously over generations, and populations blend into each other, forming new groups over time through the merging and division of past ones.  What physical features people in any given time period choose to focus on is arbitrary.

For instance, someone with red hair and very pale skin (a ""ginger"") would have been singled out as a race in Roman times - a feature of the Celtic gene pool.  Their appearance distinguished them and led to discrimination for a long time.  Likewise, blondes with blue eyes were considered a ""barbarian"" race, stereotyped as stupid, violent, drunken illiterates because they came from tribal lands North of Roman influence.  

Ginger and blonde are not considered races now, just subtypes of ""white"" people - a broader race that has come into social focus in modern centuries due to the extreme disparity in wealth and technology that Europe attained through the Industrial Revolution.

Similarly, before large-scale contact with people outside of their broad genetic grouping, there was no internal group identity of ""black"" people in Africa, nor of ""Oriental"" people in Asia.  These groupings result from contact with people who had greater differences than the nearer groupings - i.e., a *social construct* based on relative differences.  

Among very isolated peoples, the distinction between one ""race"" and another might be from one valley to another - slightly lighter hair, slightly taller stature, a slightly different shape of nose.  People invent distinctions to fit their circumstances.  

The idea that Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. people would belong to a single ""race"" group would have been found ludicrous to all of them at most points in their history, and in fact at most points even those modern groups would have been considered extreme generalizations of the local subgroups that now comprise them.  Those groups formed out of the fusion of many.

In the future, the ""races"" defined in the present will probably lose focus and new ones will be defined by future demographics.  This will be especially true when and if future political changes or catastrophes drive various groups of people together, creating both melding and politically-driven resistance.

I find the idea of a collective objective reality very curious. I think it's something we take for granted because we live in a homogeneous society. Have you heard the story of the Native Americans not seeing the Europeans' ships when they were arriving? It's because they had no context to understand what that was. Now I don't know if this story is true - but there are huge cultural disconnects that we can see from studying cultures much different from our own. Even language itself shapes how we think and what we see in the world. I'm not going to research tons of examples, but they are out there. For instance, there was a South American indigenous group who didn't distinguish between the color blue and green. It may have been the same group that didn't have numbers greater than 3 (they had 1, 2, and ""many""). There's a Polynesian indigenous group that had no way to talk about time (past and future).

What I'm trying to say is - your concept of objective reality can only exist because you are surrounded by like-minded people. Even so, you can't truly see the world from their perspective. That's why to me life is entirely subjective.

It's a big difference of opinion- what you said and how I think of things. Maybe now that I've explained this you can understand why some people are ""spiritualists"".

I'm not an expert on Danish or Norvegian politics but from what I've seen these are just quite leftist countries, the whole spectrum is shifted (depends on a POV) and as in most of countries the differences are minor, all of the parties can create a ""grand coalition"" between each other like in Germany or EP with some minor outsiders on left and right.

discovering_NYC,northamerica,New York City,"Thanks! The first Europeans came to the area in 1637, settling along the Harlem Creek. The sandy plains were initially known to the Dutch as Otterspoor, “otter tracks,” and Coneykeekst, “home of rabbits” (this was similar to the original name for Coney Island). The village of Nieuw Haarlem was incorporated in 1658 with the blessings of Director-General Peter Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant not only wanted another Dutch settlement on Manhattan, but he was also looking for it to be a buffer against New England, which had been eyeing New Amsterdam for some time (this was also the reason that the [defensive palisade](http://i.imgur.com/ouKSn6o.jpg) was built along the northern edge of the city, along which De Waal Straet was laid out, later becoming Wall Street). 
 
After the British took over, northern Manhattan was surveyed, and in 1666 a boundary was drawn between the limits of New York and Harlem. Known as the “Harlem Line,” it extended from East 74th Street to West 129th Street and allowed settlers to keep their land grants if they swore allegiance to the British crown. It was administratively a part of New York, yet remained a somewhat independent settlement through the Revolution (it was burned to the ground after the nearby Battle of Harlem Heights in September, 1776). After the war, a group rebuilt the old village, but it was smaller than it had been, with around 100 families. 
 
A major change came to Harlem with the opening of the New York and Harlem Railroad in 1837. Folks could now take the line downtown, allowing more people to live in the area and commute downtown. When Central Park was being built, Harlem became a destination for wealthy families, many of whom built mansions near the bigger park, or the smaller [Mount Morris Park](http://i.imgur.com/Gfw0dY0.jpg) (known as Slang Berg, “snake hill” to the Dutch). It was a popular past time for moneyed gentlemen to race horses along St. Nicholas Avenue. Harlem retained a heavily rural appearance well into the 1870s and 80s, when the opening of the elevated lines prompted developers to build brownstones and rowhouses in the area. 
 
There were other small villages in Manhattan, but similarly to Harlem, as far as the government was concerned they were also a part of New York. Greenwich Village was never incorporated as its own settlement, but it was an important area, so much so, in fact, that it retained much of its original street grid when the Commissioners were laying out the grid on the rest of Manhattan. Peter Stuyvesant laid out his own street grid on his farm in 1660, which was called [Bowery Village](http://i.imgur.com/jlPQ6q4.jpg) (the only remnant of it remaining is Stuyvesant Street, which once led to Stuyvesant’s farmhouse). There were a series of small villages on the Upper West Side, which remained undeveloped for longer compared to the east side due to its rocky topography: Harsenville (located near 70th Street and Broadway), Stryker’s Bay (located near 96th Street and 11th Avenue), [Manhattanville](http://i.imgur.com/IPZi0Sc.jpg) (incorporated in 1806, located along the Hollow Way, now 125th Street), and Carmansville (located near 155th Street and Broadway). There were also a number of other settlements and shantytowns dotting the island, including [Seneca Village](http://i.imgur.com/ewlSQaE.jpg) (located near 86th Street and 8th Avenue, its residents were evicted and their land used for Central Park), and [Dutch Hill](http://i.imgur.com/zulJKli.jpg) (located where Tudor City is now).

Tundur,,,"Indeed, if you accept the principle that arbitrarily giving some people property and letting them exploit the labour of others for profit is immoral, then attempting to defend that property and the system which gave you it is unjustified violence. From a communist perspective it is essentially self-defence. There are plenty of examples (like, half of what Stalin and Mao got up to, seriously what the fuck were they doing) of atrocities that must be blamed on the people who carried them out, but we should still bear in mind *why* they were in power in the first place before ascribing it to a structural flaw in communism.

I have the Russian Revolution as an example but you can pick any other and see the same patterns emerge. People do not resort to revolution until they are desperate. China, Vietnam, Korea (don't worry I'm not a Kim apologist), Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, South America, Thailand, Malaya, Burma (again, fuck the Khmer Rouge). All states held up as examples of unwarranted communist aggression and all states where, looking at the actual history, it was in fact incredibly warranted.

I disagree that a blank slate is necessary - merely a critical mass of power is necessary, and in the early 20th century it came incredibly close. All the nations of Europe came very close to revolution - the UK had the military deployed on the streets, Germany had a revolution which was only barely interrupted by a series of unfortunate mistakes, Spain was plunged into a brutal civil war, France almost capitulated in WW1. If it wasn't for the violent repression of these movements then we would have seen the majority of the world's industrial might in the hands of communism and a very different path being trod.

I can talk about the usual communist  reasoning why a moderate solution - capitalism regulated and complemented by socialist policies - is untenable but their basic conclusion is that the two cannot exist in equilibrium because capital's power is global and inherent/mechanical while socialist policies are local and based on human political will. This is avoiding entirely the ""exploitation is immoral"" aspect. This also ties in to the ideological basis for fascism and why some prominent fascists were, in an earlier life, socialists but that's a whole 'nother deal.

I can kind of rant, sorry about that. It sounds like you're at least somewhat interested in all this and it's hard to ""stumble upon"" what communists actualy believe without specifically looking for it. I'd recommend checking out /r/communism101, even if you've no intention of 'converting'. There's plenty of easy to read literature there that explains it in far better terms and language than I'll ever manage and - given how it defined the last 150 years of history - it's a useful concept to get to grips with, even if it's just for hitting on sociology students.",True,0,1496281656,,False,0,dias9je,t3_6ehd0b,t1_dian8s3,1498964115,2,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,

b0mmie,fan ibp,iBUYPOWER Fan,"True, I'm not sure why ESL chose to go with a round robin format like this with automatic semi-final bids when there are a few good group stage formats to choose from.

But at the same time, I suppose this is also a reward for North for playing well (3-0) the first day. After beating Optic in their first game of Day 2 (4-0), they could just coast and take it easy since they locked up 1st place.

I know people hate the comparisons, but it happens almost every season in the NFL or NBA or whatever else sport. If a team has locked up a top seed for the playoffs, they'll just rest their starters for the last few games of the season since there's nothing to play for. You can say that's not fair for other teams who are in contention with the opponents of the resting team, but well... I guess they should have just played better earlier in the season to avoid the situation.

Regardless, it *is* a shitty group stage format for such a small amount of teams, I wish they just used GSL (would have to add more teams but I don't think people would be mad if 4 more EU slots were added: FaZe, Astralis, Heroic, NiP).

Let’s. Fucking. Go. 

Last 10  LWWWWWWWLW

Today’s Pick

🔥🔥*Cavs/Warriors u225.5* 🔥🔥 This is a 3 star play. 

I am taking the under pick for multiple reasons, with the main reason being that these teams have not even come close to scoring 226 points in the last 9 meeting between the two (2016 finals and this regular season). I understand that KD was not part of the team in 2016 finals, you do not have to argue this point with me.

Defense. Two of the best defense’s in the league are matching up head to head. This will mean highly contested shots, paint presence, and plenty of turnovers and wasted possessions. I think this will cause the two teams to run posstions late into the shot clock slowing the game down.

Rest. The rest these two teams got, Warriors even more than the Cavs, will play a big part in the way this game 1 plays out. Look at how the Warriors came out in game 1 vs the Spurs. They took a long break between series and the Spurs came out and hit them in the mouth. They were shook the entire first half of the game. 

This leads me to my bonus pick of the game, for the previously stated reasoning. 

🔥*Cavs +2.5 Q1*🔥

I combined these two picks for 1 unit ($25) in a parlay with some nice juice. 
[betslip]( https://nitrogensports.eu/betslip/874c6c3NjROcjlMa2lHWDg4Y2FiMEJQMjEyQT09/r/1933229/)

Bonus pick 2

🔥*Warriors -7* 🔥

Tread with caution on this pick, maybe half a unit. I only picked this up because of a stat I heard the other day. In 11 out of the last 12 game 1’s in the finals, the home team has covered the spread. Food for thought. 

Follow me @ [tonycashlocks](http://twitter.com/tonycashlocks) for more insight, bonus picks, and chance to win my free betslips.

This is going to be the hardest series to predict, we are going to need luck combined with our analysis to be profitable here. We have won a lot of money, practice good bankroll management throughout the finals, don’t blow your load prematurely.

UnbiasedPashtun,,,"There were four main groups of Germanics that traveled to Britain. They were: Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Frisians. Angles came from Schleswig, Saxons came from Old Saxony, Jutes came from Jutland, and Frisians came from Frisia. The Angles were the most influential/prominent Germanic group in Britain so that's why England is named after them. The Saxons were the second most prominent which is why the Celts (Irish, Scottish, Welsh) call the English that. Anglo-Saxon is just the Latin name for them based off the two most prominent tribes. The Angle and Jute people are now extinct in continental Europe whereas the Saxons and Frisians still live in the Netherlands and North Germany.

Since the homeland of the Anglo-Saxons did not have fertile land good for farming due to constant floods, they decided to go to Britain where the land was much more suitable to farming. There's a legend that also speaks of a British king named Vortigern who invited two Jutes to help defend the Britons from northern invaders (Picts, Scots) but that story is not verified. Anyways, since the Germanic tribes were from the northern part of continental Europe, they were seafarers and had relatively easy access to Britain. When the Romans left Britain, the people there were seen by the Germanics as weak and vulnerable to invasions from mainland Europe. In the region of modern day Poland, other Germanic tribes lived there at the time and were further away from the Anglo-Saxons. France was governed by the Romans. So Britain was easier to invade and conquer. It was both a migration and an invasion.

cromerax,whitenat,"Community Economics l Guns,Gold and Glory l Tribe above All","Diamond in the anthropological and historical community is disliked to say the least, actively hated at worst.

I'm not an anthropologist, and I feel that people who have read much more of Diamond's work than I could better express the criticisms that people have.

Here's are some reddit threads from /r/AskAnthropology and /r/AskHistorians 

[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1rzm07/what_are_some_of_the_main_anthropological/)

[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2mkcc3/how_do_modern_historians_and_history/)

With that being said, I'll do my best to offer some feedback on your questions.

&gt;Also, one of the alt-Right's arguments for higher IQ in Europeans is the harsher climate. How does this square with Diamond's idea that a homogenous climate there actually was ""easier""?

I have honestly never heard the ""harsh environment made higher IQ"" argument before. However, I think Diamond is missing that Europe has a fairly diverse climate from the Mediterranean South to the insane far-north ie Nordic areas, this combined with the plethora of rivers, lakes, and mountain ranges make Europe not really this ""homogenous"" utopia that Diamon thinks it is. 

&gt; Why didn't Africans domesticate ""Prey Domesticates"" to learn the skills that they could then use for ""Directed Domesticates""?

This may boil down to low-time preference. Africa is a very rich continent in terms of vegetation and agricultural capacity, so there isn't a need to domesticate these big animals, because smaller creatures are more than enough to supplement the large amount of edible vegetation.

&gt;Diamond argues that mountainous terrain allowed for fragmentation that benefited Europe over Asia by creating internal competition.

I haven't found much argument against the fracture theory, but your counterarguments are actually fairly solid. Fragmentation isn't always and advantage, nor is it always a disadvantage. It's important to account for other variables in this, and this is why Diamond has been criticized by people in his field.

&gt;Larger Population(this point was made by a History Cooperative writer in a review of Diamond's points)

From what I see the argument here is pretty good, however, if we're going to talk about how colonists diseases wiped out indigenous diseases, and somehow this trend didn't apply in reverse, we should also consider the enhanced medical knowledge and practices of colonist groups which may have contributed to them holding out longer than natives and thereby seizing the land.

All in all, Diamond isn't exactly who I would turn to for legitimate insight into development and what not. Is he entertaining? Yes, but I wouldn't count on his info too much.

Sernk,France,France,"Note that it is an european PoV , the iranian regime doesn't show the same hostility toward Europe except maybe the UK , also for historical reasons. We side with the US because you are a privileged partner while Iran is not and never will be , but if it wasn't the case the EU-Iran relationship would be pretty neutral as long as they don't act against Israel.

The influence of both the US and the UK was greatly exaggerated by the regime but you can't deny that the Shah in person was a puppet of these two states and that this regime didn't worked on the betterment of the living condition of the iranian people , while the regime arguably did even though in the same it spread fundamentalism in the lower class... (guess you can't have good mass education without mass endoctrinment for some people...)

Add to that the fact that the US helped Saddam Hussein during the war , and you have the recipe for a continuous hostility between your country and Iran. 

As to whether it was justified or not , it's a more complicated question. You can argue that it helped a bit to contain the islamist threat (although shias have a marginal influence in the muslim world) but in the same time the US actively helped mujahideens to repel the soviets in Afghanistan , effectively creating in the process both the Talibans and Al Qaeda which proved far more threatening for the world peace than Iran. It was at best clunky and the war resulted in 1 million death for nothing. 

The real concerns are not about the US now (who are not threatened by any means by Iran , even though they act like they are strong guys) but about Israel.Yes the hostage crisis is not a ""little thing"" , but it's not sufficient enough to justify such an hostile relationship. Turkey continue to deny a genocide yet they are member of NATO, we can as a group surpass these differences to work together when they are not essential anymore to define our relationships.

Such hostility toward Israel is dumb as rocks from their part (and their whole ideology about Israel is a heinous antisemitic mess , it's true. And that must be something we must remain ever vigilent about.) and will make them really isolated from the rest of the world. But leaving them isolated for this reason is maybe not the best idea either. It encourages a ""us vs them"" narrative that will always result in more popular support.

How could we as a group have a better image in Iran if the only thing we do is to threaten the country with sanctions when they do something we don't like? The previous US government understood this , at least.

Quardah,QC,Québec,"In this thread i see many people failing to realise or refusing to acknowledge the obvious factual difference in between the society that is Québec versus the Rest of Canada. Not only Québec has french roots and still stays the epicenter of french in North America, the society deeply functions differently has we have many laws overriding the federal ones.

How many times can you recall noticing ""Except in Québec..."" or ""If you are a resident of Québec..."" on things like purchasing parts in mutual funds or filling up a federal tax return? The law differs greatly.

Also the way our major cities look like is much more European that anywhere else in Canada. Look at Montréal or Québec City, the European roots dating back from the 17th century are obvious.

Not to forget the high presence of catholic heritage throughout the landscape in cities or in nature such as crosses on top of many mountains throughout the province.

And the strong nationalist sentiment... And the present culture...

And so on...

As a Québecois i have to tell you, while i've learned to accept the best out of every people i've ever met throughout the cosmopolitan city of Montréal that i live in and made a tremendous effort to become acceptably fluent in the english language to permit myself to share my heritage with everyone i would encounter in life, i find this deeply troubling that the Rest of Canada online always tries to justify it's deeply rooted hatred against my people. If you would take a moment and listen to us, you would understand we never hated the Canadian people but we only dislike the federal government for ignoring us and stepping over the will of our people every time.

Because for the federal government we're Canadians when it matter (like in 95) and we ain't when it doesn't matter (like the Churchill fall project, that they'd rather throw a gigantic amount of taxpayers money to the failing project instead of giving the contract to Hydro-Québec).

If for a moment you would give it a break maybe we could work together to achieve unity, otherwise the separatist menace will never die as we can never feel part of this country. We're outcasts and that's how the federal wants it to be.

TheCid,,,"&gt; I can see how low bond rates make it harder for the government to get enough money

This is actually not true! It's _high_ bond rates that make it hard for the government to get enough money. With low bond rates the government can essentially borrow as much as they want - they can just stop borrowing once the rates go up to a point they're uncomfortable with. Like, the way bonds work is you define a coupon and a face value and issue the bonds at auction. If the interest rates are ""too low"" people just won't bid equal to face value.

(This is how ""negative interest rates"" happen - governments set zero coupon bonds and banks and formula investors, forced to buy them, wind up having to bid past the face value. Even with a coupon this can happen, resulting in a yield lower than the coupon rate! Or vice versa - in a time of high interest rates, a market that thinks the coupon rate is too low will not bid face value at auction, resulting in a yield that's higher than the coupon rate.)

For... various reasons, everyone gets unhappy if the initial intake of borrowed money and the face value are too far apart (particularly, if you are paying _less_ than face value at auction), so bond offerings try to have interest rates in line with market expectations so that the coupon is the primary source of yield. (You want the face value to be roughly equal to the amount that you take in, so you can easily roll over the bonds if needed. ""See, we paid the coupon on this $10B of debt, please let us borrow $10B to pay the face value and we'll just continue paying coupons"" is a lot more reliable a proposition than ""We paid the coupon on this $10B of debt please let us borrow $20B to pay the face value which is going to cost us $40B to pay back later""! Of course if you see a bond auction and it's expected to be at face value and you can sneak in a bid that's at 950 instead of 1000 or something then you walk away pumping your fist, of course; especially if your plan is to sell the bond on the secondary market at or near face value before it matures.)

The argument is that this prolonged period of low interest rates has driven the stock market to high valuations. Or to put it another way, the stock market has now gotten so high that people who ""would"" invest in companies are just leaving their money under the mattress (so to speak) in anticipation of a drop in the stock market.

I am not sure I buy this argument (if it's true I'd expect the amount of investors short the market to be at or near an all-time high as well - I don't have data on this though), but it is plausible enough on the surface.

This *is* arguably why stuff that ""shouldn't"" be connected to the US market is also at an all-time high. I mean, no matter how you slice it - US, Japan, UK/Europe, BRIC, SEA, other emerging markets, whatever - everything's up. Really the only things that are down are certain commodities like oil. 

Basically investors have gone ""fuck it, bonds are worthless and US stocks are at an all time high, guess I'll buy EU/JP/whatever instead?"" And, given that it's been this way for several years running, there has been plenty of time for investors everywhere to make that call, which has driven everything up. And since everything is up, eventually investors conclude TINA, which drives the US market up, and then oh man valuations are so _high_ do I really want to pay 30 times earnings, and I can't buy bonds because there's no yield, uhhhh screw this I guess I'm buying Europe instead? And it's a bit of a cycle.

reanimat0r711,,,"I'm not saying that it could avoid sequelitis, I'm suggesting that there are screenwriting pitfalls that you can avoid because of how it's set up, notably exposition. Imagine if you tried to setup The Avengers from the start with none of the early Marvel films. Establishing every single one of those character's powers, backstory, etc. You would be so buried in having to explain to the audience who these people are, what they want, what their capabilities are that it would take you so long to get to any real drama or relations between the characters. I don't think The Avengers is the pinnacle example in blockbuster screenwriting, but I do think Whedon's attempt to portray these people as a dysfunctional family where their egos and character flaws clash succeeded very well dramatically. That film's weakness showed towards the end where that dynamic took a backseat to the SPLOSIONS. I would also say this is partly where Batman Vs Superman failed so hard. Not having a properly established Batman or Wonderwoman, then trying to shoehorn all these other characters and villains in made it incredibly clunky. I don't think it bodes well for the Justice League either, not that I'll be seeing it. That said, Avengers II was very much plagued with sequelitis and probably was due to the mechanics of an extended universe, but could've been avoided with a less copied story.

Also, I disagree that I'm taking it for granted that EU translates to spinoffs.

I think mini-series and expanded universes allow totally different things. Technically all the Marvel TV shows are their own mini-series, but you couldn't explore everything they wanted in Daredevil if you had all of the other characters heaped in with them with their own arcs.

Ewannnn,clegg-img,Nick Clegg,"Labour is garbage in many ways, but so are the Conservatives. My major issues with Con are:

1. Their immigrant-baiting, and lack of ability to actually deal with the consequences of immigration, which makes the situation worse.
2. Their position on benefits and redistribution (this also links in w/ immigration), I don't agree at all with the right-wing idea that benefits need to be cut. More redistribution is good in my book. I don't like the demonization that goes on either, this just pushes us away from cash redistribution and towards ridiculously high minimum wages and other less effective policies. **Cash benefits should be promoted as good policy,** not something that needs eliminating. We should also move towards more cash benefits without strings attached, again this is classic right-wing ideology at the forefront, thinking poor people are too stupid to know how to spend their money.
3. Their targets on the deficit and cuts in general. I don't agree with where they have cut, and do not agree with reaching an overall surplus. I think the Lab/Lib position of balancing current spending makes more sense. I find the debate on this issue totally toxic (""magic money tree"", ""living within our means""), as if the government should run their budget like a family does (""pub economics""). 
4. Their Brexit position is obviously ridiculous. I have little faith in them coming up with a good deal if anything it is more likely we will end up with nothing with the kind of rhetoric we are seeing (could just all be for show though). 

To be honest I just find the Conservatives are toxic in terms of the debate around immigration, benefits, fiscal policy and the EU. It's the classic right wing bootstrap view which I've just never agreed with. 

There's a lot more that I could say but the above are the fundamental issues I have with their philosophy. If we could change the debate on these issues, the UK could become a much more open economy. Immigration is fundamental, I can't stress that enough. 

Anyway, as you can guess I would vote Lab if I was in a marginal. I don't so I'm voting Liberal. This is generally how I have always voted. I just fundamentally disagree with the Conservative philosophy around how our society should work at the end of the day.

c3o,EURO,EU,"In EU lawmaking, the Commission (~""government"") first proposes a plan and then the Parliament (directly elected representatives of the people) and Council (member state governments) have to agree – or they can suggest changes.

On the topic of copyright reform, the Commission has proposed:

1. Force internet platforms that accept user uploads and have a lot of them to scan all uploads to identify copyrighted works to prevent them from going online. This is aimed at YouTube, but would also make life hard for e.g. Wikipedia and Github. It will kill EU web startups that can't afford the required tech. Details: https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/censorship-machines/

2. Introduce a special extra copyright for news sites, so that news publishers can charge Facebook, Google News and everyone else who reproduces even the tiniest snippets of news (e.g. the headline, a thumbnail, an excerpt) – i.e. also Reddit, private blogs, etc. Details: https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/extra-copyright-for-news-sites/

Those proposals are dangerous and would harm the web – and not even achieve their goals. That's not just a political position, it's the unanimous consensus of independent academic experts all across Europe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR5CfAZ1Nwk

Now the Parliament has to find a position on these plans. To do so, experts on the topic from all the different political groups sit together to work out a text that they think can get a majority in a vote that then follows.

The result of this process in one important committee was:

* ""Let's de-fang proposal #1 and outrightly reject proposal #2"".

That's very sensible.

But the spokesperson for the largest group, the Conservative EPP (the party of e.g. Merkel and Orban), is not happy with that outcome. So he wrote his own ""compromise"" that he is asking individual Members of the Parliament to vote for, instead of the actual compromise reached by the official group negotiators. If enough jump ship and vote for his text, this will become the official position of the committee and thus strongly influence the future negotiations and the eventual outcome of the whole process.

Now, his ""compromise"" is not a compromise at all – it's the Commission proposals on steroids. For example, he doesn't just want the extra copyright for news to not be rejected, he wants to make it last for 50 years – so that quoting a headline from 1967 today would in many cases become illegal without a license. He wants the obligation to censor uploads to also apply to sites that just link to stuff, not even host files themselves.

It's an extremist position that he hopes enough clueless back-benchers, who didn't take part in the negotiations, might support – because the big music industry and publishing lobbies claim that this is what they need to survive in the internet age. (In reality, they hope to regain an upper hand over web platforms that have been becoming more powerful than them, and to make some extra cash. They don't mind if it breaks the open web in the process.)

That's why this Member of Parliament is publicizing what's happening and asking people to call their representatives and tell them to vote on June 8 for the official, sensible compromise, and not this attempt to force an extreme lobby position through the most democratic EU body with shady tactics.",True,0,1496288919,,1496291223,0,diaxlsp,t3_6eeyhz,t1_diah332,1498966720,77,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

&gt; So I took a quick look at the front page and it seems the game is a dumpster fire, but I'd still like to play a few games here and there.

**Basically, people are not happy because:**

* New premium tanks (such as Chrysler K GF, Defender, Scorpion, maybe Patriot?) are relatively better than existing non-premium tanks of the same tier.  Some feel that there is a ""power creep"" going on where new premium vehicles are becoming more powerful.  In the past, premium vehicles tended to be just *slightly* weaker than their non-premium counterparts, but they made you a lot more sliver profit.

* The most recent premium tanks have excellent frontal armor, but with no clear weak spots.  If you want to pen them from the front there are no weak spots to aim for, you just have to press 2 and use premium ammo.  The new premium tank also has a gun with low-ish penetration rating.  Many feel like these new premium tanks are just designed to gently encourage the use of gold rounds (and therefore indirectly spending money on the game which could be viewed as pay-2-win).

* SirFoch (well known Youtuber and used to be offical WG Community Contributor) posted a critical video of the Chrysler K, basically saying what I mentioned above with lots of ""fuck Wargaming"" and ""Wargaming is greedy assholes"" etc.  A WG employee threaten to copyright strike his channel if he didn't remove the video.  Basically, they were trying to censor his criticisms and allegations of pay-to-win. SirFoch is also no longer a WG Community Contributor.  

[Jim Sterling's video for a general summery of this and his perspective](https://youtu.be/TQ1OXSusKdw)

[Kotaku Article](http://kotaku.com/negative-world-of-tanks-video-gets-taken-down-after-dev-1795398541)

1. That is actually an abuse of the copyright system and is illegal.

2. WG in the past said they would never pursue anyone for copyright infringement for posting World of Tanks videos.

3.  They made claims like ""we never did that,""  ""oh wait we did, sorry,""  ""we removed his CC status because his video was hateful and homophobic"" .... except it was not at all homophobic.  Some of these statements were coming from different departments of WG so people weren't sure what the real stance of WG was for a while.  It took them a few days to finally give a [half-ass apology](https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/general-news/sirfoch-statement/).

* Ranked Battles: Only for Tier X, the best players are rewarded with super-duper equipment that gives ~2.5% better stats than basic equipment.  People are unhappy because 1. you are rewarding the very best players with equipment to give them even more of an advantage when they play against lesser players.  2. Tier X only: the cost of playing Tier X tanks encourages the use of either a premium account or use of premium tanks.  Basically getting you to spend money.

* WG ran a video during the grand finals to address this, but it was patronizing and out of touch to me.  They were basically like, ""no, the game is balanced we promise, you just don't understand"" and ""premium ammo is fair, if you play enough you can easily afford it.  If you play only a little, that is why we let you just buy it... see it's fair!""

* Also new matchmaker has very mixed opinions.  Some say it has helped keep the teams more balanced.  Nearly everyone agrees Tier VIII is getting screwed right now.  (only top tier like ~15%) and frequently bottom tier due to the new system.


&gt; Are the Obj 140/T-62A (and mediums in general) still the tank of choice for skilled players, or has the game become World of Heavies?

My understanding is that the meta is still medium tanks.

&gt; Did they make any changes to ammo, pen or accuracy?

Just gently encourage the use of premium ammo.

Also, not here but World of Tanks Blitz acknowledged that premium ammo basically helps players do 15% more damage on average.  So to balance this out their premium shells now do 15% less damage.  So you can fairly trade penetration for damage.  Many people wonder why not do this in World of Tanks?  Seems fair to us.


&gt; Overall, has the game gotten better or worse over the last year?

Well they redid the matchmaker.  And they reworked arty and light tanks.  Light tanks are re-balanced so they get normal matchmaking.  General consensuses among light tank players is that they were nurfed a little to hard.  Idk if this is true as I don't play light tanks.

People were getting sick of being one-shotted by arty.  So now arty does like half the damage, but in replacement it has a stun effect where all of your crew and equipment is stunned for 10 seconds.  You can move and shoot but you are noticeably sluggish on the response.  I belive arty's rate of fire has been increased.  So you might not get one-shotted, but you can easily be pined down by more than one arty picking on you.

**Should you keep playing this game?**
Personally, I just hop on and play a few Tier V or VI battles.  I keeps away from some of the issues I addressed above, and you should be able to play just fine without premium ammo.  I won't be spending any money on this game until they sort this shit out.  Either they don't give a shit about what we think or they are very out of touch with the state of the game.  Either way, it's unacceptable.  I want more balance and less ""press 2 to win.""  The /r/worldoftanks community has suggested a blackout on June 5th to try to get WG's attention.  I hope that it works, but I doubt it will do anything.  We are small potatoes compared to EU and Russia.

Aeon199,,,"&gt; This is because you'll be at a very different stage of life than them.

You're likely assuming I have my shit together, but I'll have to admit that I'm a stone-cold loser in my 30s..  too many years spent as a quasi shut-in and very poor life direction, and so on.  I'm ""coming into this late"" as a result of knowing the time to get women (for any arrangement, I don't really care about LTR, I'm a solitary-type anyhow) is running out quickly.  I have my reasons for sucking, beyond simple apathy/laziness, and those include mild autism and anxiety, etc.  One thing is (sadly) pretty certain...  I'm not going to have any of the value a woman expects of a man in his 30s.

&gt; The only area where age will hit you hard is online dating. With online dating girls have limited data about you. One thing they have is age, so they filter on it. I used to do well on tinder at 32, but now find it hard to get a match younger than 28. Most girls who are say 21 will have their filters so I don't even show up for them, so my days of super easy tinder lays are gone. This isn't an issue for cold approach though.

Yes, online dating, to me, is thoroughly demoralizing.  Simply finding any woman interested at all, if you're unexceptional in many ways, it's a brutal slog and lowers self-esteem when you realize it's not gonna happen.  I stopped using it.  OKCupid seemed like a playground for elitists.. women listing their 5 pages of credentials and their 2 master's degrees and 50 hobbies, and ""looking for men on my level"".. there were too many of these narcissistic profiles and I couldn't get replies from ""basic, average women"" either.

I tried ""unconventional options"" like putting ads on Craigslist, I tried many different ads and it does seem as if putting the age of ""30"" up there, it's like all they see.  I get replies from women *out of state* who assume that since I put up an age of 30+, I must have a good career and make good money.  They all cut-and-paste a long message that includes, ""I'm done fooling around and looking to find someone for the rest of my life"" and every last one of these women is a gold-digger, who considers me as a potential money-bag, based on listing the number 30.  It's disturbing as hell, and confirms my worst suspicions about women.

The other replies from women on CL (yes, some MEN reply too, it's creepy as hell) are mostly prostitutes and some other types I don't want to talk about, I prefer to be politically correct.  (It's not a ""low quality"" thing, I don't frame it that way, I'm just not interested in them.)  Once in a blue moon I find an interesting women who looks normal and all, I get their number but something always screws up, they stop replying or I lose interest, etc.

I follow what I deem important to my country and those that I follow regarding the EU. Mostly immigration taxation and policy which mandates a country to act or not to act against their wishes simply because they are a member of a free trade area.

The EU was founded as an economic zone which also prevented another German invasion of France. Somehow that means that all Europe and future members are forced into political union if they want to trade goods.and services or if they wish to seek emigration on a large scale.

scp1500,,,"[SCP-3037 prior to containment.](&lt;http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3037/Dubrovnik1.jpg&gt;)

**Item #:** SCP-3037

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3037 is to be kept in a standard Safe class storage locker at Site-19. When it is being transported, personnel are not to hold it in their hands; rather, it may be slid onto a wheeled cart and pushed to its destination.

SCP-3037-A instances created for testing are to be terminated at the
conclusion of each test. Additionally, no more than one instance of SCP-3037-A
is to exist at any given time. In the event that multiple instances are
created, all of them are to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-3037 is a miniature model of the walled city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. Its base is an irregular octagon that resembles a square measuring 9 centimeters on each edge, and it is composed of plaster and painted with acrylic.

Persons who hold SCP-3037^(**1**) are designated instances of SCP-3037-A. Instances of SCP-3037-A believe themselves to actually be the city of Dubrovnik, and speak exclusively in Serbo-Croatian. Amnestic treatment has thus far proven ineffective in reversing these effects.

SCP-3037-A instances have also exhibited anomalous physical changes corresponding to current events in the city of Dubrovnik. Any damage sustained by the city causes corresponding bodily harm to instances of SCP-3037-A, which cannot heal unless the city of Dubrovnik is also repaired. A notable example of this was observed in December of 1991^(**2**) (see Incident Log 3037-Alpha).

Testing has shown that this relationship is not reciprocal. Instances of
SCP-3037-A may be harmed without causing corresponding damage to the real city
of Dubrovnik.

Instances of SCP-3037-A believe themselves to be parents of SCP-3037 itself.
As such, they are reluctant to put it down or expose it to harm; if they are
forced to give up SCP-3037 or it appears to be damaged, they show reactions
consistent with those of parents whose children have been harmed.

Multiple concurrent instances of SCP-3037-A may exist at any given time, and appear willing to put down SCP-3037 only if they are handing it over to another instance. Even when these instances are aware of each other's existence, they do not show signs of distress. If, for example, there are ten SCP-3037-A instances in existence, they claim that there exist eleven copies^(**3**) of the city of Dubrovnik, all of which are parents of SCP-3037.

In the summer of 1988, Dr. V████████, a researcher at Site-19, began
exhibiting a streak of absenteeism. Investigation of his home by Foundation
agents found that he had been at home the entire time, and had been affected
by the object that was later designated SCP-3037.

Further investigation found that Dr. V████████ had never been to Dubrovnik,
and had bought SCP-3037 at a local art exhibition. The object was originally
wrapped and boxed, and he did not directly hold it until removing it from the
box in his home. The company organizing the art exhibition had no records of a
vendor selling art inspired by Yugoslavia or the Dalmatian Coast region.
Because payment for the object was made in cash, the identity of the artist is
unknown.

The exact nature of SCP-3037's anomalous properties was determined during
recovery, as a Foundation agent handled the object after bringing the first
SCP-3037-A instance (formerly Dr. V████████) into containment. This agent, in
turn, became an SCP-3037-A instance. Containment was established when both
SCP-3037-A instances were tranquilized and the object was handled with tongs
to be placed into its current Safe class storage locker.

&gt; **Interviewer:** Dr. C█████, a researcher at Site-19

&gt;

&gt; **Subject:** An instance of SCP-3037-A, formerly Dr. V████████. At the time
of the interview, there were six instances of SCP-3037-A.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** How are you feeling today?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** The same as usual. Rocky, ancient, humid, warm today.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** And SCP-3037?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** My daughter? She is doing well, but please be quiet, she is
sleeping.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** Of course. I would like to confirm some of your previous
statements. You are the ancient walled city of Dubrovnik, correct?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** Correct. One of seven Dubrovniks.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** Can you tell me how an entire city has arms and legs, or
fits inside this one room?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** That is simply what cities do. Cities have arms and legs, a
whole body. And they fit inside rooms. I am not sure what it is you are
asking.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** Could you please define ""city"" for me?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** A place where many people live, made of buildings, stone,
maybe wood. It has a body that can fit inside a room, and it is composed of
several neighborhoods. There are seven of the city of Dubrovnik.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** And how does an entire city have a daughter?

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** Doctor, I hope you will excuse my modesty. I do not want to
answer that question.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** I am a scientist, you will not disgust me.

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** Fine. A city… is made of marble, is it not?

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** Some cities are.

&gt;

&gt; **SCP-3037-A:** My daughter was, well, carved from my marble. It is quite
simple, really. She will make an excellent city herself one day.

&gt;

&gt; **Dr. C█████:** Thank you, I have no more questions for today.

&gt;

&gt; [END LOG 14/07/1988 11:18:14]

&gt;

&gt; **Note:** Chemical analysis of SCP-3037 consistently indicates that it is
not made of marble.

Beginning in October of 1991, the Yugoslav People's Army besieged the real
city of Dubrovnik. At the time, the Foundation had fifteen instances of
SCP-3037-A in custody. During the siege, each of these instances reported some
difficulty in eating, and minor lacerations manifested at times corresponding
to actual attacks on the city of Dubrovnik.

The bombardment of the Old Town of Dubrovnik reached its peak on 06/12/1991.
At almost exactly 06:00:00 Central European Time, during this bombardment, all
fifteen instances of SCP-3037-A exploded in succession, roughly one second
apart. The order in which they exploded was observed to correspond to the
order in which they were created.

The first instance of SCP-3037-A exploded with relatively little force, but
each successive explosion was increasingly powerful. The last instance
exploded with force equivalent to roughly one ton of TNT, breaching several
containment chambers at Site-19 and resulting in the loss of █ personnel.

It is hypothesized that instances of SCP-3037-A have an anomalous connection
not only with the real city of Dubrovnik, but also with each other. Therefore,
the second instance of SCP-3037-A was not only damaged by the shelling of
Dubrovnik, but also by the explosion of the first instance, and so on. In this
way, the explosive force of the first instance of SCP-3037-A was multiplied by
214 by the time the fifteenth instance exploded.

Due to this incident, it is now prohibited for more than one instance of
SCP-3037-A to exist at any given time.

 This is true, if the king in said country is the only source of power.

It's often referred to as capitalist during this period, thought admittedly not as fully capitalist a country as modern day US.

&gt; Still, not all Capitalist countries have turned their countries into murder holes like ALL Communist countries have

There's a lot wrong with this... but I'm not sure what you mean by murderhole exactly, since you admitted that capitalists DO commit atrocities.  
The Indigenous peoples of North America were murdered in the millions in order to clear the land to make way for farms and settlers;  free markets and capitalism. People living in Africa were raped, murdered, tortured, enslaved and kidnapped to the US and Europe consistently for hundreds of years in order to maintain capitalist economic production.  
That's not to excuse atrocities of communist countries, but those are two of the worst atrocities ever committed, both by people who would consider themselves capitalist (or similar).

Sometimes it was pure greed: they knew they were stealing land, and didn't care. See for example columbus' treatment of Caribbean natives, or the conquests of the Aztecs and Incas. They were also justified as aiming to convert savages to Christianity, but that was mostly a pretense.

In North America it was more complicated. For one, natives sometimes made the mistake of welcoming Europeans. Sometimes to access their goods, sometimes out of fear, and sometimes in hope of gaining a powerful ally. 

But, I read a book a long time ago that made some points that stuck with me. Natives of the eastern US tended to move around. Each time they moved, they'd burn the undergrowth of the forest, and leave it fallow. When they'd rotate back, the soil was fertile again.

Europeans arrive, and see the picturesque forest free of undergrowth, and not a soul to be seen. The european sense of ownership was that if you worked the land, it was yours. Which meant putting up fences and building permanent buildings. They'd do that, and then the natives would rotate back to that land, only to find Europeans basically squatting on their land. To the Europeans though, it wasn't the natives land, because they weren't working it, not from the european perspective. So, quite the culture clash.

May's items are in the luxury bracket because honestly the gorgeous packaging is incredibly expensive, the ingredients are sourced by an incredible woman with the most discerning eye I've ever met, and if it's not up to snuff, she won't get it or put it in the products. Also, since a huge amount of the ingredients can fluctuate in price due to bad weather, a poor season etc (rose powder was a huge culprit when I was there.) the ingredients can honestly be astronomical. Also May's recipes use many more of the pricey and super baller extracts (blue tansy for example) than a lot of competitors.

I used to hang around some skinheads in my youth in the 90s. I never shared their ideology but it didn't really matter since, at the time, they were mostly concerned with going hiking, drinking beer and bbq. It wasn't a reaction against the jews/muslims/blacks/enemy-du-jour that made them skinheads, it was a sense of belonging to something they felt they could take pride in like the cultural history of their people. This was especially important because, in their view, being interested in ""white culture"" like listening to Wagner was under attack by mainstream society.

They became ""radicalized"" when they were attacked from outside. Whenever the news did another ""PS the skinheads are still evil"" story, their prejudices about the rest of society were strengthened. ""Everyone's out to get us and you know whose behind *that*, right?"" etc.

Fast forward to today and white people, men especially and *christian* men in particular, are told that they should stfu about pretty much everything because their opinions are irrelevant by virtue of their skin color, gender and/or religion and that they are evil misogynist racists for thinking otherwise. The racial issue is more a thing in the US and the religious issue is more a European thing from what I understand. Already you have established an in-group/out-group dynamic and this is strengthened by constant ridicule from outside. ""You can't be racist towards whites"" or the idea that everything white people have or do that is also found in cultures of traditionally non-white people is appropriation and colonialism or something like that. But this is ridicule *from white people* with some sort of white savior syndrome, not from immigrants usually.

Because you're not asking ""what if your solution doesn't work,"" you're asking ""what if society as we know it collapses?""

This isn't a relevant question to ask in relation to single-payer healthcare since even a country that has a private healthcare system like the United States has a significant level of both governmental oversight and governmental subsidy of the market. If the government were to go bankrupt - leaving aside for a moment that the economy would collapse and immediately following it public order and then quite likely civilization itself - healthcare would become very difficult to obtain due to a sudden lack of government funding to hospitals.

Here is what your source has to say:

&gt; The foreignness of this way of drinking tea was apparent, because the tone in which both Yuan and Yu wrote their observations indicated they were observing something they had never seen before and thus they described it in detail in a way only outsiders would; in both cases there was a revelation that this way of brewing tea yielded a vastly different experience than their normal usage of tea. This impression of the uniqueness of gongfucha as a way to drink tea persisted into the twentieth century.

Gongfu was already an established tradition by the time the British were looking to produce tea in their colonies. But it really was an obscure tradition even to most Chinese people. There's little chance of a westerner stumbling on it, understanding what the fuss was about, and then going back to Europe to popularize it. Even Chinese people in China didn't do that. For that to take place, gongfu had to be reinvented into a more accessible and artful form in Taiwan first.

&gt; Even if you ignore gongfu, there is a difference between other tea brewing methods in China (for example, ""grandpa style"") and western-style brewing. This had to develop at some point.

The first consequence is that the contract is given to the company that'll give the bribe, not the one that will do the best job, for this the contract giving is rigged. Then to pay the bribe the cost of the work is inflated. In some cases, the contract is given to companies that can't fulfill it to specifications. 

Another consequence is that it gives an incentive for the politicians to use the same companies always, since less people in the know, the less chances there'll be a leak. So it helps one company (not the best one) to get really big, to the point it can stifle smaller ones. With less competition, it can inflate costs and becomes inefficient very fast.

I know it's not applicable to you as you have had the surgery but I have notice a number of comments from people about to have the surgery. Papillon contact radiotherapy is a type of treatment that can save a great deal of patients from ever needing a colostomy. I won't go into a huge ammount of detail about the treatment as I can't comment on individual cases but it is currently performed in 15 centres around the world (all of which I think are in Europe, but many take referrals from outside their country). It is a treatment that is only available for rectal tumours and even still it is not suitable for everyone dependant on tumour size however it can be given in conjuction with external beam radiation and TEMS surgery. The treatment also does not rule out a colostomy surgery which means if the treatment is given and does not work as well as predicted a colostomy surgery can still be performed. I'm sorry if people feel this is the incorrect place for the information I just wanted to put it out there so people in simular situations to yourself have all the information available.

ArchangBelle,,Reformist Libertarian Socialist | Open Society,"The Labour manifesto is fully-costed, and according to the Guardian:

&gt; ""Labour has pledged not to raise the tax burden of those on low and middle incomes. The standard income tax rate will remain unchanged as will VAT. That means someone on the average wage of £26,500 will pay the same. Labour plans to apply the 45p rate to the 500,000 who earn between £80,000 and £100,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this group would pay on average £400 more a year. The 300,000 earning between £100,000 and £123,000 would lose up to £2,725 while the 50,000 earning over £500,000 would all lose at least £22,900 a year."" ^[\[1\]](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/labour-manifesto-analysis-key-points-pledges)

---

Only Labor has pledged to ""eliminate the government’s deficit on day-to-day spending within five years"" ^[\[2\]](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/may/19/who-should-i-vote-for-the-uk-election-manifestos-compared). The Conservatives, who promised without reservation that the deadline to set the financed straight would be 2015, have now revised that to 2025, a full ten years after the original promise. By ditching Osborne’s pledge not to increase NI or income tax, the 2017 manifesto gives the party wriggle room to raise taxes, but they lack the strength of conviction to admit it.

---

On health, Labor has pledged 30 billion pounds to the NHS over the next Parliament, whereas the Conservatives have promised only eight billion. It's a tiny sum compared to Labour's, and pundits doubt that it will be able to match increasing demand.

---

On immigration: the Conservatives promise this election to immigration to “sustainable” levels, meaning annual net migration in the tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands. This is from the party which promised to reduce immigration to only 100,000, then allowed over 300,000 immigrants in. Continuation of the net migration pledge for a further five years, despite never being met in the past seven years, constitutes a divisive and deceitful vow from May’s cabinet.

Labour plans to demand large corporations to ""pay a little more"" in tax while still keeping UK corporation tax among the lowest of major developed economies, which eminent economists have supported. The IFS said lowering the threshold for the 45p rate would raise seven billion pounds. Meanwhile, the pro-business Conservatives to plan to cut corporation tax to 17% by 2020 (bringing it far, far below the levels of any comparable developed European economy). They criticise Labour for planning to 'drive companies offshore' with their increased corporation tax (a rise from 21% to 26%), yet they were the same party who fumbled the Brexit campaign and want a ""no-deal"" (which would mean that the UK would be isolated, as trading would be virtually impossible with other European countries).",True,0,1496305917,,False,0,dib5i5c,t3_6eigrs,t1_dib44z7,1498970582,4,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

Streetwind,,,"City buses are possibly the most favorable application for electric drive that there is.

* Low-speed, high-torque is the prime operating regime for a direct transmission electric motor, and constant start/stop maximizes the gains from a regenerative braking system. By contrast, a combustion engine wants constant revs and few gear changes in order to be efficient, but city driving requires the opposite.
* Diesel engine emission cleaning devices, such as catalytic converters, really don't like the engine turning off and on repeatedly, so buses end up idling most most the time even when they're not moving; and electric motor doesn't have this problem.
* Bus engines and brakes are noisy and annoying, especially when driving through residential zones while people are trying to sleep or relax in the garden. Electric motors are much quieter, even while delivering higher acceleration, and regeneration means less brake action.
* Bus diesels stink. Way worse than car diesels. Electric motors don't stink.
* Related: large diesels like buses and trucks actually contribute the vast majority of secondary emissions like particles and NOX. The media made a big deal about the VW diesel scandal, but diesel cars contribute less than 20% to the air quality problem. More than 80% of this harmful stuff is all large diesels. Some European cities are considering banning diesel cars during summer days when air quality measurements are over the regulation limits, but other groups have put forward that simply replacing public transit diesels with electric vehicles drops secondary emissions so much that cities won't exceed the regulation limits in the first place.

I would say that the advantages are so numerous that even if an electric bus saves nothing whatsoever compared to a diesel bus, or is slightly more expensive even, it's a no-brainer.

As far as the question goes about whether or not there are studies about the economic aspect... well, I typed ""cost benefit analysis electric bus"" into Google and got 45 million hits =P

Among the first was [this paper from 2014](http://www1.udel.edu/V2G/resources/V2G-Cost-Benefit-Analysis-Noel-McCormack-Applied-Energy-As-Accepted.pdf) which runs the math in great detail for a 24-seater electric school bus with monetized vehicle-to-grid capabilities compared to a 32-seater diesel school bus. They present results both with and without external health costs of emissions, and also both with and without factoring in V2G revenues. It comes to the conclusion that the electric bus without externalities and V2G can match the lifetime expenses of the diesel bus almost exactly, while when factoring in both of these things, it would save as much as US $6000 per seat annually and recoup its higher upfront costs in a third of its projected lifetime.

It doesnt really matter... you still get (almost) no taxes and manpower due to negative modifiers.
I mass develop almost every state province to at least 25-30 development. Most of them have to be high value trade good provinces.
Your highly developed state provinces also have to be as far away from europe (your home node) as possible to benefit from that multiple merchant/trade steering bonus.

&gt; and absolutely no problems at all with the wrong religion/culture.

Same for making them states as you want to convert it anyway for the huge amount of papal authotity (mercantilism) and culture convert before developing when its super cheap


&gt; You still benefit from their production and trade.

A state province given to burghers will produce even more goods because of the +10% ""local goods produced"" modifier.
This is MUCH!!! better than the extra +50% local provincial trade power you get from trade companies.
And even with the +25% estate autonomy you'll still get more manpower and taxes

&gt; You generally do not make much money from states that far overseas anyway because of state maintenance.

lol... I get 3-10 ducats/month per province in taxes and production alone even without considering all the trade money.
State maintenance is pretty much nothing compared to this especially if you buy the proper buildings...

&gt; get that juicy free merchant from them.

I still get enough merchants to steer all the trade from asia and south/central america to my home node.
Dont need a merchant from every single trade company region.



I also give some provinces to trade companies. I just have most of my states in east africa/asia.

&gt;It's mainly a constructed theory with little evidence to support. As you mentioned, there is little indication that Asian men that have spent more time in the US (or those that are born here) display more toxic behaviours such as sexual and physical violence. Supposedly in response to frustration with emasculation.

&gt;It's ofcourse not well defined, some people go the other way and bring up ""asian cultures"" which is problematic to begin with considering that Asia as a continent represents a huge multitude of cultures that encompass 70% of the world's population, not to mention plenty of which have cultures that are no different than ""european"" or ""western ones"" due to colonialism. If we're looking at the Asian cultures that are most commonly referred to, such as East Asian cultures, Chinese, Japanese, Korean there are plenty of metrics that refute the premise that Asian cultures are in anyway obviously less progressive or more misogynist than Western or American culture.

&gt;The most obvious and measurable display of toxic masculinity is violence, gendered or otherwise. And Asian men that are both culturally Asian or culturally American, are the least likely to commit such acts. Asian men and Asian masculinity is not perfect, and nobody is suggesting that they are perfectly egalitarian and lacking misogyny. However if one decides to define masculinities in terms of racial affiliations, then Asian masculinity is currently the best form of masculinity with regards to the safety of women that others should emulate.

[deleted],,,"Allez c'est cadeau, mais je précise que je suis pas très d'accord avec cet article :P

Depuis l’élection d’Emmanuel Macron à la présidence de la République, les médias se pâment d’admiration devant la « nouveauté » de son programme. En dépassant le clivage entre droite et gauche, il apporterait la solution aux éternels blocages de la société française. La République en marche serait porteuse d’une révolution démocratique apte à libérer toute l’énergie des forces progressistes, jusqu’ici bridées par les partis traditionnels.

Il est tout de même assez paradoxal de présenter comme remède à la profonde crise de représentation qui affecte les démocraties occidentales précisément le type de politique qui est à l’origine même de cette crise. Car celle-ci résulte de l’adoption, dans la plupart des pays européens, de la stratégie de la troisième voie théorisée en Grande-Bretagne par le sociologue Anthony Giddens et pratiquée par le New Labour de Tony Blair.

Déclarant obsolète le clivage droite/gauche, cette stratégie prônait une nouvelle forme de gouvernance nommée « centrisme radical ». Selon Tony Blair, « nous étions tous de classe moyenne », les anciens antagonismes avaient disparu et le modèle antagoniste de la politique était devenu caduc. Il n’y avait plus une politique économique de droite et une de gauche, mais seulement une « bonne politique » et une « mauvaise politique ». Cette perspective « post-politique » se fondait sur le fameux TINA (There Is No Alternative) de Margaret Thatcher, la conviction qu’il n’y avait pas d’alternative à la mondialisation néolibérale.

**L’avènement du centre gauche**

Après avoir été saluée en Allemagne par Gerhard Schröder et sa Neue Mitte (nouveau centre), la troisième voie de Blair a été progressivement adoptée par la plupart des partis socialistes et sociaux-démocrates, qui se définissent désormais comme de centre gauche. C’est ainsi qu’a été établi en Europe le consensus au centre qui, en effaçant la frontière entre la droite et la gauche, a privé les citoyens de la possibilité d’avoir le choix, lors des élections, entre des projets différents.

Cette absence d’alternative est à l’origine de beaucoup des problèmes auxquels nous sommes aujourd’hui confrontés : le discrédit des institutions démocratiques, la montée de l’abstention, ainsi que le succès croissant des partis populistes de droite. Ceux-ci, en prétendant qu’ils allaient rendre au peuple le pouvoir qui lui avait été confisqué par les élites, ont réussi à s’implanter durablement dans de nombreux pays. En ce qui concerne la social-démocratie, cette dérive vers le centre gauche lui a été fatale et elle est entrée en crise presque partout en Europe.

Or, comme nous le savons depuis Machiavel, il existe dans la société des intérêts et des positions irréconciliables, et il ne suffit pas de nier ces antagonismes pour les faire disparaître. L’objectif d’une démocratie pluraliste n’est pas d’arriver au consensus, mais de permettre au dissensus de s’exprimer grâce à des institutions qui le mettent en scène d’une façon « agonistique ».

**Donner forme à la division de la société**

Dans la lutte agonistique, les opposants ne se traitent pas en ennemis mais en adversaires. Ils savent qu’il y a des questions sur lesquelles ils ne vont pas pouvoir se mettre d’accord, mais ils respectent leurs droits respectifs à se battre pour faire gagner leur camp. Dans cette perspective, le rôle des institutions démocratiques consiste à fournir le cadre pour « s’opposer sans se massacrer », comme le soulignait l’anthropologue Marcel Mauss.
L’opposition entre la droite et la gauche, quel que soit le contenu qu’on lui attribue, est dans la tradition républicaine la façon de donner forme à la division de la société. La démocratie pluraliste est le lieu d’une tension entre les idéaux d’égalité et de liberté, tension qui doit être constamment renégociée dans la confrontation agonistique entre la droite et la gauche. C’est à travers elle que peut s’exprimer la souveraineté populaire, qui est un des piliers de l’idéal démocratique. C’est là que se trouve l’enjeu d’une politique démocratique authentique.


Si l’on peut affirmer que nous vivons maintenant dans des sociétés « post-démocratiques », c’est parce qu’avec le triomphe de l’hégémonie néolibérale, la souveraineté populaire a été privée de son champ d’exercice. Le consensus post-politique ne laisse place qu’à l’alternance au pouvoir entre le centre droit et le centre gauche, tous deux servant les diktats du néolibéralisme. Tous les partis qui n’acceptent pas ce scénario sont renvoyés aux « extrêmes » et accusés de mettre la démocratie en danger.

**Disparition de la contestation**

Emmanuel Macron pousse cette logique encore plus loin et sa supposée « nouveauté » consiste tout simplement à évacuer le semblant de contestation qui existait encore avec le bipartisme. Dorénavant, c’est la possibilité même de contestation qui est récusée avec la disparition de la distinction entre la droite et la gauche. C’est vraiment le stade suprême de la post-politique.

Mais comme il n’y a pas de politique sans frontière entre un « nous » et un « eux », il est amené à en construire une autre entre « progressistes » et « conservateurs ». Une telle frontière n’institue pas un rapport d’ordre politique entre adversaires. Faisant l’impasse sur les configurations de pouvoir, elle sert seulement à disqualifier les différentes formes d’opposition en les assimilant sous un même vocable, celui de « conservateurs ». Emmanuel Macron s’autorise ainsi à dédaigner en tant que « conservateurs » le grand nombre de Français qui sont opposés à sa politique et à ignorer les revendications de la « France d’en bas ».

Qu’une telle politique conduise inévitablement à la révolte des catégories populaires ne semble pas l’inquiéter. Un tel aveuglement est proprement hallucinant, car ce recyclage de la troisième voie, au lieu d’endiguer le Front national, comme il se l’imagine, peut conduire à son renforcement et même à sa victoire en 2022. Heureusement, le très bon score de Jean-Luc Mélenchon à l’élection présidentielle et l’enthousiasme populaire autour de La France insoumise nous montrent qu’une autre issue est possible, celle d’une révolution citoyenne.",False,0,1496313323,,False,0,dib83i3,t3_6eln26,t1_dib78vi,1498971841,23,False,france,t5_2qhjz,

HelloImDrunkish,ZuidHolland,Zuid Holland,"Bij veel van de argumenten komt het er op neer dat de EU gewoon een duur handelsakkoord is.

&gt;denk je dat we beter af zijn zonder gelijkgestemde voedselveiligheidsnormen

Wij hebben al voedselveiligheidsnormen. Ook zonder de EU. 

Het is naïef om te denken dat wij als Koninkrijk der Nederlanden te klein zouden zijn om veel impact te hebben. Dat wij dit niet zouden kunnen zonder de EU. Australië heeft maar een 25% grotere bevolking en dat word bijna gezien al continent. Naast dat hebben wij Nederlanders veel van de wereld veroverd in de geschiedenis. 

&gt;denk je dat boeren zitten te wachten op versplintering van regels?

Ik zou het de boeren zelf vragen. De EU regels zijn ideaal voor grote bedrijven. Maar ik denk dat de wat kleinere boeren/tuinders niet blij zijn dat zij geen kromme komkommers mogen verkopen vanwege de EU.

&gt;denk je dat een handelsakkoord met de VS een eerlijke deal wordt als het VS-NL is? 

Je vraagt aan een handels land of het een eerlijke deal word. Ik denk inderdaad dat de VS goed genaaid zal worden. Hoe graag willen jullie Maaslander of Heineken? Ik heb zelfs donuts in de VS gezien die van de Hollandse bakker kwamen.

GVR64,,,"This was circa 2001. So the average age of the respondents may go up by a decade and a half and all this may be basically irrelevant. Still, I persist. I was already a Ph D - Extremal Combinatorics,  Hungarian school and all that jazz. After a 3 year postdoc stint got into an interdisciplinary startup as faculty. I was still doing Combinatorial Number Theory (Nullstellensatz type of work), Coding Theory (Space time codes among) / Cryptograpy (Stream Ciphers) when I chanced upon some a popular article explaining Turk and Pentland's result. It was more like WTF moment than a flash of inspiration. Coding and Crypto seemed not applied enough for me at that point.  I also love algebraic proofs and knew about SVD. But being more of a pure mathematician, I was not aware of Turk, Pentland, Kanade and the whole bevvy of engineering applications. Or Mumford, Gelman(s) and the Brown School of Pattern Recognition. So got into the field of what then went under the title of Statistical Pattern Recognition,  by supervising a couple of MS theses on the subject. During the third year of my foray, I wrote a proposal for a 5 Crore grant (Fifty million Rs? It was roughly 44 or 45 Rs to a dollar then. Go compute) which was promptly plagiarized by another agency which took home that loot. They have still not delivered anything yet. I already had good results on FRGC and other datasets during this time with my students. I felt let down, and quit about a couple or so years down the lane and started my own company in 2006. The aim was to create a Face Verification product for attendance  with one of my MS students. He promptly ditched me (supposedly family pressure) about 6 months later. I also ran into 2008 with no cash and turned into a Statistical Pattern Recognition mercenary doing for a price ($25 to $50 per hour depending on the complexity and sometimes fixed cost ones) all sorts of nonsense like segmenting wedding clothes, finding defects in engine nozzles, finding tables and entities in Edgars filings, defects in packages, machine translation for European language pairs using Moses, finding and matching resumes, small vocabulary speech recognition, algorithmic trading algorithms and event triggers,  OCR of HCFA forms, near duplicate detection algorithms, sentiment analysis, detecting intent, detecting deception in witness statements,  topic modeling, document classification, ontological matching, measuring objects, measuring foot and shoe size, lead scoring and classification.  Most of the time, I would have to formulate the problem and the project for the client and also make it as inexpensive as possible. Think 11 years of learning ML doing these projects a few ( 2 to 4 on an average) per year. This does not include the amount of due diligence I had to do for projects  that my clients finally dropped or could not afford to proceed.  That answers how I got into and what I did. Now qualifications. I am a Masters in Mathematics - Trinity College, Cambridge (92-93) and a Ph D (IISc, 1997). But mostly all the maths I needed, I learnt during my B Sc which was done through correspondence course in a small university in South India.  That is still my main qualification. The other experiences gave me more  mathematical maturity. That is all you need. How difficult was it? This Statistical Pattern Recognition thingee has become more popularly known as ML and now DL. I wish I can convey a Mathematician's excitement while reading Mumford's book with Agnes (draft was only what I could get hold of in the beginning. Or Charniak's tiny little masterpiece which I borrowed from my Physicist colleague. Or the excitement of making LDA, Bayesian and logit, all work on data **and** getting paid for it. Initially piffling amounts, but in the long run, I have paid about 128 months of salaries on time - the last day of the month. Something I am immensely proud of.  During the early part of development, Weka could hardly handle more than 10K instances - mostly because RAM prices were too high and we could not afford pricier machines. I had to write projects and chase grants to get PCs that could handle data. OpenCV, I discovered more or less during 2006. For one Vision project, I had to work with Halcon software and also budget for it, for god's sake. If I had this project now, I would do it in about a couple of days flat or even less using Python + OpenCV.  As you can see, it was and is still exciting. But people were difficult. Sort of. Sometimes. People who worked under me, for me, with me. People being people and attrition being what it is in the Software industry. No, I did not have to jump into NIPS headquarters and find neatly balanced data and throw gradient bombs at it. Nips is about trends and fashion. We are all in the golden period of ML. The upside is the sheer infectious enthusiasm of the kids and the typical superficiality of most of the directions. It is more like HAVE GPU, WILL COMPUTE. If you compute with '42' backwards for sufficiently many epochs, in Tensorflow (or PyTorch) and watch the progress in Tensorboard, you may even be able to reverse engineer that 'question-that-cannot-be-formulated'. There is only so many ways to do this. Like 2 x 3 x 7 or 6 x 7. I dont know if Quantum computers has progressed to factorizing more than 15. We are still waiting with bated breath. I digress. Yes. The future is bright - the next two, three years or so at least.  Or you can watch how the Big Data / Hadoop era is unfolding to guess DL's future. You wont find it difficult to find an internship or a job. As an employer, I find it difficult to get good people in my geography. With some push and git tutorials in TF, you will go places. You should do a startup if you are ambitious. Definitely. The time is ripe. Especially if you are sub 30. Post 40 you will be declared brain dead by VCs and other angels.

11. Cooperate in the fight against crime and terrorism

That's because the EU told you that you couldn't use security as a bargaining chip or they'd veto you. So that's not a ""plan"" as much as a forced point to enlarge your plan to make it seem more impressive. 

12. Deliver a smooth, orderly exit from the EU

Get to fuck. You couldn't plan your way out of a shoebox, nevermind the EU. Proof of this is that a year later you've still got like ZERO risk-assessments? You're STILL being told by EU leaders that you're full of shit and should return to reality and with people like Boris and Fox at the helm and your soundbites... 

*""With a strong hand in the Brexit negotiations, Theresa May can guarantee Britain’s economic security and future prosperity for you and your family.""*

**YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE omfg!** How can you say something as dumb as that? How the fuck can you guarantee something you need to negotiate about, from a weak position and a position of lies and soundbytes? Also, if you CAN guarantee it, surely you know what we're getting then? But you haven't told us. Because you don't know.

*""A vote for any other party risks Jeremy Corbyn running the Brexit negotiations and putting jobs, living standards and our economic security at risk.""*

Unlike you JC has actual experience in brokering complex things, like peace in NI. He's also able to ACTUALLY TALK with voters, unlike your staged fakery consisting of soundbytes and evasion of direct answers.

Be careful not to get stoned by someone reading this.

&gt;As for migrant outcomes, those are generally quite positive, actually. In fact, migrants outperform natives of the same poverty level with some consistency.

Of course because to end up poor from a better starting position together with the general lower ability of people who remain in one place means that you were likely not a well performing members of the native populations in the first place. Dumb americans are more stupid than smart Mexicans, noone is quibbling with that.  You can control for this by comparing different migrant groups. Eg East Europeans vs Turks in westrn europe. East Europeans not only outperform turks but perform on a similar level to the native populations. Turks nothing of the sort on average.

&gt;Now, you might argue this is selection bias, but if you look at second generation migrants (which should have reverted to the mean somewhat), they still do well.

But not necessarily as well as migrants from other countries of origin.

&gt;I think the argument from ""look at how badly immigrants do"" is hampered by the fact that immigrants just don't do that badly.

SaveJunyo,,,"A ce sujet, je n'ai que quelques pistes qui me viennent de mon expérience personnelle : 

* Je place le curseur à partir des attentats du 11 septembre. Les années 2001-2006 ont été très compliquées à vivre pour les musulmans installés en Europe, qui se prenaient dans la gueule des flots de merde issus des responsables politiques, des médias et de société en général pour un truc avec lequel ils n'avaient rien à voir. Ça a participé à un repli communautaire fort : tout à coup, les Français de confession musulmane (pour parler de nous) se sont rendu compte qu'ils n'étaient pas Français aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes : ils étaient redevenus musulmans, ils étaient redevenus arabes. Donc, le premier réflexe a été de se réfugier dans le communautarisme ; soit par peur, soit par dépit, soit par défiance. 

* Internet a beaucoup joué dans la transmission. Il y a des communautés qui se sont créées sur Internet, et comme souvent, ceux qui y prennent la parole sont les plus rigoristes. Du coup, y a ce que j'appelle (parce que je n'ai pas d'autres mots) un Islam internétisé qui a débarqué depuis quelque temps : des mecs se sont mis à prêcher de manière très rigoriste, mais en utilisant les codes de Youtube par exemple (ce qui a participé à la popularité de leurs propos), des pages Facebook se sont créées, etc. Certains mots/expressions sont limite devenus des mèmes, ont été popularisé chez les plus jeunes, etc. Désolé, je bâcle un peu car je suis pressé. 

* Le marasme identitaire dans lequel sont plongé, encore aujourd'hui, les personnes issues de l'immigration nord-africaine et de la tradition musulmane. En 2017, si tu as des gosses de 8 ans qui brandissent le drapeau d'un pays dans lequel ils n'ont jamais foutu les pieds, dont ils ne connaissent ni l'histoire, ni la langue, alors que leurs propres parents sont nés en France : c'est qu'il y a un souci. Souci qui ne peut pas être toujours imputables à ces populations : je ne reviendrais pas sur les problèmes de ségrégation géographique, de chômage, de difficultés d'accès à la culture, d'impression d'être marginalisés, etc. 

Je viens d'une famille algérienne, traditionnellement musulmane. Quand j'étais gamin, il n'y avait que les vieux qui priaient ; le Ramadan se pratiquait à l'Américaine comme on disait à l'époque (il était fait de manière aléatoire, surtout par les jeunes) ; seules les femmes âgées portaient le voile ; personne ne mangeait vraiment hallal. Tout a changé après le 11 septembre et l'invasion américaine en Irak. 

Je connais beaucoup de gens qui se sont tournés vers une pratique plus forte de l'Islam lorsqu'ils se sont rendu compte que quoiqu'ils fassent, qu'importe qu'ils soient bardés de diplômes, qu'importe qu'ils aient un statut social important, qu'importe qu'ils embrassent les valeurs de la France comme on dit et qu'ils se comportent comme des citoyens investis et responsables : ils ne seront jamais assez Français. Toujours trop arabes, toujours trop musulmans. Résultat des courses : l'apparition récente d'une pratique plus forte, encouragée par les pays de la péninsule arabique, éloignée de la pratique de leurs parents/grands-parents berbères ou africains.

diversity_is_racism,,Realist Conservative,"&gt; Do the US constitution right to life would entitle people whose lives are threatened by a disease (e.g. cancer) to free health care?

The Constitution is designed to preserve *natural* rights, or those under which humans live in nature, *from* government which the Founding Fathers saw as a necessary evil that like most N.E.s should be reduced as much as possible. The Constitution does not grant rights; it defends them.

The ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" thus means you cannot be impeded in these things, *but also* that government should not be funding you in them or trying to enforce them against other people. In other words, the Constitution stops government from denying you these things without just cause, but does not in itself write a prescription for them on the dime of the taxpayer.

Obviously America has misinterpreted this and reversed position, but that is not the news.

People make a big show of talking about how much they believe in evolution, but an honest Darwinist would respond that the best way to handle people whose lives are threatened by disease is to let them die. That way, future generations are not susceptible to that disease. Think about how the black plague wiped out a quarter of Europe and yet, now, many European-descended people are immune to contracting HIV, for example.

What does not kill us, makes us stronger. What kills some of us leaves a group less likely to get killed the same way.

No, because the biomass that they are generating will eventually release carbon back when it rots. They are anyway operating  in trivial quantities compared to the truly heroic scale of CO2 injection in commercial horticulture in the rest of Europe.

If you want to purge atmospheric CO2, there are two serious routes. One is to grow biomass, reduce that to char and bury it. As it is both stable in soil and active in ion exchange you can use it as a soil conditioner, up to a certain point. But how do you get paid for this? 

The second mechanism is to accelerate geochemical ageing. The erosion fo the Himalayas removed huge amounts of CO2 as carbonate, depositing it under Bangladesh and offshore. Crushing basic basalts - such as the Indian Deccan traps - will have the same consequences. You can make rice paddy with the powder whilst it fixes carbon. I suggested a scheme that would sell carbon credits, whereby Indian peasants would learn to construct wind-powered stamp mills from local materials, thus getting and income and new paddy. 

In truth, though, even though humans have now moved about one and a half times the mass of the Himalayas in construction materials, the likelihood of either route having significant impact is negligible.

&gt;It is like 1 month me and other players playing on EU have this issue when playing on the AMS1 server (code given by the network graph), experiencing HEAVY rubberbanding and fluctuating RTT while our ping remains low and stable. I posted my Looking Glass several times and every time it got removed without explanations, I tried open a ticked too and it got deleted.

&gt;

&gt;Every time I queue, there is basically a RNG chance that my game will be unplayable because I end up on this server.

&gt;

&gt;I would like to know at least if it is a server's problem or my ISP's problem, and considering that in my country (Italy) ISPs don't care about our customers (they never check out issues, they always say that it is all right) maybe if there is a solution for this I am not aware of.

c3o,EURO,EU,"The copyright reform, including the extra copyright for news sites and the censorship filter obligation for internet platforms, was officially proposed by the Commission last September already. It's not some vague idea, it's a legal text that they plan to make law.

Now the Parliament is in the process of developing its response. It is the MEPs' job to take part in that process and represent the interests of their voters in it. So she's right to sound the alarm when even worse proposals are made (again: not just ideas, but actual legal text proposed by the largest Parliamentary group) and when that process is being undermined.

The real work on a new law happens long before the final vote is cast and before the media starts paying attention. The Parliament takes almost a year to find a position, and that's before negotiations with the Commission and Council even start.

pi_over_3,,,"Your exaggerated definition is artificially narrow.

&gt;Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and control of industry and commerce, that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.

These extreme social justice groups fit this definition to a T. 

I would argue that their extreme identity based ideology **is** a from of nationalism.

&gt;One common definition of the term focuses on three concepts: the fascist negations (anti-liberalism, anti-communism and anti-conservatism);

We can all agree that they meet this requirement.

&gt;nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; 

Replace ""nationalist"" with ""identity-based"" (which I argue is a form of nationalism) and this would fit them perfectly.

&gt;and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership.

Again, describes them perfectly, especially the ""promotion"" of their gender based views.


&gt; According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamenterism

Again, attacking rival, existing political groups with authoritarianism is what they do.


TL;DR: Contemporary extreme social justice groups are indeed fascist, they are just placing political supremacy for different identity groups than early 20th century fascist groups.

Raffaele1617,,"EN native, IT advanced","&gt;Standard Italian has the sound ""gli"" and who doesn't pronounce it correctly is just not making the correct sound. 

No. It's not standard, but it's also not wrong. There is no such thing as a ""wrong"" native accent in any language. 

&gt;This is directly connected with the dialect/language spoken in the person environment (region/family if out of Italy)

As I said, the origin of the pronunciation is not relevant. Languages influence each other phonologically all the time. Standard Italian is spoken natively now in the south of Italy. The reason why they use a different sound for ""gli"" HISTORICALLY was because of people learning Italian who were not native speakers. Now they are nearly all native speakers of Italian, and the difference in pronunciation remains. Therefore, it is impossible for it to be incorrect because it is a native realization.

&gt;The way the English pronunciation differs depends on the localization (where English is spoken) and not because of the influence of the local language/dialect. In Europe, excluding Scotland and Welsh, the same word is often ""spoken"" differently if you are in Dublin, Brighton, Sheffield or London not because of the presence of another language in the surrounding territory.

The entirety of Britain was once Celtic speaking, and the different Celtic languages have to some degree influenced the accents of English speakers in thise regions. However, even if this wasn't the case, it wouldn't matter. If the new sound enters a language through influence from another language or if it just pops up on its own, the result is the same. Once native speakers use it, it's correct.

&gt;And not because it is accepted.

Accepted by who? Acceptance is not what determines correctness, native speech is. 

&gt;The sound ""gli"" can be corrected perfectly if desired.

It can be changed, but not corrected, because both realizations are correct.

&gt;Maybe in some years, with the natural language evolution, it will become the standard sound, but right now it is not. It just indicates the birth-origin of the speaker.

The language has already evolved in that it is already part of the speech of many native speakers. It does not have to become standard for it to be correct.",True,0,1496319135,,False,0,dibaucy,t3_6eae2b,t1_dibae1p,1498973173,1,False,italianlearning,t5_2tuxf,

PortugalBot,,,"&gt; r/portugal *-* Reestruturar dívida afeta confiança dos credores. Mário Centeno procura alternativas ([1 comentário](https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/6elgxs/))

## A reestruturação da dívida ""é um processo difícil"", porque implica a perda de confiança por parte dos credores, diz o ministro das Finanças. Há alternativas, como os reembolsos antecipados ao FMI.

A reestruturação da dívida pública é uma medida que está fora da mesa para o Governo, pelo efeito que tem sobre a confiança dos credores. **Mário Centeno** é claro em dizer que rejeita esse caminho, mas abre a porta a alternativas e a uma discussão a nível europeu.

“**A reestruturação é um processo difícil porque se perde a confiança dos credores. Rejeitamos esse caminho; mas é muito bom estudar diferentes alternativas**. Há soluções já aplicadas, como o reembolso antecipado do empréstimo do Fundo Monetário Internacional. A discussão mais profunda tem de acontecer num contexto europeu”, diz o ministro das Finanças sobre este assunto, em entrevista ao jornal espanhol [*El País*](http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2017/05/31/actualidad/1496242988_877556.html), publicada esta quinta-feira.

Esta já tem sido a posição assumida pelo Governo desde que foi apresentado o [relatório](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B77N63RvoqKFWmlZd3FxNGtVNHc/view) do grupo de trabalho criado para estudar a dívida pública portuguesa, composto por economistas do Partido Socialista e do Bloco de Esquerda. [Entre outras medidas](https://eco.pt/2017/04/28/as-propostas-para-a-reestruturacao-da-divida-uma-a-uma/), **o grupo propõe estender, de 15 para 45 anos, os prazos de pagamento da dívida a organismos europeus, além de reduzir a taxa de juro para 1%**, o que representa uma quebra de 1,4 pontos percentuais face ao que é cobrado atualmente.

As propostas para a reestruturação da dívida. Uma a uma

Quando o relatório foi apresentado, o Governo disse que vai tomar “boa nota” das conclusões do grupo, mas assegurou que [“não se vincula”](https://eco.pt/2017/04/28/relatorio-da-divida-governo-nao-se-vincula/) a estas conclusões.

""A reestruturação é um processo difícil porque se perde a confiança dos credores. Rejeitamos esse caminho; mas é muito bom estudar diferentes alternativas. Há soluções já aplicadas, como o reembolso antecipado do empréstimo do Fundo Monetário Internacional. ”

Ministro das Finanças

Ainda sobre o elevado nível de endividamento do país, Mário Centeno reconhece ao *El País* que **“é muito importante” reduzir a dívida**, “não só para devermos menos, mas porque a redução da dívida implica sempre crescimento económico”.

O ministro das Finanças volta, assim, a apresentar o objetivo do Governo para a próxima década: “no contexto atual, a dívida é sustentável; ainda assim, prevemos baixá-la em três pontos por ano, durante os próximos dez anos, [até reduzi-la para 100% do PIB](https://eco.pt/2017/05/25/centeno-quer-racio-da-divida-nos-100-do-pib-em-dez-anos/)“.

Na entrevista ao *El País*, o ministro das Finanças falou ainda sobre a situação do setor financeiro, onde, garante, **foram resolvidos seis dos sete grandes problemas identificados pelo Governo.**

“O Banif foi comprado pelo Santander; o BCP foi capitalizado; o BPI foi comprado, felizmente, pelo La Caixa; o maior banco do país, a Caixa Geral de Depósitos, capitalizou-se com capital público; o Novo Banco foi vendido a um fundo norte-americano; e o o Fundo de Resolução, que tem uma dívida muito elevada desde a resolução do Banco Espírito Santo, tem um empréstimo do Estado para pagar em 30 anos”.

""Temos capital espanhol chinês, angolano e norte-americano a investir na banca portuguesa. Isso é único na Europa.”

Ministro das Finanças

“No final, temos capital espanhol chinês, angolano e norte-americano a investir na banca portuguesa. Isso é único na Europa”, garante Centeno.

E o sétimo problema? **O crédito malparado**. “A solução não passa apenas pela banca mas, também, pela recuperação de empresas. Em Portugal, não tivemos uma bolha imobiliária nem de crédito hipotecário; o problema foi o incumprimento das empresas, não das famílias. Estamos a legislar para facilitar a capitalização das empresas, mas primeiro tínhamos de sanear os bancos”, refere o ministro.",True,0,1496320564,moderator,False,0,dibbojt,t3_6emg8k,t3_6emg8k,1498973582,1,True,portugalnews,t5_3j11u,

Thorbee,NORW,Norway,"&gt;Are there any contingency plans about what Norway's trade/foreign policy would look like if it left the EEA?

We already have some agreements prior to EEA that we can fall back to, though they need to be updated to more current standards. Currently the ""leave the EEA"" lobby wants to negotiate new trade agreements or drop out to WTO terms if it comes to that. If we do decide to leave the EEA, there's no article 50 with a hard deadline, we can probably take our sweet time and work out some other deals before actually severing our ties to the EU.

&gt;Are there any contingency plans about what Norway's trade/foreign policy would look like if it left the EEA?

That's the current problem. We're stuck in a weird limbo; not being part of the political project nor have a vote on regulations, yet we have to implement them. Sooner or later we'll have to pick a full EU membership or drop the EEA agreement. The hope of the pro-EU side after loosing the second referendum was that after a decade or two in the EEA, the public opinion would be more positive to an EU membership. That hasn't happened, no close to 70% are opposed to an EU membership, compared to 52.2% in 1994 and 53.5 in 1972. 

The organization ""No to the EU"" has produced a [lengthy report](http://www.neitileu.no/media/publikasjoner/arbeidsnotater/alternativer_til_eoes) on alternatives to the EEA, both in terms of exploiting  possible legal loopholes/vetoing more directives, or just plain leaving. They also proposed a ""lean EEA"", where we ask to opt out of certain aspects offering the EU either increased contribution or decreased market access in return. Even though the report was produced by an anti-EU organization, its authors included people outside of the organization, including experts on trade law, constitutional matters and international law. The report has several chapters dedicated to a proposed way of dropping out, including how to handle it in terms of national and international law, a proposed timeline, negotiation goals and so on.",True,0,1496320625,,1496320886,0,dibbpwb,t3_6eli3g,t1_dibb5i9,1498973600,10,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,

TheForeignMan,,,"Well not really it is quite clear; liberalism is focussed on ideas of freedom and equality.  
In terms of economy, this means freedom from barriers to trade (ie no tariffs, no government intervention, no subsidies etc), freedom for workers (ie no controls of immigration, no rules banning classes of workers from working certain jobs etc).  
It is well established economically that markets work best if they are perfectly competitive - that is to say there are no barriers to entry or exit, everyone (businesses and customers) have perfect information and everyone acts rationally. This leads to perfect allocation of resources. However, it is quite obvious that this is very difficult (perhaps impossible) to achieve in the real world. As a result, all markets are inefficient in some way and likely leads to someone (either businesses or people) being disadvantaged and this needs to be corrected.   

This is where liberal government comes in - although in an ideal world there wouldn't be any need to implement rules, this is the real world. An example of this is smoking: it is well established that it is bad for your health, however this only occurs 20-30 years after you start smoking. Therefore people act irrationally and buy cigarettes, people get ill which costs them and the economy (cost of healthcare and opportunity cost from loss of output). This leads to what's called a negative externality - the whole cost of the product isn't fully priced into it. So government sticks a excise duty to try to combat this.  
Similar things are done throughout everything, from immigration controls to child tax credits.   

This is why you can get parties or people who are liberal but have differing views on things.   
The EU is extremely liberal if you are a member as there very few barriers to trade with other members. But they are extremely protectionist to non-members. Would a liberal be for or against the EU?  
What about taxation? Obviously government needs funding, but what level should tax be set at? etc.   

I imagine your criticism of Thatcher, Major etc is they didn't support individuals who were not treated well by their economic policies, and I definitely agree with this - they essentially forgot about the individual freedom branch of liberal policies.

The European states also made 'cynical' agreements to give Germany parts of Czechoslovakia to avoid conflict. 
 
Yeah part of the problem was the fear of another war. It certainly wouldn't have been popular. 

But they were watching Germany annex states and build it's army and move troops up to the Border with France, etc. They were watching revolutions all over Europe.

Particularly in the UK we were sort of hoping the fascists in Europe would fight the soviets and cancel each other out. 

And we were actively discouraging France from supporting the Republicans in Spain whilst they fought Fascist backed nationalists. This is directly because of the fear of the spread of communism. 

There are of course, many contributing factors.

But a big player that no one often talks about is the fact that western democracies often saw communism as a greater threat than Fascism, which is what allowed Germany to have enough time to reach a military strength capable of putting up such a terrible fight.

Abstract:

&gt; Lifestyle factors, such as food choices and exposure to chemicals, can alter DNA methylation and lead to changes in gene activity. Two such exposures with pharmacologically active components are coffee and tea consumption. Both coffee and tea has been suggested to play an important role in modulating disease-risk in humans by suppressing tumour progression, decreasing inflammation and influencing estrogen metabolism. These mechanisms may be mediated by changes in DNA methylation.
&gt; To investigate if DNA methylation in blood is associated with coffee and tea consumption we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study for coffee and tea consumption in four European cohorts (N = 3,096). DNA methylation was measured from whole blood at 421,695 CpG sites distributed throughout the genome and analysed in men and women both separately and together in each cohort. Meta-analyses of the results and additional regional-level analyses were performed.
&gt; After adjusting for multiple testing, the meta-analysis revealed that two individual CpG-sites, mapping to DNAJC16 and TTC17, were differentially methylated in relation to tea consumption in women. No individual sites were associated in men or in the sex-combined analysis for tea or coffee. The regional analysis revealed that 28 regions were differentially methylated in relation to tea consumption in women. These regions contained genes known to interact with estradiol metabolism and cancer. No significant regions were found in the sex-combined and male-only analysis for either tea or coffee consumption.",True,0,1496321502,,False,0,dibc9ps,t3_6emiy2,t3_6emiy2,1498973866,1,False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,

Europe comes from being ruled by royalty, and the people are used to the government having the power, being able to tell them what to do, and having responsibility to protect them (not that it does this very well). We come from having rebelled against royalty, and thus have a view that the people themselves are the ultimate power, the government being a necessary evil subservient to them. For this power of the people to be real it must not just be theoretical, defined by words on paper, but also physical. 

&gt;here guns are prohibited (some exemptions), and where there is a lot less of gun violence?

Switzerland has much more lax gun laws than the UK and far higher gun ownership, and in fact civilians can own full-auto machine guns. Switzerland has a lot less gun violence than the UK, and less violence overall.

N_Saint,,,"That's a bit disingenuous. People have been sending money to Africa voluntarily for over half a century through charities and involuntarily through taxes. 

Requires a lot more than just money to fix impoverished nations. We've been sending money to Africa for over half a century and there hasn't been any significant development of note. 

Most of those countries go from corrupt government to corrupt government. Uprisings by liberation groups in turn lead to yet more corrupt leadership. 

Money isn't always the answer. At the very bare minimum, they need to educate a generation of farmers. Foreign aid groups do go and teach how to farm but these methods needs to be internalized and spread by the local population and initiatives need local government support. 

I'm not convinced that this happens. Take a look at what happened in Zimbabwe. Since the 1980's their government tried to push land reform, slowly at first, but by the late 1990s funding dried up and their government began pushing their white farmers (people from European descent) off their lands. By the 2000's, only a fraction of the country's farmable land was even being used and, no surprise, they were suffering massive food shortages and, again no surprise, are costing the international community. 

My point in bringing up that example is to show that although there is a minimum cost threshold to just about everything, budgeting and finance management trumps the actual dollar amount. 

Why is there widespread starvation in impoverished nations? It's not because no one cares or no one is paying. That's false. There are billions of dollars every year that go into those regions of the world. The money is being poorly managed, farming is not being taught, and farming is not being supported by the government. 

As for clean drinking water, think about what goes into clean drinking water. You need infrastructure for clean drinking water. Period. Yes sure you can tap the ground and all of that, but on a large scale, when you're talking about providing a population with drinking water, there needs to be infrastructure in place for it. 

This means, you need trained engineers, plumbers, scientists, builders, etc... Plumbing needs to be in place and water purification plants need to be in place as well, at a minimum. 

All of this requires stability, which again comes back to government responsibility. You can send as much money as you want, but until there is a powerful government in place, able to provide stability, and willing to support the necessary infrastructure for civilization growth, you're just not going to see these developments. 

TL;DR- Has little to do about not sharing money. Developed nations have been sharing money voluntarily and involuntarily for over half a century. Impoverished nations are not managed well. They have corrupt governments with a high turnover rate and have shown to be either disinterested or incapable of supporting realistic farming initiatives. No support for infrastructure and personnel required for water purification and distribution. ",True,0,1496322460,,False,0,dibcw6u,t3_6ek0n3,t1_diavs4i,1498974167,27,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,

Shyxlol,creatorwinner,Creator World First - Astrologian,"First of all, op has an error in his post, a crit adlo has a 900 potency shield and the EU/JP builds have diurnal sect listed as 10% healing increase.

However, a crit asp. benefic crit shielding for more than an adlo would feel weird in my opinion, simply because it takes away adlos identity. Adlo has always cost a lot of mp and was a fairly inefficient cast, Cure2/Bene2 were a lot more efficient but adlo made things that kill a tank survivable.

I don't want to argue ast vs sch so I'll keep this only on adlo but op made a comparison between asp. helios and adlo spread but he forgot to factor in healing multipliers. When spreading an adlo from a warrior, the warrior can provide an additional 1.44 multiplier for the shield and a bard another 1.2 one (so 1.73~ total). Scholar has access to a 20% divine seal now and he still has fey illu and in certain cases, like a8s 2nd intermission for example, you can even add dissipation. Mantra is an option as well ofc. 

So in total we have: 2.489 w/o mantra/dissipation, 2.99 with either of them and 3.6 with both of them. Which would but adlo up to a 1075 potency shield on a non-crit and a 3225 potency shield on a crit (assuming 1.5 crit multiplier). I would argue that they might be afraid of buffing adlo right now because it might make adlo spread even stronger than it already is.

These numbers might seem like all the stars would need to align for this to happen, do keep in mind people did exactly this in A8s for the 2nd intermission and Jstorm to survive. Though having access to this many multipliers you probably wouldn't even want to stack all of them because it'd end up being overkill.

Astro in comparison only has access to mantra and divine seal (I'm disregarding fey illu ofc). That would give you a 373 potency aoe shield. Why do I not mention the value for a crit here? Because if 8 people are stacked up you can't even see who it crits on.

So for this wall of text :&lt; I might or might not be upset about whm changes but I do believe ast/sch are actually in a good place. Sch will still pull ahead in my opinion but w/o cleric stance the ast can easily weave in single target healing to support the whm, while the whm uses mostly regens (-&gt;rip lilies but that's not the point) which makes whm/ast a lot easier to efficiently play but turns the whm into a stonemage (and regenmage)

Tl;dr: Adlo is weird. It sucks when not necessary but when needed you simply need it. It also is godlike for aoe shielding every 2 minutes.

&gt; When comparing this pattern with modern Egyptians, we find that the ancient Egyptians are more closely related to all modern and ancient European populations that we tested (Fig. 5b), likely due to the additional African component in the modern population observed above.

&gt;By comparing ancient individuals from Abusir el-Meleq with modern Egyptian reference populations, we found an influx of sub-Saharan African ancestry after the Roman Period.

So, my interpretation is that ancient Egypt and Europe were were a fairly well-mixed group due to trade etc. within the ancient civilisations. After the collapse of these civilisations, and the resulting reduction in genetic flow, Europeans remain relatively 'pure' (and hence similar to ancient Egyptians), modern Egyptian genes have been influenced by a later wave of African migrants.",True,0,1496323611,,False,0,dibdpk1,t3_6eecbp,t3_6eecbp,1498974562,2,False,askscience,t5_2qm4e,

I have bought a couple packs from him in the past and everything was fine and the service and product were good. The only caveat is that A: considering the supply method, the flavour selection is limited, and B: the prices are... well... jaw dropping (50 pounds sterling for a pack of Cane Mint) - you are basically paying for not having to risk importing yourself from the US.
I think that is it for shops that actually have Tangiers in stock in Europe at this given moment.
As a side note: 'Tangiers Europe' have a facebook profile and they appear to be an affiliate, if not part, of the Tangiers US company, who seem to at least promote Tangiers in, mainly, Germany. They do not reply to pms but do post when they attend events in Germany, so you can try to go to one of them and talk with them.

DevilishRogue,,"Libertarian capitalist 8.12, -0.46","&gt; I disagree. If Corbyn stands again in the next election, which I reckon he won't because he'll be too old by then there's a good chance he could beat her (she likely won't be standing either, I reckon there will be a coup in about eighteen months).

The Tories don't operate like that. So long as Corbyn is leading Labour there will be no impetus for change of leadership within the Tories. The thinking will be (even if it is wrong) ""She's beaten him once, she'll do it again"" unless she does something particularly catastrophic rather than just a series of relatively minor missteps. 

&gt; Here's the thing about Brexit that none of the leavers on here has understood: it can't be 'successful' because there are too many contradictory measures of what success would look like.

For that exact same reason it also can't be ""unsuccessful"". Besides which, everyone is aware it is a long-term gambit. May will be long gone by the time the fuller consequences are known. 

&gt; You've got Corbyn and Hoey who wanted out due to a Bennite belief that the EU was a tool of neo-Liberal globalism which lead to local workers' wages being undercut. You have people like Aaron Banks wanting to liberalise trade even more and at the same time remove some of the legislation surrounding worker's rights. Right there you have a contradiction.

Only in terms of outcome, not in terms of decision. The decision is that we should have the right to make up our own minds on this issue, not that it should be one way or the other. Thus whatever option is chosen (and obviously I hope it is the Banks version rather than the Corbyn version), so long as it is the UK that has decided it will be seen as a success.

&gt; You have people that voted for it on the basis of reducing immigration but this was never seriously on the table.

That is an oversimplificaiton. People who want lower immigration recognise that this is a necessary step to achieve that, not a guarantee of lower immigration.

&gt; You have people wanting to increase trade with the old commonwealth but we don't actually produce any of the things they consume any more.

Being that they will be modernising their economy, our service industry and particularly the financial sector, is well placed to take advantage of that emerging economic strength.

&gt; So even if May chose an infinitely detailed set of demands and successfully negotiated for them, she'd still be getting heckled by a different sector of the leavers for selling them down the river.

honestly, the consolidation of the Left and an electoral base for it is a much more important long-term objective for the future of Britain than seeking power itself.

Then most of their agents escaped to Argentina and other south American nations as a diversion tactics. Some of the most important ones in the party were responsible for keeping this sperms and find the appropriate receptor for making the suitable offspring. The one sent to Asia was smart but wasnt attractive. The ones sent to the Americas were both girls​. The one in Europe wasn't sexy enough.

Now of course, one fleet is not the same as contributing ALL their fleets so they can still be accused of not doing enough. But also keep in mind that since much of their forces weren't engaged in the fight, they probably ended up suffering the least amount of damage in the war. It didn't seem like their homeworld suffered as much devastation from the Reapers as Palaven, Earth, Thessia and Tuchanka did either. Out of all the major powers in the galaxy, they were the ones who came out relatively unscathed compared to everyone else. Sort of like the US in World War 2. 

I think because of this, many of the Salarian's infastructure, industrial, economic, and military capabilities would have remained intact, thus giving them a fairly big advantage over the other species. At that point, they might even be the most powerful species in the galaxy. I don't think they would lose their council seat so easily.

machine_addict,,,"I think the *free* guns vs free birth control is a bad comparison. We cannot look at the situation in terms of the monetary cost to the individual but rather the monetary cost to the society.

Guns represent, on one hand, a danger to a free society, as anyone who can obtain one now has unbalanced power over someone who can't. In the US the guns are there if you feel you need one, and you can choose to purchase it, we really probably should keep a little tighter control on who we allow to do so. But it is something you're allowed to have. On the other hand of that statement guns in the hands of civilians is one of the things that should be really setting us apart from a society under some form of despotism as it enables the general public to take power back from the government should they so desire. There is a further discussion here about progressive thought and the American Revolution that I think is super ironic, but we won't get into that. 

So we allow our citizenry to be armed because we live in a society with enough resources that we're not terribly worried about people using those firearms against their fellow citizens in order to meet their own needs. Note I'm not saying this doesn't happen, it does, just at a rate most Americans feel they can accept, that is: The risk of being shot by a crazy person with access to a gun is low enough to make ones own 'right' to own the same weapon favourable for most of us.

Now birth control, and why it needs to be free. Birth control does not represent a danger to our society. Folks practising safe sex and being able to talk responsibility for their own bodies at no additional cost to themselves lowers the rate of unplanned pregnancy in teenagers. Unplanned pregnancy is a threat to the general well being of our society, those who have them (especially in their teens or twenties) are likely to go social programs like welfare or WIC and cost tax dollars, far more tax dollars per baby than if we continued to give them free birth control. Furthermore, one thing we can agree on is that people are going to have sex, whether or not we give them free birth control. For me this isn't much of a problem for you, I make decent money and can afford my own birth control. For families living paycheck to paycheck birth control is way down the list of needs, first they're going to buy food, gasoline, shelter, and other necessity items. Then, they practice rhythm or withdrawal, then they get pregnant. Often this pregnancy is going to make their financial stability go down, their likelihood of attending trade school or college drops, and their own expectations for reaching whatever goals they may have had quickly dwindles. In essence poverty breeds poverty and one of the factors we as a society can help to control is to provide birth control and prophylactics to anyone who seeks them.

As a society we are strongest when we carry the least collective debt, and have employed the most members of our society to the highest value of work their own competence allows. Quality of life is higher for all races and classes of people when the lowest paid class is comfortable. In order to improve the quality of life for all Americans we must seek to improve the quality of life of our poorest 20%. 

The problem we're having with this right now is superstition. Religion is the destroyer of society. Look at the middle east. Look at the dark ages of Europe. There comes a time in a societies development when our superstitions must be set aside and we must care more about our fellow citizens than we do the beliefs we hold. If everyone showed compassion for the tired, the poor, the oppressed and outcast, with the same energy they use their respective 2000 year old book to justify hurting those exact people we'd be living in a far better world right now.

Trump's retardedness on climate change isn't even about the taxing, which by the way does work but like all solutions isn't the fix all.

Free fucking energy from a nuclear reactor in space vs limited plant sludge when burned results in increased temperature trapping. It's supposedly idiot proof.

That other chemical shit in China is Trump's wet dream, it's why it's so cheap for him to produce his merchandise there. That shit in China is no regulations.


Before Obamacare people were denied health insurance. How deep you pulled 60% from your ass I don't want to know but Universal Single Payer Healthcare is still backwards compared to the Not-actually-failed-Communist(read Capitalist) states in Europe. The actual cheap way to do this is to put it into taxes, everyone is guaranteed whatever medical treatment they require whenever and for less than if they payed for their whole treatment themselves. ""Oh no, I'm paying for freeloaders"" Spare me that bullshit. It's part of being in a successful country. You pay for roads, Trump's trips to Mar-a-Lago, and for all those revenge/oil wars from your taxes. Your tax dollars go 110 billion dollars worth of weapons for Saudi Arabia because of trump. Now before you go on about getting the money for the goods we sold remember that they funded 9/11 attacks and then wonder why the hell we made 110billion worth of weapons in the first place? Reinvestment would certainly be the best option.

Trump did want to get rid of Obamacare, not only was that his campaign promise but he actually tried and thankfully failed to get that through. Instead he made a butchered version of it that punishes poor people for being poor and for being sick. 

Trump didn't start the war, but he's far from making the situation better. He's certainly killing loads of civilians.

He gets his news from from intelligence briefings but from a tabloid magazine and Fox news. The leader of the USA makes his decisions based on the actual fake news then accuses all other news of being fake. What the fuck is that? How the god damn hell is this national embarrassment better than hillary? Where is Aleppo sunk one guy but somehow Trump gets away with this shit?

&gt;No. I think it's a problem of the EU not having its own administration to enforce its own rules. 

The Eu can enforce its some of its own laws (some are directly applicable) and can also impose fines on non-complying member state. 


&gt;80-90% of our laws are said to come from EU level. Our parliament has some discretionary power for regulations to implement them but most of the time they just have to copy paste...

That is a Brexit lie. By far the largest part of our laws are local, national laws. 


&gt;[Another example look at how the UK now has big problems in starting to negotiating trade deals, the national governments have lost that expertise to the EU. 

Not 'lost' but voluntarily transferred that, because you can have a better deal when negotiating as a large player. We have more stringent rules on food safety, against the WTO codex alimentarius. But we are EU so fuck them.

The guy he put in charge of the DoE literally didn't even know what the DoE did.  Doesn't sound like someone with a sound energy plan.

&gt;He's put pressure on NATO to pay up.

He was basically laughed at, and eventually admitted he hadn't understood what NATO was even for.

So no, he didn't put pressure on them to pay up.  He put pressure on them to teach him what NATO is even supposed to do.

&gt;He's brought in jobs upon jobs since he was sworn in - Intel, Carrier, SoftBank, Kroger to name a few.

[Carrier lost jobs, and he didn't save nearly as many as claimed.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-03-29/remember-when-trump-said-he-saved-1-100-jobs-at-a-carrier-plant)  And then [they started laying more people off.](http://www.newsweek.com/carrier-company-where-trump-rescued-800-jobs-now-announces-600-layoffs-ahead-614352)  As for Intel, [that was planned out under Obama, not Trump.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/17/news/companies/donald-trump-jobs-watch/)  And the Softbank thing?  [It was announced before the election](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/20/technology/softbank-oneweb-investment-trump/).  And Kroger [did add 10k jobs, but it added 12k last year, so that's just their current trajectory started under Obama.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/24/news/companies/kroger-jobs/)  None of your examples actually work.

&gt;He's increased the military budget in keeping with his plan to bolster the military.

Yes, he did manage to spend more there.  $54 billion more.  Yay big government.  We'll see what the money actually does.

&gt;He signed an executive order to crack down on drug cartels.

[We'll see on any long term effects of those orders.  So far they obviously haven't done anything and they don't seem attached to reality.](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-orders-crackdown-drug-trafficking-anti-cop-violence-n719001)

&gt;Btw, walls do work. See China, Berlin, South Korea, two cities in Spain, Egypt, Israel, Ireland, India and Malaysia.

The Great Wall of China was to delay Mongolian cavalry and cost thousands of lives to build, but anyone could climb over it (it was the horses that were tough to get across).  The Berlin Wall required mass surveillance that we can't afford.  None of the places you mention (other than the Great Wall of China, which can't do what is suggested) cover anywhere near the required ground, and he can't afford to build the damn thing.  He is trying to build a bit of a fence though (not ""a big beautiful wall"").  His promise was of course that Mexico would pay for it... they won't.  And the fence won't do much.  [But yeah, it's an ineffective fence](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/donald-trump-s-border-wall-progress-report-n764726).

He also threatened Sanctuary Cities (I'm in one), but hasn't been able to do anything yet because that's actually unconstitutional.  

So far, I'm not seeing results (I don't have time to check the rest of your stuff, but that jobs bit especially was totally false).

&gt;Also remember, Republicans filling seats are not necessarily his base. His base are his followers, and his followers expect him to toss out Paul Ryan, McCain, and Graham, among others, because of their inability to care about what their constituency wants/is voting for.

Then his followers are hopelessly naive.

&gt;My point with the Clintons is that, looking at the economy, the number of promises Trump has already fulfilled, the jobs coming in, the firm hand with other countries, their 30 years were entirely unsuccessful in comparison and now we know it's not because they just ""couldn't make headway"".

As shown above,  he didn't actually make headway with a congress that was his own party (he just pretended to), and his economic gains either didn't exist or were from Obama.  He's lost us influence in Europe (rather dramatically in the last few weeks).  How on earth can you claim he has a ""firm hand"" with other countries when they've made him (and the country) a laughing stock?

Meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation [does charitable work, it's not the Clinton's private slush fund.](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/)  I have no idea about Chelsea's wedding, but [there's not really evidence that dollars for Haiti went to it.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/04/did-the-clinton-foundation-pay-for-chelseas-wedding/?utm_term=.9709870b357d)

&gt; Referring to trade negotiations with the U.S., which ran until the end of last year but are now on ice, Schulz said it would be impossible to grant better market access to the U.S. if it did not respect climate protection rules.

&gt; &amp;quot;If the U.S. drops out of the climate agreement for European trade policy, this means that American production sites don&amp;#039;t need to abide by the climate goals,&amp;quot; said the Social Democratic candidate, who was speaking at the WDR Europa Forum in Berlin.

The why behind the allocation is based on the capitalization of these indices at a given time. The US market capitalization is bigger than the European one, hence it being a bigger size. It's not perfectly logical and there's no reason to follow it to the letter other than having a super simple passive rule. That's how XAW is, you find the details under holdings, i.e. XEF is about 35% right now, US is a combination of IVV IJH IJR for 53.72%, and 11.38% to Emerging Markets through the US fund IEMG.

CCP's recommended portfolio may have changed, but the stock allocation used to be something like 30%/30%/30% XUU/XEF/XIC and 10% XEC. Personally, I'm investing based on where I want to travel when I retire, and have a house and plan to have a small pension here that will be tied to inflation, so I go with about 40%/40%/10%/10% XUU/XEF/XEC/XIC. This way, if Europe or the US become super expensive, the investments should in theory reflect that; furthermore, the cost of many things in Canada is tied to the US' economy/currency, and the rest will be payable with my pension.



The MER difference between XAW and the other funds might have been lower before iShares lowered some of their MER.

AKA why the Revolutionary War happened and was great, then why the Civil War happened and wasn't so great, then everyone took a break to warm up for the WWI and WWII double header. This takes us to the present, good ol' 1950. 

**AP World History** 

Basically European History-lite, with a supporting cast featuring: the river valley civilization quartet, the  perfect and pristine utopias that were Africa and the Americas before the white man showed up, some stuff happened with a guy named Buddha in the Far East in the non-Roman/non-Greek parts of the world, Then a whole lot of Christianity, then a whole lot of Islam, Islam-Christianity fight night, Then a whole lot of Mongols, then a Whole lot of Black death, then everyone in Europe suddenly remembered how great dongs and boobs look in paintings and sculpted onto marble, then the Reformation which didn't so much like the dongs and boobs, then the evil Brits and Spaniards took over the world because of tea and gold, Then everyone killed each other in WWII. This takes us to the present, good ol' 1950.

There's very few examples of total population destruction and complete replacement with a population totally uninfluenced by the local culture that remains uninfluenced by the previous culture of an area. 

If we accept that to be true, then the social structures that governed behavior in feudalism didn't just disappear overnight, rather, even with changes in thinking and governance the social impact of those system framed behavior in a way that continues to this day. 

In that way, the question should be, ""how do sociological trends that developed during feudal Europe continue to impact the present day European societies, and the societies which grew out of European colonies?"" Obviously this influence will vary depending on country, language, and history, but it is clear that a stratified and class based system continues to exist, the American and French revolutions simply changed how one enters the class and reformed how power is structured in their societies. 

To put it in short, modern society is a continuation of the motivators that existed previously in society, and the framework of thought and expectation of success that individuals strive towards now is reflective of the influence of past expectations, which in themselves draw from previous societal definitions of success, all of which are grounded in the past and allow a stratified, hierarchical structure to more or less be maintained, just with varying degrees of power and significance.

TheGreatWalk,,,"I actually know exactly how this works, so prepare for a lesson.

Ex, with a 1000 ping, I could peak from a tree, line up a headshot, and shoot you for 1 full second. On your screen, you would see me peak, shoot at me, hit me 5-10x, but then you'd die without doing any damage, because the server would timestamp you as ""dead"" before 
you ever see me, since I've been shooting you for a full second before your first shot ever went off, but it would take a full second for my client to send those time stamps to the server. This all goes based on timestamps, and the ping advantage is only there if they are doing the aggressive action(ie, peaking an enemy) and not the other way around(ie, sitting in a corner and someone pushes them). The net result from your perspective would be that you see me look around the corner, you'd shoot me a bunch, then you'd go 100-0 and I'd be full, even though you wouldn't even see me shoot. You'd swear up and down you got the first shot off, there's no way I could've killed you, but it's all moot, because the timestamps showed you completely dead before you EVER saw me. That's for sitting still, however. When talking about movement...

The reason high ping players will teleport is due to interpolation - what you see on your screen is not exactly what the server (or the player on the other screen sees). There are some predictive features that smooth the gameplay out considerably and help with animation handling - barely noticeable on low ping, but seriously noticeable if a player has high ping. For example, if a low ping player, say 1 ms, is running in a straight line, then does an instant 180 and runs in the opposite direction, it will send that info to the server instantaneously which will then in turn send it to you, so you see the turn instantly and there is little to no fuckery whatsoever. On the other hand, if it's a high ping player, say 1000, doing the same thing, the server and your client will keep interpolating his movement in one direction for a FULL second until his client tells the server ""oh by the way I've run the opposite direction for a full second now"", meaning in total, what you as a client sees is actually 2 full seconds behind. The server would send the new coordinates to your client, and the player would teleport, because no interpolation is good enough to smooth 2 seconds worth of running in opposite directions. This would happen everytime the high ping player changes direction - they would only not teleport by running in the same direction for extended periods of time. 

The vast majority of shooters all use this exact same client sided hit reg and architecture - CS:GO, Overwatch, and battlefield all use this(there was a BIG problem at the release of battlefield 4 that resulted in the EXACT same thing you see here - high ping players had a MASSIVE advantage because there were no upper limits to acceptable ping). 

Games like CS:GO and overwatch is that have matchmaking based heavily on ping, and that there are hard coded maximums(I think 150 ping) over which their players either get kicked from the servers(custom servers in bf4 did this) or set as a hard limit, meaning in my original example, as the high ping player, my first 850 milliseconds of shooting wouldn't count as far as timestamps are concerned if you shot 
 and registered a kill on me on your screen, essentially negating the vast majority of the ping advantage. 

This games netcode(and honestly, nearly every FPS) would all be really good in a ideal situation where there are only people with 5 or less ms of ping - in the battlefield 4 example I was talking about, the games netcode was absolutely fucking AMAZING at the reveal(forget which convention) because every single client was physically present and a few feet away from the server. They didn't realize that the netcode was utterly fucked until after they shipped the game and suddenly the games were filled with people with 150-500 ping, especially as they all started realizing that they were basically untouchable if they queued other regions servers.

So I'm going to use your own, stupid, arrogant statement right back at you... if only you had informed yourself, maybe you could stop lying to yourself and talking about this bullshit ""EU are better than US"" and vice versa mindset. Because if I went back and clipped my games on EU last night, you'd think that EU players are literally completely fucking braindead by how hard and effortlessly I shit on them.

3180,us,RPCV,"I flew home with my cat in cabin and this post has several good tips although I'd like to add some. 

* Research, research, research on everything in your country because it all varies from country to country. Some countries have strict regulations while others don't. My country doesn't have any microchip clinic therefore there are no requirements for any pet to have it before they fly out. My fellow Volunteers and I put everything we researched from vets to airlines in Excel spreadsheet for future Volunteers to check out whenever they decide to bring their pets home. Working together helped us greatly because some of us received different information from some agencies (they are very slow and unorganized here) and others had to follow up to verify information and receive correct information. 

* If you want to bring a pet home, find the best vet in your country and talk with them because it is likely they know which custom brokers and agencies to work on drafting up all papers you and your pet need. My local vet referred us to the custom broker who knew which agencies to get all paperwork done within 10 days before departure. This saved me a lot of time so I didn't have to travel all over in town and get each paperwork done at each agency. 

* **Before you decide to buy a crate,** research on your airlines and their pet policies in cabin and cargo. We found out our popular airline doesn't allow cats on board at all, not even in cargo. Out of seven airlines, two prohibited pets on board and in cargo, one was prohibited by U.S. Embassy, two had limited flight schedules flying in and out of the country, and only two accepted cats. Furtunately, they allow cats in cabin therefore I brought a soft-sided carrier to fit under the seat. I recommend Mr. Peanut brand for soft-sided carriers.

* Before you fly, check for pet relief areas at all airports you're flying to and save their maps. This helped me so much knowing where it was during a layover - less stress and more time to travel between gates. 

* Empty PB jar makes a good container for food. The lids (I brought an extra) can be used as ""bowls"" for food and water. 

* After seeing /u/mollyjeanne's post about layovers in EU, this reminded me of all hassles we PCVs in this specific country in South America had to go through with figuring out logistics of a layover in another country.  **Before you get your flight tickets, check information in other countries regarding pet regulations for layovers. This will help you decide which airline and flight routes you want.** For instance, the popular airline in this country goes through Trinidad and Tobago as a layover and Trinidad &amp; Tobago Argriculture Ministry requires an transmit permit and all animals to be evaluated by the airport vet on weekdays between 9-5 (it doesn't matter if your pet is sitting in the same plane. You still have to get off with your pet to have them inspected for a fee in order to get clearance before you can fly out). To avoid this, I opted for another airline with a direct flight to U.S. 

* To avoid that, find a direct flight (if possible) from your country to U.S. or get flights with minimial number of layovers or any flight in the country with none or minimal pet regulations for layovers. A direct flight to U.S. saved me from a whole of headache.

If you got any question about bringing a cat home or traveling with a pet in cabin,  ask away!

Capitalism and socialism work in tandem. They don't work against each other.    
You bring up a perfect example of Scandinavian countries and health care. You have the public health care system, and you have the private sector. The public system is **just another actor on the market**. If the private sector want to remain viable they have to **offer a better service.**   
What this essentially means is you are guaranteed a minimum of care (which is, in our case, very good) and then if you have the money for it you can pay for even better care. 

OF COURSE you can give real world examples, we can sit for years giving examples of public being better and private being better.

When people started to make changes and adaptations to this formation, the numbering began to differ because different players were moved to different formations in different parts of the world.

For example, in Britain, when the 2-3-5 changed to a formation with a back four, the no. 5 and 6 were moved into central defence. In continental Europe, it was the no. 4 and the no. 5. That's why today, the no. 4 is the defensive midfielder in UK parlance, but on the continent, it is the no. 6 that is the defensive midfielder. In Argentina it is the no. 5 that is the defensive midfielder. Also, no. 3 is often designated as the left back in Europe, but in Brazil, it is actually the no. 6 that they designate as left full back (this is why famous Brazilian left backs like Roberto Carlos and Marcelo wear the no. 6 jersey), and no. 3 is a centre half.

You can't honestly expect us to believe any of that.

&gt;Nobody in SAS hates the USA. (to be honest, I should say, the majority of them doesn't).

&gt;SAS is more about stuff about America that makes us laugh, and that a lot of people will consider stereotypical US behaviour. In no way does it imply that such or such country is better.

Sure, that's what the sidebar says. That's not what the users actually believe. You can see it by reading any comment chain on any post on that sub.

Any American who even attempts to say ""Hey, you're taking this out of context"" or offer an explanation is downvoted to oblivion and told that they're wrong about their own country.

&gt;And obviously, one of the most proeminently laughable thing is the (very American-centric) notion that ""we think so much about the US"". Fact is, we don't! As a french guy, if I look at the international part of any major newspaper, it will mostly be talking about Germany, the UK, and Europe, because those are the countries we interact with the most on a daily basis.

SAS spends plenty of time thinking about America. They troll American-specific subs for the sole purpose of mockery.

&gt;Doesn't mean we consider the US to be unimportant, that would be utterly ridiculous! It obviously plays a huge role when it comes to international relations. On the other hand, we do believe that, as much as our own countries have their own fair share of stupid shit going on, there are plenty of things other countries actually do way better than the US.

And then you go to SAS and circlejerk about how superior you are to us, the uncivilized imbeciles of America.

&gt;And then there is the issue of the representations we get of each other. Don't get me wrong, in France of all countries, we're pretty damn good at having some seriously skewed ideas about whatever the fuck happens in any other country. But then, you guys tend to take the crown when it comes to imagining the weirdest bullshit about what's up with ours.

If SAS thinks that the shit they post is what the average American is actually like, they're completely hopeless.

&gt;Case in point, the freedom of speech thing. I mean, if you were to actually live for a while here, you'd realize you're free to spout any kind of bullshit you want, including on national TV (and you won't get the bleep censorship on public media either). Now, you guys have not really lived through the whole Nazi thing, nor the whole post-colonialism thing either,so your view on this is generally different, but we as a society decided that it would be a good thing to allow people to sue other people when they are clearly calling for racial hatred (note that actual convictions are not frequent).

And the First Amendment is merely a protection against government censorship. It has no bearing on private individuals suing each other for libel, slander or anything else in civil court. It simply means you can't be arrested for your particular beliefs.

Talk about a misconception.

&gt;That's a debatable point, I get that, but you could argue that the whole ""My freedom stops where yours begins"" is not that idiotic. Yet the only thing we tend to hear from an American (generally) is ""we invented free speech"" (it was already in effect in Athens, in the Roman republic, and in the UK before the USA even existed, it was written in the Declaration of the Rights of Man which predates the first amendment), and ""y'all get jailed for wording thoughts"".

I have literally never met somebody in this country who believes we invented the concept of free speech. Are there some morons who believe this? Sure.

But don't pretend that other countries don't have the same problem of vocal idiots. Or am I to believe all French citizens want to destroy the EU based on this quote by Marine le Pen:

&gt;I want to destroy the EU, not Europe! I believe in a Europe of nation-states. I believe in Airbus and Ariane, in a Europe based on cooperation. But I don't want this European Soviet Union.

&gt; 

But what do *American* workers want?

Does the American worker want more hours and more pay, because the American worker values purchasing power, or do they perhaps want those ""European"" things?

I mean, there are a lot of reasons for this statistic (geographic, political, etc.), but the average American household owns a lot more cars, more electronics, and a much bigger house and lot than the average European household.

I'd also point out that even geographically speaking, that has an influence on everything. The average European has a much easier time visiting another nation/different culture, and so a vacation-focused work policy may mean a lot more to the average European where travel costs are negligible.

Meanwhile, the average American has a much harder time traveling to another country for a vacation - for them, the *option* made by increased purchasing power to travel OR do other things is what they crave.

Even the disparity in urbanization matters.

You say the average European can go get a meal. The average European also lives in a far more dense and urban environment than the average American. Imagine a worker at a factory in a suburb or rural area - their only option might be fast food! Also, similar to in the big cities in America, the more densely populated European homes there may not have the same facilities to cook at home that a suburban house in an urban sprawl in America has - thus, *eating out* may be the *damn-near-necessary* option whereas bringing a pre-made home-cooked meal may be the *option* American workers want.

Long story short - there's a lot of cultural, geographic, political, and other factors that come into play on what the American worker *prefers* over what the average European worker does.

Neo24,EURO,European Union,"&gt;This is because legislatures in presidential systems are often elected through FPTP systems, the only advantage of which is that there is sometimes low party discipline.

True, but the election system isn't necessarily the only factor. The US and UK both use FPTP yet the first has low party discipline, and the second high. The thing is that in a parliamentary system you inherently need to have a relatively loyal majority on your side just to survive - it's hard for MPs to oppose their party when doing that might mean the government will fall, and it means the governing party has very strong incentives to keep its MPs under strict control. OTOH, in a presidential system the representatives can oppose the president without endangering his survival.

&gt;The national parties authority over who is on the list helps maintain the current low party discipline, replacing it completely with EU wide lists would avoid this, and make sure that pan-European party leaders have much higher control over their MEPs.

True, I'm not in favor of just having one EU-wide list. I think it can't happen anyway, people like their local representation too much.

&gt;open lists for a 750 member parliament is a bit unfeasible, ballots would be huge and nobody would be able to know everyone on the list, even of one party.

&gt;Also, you don't even strictly need to compare ever single language with every other. 
 

Yes im aware. Thats why i mentioned Papua since most of the languages there havent even been analized yet. So we dont really know their linguistic features.
&gt;Basque is kinda unique because it's not related to any of the languages that surround it. In other words it separated from the European languages a really long time ago. Thus it's really, really different from English. And it has some properties that happen to be difficult for English speakers, thus it's relatively difficult.

So you are saying that Basque separated from European languages a long time ago and im the one that has no idea? As far as we know basque is a language isolate it never diverged from them since it never was part of PIE.

I know its really different and i know its very difficult. Im not contesting that. German is easier than basque for an english speaker of course.  But what about finnish? is it easier or harder than basque? Is basque  the hardest? NO, talking in superlatives is absurd.
&gt;You have no idea what you're talking about 


About difficulties in second language learning? More than you if you believe there are linguists looking at categorizing languages from hardest to easiest making some kind of ranking.

Is it because you had a very solitary family life - parents of the ""you're 18, now get out"" type of mentality? What about your friends? Even if they're also struggling to get by, surely, most of them would be nice enough to lend you a couch at least, if you became homeless? 

I think the real reason people feel so bitter/unable to achieve these things is not because of financial strain, but social loneliness. I know a post-grad couple who took 6 months off to backpack Europe - they were not wealthy, they were not lucky, they had shit-all in savings - but they had social support. 

This over-obsession with money these days misses the point. You can do a lot with the right attitude and with the right non-financial support. Risk taking is so much easier when you know you can count on someone, anyone, to not shit on you if you fall. 

Make better (not richer, just better) friends. Friends that, even if they're having a hard time, don't begrudge you staying with them to get back on your feet because they truly care about you.

While a serious SHTF event may not be in France's near future; the way of life has already changed greatly over the last few years for many Europeans and as time moves forward there is a serious chance things will change dramatically as Muslims become the majority.

Background: This event will take place in Rio and it is obviously stacked with Brazilian fighters. The crowds will clearly be in their favor along with the travel distances and judges. It’s understood that the UFC really wanted to push the brand to Brazil with this event. The entire undercard is filled with up and coming Americans fighting experienced and lethal Brazilians. I foresee a lot of Brazilians fighters winning on Saturday night especially those that go the distance.   
  
————————————————————————————-
    
Marco Beltrán vs. **Deiveson Alcântara 1.67**      

Deiveson Alcantara comes into this fight making his UFC debut undefeated. 11 fights 11 wins for the 5'5"" flyweight fighting out of Para, Brazil. Breaking down his 11 wins showcases his talents. Only 1 of 11 ended in a decision with nearly all his finishes ending in the first round. Alcantara has fighting in his genes as he is ready to make his UFC debut and show the world what he is capable of. Beltran on the other hand holds a subpar 8-4 record with 3 of his losses a result of submissions. He holds 3 UFC wins to his name, 2 of which came via decision, and one via submission. A former semifinalist of The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America, Beltran skills just do not match up with the up and coming Deiveson Alcântara.    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
**Luan Chagas 1.43** vs. Jim Wallhead    
Jim Wallheads demeanor, looks, and fight style suggest that he is an inmate and not a fighter. Although he is experienced with over 39 fights he is vulnerable. His movements especially on the ground look amateurish and with a nickname of Scuba Steve there is no reason to doubt bookmakers making him an underdog. Although he lacks the skills of a professional UFC fighter he does have a dangerous right hand that can send anyone in front of him to the canvas. Luan Chagas on the other hand is a up and coming young and resilient 23-year-old. His highlight reel is filled with finishes. His hands are lethal and his ground game is far superior. Although his last fight ended with a strange submission loss, it seemed more of a problem with his fitness than anything else. Chagas will look to bounce back and improve on his 14-1-1 record, his UFC experience and proven skills have got my vote.   
————————————————————————————  
**Viviane Pereira 1.84** vs. Jamie Moyle   
Viviane Perira looks to improve on her 12-0 undefeated record. Her UFC debut ended in a split decision that saw her topple Valerie Letourneau (American Top Team Member) in a 3-round split decision. Proving she can compete with high caliber women Periera will look to jump up in the rankings. Her opponent Jamie Moyle is a clear underdog. Holding a professional record of 4-1 she made her UFC debut beating Kailin Curran (1-4 UFC Record) in Decemeber. A purple belt with no knockout power I see no way that her abilities can topple Viviane. Looking over her last fight is seeming clear that she has no punching power nor ground game. Her game plan remains focused on outlasting her opponent’s fitness level then actually beating them while they’re gassed.   
————————————————————————————  
**Iuri Alcântara 1.33** vs. Brian Kelleher   
Luri Alcatnara the second fighter on the card fighting out of Para, Brazil. A southpaw holding a black belt in BJJ and an outstanding record of 35-7. Looking at his most recent fights one that stands out was his bout with Frankie Saenz . Starting the fight as a huge favorite (-800 I believe) Luri showed that he struggles versus elite wrestlers, but it is clear from the tapes that his striking and ground game is next level. His other recent loss vs Jimmie Rivera (20-1) once again showcased his weakness against wrestlers while at the same time emphasizing his truly remarkable striking and ground game. Now coming off a 2 fight UFC win streak he looks to improve on his already great record. Luri is the superior fighter and it’s just a matter of minute coaching adjustments that will take him to the next level. Brian Kelleher (16-7) on the other hand is making his UFC debut. With the lack of experience and no strong wrestling background his chances are slim. Looking over some of his highlight reels he seems to have some explosiveness with his right hand, and an improving ground game. But they should be no match for the experienced Brazilian.   
————————————————————————————  
**Johnny Eduardo 1.49** vs. Matthew Lopez    
Lopez is a very powerful and strong fighter who is capable of overwhelming anybody in his weight class however if Eduardo is aware Johnny has a significant weakness. Speed and kicks. Eduardo fights out of Rio and will have the home crowd along with his insane speed and experience it should be enough to finish this fight swiftly. With only 2 UFC fights to his name Matthew Lopez will be put to the ultimate test. In fights where he has overpowered opponents on the ground, Lopez has not yet faced someone with a strong ground game.  Eduardo will look to challenge that. Kicks and rolls will be the way in the fight as he looks to win in front of the home crowd.   
—————————————————————————————  
Antônio Carlos Júnior vs. **Eric Spicely 2.93**  
This card is filled with Brazilians and for fighters traveling there from the United States the crowd, distance, and strength of opponents make it hard to bet the underdogs especially if they’re up and coming inexperienced outsiders. However, Eric Spicely stand outs from the rest. First, he is a strong wrestler with a growing skill in BJJ. He has competed in the Ultimate Fighter and reach the semifinals. Antonio Carlos Junior won the Brazilian Ultimate fighter in scary fashion knocking out his opponents quickly and swiftly. But in fights where he has struggled to take opponents down he has shown strong weaknesses. Eric takedown defenses is excellent and his stamina is far superior. If he can last the first-round onslaught I really think he has a good shot at gassing Jr. and beating him. Junior has previously fought at Heavyweight and faces a huge cut for this fight, while Eric nearly walks around at the fight weight. The pressure of the Brazilian crown along with Erics calm and assortative approach is what I really think is going to push him to win as a underdog. This recent interview really showcases his character and strategy.

**Raphael Assunção 2.48** vs. Marlon Moraes  
  
Rapahael enters this bout with 29 fights under his belt. He’s had 1 loss since August 2011 and that was against TJ Dillasshaw (Currently Ranked #2). Marlon is making his UFC debut. Facing the Brazilian crowd against a Brazilian in Rio doesn’t exactly pass as a great way to start your UFC journey. Although Marlon looks good in his fights for the WSOF organization he will face an opponent who went 3 rounds with TJ. His balance, positioning, and technique look solid but nothing that would threaten the Brazilian in his home country. Undefeated since 2011 Marlon has a huge challenge ahead of him but most smart money will be on Raphael. The odds on this fight really don’t make a lot of sense unless I’m missing a injury or scandal of sorts.

nibbler666,nativespeaker,Berlin,"Regarding expletive infixation this was a misunderstanding. When I was writing, I was looking at your example sentence. As I had already written that the German language does not have a word that is grammatically as flexible as ""fucking"" I was referring to the rest of your sentence when I said that all other phenomena are no problem in German. But again I have to say that expletive infixation really pales in comparison with the tools that the German language provides for word composition, and these are used creatively when constructing new swearwords.

Regarding fuckwit: there are loads of expletives for people with low intelligence. Dumpfbacke, Blödbratz and Vollidiot are coming to my mind immediately, but if I spent a bit more time on it, I would easily come up with two dozens of these. Note that ""Vollidiot"" is way stronger than ""complete idiot"", which would be a literal translation. I think the reason why it sounds stronger is that we can add the syllable ""Voll-"" directly to the idot, making the ""Voll-"" an integral part of the ""Idiot"" (similar to the construction ""fuckwit""), instead of just modifying the ""Idiot"" by an adjective. ""Kompletter Idiot"" would be possible in principle, too, but it is not even half as strong as ""Vollidiot"".

Regarding your idea that there may be a cultural difference: on this general level, there are not really cultural differences between European countries. European cultures in general have co-evolved for more than a millennium, on all levels: economcally, art, literature, poetry, education, law, science, philosophy, politics, engineering, etc. Why on earth should there be any significant cultural difference when it comes to swearing?

Regarding the point of encapsulating various ideas efficiently, ultimately what applies to word creation in poetry applies to inventing expletives: it would be weird to assume that any European language would be less equipped to express complex poetic ideas than any other European language. There also is a second parallel here: poems are often impossible to translate in a precise way because poems encapsulate many ideas in a very dense way, using the specific devices of a particular language, but, of course, you can find highly complex poems in all European languages. Similarly, it is probably nearly impossible to find direct English equivalents to ""Dumpfbacke"" and ""Blödbratz"".

RoadHouseSwayzeTrain,,,"&gt;The UK pays more into the EU budget than it gets back.

&gt;In 2016 the UK government paid £13.1 billion to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was forecast to be £4.5 billion. So the UK’s ‘net contribution’ was estimated at about £8.6 billion.

&gt;Each year the UK gets an instant discount on its contributions to the EU—the ‘rebate’—worth almost £4 billion last year. Without it the UK would have been liable for £17 billion in contributions.

&gt;UK EU membership Fee 2016The UK doesn’t pay or ""send to Brussels"" this higher figure of £17 billion, or anything equivalent per week or per day. The rebate is applied straight away, so the UK never contributes this much.

&gt;The UK’s contributions to the budget vary from year to year. They’ve been larger recently than in previous decades.

&gt;UK payments to EU budget since 1973A membership fee isn’t the same as the economic cost or benefit

&gt;Being in the EU costs money but does it also create trade, jobs and investment that are worth more?

&gt;We can be pretty sure about how much cash we put in, but it’s far harder to be sure about how much, if anything, comes back in economic benefits.

&gt;£55 million a day doesn't include the rebate and is not based on recommended figures

&gt;The claim that the UK’s membership fee is £55 million a day comes from the £20 billion annual UK payment to EU institutions listed in the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) Pink Book. 

&gt;The ONS told us this isn’t the correct figure to use. It has another set of figures which actually represent official government payments, although this isn’t clear from the release.

&gt;The £20 billion figure includes payments to EU institutions by UK households, and so doesn’t represent what the government pays as a ‘membership fee’.

&gt;The Treasury has more up-to-date estimates than the ONS, and uses slightly different accounting methods. They show that the UK government paid in £13.1 billion in 2016.

&gt;We previously said that “it's reasonable to describe £55 million as our ‘membership fee’, but it ignores the fact that we get money back as well.”

&gt;This was based on the understanding that the rebate is paid up front and then sent back, which we now know is wrong.

&gt;£350 million a week doesn’t include the rebate but uses better figures

&gt;It’s also been claimed that we send £350 million a week to the EU. That also misses out the rebate, although is based on better figures for the UK’s contributions.

&gt;£350 million is what we would pay to the EU budget, without the rebate.

&gt;But the UK actually pays just under £250 million a week.

&gt;The UK Statistics Authority has said the EU membership fee figure of £19 billion a year, or £350 million a week, is ""not an amount of money that the UK pays to the EU each year"".

&gt;The UK gets money back

&gt;The government then gets some of that money back, mainly through payments to farmers and for poorer areas of the country such as Wales and Cornwall.

&gt;In 2016, the UK's ‘public sector receipts’ are forecast to be £4.5 billion.

&gt;So overall we paid in £8.6 billion more than we got back, or £24 million a day

Even if you could provide evidence that a majority of such children suffered, it'd be compelling (though not enough to say such pairings should be completely disallowed). Yes, there are many instances where a child suffers because of a parent's ignorance or ineptitude. How can you then condemn *all* parents because of it? Some children suffer due to a parent's alcoholism. Should all parents cease imbibing? Some children suffer because of a parent's work schedule. Should all parents remain at home? We could imagine a thousand such questions, but the answer to all of them would be of course not. *Only those individuals who are unable to overcome a specific challenge should avoid said challenge altogether.*

There are good parents and there are bad parents. Your framing of this issue completely discounts the individual. There are parents who can consume alcohol responsibly now and again and still raise happy, healthy (both physically and psychologically) children. There are parents who can balance work life and home life to ensure they are there for their children when they need it. So too are their parents who can prepare their children for the challenges and experiences unique to being of mixed racial heritage. You cannot deny that they exist and so you cannot argue against *all* pairings which could produce such a child. Your argument only extends to those interracial pairings where one or both individuals are unfit parents.

You guys pretty much ruined that by causing the Greek crisis to spread from Greece to the entire rest of the Eurozone. Some countries had (like Portugal) sound fundamentals and still went bankrupt once it was clear that there was a risk of EU institutional failure on the crisis management front. Other countries saw increased sovereign risk spreads, despite having stronger fundamentals than Germany (Finland, Holland, Lux). Still other countries had precariously large banking sectors, and started to see trouble as soon as it was clear that the Germans were prepared to actively interfere wit the EU's crisis-response mechanisms (Ireland, Cyprus).  

Overall, there isn't even one EZ country that wasn't affected by German mismanagement of the 2008 crisis. 

Brexit is largely a result of that. 

On the bright side though, what the Germans and Austrians did to bail out the east (while systematically undermining economic stability in the rest of europe).

I can fault Joseph and Brigham for a lot (lying, adultery, coercion, polyandry, etc., but not for the age of their brides. Despite the average age of marriage being close to 19 in 19th century america, puberty was generally recognized as the age of consent, or somewhere between the age of 10 and 12 (7 in Delaware, I believe). Lots of people you've heard of, and probably respect, slept with/married girls as young or younger than Joseph Smith and Brigham did. Here's some citation if you need it (not that it will sway your indignation, but what can I expect? You used to be Mormon after all. ;) ) 

“United States, the age of consent was much lower. For example, in New York, the age of consent was ten years until 1885. After 1885, age of consent laws changed around the country, reaching 16 in New York in 1889 and 18 in 1895. Prior to these changes the age of consent in most places in the United States was 10 or 12 years.” -Prostitution and Sex Work By Melissa Hope Ditmore page xxi [Introduction]

“To that end, from ancient times to the present, many societies have acted to try to safeguard children from rape and other forms of sexual degradation, though they might define sexual degradation differently from era to era and from place to place. One way societies have tried to protect young girls is through laws that designate a statutory age of consent. Such laws prohibit men from having sexual relations with females under a specified age on legal theory that they are too young and immature to make informed decision and, therefore, are incapable of giving a legal consent. Historically, the age of consent was set at 10 or 13 years, depending on the era and the culture, and tended to coincide with female puberty, which was also the age at which a female could marry without parental permission.” -Encyclopedia of Rape by Merril D.

“Traditionally, across the globe, the age of consent for sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of puberty, menstruation for a woman and pubic hair for a man.
Sir Edward Coke in 17th century England ‘made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a dower from her husband’s estate was 9. The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example Mary Hathaway of Virginia, was only 9 when she was married to William Williams. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss canons, initially set the age of consent at 10-12 years and then raised it to between 13 and 16 years in the second half of the 19th century. Historically, the English common law set the age of consent to range from 10- 12. In the United States, by the 1880s, most states set the age of consent at 10-12, and in one state Delaware, the age of consent was only 7. Social and resulting legal attitudes toward the appropriate age of consent have drifted upwards in modern times. For example while ages from 10 to 13 were typically acceptable in Western countries during the mid-19the century, the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century were marked by changing. I believe that a lot of our current mores come from reluctance to let our children mature mentally as quickly as our bodies do. Keep in mind that not all societies share Western mores. And to my surprise, until the latter part of the 19th Century, Children in the Western nations were engaged and married at a much earlier age. The trend to give children more time to mature is relatively new. In his book, The Emphatic civilization, (Penguin, NY, 200) Jeremy Rifkin points out that the concept of adolescence only emerged during the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of the twentieth century. Society started to think of childhood as extending beyond puberty, into the later teenage years. Before that, children were considered to graduate into adulthood with the onset of puberty.” -What’s Wrong in America: A Look at Troublesome Issues in Our Country By Arthur Siccan

“1275 English common law criminalizes statutory rape- sex between a man and a woman below the age of consent, which was first set at 12 years. 1576 Common Law age of consent lowered to 10 years. 1700s-1800s Statutory rape at common law adopted in the united states. States set the age of consent at 10 or 12 years.” -ABA [American Bar Association] Journal Aug 1996 page 87

“In Medieval and early modern European societies, the age of marriage remained low, with documented cases of brides as young as seven years, although marriages were typically not consummated until the girl reached puberty (Bullough 2004). Shakespeare’s Juliet was just 13, and there is no hint in the play that this was considered to be exceptional. The situation was similar on the other side of the Atlantic; Bullough reports the case in 1689 of a nine-year-old bride in Virginia. At the start of the nineteenth century in England, it was legal to have sex with a 10 year-old girl.” -Internet Child Pornography: Causes, Investigation, and Prevention By Richard Wortley, Stephen Smallbon page 10

Quanto a ser devias procurar melhor, segundo a American Psychological Association:

&gt; A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.
&gt; According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as ""gender identity disorder.""

TitaniumDragon,,,"&gt; spree shootings are a very good reason in my opinion, it is as simple as that. But that's just another drop in the bucket right? The perpetrator would have just run them over or stabbed them.

Rampage killings where someone goes postal in some public/semi-public space are extremely rare. I understand that you are pretty uneducated about the world, being a typical European, but spree shootings only happen a few times a year. Last year, for instance, the US had three rampage killings. In a country of 320 million people. There were two in 2015. There's been one so far this year.

They're not a major problem and their contribution to the homicide rate is negligible. Freaking out over them is stupid.

&gt; you don't need

It isn't about needing, it is about wanting. Moreover, people use weapons for self defense which are appropriate for such, generally speaking.

&gt; Please also elaborate on the 'cultural reasons' for owning operational guns.

Uh, people own them because it is a part of their culture? That's what a cultural reason is. Guns are a traditional part of American culture.

As the saying goes, God made man, but Sam Colt made him equal.

&gt; Guns are, by their very nature harmful - they are explicitly made to kill things or else they might as well fire pieces of chocolate.

Guns are not ""by their very nature harmful"". They are tools and weapons, and highly useful ones at that.

You know the saying, guns don't kill people, people kill people?

It's true.

Firearm ""accidents"" are actually firearm negligence. When people murder each other, it isn't because guns send out mind control waves, it is because they are worthless human garbage who deal with their problems with violence.

Guns are inanimate objects. They don't *do* anything a human doesn't tell them to do.

&gt; how do you know this? You don't, nobody does. Just like nobody knows who's going to run someone over. The difference is cars are essential to many people, guns simply aren't.

Statistics. Most people with guns never commit a crime with them. In fact, the overwhelming majority of people who own guns never use them for unlawful purposes.

This is fact.

&gt; The fact that literally every other civilised country in the world gets along quite fine with hardline gun control laws, have lower homicide figures per capita

White people in the US have the same homicide rate as every other ""civilized country"" despite having vastly more guns. Moreover, gun ownership rates *do not correlate with homicide rates* within the United States.

You have repeatedly ignored this point. Willfully.

*There is no correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates on a state by state basis.*

Your hypothesis is that gun ownership is what drives the US's high homicide rate. And yet, when we actually *test* this hypothesis, with *actual data*, it doesn't hold up.

Make_Krieg_Not_Liebe,,,"&gt; O problema é que a parada era toda falsa, era só uma mentira, um projeto de faz de conta... nao existia demanda por aquilo e nao existia capacidade tecnica pra produzir algo.

Discordo de você nesse ponto. Embora é claro que nem todos estudantes que ingressam em um projeto e aprendem uma técnica nova vão se tornar mestres nisso ou lançar no mercado um produto revolucionário, continua sendo uma atividade extracurricular que melhora o currículo e permite que o estudante desenvolva novas habilidades. Me parece que você teve uma experiência muito negativa acerca disso, talvez por culpa da sua universidade. Embora eu não posso dizer que tudo que acontece na minha é 100%, tenho um colega que poderia ter viajado para o Uruguai apresentar um projeto, se tivesse dinheiro.

&gt;Que é a mesma coisa do que eu disse acima, masturbação mental com dinheiro publico. O pessoal se reune, nada produtivo é gerado. Lembro que o pessoal ficou tipo 3 anos fazendo uma animacao 3d de uma bailarina que girava... alugaram equipamento super caro pra fazer motion capture, fizeram um escarceu e gastaram uma grana fudida pra no fim sair um gif que gira escroto pra caralho, porque no fim das contas ninguem tinha capacidade tecnica para aquilo.

Não posso falar muito acerca disso pois não sou bolsista de iniciação científica e não conheço muito sobre, mas ainda assim é uma oportunidade de melhorar habilidades profissionais.

&gt;Que legal, o coitado do seu zé dono da quitanda tem que pagar pro filho do Dr Machado, estudante de federal, fazer viagem pra apresentar projetos de mentirinha.

Esse argumento pode ser usado para qualquer situação nas universidades públicas. Não importa. O dinheiro da educação é para a educação. Se não fosse usado custeando viagens, seria usado de outra forma.

&gt;Voce precisa fazer estagio pra concluir o curso técnico, nao entendi essa... é obvio que todos que se formam tem estagio, pois é obrigatorio estagio pra se formar.

O estágio é obrigatório para se formar, isso é correto. Porém, conseguir um estágio não é uma corrida espacial. Tem um prazo de 2 anos para concluir um estágio de 6 meses e pegar o diploma do MEC. O que eu quis dizer é que é muito mas fácil para um estudante desses conseguir um emprego(e eu falei que nem todos saem como estagiários, muito são efetivados) do que um estudante que tem uma base fraca e estuda em uma universidade sem renome.

&gt;Ninguem vai la porque pensa que os alunos sao ""Brilhantes, e nos precisamos contratar esses caras magnifico""... é só um jeito gratuito de promover a sua empresa/projeto.

Concordo que é um jeito de promover a empresa. Entretanto, a qualidade do profissional é um dos principais motivos da empresa querer palestrar lá e não em outra escola. Afinal, existem muitas universidades.

&gt;Voce abre uma vaga de empresa aparecem 6 mil candidatos, a faculdade se torna um jeito facil de filtrar... como eu falei, o cara que passou em um vestibular concorrido provavelmente nao é um debil mental, mas nao tem nada a ver com a instituicao ter uma qualidade de ensino superior... voce só ta usando o vestibular que o cara já fez pra adiantar o processo seletivo da sua empresa.

Concordo em partes. Mas como isso é uma prática tão corriqueira, pode-se argumentar que os graduados e graduandos de faculdades de renome preenchem bem as vagas das empresas, e essa estratégia de escolha funciona.

IMO, Amsterdam weed culture has some caveats, as the novelty of exclusive 'legality' wears off. Some comments.

 * still overwhelmingly a combustion city, as well as lots of tobacco smoke. Call me weird, but i'm an all in vaporent. Smoke bothers me, even weed smoke. Going into any coffeeshop means you have to deal with some more of tobacco smoke.
 * With few exceptions, it's still a grungy weed buying experience. They have a lot to learn from American weed shops that offer a better and classier buying experience. I hit one shop recently that seemed pretty hipstery and new, but the rest were still a time warp back to the 90's. 
 * weed selection is pretty good. Some different strains over there, some the same classics you've had locally. it's like wine - you got a new country, there are some labels you might recognize, and a few that don't make it to export. It's fun to try some new stuff.
 * I feel like generally, weed quality is better in the US. This is a *GROSS* generalization I admit, but I'm saying that if you buy 10 random strains there at average places and do the same in a US shop, the US weed is better.
 * it's not exactly cheap for weed. Economy of scale is kicking in stateside, which is driving down prices.
 * edibles/oils/other products are in a completely different league in the states. You can find some edibles, but not nearly the selection as in the US. 
 * well, easy mushrooms are a big attraction for some!
 * not qualified to talk concentrates, but they are readily available.

I love Amsterdam and recommend it to anyone. I just think it's going to change significantly over the next few years, as the novelty of going there for weed will wear off.

Even though LGBT people don't have rights (cos the countries are straight-oriented, and the governments don't give a shit), you'll still lead a pleasant life of probable acceptance, even if you can't get married.  
  
On the second-largest continent, called Koraesta, it's highly regional. In the east (near Aysta), they'll have the same attitude as the Aystans: LGBT don't have rights, but nobody cares.  
In the west, it's not an issue, but just don't expect to be welcomed with open arms. The younger generation's more tolerant, but the older generation isn't.  
  
In the northern regions, you're gonna run into some issues. If you even hold hands with the same sex, you're gonna get beat up, and one country deems it illegal and will prison you, like what almost happened to the only bisexual character I've wrote in my story.  
  
The south, on the other hand, are very open about it, and LGBT people over there have most, and if not, all, their rights. If you're gay, living there's the equivalent of living in western Europe, basically - most will accept you, and a lot of places have given you all your rights.  
  
On the smallest continent we visit in the story (called Doristia), they have a very conservative attitude to everything. Women are treated unfairly, interracial marriages are outlawed, and gays have a pretty tough time.
Remember the bi character I mentioned earlier? Well, he's in one of the capital cities, names Acias, for ages, and develops a secret relationship with another man. Long story short, the other man can't resist and kisses my ""MC"" (there are no real main characters in my story) on the lips in a public square, causing both of them to get pinned to the ground and executed on the spot. One of them gets killed in front of his lover, and the other one manages to escape and runs the fuck out of there.  
  
The worst place are the Independent Islands, however. That place is a combination of Saudi Arabia and Chechnya for gay people - it's common for LGBT people (and foreigners if they go to the wrong place) to get sent to correction camps, and if that fails, they get tortured to death, basically.

They are about the same number as a proportion of the Armenians in the South Caucasus before the conflict, and as a proportion of the people living in Armenia and Artsakh today.

But they are not ghettoised or politically instrumentalised in the same way by Armenia.

Thanks for letting us know that we're trash. Mitt Romney made the same mistake and lost the 2012 election but that's neither here nor there. Still, I use these shitty public services with the clearest of consciences. 

There's a lot going on in this comment and the cynicism is just a little too edgy for me. The modern conception of the welfare state is built upon the idea that the richer and more successful you are, the more you are required to contribute to the system that enabled your success and hopefully assist those less fortunate to move upwards as well. Particularly because wealth begets wealth... that's why there's an inheritance tax and a progressive code to discourage hoarding of wealth at the top 1% and hopefully keep inequality in check. And not only does wealth beget wealth but it also begets power. Marcos, Aquino, Poe, Pacquiao... ring any bells?

Just because someone *needs* it is a great reason why it should be free and/or easily accessible. Our entire society is better off when there aren't hordes of beggars in the streets on some Hunger Games shit. I would say that your mentality leads to people literally living in cemeteries and surviving off actual trash, but oh wait, that actually happens in the Philippines. I was worried that I was strawmanning your position, but unfortunately I'm not. I'm proud of being Filipino but am in no rush to live a society with that disgusting of a wealth gap. This kind of ""fuck you poors, I've got mine"" mentality is partly why the Philippines is such a mess. Give the beggars some food and put them in school and maybe we can see ourselves out of this mess.

You... are aware that there's this crazy, mythical place called Europe, right? Obviously the different countries have different types of welfare systems but on the whole, they've got socialized education, healthcare, subsidized housing, paid family leave, etc. and people still work hard. France and Germany even have free university! In the UK you can go to the doctor, have open heart surgery, and leave without paying a cent! And they feel safe knowing that if shit hits the fan and they lose everything, they'll at least never be denied essential healthcare or assistance for food and housing. If welfare discouraged work, Europe would be a lot shittier than it is now. It ain't perfect, but it's better than having the poors die in the street. 

America has one of the worst social safety nets in the developed world, but I'm damn glad we at least have what little that we do. I pray that our government comes to their senses and begins to truly create ""free"" healthcare, ""free"" education, generous retirement and unemployment benefits, etc. I'm well aware it ain't actually free and I expect you, Mr. 1%, to contribute way more in taxes than someone in the bottom 50%. And if I'm so lucky to one day become financially successful, I'll happily pay my fair share because that is part of living in a just society.

I mean do we include EU citizens who've lived and worked in the UK for decades and want to keep living here as British for these pensions, what about ex-pats who draw an EU pension?

How much will the civil service cost be to register this system, manage the pension fund, and the payouts?

It is a photo of three artisans, yes.

If you examine each artisan closely, you will note that it is a heavily caricatured sculpt of a gentleman with a monocle, mustache, jacket, vest and bowtie. These accoutrements have historically been used to characterize a person from the upper-class of society in late 19th to early 20th century western culture.

The monocle itself was often used as a comedic device worn by an upper-class gentleman who expresses shock at some event, ostensibly affecting his delicate sensibilities, which in turn results in the aforementioned eyepiece falling out, sometimes into a drink.

An Earl is a title of nobility in European countries with historically monarchical societies, often associated with a position of wealth and power. Therefore, one can assume that someone with the title of an Earl is often from the upper-class demographic of society. 

Artisans are often used in the Esc key position on a keyboard. While this may vary based on personal taste, and many fans of artisans employ them more liberally in other areas of the keyboard, one often finds photos of keyboards with a single artisan, typically color-matched to the keyset, on the Esc key location.

Putting these items together, gives you an explanation of the title, which is a play on words, typical of the humor many of us have come to love about /u/BingeCaps, the artisan that made this post....

""Each Earl"" &lt; each of the artisans, whose name begins with Earl, a title of nobility

""Esc""  &lt; part of the artisan name, and the traditional placement of the subject on a keyboard

""Exemplifies the Upper Echelon"" &lt;  the subject of the sculpt is wearing garb typically representative of an upper-class member of society in the late 19th century

just_some_Fred,,,"Unnamed officials like John Brennan? God, what was his name again... I feel like he was someone important. 

Russia stands to gain more power. Putin wants to put the USSR back together again, and with the EU and US standing together he will have a lot more trouble doing so. Trump has waffled on his support for Ukraine and NATO, and Putin benefits from that. He also benefits from the US losing stature internationally, because US backed sanctions are hurting Russia. If the US starts to lose influence, it gets easier to convince individual countries to go against sanctions. It's the same reason he backed LePen in France, the weaker the EU is the stronger Russia can be. 

As far as borders go, again, it's down to waning US authority, moral authority in this case. When the US stops accepting Syrian refugees, Russia can point out what hypocrites we are, and it causes more unrest in refugee camps, and in countries hosting refugees. They can say they are backing stability in Syria, and that the US isn't helping anyone. This makes it easier for extremists to pitch their message to displaced Muslims. It doesn't matter that Russia isn't accepting refugees, or that they're working to destabilize the region, or supporting Syrian death camps. It still gets framed as the US/the West vs Islam. 

And his border policies don't actually make us safer. They just make us more stupid and reactionary. Banning all Muslims was his campaign speech, and then he gives out orders to ban Muslims. That gives another talking point in the Us vs Them rhetoric that extremists love. Most terrorist attacks carried out in America come from US citizens. Refugees have never carried out a terror attack.

And then there's the pants on head retardation that is the southern border wall. It costs more to put it up than the actual illegal Mexican immigrants cost to our services. Plus we're at the lowest numbers of illegal immigrants across the southern border we've had since the 90s. From Mexico particularly we have *negative* immigration. That means we'd be trapping people inside if we put up the fucking wall. It costs a stupid amount, it doesn't solve any problems, and it addresses an issue where the existing policies are actually working. 

Russia doesn't care whether our military is strong or not, they never plan to confront us militarily. We're both nuclear powers, so direct confrontation is way too risky. Plus our military was the strongest in the world by a long shot, there isn't any reason to strengthen it further. So long as we keep modernizing our ships and planes our military will stay the strongest. We don't need to push anything there, because we are already set up on a plan that keeps us on top. 

And for your final point, we absolutely should export more natural gas, especially to Europe to undercut Russian exports. Unfortunately there isn't anything in place to allow us to export anything on the scale where we can compete with Russian LNG in Europe, we don't have the tankers, and there aren't the port facilities to support them if we did have them. Russia needs to be starved until Putin is no longer in charge there. Direct military action is stupid, but we can and should keep up our economic warfare against them.

Djerid,,,"you know what, I have a copypasta I use when I want to recommend the series. so here you go:

S&amp;W is one of the ""least-anime"" anime I've ever watched and it's all the better and more unique for it:
It rarely breaks visual style. Artshifts, visual audio cues, and stereotypical anime indicators such as cross veins or the ""giant sweat drop"" are pretty much nowhere to be found. The only visual break I can recall off the top of my head involves some dotted-line whiskers and it happens exactly once.

It has nudity without it being the focus of the series, and the nudity is tasteful, confined to only a few scenes (apart from the OP&amp;ED) and is actually used as character establishment: She isn't naked to titillate the viewer, but to establish her pride in her looks and total lack of modesty. Once that's established, she puts clothes on and stays covered for nearly the entire remainder of the series.

The soundtrack, apart from the OP &amp; ED, is period-correct, fairly sedate, and phenomenal. Rather than using modern riffs or massively overwrought orchestral scores, S&amp;W's simple strings, woodwinds, and drums perfectly fit the show's world.

The setting is fairly unique to the medium. Magic is extremely low-key and the ficitonal middle-ages Europe-esque environment is very grounded and believable.

The English Dub breaks entirely away from cutesy or moe voices and everyone sounds appropriate for their age. Kids sound like kids. Adults sound like adults.

All of the above make it unique without necessarily making the series good, but what makes it great for those that enjoy it is the writing. Simply put, Spice &amp; Wolf has some of the best character writing and banter, one of the most endearing lead couples in anime, and one of the strongest, most nuanced and layered female leads in fiction of any medium.

There's an astounding level of conflict and duality to Holo's character; The fading spotlight on her centuries-long position as a local revered-and-feared Goddess has left her paradoxically proud yet insecure, independent yet lonely, and strong yet needy. She very frequently only thinks she knows exactly what she wants, and she hides everything behind a flirty playfulness that sometimes edges just close enough to her actual emerging desires to make her uncomfortable.

In less-capable hands, Holo could easily come off as cartoonishly bipolar or as the wildly tsundere archetype all too common to anime, but there's a subtlety to her, a self-awareness, that many fictional characters lack. She realizes her own faults and when she pushes things too far or says something she doesn't necessarily mean. Likewise, she also has the capacity to see the same flaws in others and has the maturity to accept them rather than react in a toxic manner. Whenever you expect an ""anime heroine"" to do the tsundere thing and get angry (and possibly 'comically' violent) Holo will keep her composure, admit to a misunderstanding, and voice her disapproval hand-in-hand with her forgiveness. And maybe a slight leg pinch.

Lawrence, who I've yet to mention, takes a while to develop. Until he figures out Holo's games and starts to keep up with her near the end of season 1, he very frequently appears as if he's just ""dragged along for the ride"" but he's one of the most believable, stronger-willed male leads in romantic anime. He isn't perfect in love nor in his chosen profession, and regularly makes mistakes. However, he also isn't oblivious or a simple tag-along doormat. From the very get-go he is adamant about not letting Holo walk all over him, despite her clearly wanting to do exactly that. As he gets used to her companionship and comes to terms with his affection for her, he does a much better job growing as a character.

Rather than hinging on a single turning point or ""love epiphany"" that comes at the end of a lot of romance stories, both of the leads are obviously in a blossoming romance from nearly the point at which they meet. Every interaction, every playful exchange, serves only to further their relationship to each other and build upon their mutual attraction.

All that being said, a viewer has to love character banter to be able to enjoy the series. The economics bits, while mildly interesting, aren't tremendously compelling and usually only serve to give mini-arcs to the story and to push and challenge Lawrence and Holo in new ways. There's minimal action and pretty much no over-arching story. There's just Holo and Lawrence, and I wouldn't prefer it any other way.

I did not claim to provide translations. These were just three words that came to my mind. You can easily google more. ""Dumpfbacke"" can be cute, but only if the context allows so. ""Vollidiot"" comes very close to ""Arschloch"". If you want stronger stuff, feel free to create words like ""Dummfotze"" yourself.

Of course, there are cultural differences between European countries. I lived in the UK for more than 7 years and I am well aware of differences between the political systems. You will always find differences if you look at the details. But if you spend a longer time outside Europe, you will notice how similar European countries actually are (also in comparison with non-European English-speaking countries, even though these have obviously other things in common). 

For our topic, differences in cultural details are pretty irrelevant because we are talking about a very basic aspect of language, namely creative ways to express negative feelings. You statement is akin to saying that other European languages lack certain poetic devices or lack a certain capability of expressing positive feelings, such as love, for example.

[This] (http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/historical_emissions.png) is the actual image you should be referring to, to explain why developing and developed countries have different responsibilities under the existing framework. It's only fair that countries who have contributed the most to the problem also have to take on a bigger role in fixing it. And by the way, this image only further demonstrates why it's such a big deal that the US is renegging its international community. The EU is stepping up to do its share, but the US going rogue like this is just criminal. And it's something the rest of the world will not forget. 
&amp;nbsp;

Which is not to say China's not acting in its self interest when it defends the agreement, they are but only in the sense that they are very much bankrolling a lot of today's developments in clean energy technology, so they stand to gain massively by exporting clean tech to the rest of the world. And they get to clean up the absolutely toxic levels of air pollution they've been experiencing and which have been causing a lot of social unrest in the process. So double win. Is that something we should be shaming them for? It's the kind of ""smart business"" sense that would otherwise be revered in American culture. And lot of developed countries in Europe, like Germany, got on the clean tech train very early on as well. It wouldn't be too late for the US to get with the programme.

KeithKenkade,moderator,Dawn of Victory,"The presence of an alien terraforming agent on Earth in the 1930s dominated world affairs and prevented Germany from enacting the worst elements of its anti-Semitic agenda. 

During the First Scinfaxi War most of the upper-Nazi leadership was killed including Hitler. Following the war much of Europe had been occupied and governed by the Wehrmacht as it was the last major organization on the continent capable of maintaining order. 

Various groups within the Wehrmacht and Germany moved to consolidate their power during this time resulting in a shadow war between remaining Nazi officials and the SS on one side, and a cadre of anti-Nazi military officers as well as the Abwehr on the other. Elements of the Wehrmacht were split between each camp, but eventually the anti-Nazi side prevailed. 

Most of Europe remained directly governed under the German Reich over fears that in Europe’s weakened state any established puppet government might be susceptible to manipulation and control by the Soviet Union. 
Over time, integrating the various ethnic groups of Europe into the German Reich became a necessity and accommodations were made to accomplish this. Over time this evolved into a policy where the very word “German” was redefined to be a set of core values rather than an ethnic group of its own. 

I’m well aware that including Nazi Germany in any work of fiction makes it a lightning rod for criticism. I really didn’t want to include any Nazi stuff in the “current era” of the Dawn of Victory universe so hopefully I’ve provided a reasonable enough explanation for how it changed over time.

Eskaminagaga,,,"Unfortunately, spiders themselves cannot be used to create any decent amount of thread. For one thing, they are cannibalistic and like to eat each other when placed in close quarters. Also, the orb weaving spiders (the ones that create the strongest type of fiber) can create 7 different types of silk and only really one of them is useful as far as strength properties go, so you have to literally [incapacitate a spider and manually draw the silk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLSGBQUA8l0) to get the correct fiber from them. And, even if you do that, you would need [over a million spiders](https://www.wired.com/2009/09/spider-silk/) to create anything useful as around 30,000 of them are needed to create a single gram of spider silk. Not really scalable.

Now, that being said, artificial and transgenic spider silks are being created and industrialized as we speak. There are many companies and universities that are developing it and are on the cusp of commercialization using various vectors to achieve spider silk production via genetic editing of various organisms. These vectors can produce 2 things directly: spider silk protein powder and spider silk threads. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

The spider silk protein powder is created by genetically altered bacteria, yeast, and goats that produce the proteins in their milk. The goats are inefficient, producing only about 2 grams of protein powder per liter of milk. Also, the goats take a long time to breed, so expanding production with this method is very slow going. The bacteria is more efficient, but the preferred bacteria, E.coli, can't store very long gene sequences, so need to be truncated to produce slightly inferior proteins and need to grow in a vat to make enough protein to be usable. The yeast method is the best protein method as it uses yeasts like *Pichia pastoris* that are able to store and transfer longer gene segments efficiently and accurately. The yeast also will reproduce much more efficiently with much cheaper “fuel” (mainly sugar water) to create much higher quality proteins than the bacteria method. Both the bacteria and yeast method have a very short gestation time, so any gene “tweaks” can be done to vary the properties of the proteins for custom applications. 

After they get the protein powder, they can then mix it with other substances to change their properties, turn it into a foam or film, or spin it into a fiber. Unfortunately, the mechanical spinning techniques such as wet spinning and electrospinning are still lacking and cannot spin fibers strong enough to measure up to natural dragline spider silks, but they are still being developed and I think it is only a matter of time before this issue is overcame.

The spider silk fibers can be directly created by genetically altering silkworms. These silkworms get various strains of spider DNA injected into them and they can naturally spin different types of fibers. This method allows them to create much stronger fibers than the protein method, but it takes a longer gestation time and a lot of mulberry and space to expand production. Also, since you are directly producing the fibers with this method, it would be more costly if you wanted to create foams or films that can be made with the protein method.

Now for the major companies creating the silks:

**[Bolt Threads](https://boltthreads.com)** is a San Francisco based company using transgenic yeast to create proteins that they spin into fibers for textiles. They have already released a limited production of [spider silk ties](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelarthur/2017/03/10/bolt-threads-is-launching-its-first-bioengineered-spider-silk-product-at-sxsw-a-necktie/#bca5baf4d13f) and are working with Patagonia to create more textiles from their silks down the road.

**[Spiber](https://www.spiber.jp/en)** Is a Japan based company that uses bacteria to make their protein powder that they plan to use in [automobiles](http://newatlas.com/lexus-paris-2016-concepts/45466/) and spin into textiles. They are working with Goldwin, the main producer for The North Face Japan, to create jacked called the [Moon Parka](http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2015/10/20/moon-parka-outerwear-made-from-synthetic-spider-silk/) that should hopefully be out this winter. 

**[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories](http://www.kraiglabs.com/)** is a Michigan based company that uses transgenic silkworms to create spider silk threads directly. They are currently fulfilling a [contract with the army to create bulletproof material](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/07/19/us-army-eyes-dragon-silk-for-bullet-proof-vests.html) at small scale and are hoping to open a [large scale sericulture facility in Vietnam](http://ipaquangnam.gov.vn/eng/tin-tuc-chi-tiet/lanh-dao-ubnd-tinh-tiep-va-lam-viec-voi-lanh-dao-cong-ty-kraig-biocraft-laboratories-hoa-ky.html) in the near future to start mass production of their fibers for use in textiles.

**[AMSilk](https://www.amsilk.com/home/)** is a German based company that uses transgenic E.coli to produce protein that currently is being used in [cosmetics](http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Business-Financial/AMSilk-and-Rahn-enter-European-distribution-deal-for-silk-biopolymers) and can be used in [medical applications](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20140129/AMSilk-completes-preclinical-testing-of-proprietary-silicone-breast-implant-coating.aspx). They are also working with Adidas to produce a [spider silk sneaker](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/compost-adidas-spider-silk-shoe/) that should be out in the near future.

&gt;Several major articles appeared in the mainstream in 2013 on money laundering in the artworld.     A
search on “art market money laundering” gives us a surprisingly long list, and on the first page of the
search we find articles at the New York Times, Forbes, and—perhaps most surprisingly—USA Today.

&gt;Although most of these articles are written as spin or damage control, some of them are relatively hard-
hitting.  For example, the one at [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2013/11/17/is-art-a-criminal-enterprise/3575107/) ends like this:

&gt;*Because there are few widows and orphans in the art market, there appears to be little need or public outcry to fix the system. Who is hurt? Nobody but artists who fail to willingly or adroitly play the game. And, perhaps, the
culture itself, surrendering art to drug lords, oligarchs, money launderers and international vulgarians, and forcing
the rest of us to admire what we might, given more rational values, disdain.*

GarlicAftershave,,,"Man, this is a big crunchy question with all sorts of nuance. I like it.

First- we should talk about capability vs intent, and things like deterrence. The USSR had the capability to wipe out the US, but didn't have the intent (*for the most part*) to do so as the aggressor. (Doubtless they had war plans for contingencies, just as the US did.) 

Part of this requires us to recognize that we're talking about a ~50 year time frame. Between ~1947 and 1953, for instance, Stalin was increasingly bellicose and aggressive and possibly unstable. In these years it's pretty easy to argue that Stalin *was* the Soviet Union, for all intents and purposes, as what he said *went*. At that time the Stalin might've had the desire (i.e. intent) to destroy the US, but never had the capability to do so without suffering unacceptable losses. Even Stalin could be deterred by those.

Post-Stalin, the USSR was directly involved in a [lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956#Soviet_intervention_of_4_November) of [bloodshed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia) and [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Crisis_of_1961) than one [provocation](http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis) which could've resulted in full-scale nuclear war, but probably never had the political will or desire to destroy the US outright, and in any case were still deterred by threat of massive retaliation. 

Terrorists, when we talk about the modern concept, by and large have the intent to kill as many US citizens as possible but so far have lacked the means to do so in a way that presents an existential threat to the US. Even their biggest single success, and all that followed, was barely a pinprick in terms of US blood spilled and economy disrupted. The big problem is that nobody has found a means of deterring terrorists who are willing to die in the process of achieving their goals. So there will be more attacks, sure, but for the foreseeable future they won't amount to much. They don't have WMDs pointed at the US, ready to launch at the turn of a figurative key.

http://www.alternet.org/media/anti-islam-author-ayaan-hirsi-alis-latest-deception

&gt;In May 2006, the Dutch television program Zembla thoroughly debunked the dramatic story Hirsi Ali had told to advance her career, concluding that Hirsi Ali had sold the Dutch public “a story full of obscurities.”

&gt;Born Ayaan Hirsi Magam, she migrated to the Netherlands in 1992, changed her name to Hirsi Ali, and lied to Dutch authorities about her past. Contrary to the story she told the government, she arrived in the Netherlands not from war-torn Somalia, but from Kenya, where she lived in a secure environment and under the protection of the United Nations, which funded her education at a well-regarded Muslim girls’ school. Though she told immigration authorities and the Dutch public she had fled from civil war in Somalia, she left that country before its war broke out. Indeed, she did not live through a war there or anywhere else. Thanks to her fabrications, Hirsi Ali received political asylum in just five weeks.

&gt;Hirsi Ali told astonished audiences on Dutch talk shows that her supposedly devout family had forced her to marry a draconian Muslim man, that she had not been present at her own wedding, and that her family had threatened to kill her for offending their religious honor. However, Zembla told a drastically different story. Hirsi Ali’s brother, aunt and former husband each testified that she had indeed been present at her wedding. It turned out that Hirsi Ali’s mother had sent her brother to a Christian school, not exactly an indication of Islamic fanaticism.

&gt;“Yeah, I made up the whole thing,” Hirsi Ali admitted on camera to a Zembla reporter who confronted her with her lies. “I said my name was Ayaan Hirsi Ali instead of Ayaan Hirsi Magan. I also said I was born in 1967 while I was actually born in 1969.”

&gt;Hirsi Ali’s claim of honor killing threats also appears to be empty; she remained in touch with her father and aunt after she left her husband. In fact, her husband even came to visit her in the Dutch refugee center where she lived after leaving him. Even though he had paid her way to Europe on the grounds that she would join him in Canada, Hirsi Ali’s husband consented to the divorce she sought. (Watch the full Zembla program on Hirsi Ali.)

Let's break this down: she was ""lying"" about being from a war torn region because she actually came from Kenya, where she was staying under the care of the UN. OK... so why was she under the care of the United Nations in Kenya? Because she was a Somalian refugee, perhaps?

-Rust,,,"&gt; but the elections wasn't influenced those leaks contained information of where hillary stood in some issues. think of them as newspaper.

It absolutely *was* influenced. It doesn't matter if they contained real information or not. They deliberately only released the information Hillary and not on the GOP targets they hacked. Had they released the hacked GOP materials, we would have been discussing the content of both, not just the content of the DNC's e-mails. That's influence. It dictates the conversation and the propaganda that surrounds it.

&gt;how can you even prove that russia favor trump in the election when we already discussed that there is no proof?

Because we *haven't* discussed there is no proof. You're just a liar. I already offered you the evidence. It doesn't magically go away because you're incredibly dishonest.

&gt; obama had that type of communication with different countries and was looking to establish one with russia that is a fact. 

Complete and utter bullshit. **I *dare* you find a single instance of Obama  using a *complete civilian with no knowledge of foreign policy*, to setup a line of communication with Russia (or any other country) *using Russian facilities and equipment to leave our intelligence community unaware*, and doing so *before he assumed office*.** You can't. You're full of shit.

&gt; and if you are going to rig and election you have to have influence, i mean are you really clinging to something so trivial as the way he explained it?

1. But you can influence an election without rigging it it. Pay attention. Rigging implies influence, but influence doesn't imply rigging. Again, rigging is guaranteeing an outcome. Nobody said Russia did that. We're saying the influenced it.

2. The only one clinging to something here is you. Your argument is awful. Even if Obama had said that Russia couldn't influence the election (and he didn't)... that wouldn't change the facts! All that would mean was that Obama was wrong then, not that the influence never happened. 

&gt; yes they have evidence that people accessed the server, what they don't have evidence of is who did it. so they decided to go with the red scare. so what they are doing is someone punched you in a room full of people, you don't know who, so you decide to punch everyone and hope that one of those was the one that hit you, and blame your actions on them claiming they were going to rob you

Not even close to true. They have evidence of who did the hacking because hacking leaves traces. There are access logs, intercepted communications, etc. Read the report. 

In fact, Putin just today admitted that it could have been ""patriotic Russians"" who did the hacking precisely because he knows he can't deny it was Russia (but wants to pretend the government wasn't involved):

""A sua boca vale o preço pra perder o sossego que eu tinha... A lua até beijou o mar para não ficar de vela. Os quatro perdidos de amor: Eu Você o Mar e Ela"", escreve o artista na legenda da fotografia.

O cantor que é alvo de muitas críticas mostra-se à vontade com o corpo e optou pelo nudismo sem problemas.

De recordar que, o cantor lançou no ano passado, o videoclip da música ‘Tequila’. No vídeo, que conta com mais de um milhão de visualizações, o artista dançou ao estilo de Beyoncé com vários fatos e em cenários bizarros.

En sciences biologiques la coutume qui m'apparaît c'est de définir un problème, une question scientifique précise, genre ""Comment le comportement hydrique d'un arbre répond à la sècheresse"", ensuite on fait un peu de biblio (via scholar et autre plateforme), on récupère les articles scientifique (en commençant par des revues qui compilent plusieurs article et offrent une synthèse). Pour les questions d'ordres très générals, on se réfère à des livres (toutes ces ressources ne coûtent rien quand on connaît les bonnes adresses ""pirates"" en ligne).

Chaque article lu personnellement j'en fait une synthèse dans un tableur pour pouvoir retrouver facilement la référence, je formule un ""take home message"" très court de l'article, je développe les points essentiels de la conclusion et condense les parties techniques (matériels et méthodes).
J'ai des amis qui ont eu recours à des mails et rendez-vous téléphonique/skype avec des auteurs qui publient régulièrement sur leur sujet, je trouve que c'est une très bonne méthode de renseignement sur un sujet.

Une fois la première bibliographie réalisée, on établit un programme expérimental en essayant d'être original sur les réponses qu'on souhaite trouver à la question scientifique. On fait l'expérience puis l'analyse des données, et ensuite normalement on sort un papier. Durant tout le cour de ce travail la veille informationnelle est très importante, il faut surveiller quotidiennement les papiers qui sortent sur le sujet entre temps, lors des moments perdus on peut toujours rechercher d'autre sources intéressantes pour la question fondamentale qui aurait pus nous échapper (car le silence bibliographique (des articles qu'on a raté) est toujours plus vicieux que le bruit bibliographique (des articles sortis sans intérêt pour nous) comme j'aime à penser). Et du coup à force de lire et de rechercher, on finit par acquérir un background suffisant pour être assez pertinent sur la problématique.

Bref c'est un pavé, j'espère que ça t'éclaire. Concrètement, on se pose une question, on lit la bibliographie, on regarde comment d'autres on répondus à une question proche etc, ça donne des idées pour l'expérimentation, et à partir de là on obtient les réponses, sachant qu'on part sans à priori sur ces réponses à la base.

Par exemple on veut comprendre la réponse des transporteurs de métaux végétaux face à une contrainte au plomb, et bah on construit pas de théorie au début du genre : ça doit les sous exprimer pour par capter le métal toxique, ou ça surexprime ceux des membranes vacuolaires pour réduire la toxicité. Nop, c'est de bonnes hypothèses on les garde dans un coin, mais si la bibliographie n'en parle pas, on ne les formule pas dans l'expérience ; on fait l'expérience, et une fois qu'on a les résultats on se dit, tiens ce transporteur est vacuolaire et est surexprimé, peut être qu'il joue un rôle dans la détoxification du métal toxique (et à partir de là Ô miracle, une nouvelle question scientifique, une nouvelle recherche, une nouvelle expérience, de nouvelles réponses à la question, de nouvelles questions et c'est repartit).

Et dans la vie personnelle quand je me pose une question ; internet : bouquins spécialisés : réponses, et comme la question m'intéresse je mémorise, rien à voir avec la rigueur nécessaire en science.

http://www12.senado.leg.br/publicacoes/estudos-legislativos/tipos-de-estudos/boletins-legislativos/bol64

**TODAS** as supostas ilegalidades e eventuais objeções à PEC do voto direto foram refutadas nesse documento, inclusive usando entendimento do STF para casos similares. 

Seria bom você ler tudo, mas se você estiver com preguiça eu faço um resumo da parte que aborda o princípio da anualidade, que também é refutado no parecer:

Basicamente o princípio da anualidade visa (conforme análise teleológica) prover segurança jurídica ao cidadão, impedindo que mudanças casuística das regras **retirem casuisticamente seus direitos** de processos eleitorais que estão próximos de acontecer (ex.: **impedir** casuisticamente que uma pessoa com apenas 9 dedos se candidate ou **impedir** casuisticamente que analfabetos votem). 

É por isso que o artigo 16 da CF pode ser entendido como cláusula pétrea, porque visa resguardar direitos fundamentais, que são cláusulas pétreas expressas. Por isso, meramente por isso. Não tem relação nenhuma com voto direto/indireto em caso de dupla vacância, mas sim com ""impedir retirada casuística de direitos"", leia-se garantir segurança jurídica. 

No caso da PEC em voga há **acréscimo de direitos** ao cidadão que irá participar do processo eleitoral, não retirada (similar ao que eu disse em relação à rasa comparação que você fez no comentário anterior). 

Poderia-se eventualmente arguir que haveria retirada dos direitos dos parlamentares, que deixariam de fazer valer sua escolha, mas isso é facilmente rebatido pois...

1) não se trata de direito fundamental da pessoal que ocupa o cargo de parlamentar, mas sim de prerrogativa do cargo que, como tal, a todo momento pode ser objeto de retirada e/ou ampliação (vide prerrogativas do Presidente em relação às MPs, citado no parecer);

2) os próprios parlamentares decidiriam por abrir mão (abdicar) dessa prerrogativa do cargo para ampliar os direitos do cidadão (não seria um corpo estranho retirando algo deles, eventualmente ofendendo a segurança jurídica).

**From my mom's side**, we have a great-grandmother (maternal grandfather's mom) from mainland China. Her family emigrated during the 1880s. My grandpa's dad is a national with 3 generations here (where I was born and live currently). 

My maternal grandmother, on the other hand, is from Argentina. From what I was told (and checked), her dad (my great-grandfather) is from Syria. Another fact is that the family of the woman he wed with is from Western Europe (according to mom and great-aunts, Germany). From my great-grandfather's offsprings, only 2 have the darkened skin pigment from a native arab. No one in the family has it (recessive).

**From my dad's side** there isn't much - my dad's biological dad separated when he was a newborn and hasn't been much in the picture. My dad is on uneven terms with him and we (my brother and I) never met him. From a description of my (paternal) grandmother, he had ""blonde hair"" and ""blue eyes"" (which is a consistent trait from descendants from Europeans, which seems to be true as most of Argentine population is descendant from Spanish and Italian settlers at most). My maternal grandmother's side of the family is straight from Argentina as well. Not much information apart that. 


A little bit of digging into both surnames, found something interesting: Dad's surname (paternal side) is straight from Canary Isles. Contradictory, it is also registered in Italy. Turns out his surname belongs to a line of nobility. 

My mom's surname (or in this case, my maternal grandfather's surname) comes straight from Spain - specifically, the first mention is from the Northern area of Asturias around the 8th Century

&gt; How does an instrumental band speak to a listener? Through melancholic melodies and energetic rhythms, dense harmonies, starbursts of noise and breathless interludes. Through organic music that speaks of duality and plurality, of fleeting ideas and ephemeral moments, unexpected climaxes and explosive epiphanies – emotions from life captured in sound. That, in a nutshell, is Exivious, an instrumental quartet that channels a truly unique voice within the contemporary music scene.

&gt; The sound of Exivious is hard to define; it operates in a space where metal meets fusion meets post-rock and still is none of the above. The band blends a wide variety of musical genres into a coherent, unified sound that’s driven by the incredible chemistry shared by the band members. The instrumental quartet consists of Tymon Kruidenier (ex-Cynic) and Michel Nienhuis (Dodecahedron) on guitars, Robin Zielhorst (ex-Cynic) on fretless bass and Yuma van Eekelen (ex-Pestilence, The New Dominion) on drums.

&gt; 
A brief history

&gt; Exivious was founded by Tymon Kruidenier as the culmination of an unlikely vision – to bring together two disparate genres, jazz fusion and metal, in a previously unexplored way. It was in 2005 that a stable line-up came together, with Tymon Kruidenier, Robin Zielhorst, Michel Nienhuis and Stef Broks (Textures). The modern era Exivious was born.

&gt; Exivious’ critically acclaimed debut was released independently in 2009. The self-titled album instantly captured the imagination of fans and critics alike, with reviewers calling it “a genre-defining album” (Sputnikmusic.com), “an incredible album which emanates class and skill” (Avant-gardeMetal.com) and “easily…one of the top releases of 2009” (Prog-sphere.com).

&gt; But in 2010, Tymon and Robin's commitment to US prog metal band Cynic forced Exivious to take a break. The move to the United States meant that they couldn’t give Exivious the time it deserved and the band went on an indefinite hiatus. A year later, though, both Tymon and Robin quit Cynic and moved back to the Netherlands and Exivious picked up where they left off, but with a greater sense of purpose and vigor.

&gt; This rebirth of the band brought about a new sense of dedication and commitment, with plans for new album releases and much touring. Unfortunately, Stef’s full-time commitment to Textures led to him parting ways with Exivious. He was replaced by longtime friend of the band, Yuma van Eekelen.

&gt; In 2011, Exivious played their first major outdoor festival at Brutal Assault in Czech Republic. The following year the band joined Obscura, Spawn Of Possession and Gorod on their first European tour. The band has received many positive comments about their live performances, often mentioning the immersive musical experience.

&gt; At the end of 2012, Exivious kicked off a crowd-funding campaign for their upcoming album, Liminal. The goal of 8,000 Euros was reached within a week and by the end of the campaign, the amount collected was more than double the goal. Subsequently, recording for Liminal kicked off in November 2012 and the album was completed in April 2013. Liminal is produced and mixed by Tymon Kruidenier and is expected to release in November 2013.

&gt; Liminal draws not from musical influences, but from life itself, capturing emotions, conveying feelings and experiences in a way that instrumental music rarely explores. It’s experimental, original and most importantly, immersive, drawing the listener into a world of sound that is at once challenging and intriguing.

I'm not even a Trump voter, I was just commenting that the US would not be without leverage if Germany tried to undercut US taxation, and in fact that such reforms would be consistent with Trump's stated agenda. The prospect of the krauts trying to take advantage on trade might be just what Congress needs to get its act together.

As I said I am a Hillary and Sanders voter, but I think that Germany is being a little selfish and greedy on these issues. Even a broken clock is right twice a day, and that is how I feel about Trump on Germany. Germany agreed in 2006 to spend 2% of its GDP on military as part of its commitment to the NATO military alliance. After years of skirting their obligations, they agreed yet again in 2014 to increase their spending to 2%. Nothing has happened. They only spend 1%. Their military is useless. They are a useless free-rider on NATO, and its not as though that has been costless. Bosnia was a mere 300 miles from their border and yet they allowed genocides to occur until the US stepped in. Syria is only a few hundred miles from them too, and the fallout from Syria is destabilizing even their own country, and yet still they do nothing. They are the largest and richest country in Europe, they should be a military force able to lead on these sorts of issues, and yet they do nothing because they know that their underfunded military would be useless. They make it too easy to justify their own fecklessness by purposely keeping their military useless.

So here we have Germany skirting on their own international obligations, promises they have made to NATO and the US, investments that could address many major world problems like global political instability, aggressive actors like Russia, and terrorism. Climate change isn't the only global challenge. And yet, here we also have German politicians mouthing off about America's obligations to the Paris Treaty. You know what, America has a larger energy industry than Germany. I think we're actually the largest energy producer in the world, bigger than Saudi Arabia. America also has a much larger primary industry (natural resources harvesting and processing) sector than Germany, and primary industry is typically more energy intensive than secondary industry. We are also a much larger and less densely populated country where people have to use more energy on transportation. Complying with the Paris Treaty will simply cost America more than it will cost Germany. And yet Germans dare criticize any reluctance America has to accept those costs while they themselves refuse to do their part and handle issues in their own neighborhood like Russia and Syria. Even as America spends over 3% of its GDP on defense.

Each country has their own deal breakers, issues which they wont back down on. Many countries have decided that some of these key issues are less important than the overriding benefit of their membership of the EU. Others feel they can get away with standing up for those key issues and remaining a member without anyone kicking up too much fuss.

It isn't entitlement and it isn't about trying to get a load of benefits and none of the costs. We more than paid our way and brought a great deal of value to the project besides just pumping money into it.

The EU was going in a bad direction and was becoming less compatible with our political outlook as a nation. We sought to take steps to try and rectify it, or opt out of certain aspects that were definite intolerable deal breakers for us and the EU weren't up for that. It's a shame, because we truly are all stronger together and I do believe that a federal Europe could genuinely be a great thing, although not the way they seem to want to do it.

They could have compromised or negotiated in better faith with us and we'd have never voted to leave.  They could have conceded on some serious issues that we had and the issue of leaving would have been sidelined. We could all be sitting here having began the path of reforming the EU into something which would be better for everyone, less of a domineering, protectionist beast which heavily favours northern Europe and has caused untold havoc with unrestricted free movement of people (however beneficial it has been, it has also been hugely problematic).

The EU isn't perfect and has got some things wrong, most Europeans would likely agree with the EU reforming and evolving into something even better. Part of that is compromising and working with members to achieve that, particularly the hugely important members, such as the UK.

Kaffe4200,Denmark,Denmark,"Thanks for the quick answer!

Temperatures in July are around on average around 13 degrees Celsius at its coldest. Average is 17 degrees Celsius. 

My backpack is from Haglöfs. There are some straps to secure the lid and some straps on the side of the pack. There are also some 'hooks' for ice picks or hiking poles. 

Sleeping pad is just a foam pad. It can be secured to the top of the pack nicely. 

My sleeping bag is also from Haglöfs. All it says is 'beaver' and 'zip L'. It's quite bulky and takes up a lot of space when inside the pack.

Not a lot of money. 400 DKK (60 USD) at most. Spent a lot of money already. I'll be buying in Denmark or in any online store in the EU (or related countries, ie Norway and Liechtenstein). 

I'm very new to backpacking! I've done a lot of camping though, but this is my first combined hiking and camping trip. 

There might be some things I could cut down on. For instance, I'm not sure how much clothes to pack. Right now, my list looks like this: 
2 t-shirts, 4 pairs of underwear, jacket or thick shirt, 2 spare pairs of socks, hat. 

My cooking gear is a spirit stove, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of room. I won't bring very much food, as I'll buy most of it during the trip. 

Other than that, I'm really not packing much more. A first aid kit, map, sunscreen, a map, a flashlight, Swiss army knife, hand sanitizer, powerbank for my phone and coffee. Also a 2 liter bottle of water, as there won't be many opportunities to refill water during the trip. 

I have a few blankets, yeah. All of them take up around a quarter of what the sleeping bag does. I might buy a nicer blanket if that's what I end up doing though.",True,0,1496351985,,False,0,dic3hrl,t3_6dzxis,t1_dic2p2r,1498987081,1,False,CampingandHiking,t5_2qqom,

Another scenario: You have a small engineering company in France, Germany, Italy or Belgium. They **only** have one factory in one of these countries. This engineering company sells a good and its' only competitor is for example GE. While GE pays only 0.005% tax (through a deal with Ireland) the small engineering company pays upwards 25% tax.

We need to make international efforts to combat climate change. 80 percent of the countries agreed, but only if the US and EU paid for it to the tune of 100B a year (?). There is admittedly little way to enforce how the money is spent, no specific consequences if they don't, and an incredible likelihood that the majority of it will be wasted and/or pocketed, and the US and the EU will basically be the ones taking the financial impact and the regulatory impact on jobs, plus will be self-sabotaged competitively. This appears to rely on the honor system for the most part. The is like NATO for the climate. It just won't be effective. If every country did the right thing, and there were definite serious consequences it would make more sense. If you think handing a check over to dictators and asking them to ""do the right thing"" is going to work, then I would have to say you have way too much confidence in people lol.

I would rather see the US/EU spend 100 billion on investments into alternative energy. Make it viable, make it affordable, and export it to other countries. At least then we know our investment is being put to good use. This whole thing hinges upon alternative energy anyway.

That's why it's problematic. Its horrible history particularly in the US, UK, and a lesser extent the other colonialist countries. 

But the furthest you get with a lot of people is ""Painting your face black is horrible and racist period dot com"" and tbh if someone told me that and *I* was completely ignorant of its history I'd be like ""Well then so should painting your face white"" - because that makes *sense* when you're absolutely clueless about racism in today's society.

We're starting the conversation way ahead of them - we on ""this side"" are already on the same page, we're aware of the systemic racism and calculated oppression and othering of racial &amp; ethnic minorities (the majority is at least familiar with how it is in the US), but these people don't really understand these things because they live in a mental paradigm where race isn't an issue (""I don't see race =)))) Aren't we all humans anyway?""), so for them, painting your face black is the same as painting it white. They're not on the same page, they're not even in the same book.

And I know it's not our job to inform other people but the two sides not communicating at all is what lead to the schism the US &amp; most of Europe are experiencing now so maybe establishing some dialogue would help.

Dorias90,bold,El pueblo quiere Ucraniazo,"&gt;no seas loco tampoco, una cosa es la izquierda y otra cosa es la corruptela malandra chavista 

Una cosa lleva a  la otra, venezuela estuvo 50 años con la ""izquierda buena"" y eso dio por origen al Chavismo, en otros paises se pudo ver como casi gracias a los Democratas el Chavez de Estados Unidos(Bernie Sanders) casi consigue el poder, repitiendose la historia siempre que el patron de los malditos socialdemocratas logran usurpar el poder y destruir el pais a paso lento para darle a sus primos Leninistas el acto final, tal como los AdeComunistas hicieron con el PSUV y el PCV

Los conflictos entre mencheviques (Socialdemocratas o democrata-comunista) y bolcheviques (Comunistas) me dan igual, ambos son la misma escoria con exactamente las mismas ambiciones pero distintos mismos metodos para lograrlo, la izquierda por donde que se para es un augurio para la decadencia y la destruccion

&gt;casi todos los partidos de oposición Venezuela incluyendo AD y Voluntad Popular están inscritos en la internacional socialista

Exactamente, eso se menciona en mi comentario respondiendo al pana anterior, y la verdad no se como ayuda a tu argumento, la popularidad de la MUD es igual a la del PSUV y la gente solo lo utiliza como puente para organizan ya que ellos tienen monopolizado ser ""Oposicion""

&gt;para el que dijo que para mandar en Venezuela hay que mandar con mano dura, pues eso es lo que están haciendo los chavistas ahora, si no mira como están jodiendo a los manifestantes en la calle.

En Venezuela no hay mano dura, el Chavismo tiene como sello promover la anarquia y la falta de ley y ORDEN en todo los niveles de la sociedad para Animalizar y someter a los Venezolanos, la delincuencia, los saqueos, los ataques a la propiedad privada y la destruccion de nuestra Cultura, soberania Nacional, y valores son una politica premeditada, la unica ""mano dura"" que se aplica es contra la gente decente que pide que la supremacia de las leyes impere

&gt;No se dejen llevar por el mal solo por salir de otro mal, es muy importante tener eso claro, si no pasan desastres como Trump en Estados Unidos donde muchos americanos por no elegir a un candidato que no sentía que los representaba, y para alejarse de un presidente de color, eligieron a un mojón anaranjado que quiere dejar a los niños y ancianos con condiciones pre-existentes como asma etc, sin seguro medico. O el caso de Brexit en Inglaterra donde la ignorancia y a apatía hizo que el Reino Unido se separara de de la UE dejando a un miles de personas en un limbo migratorio.

Que a ti todo te parezca mal denota que eres parte del problema de Venezuela, lo que propuso Trump es que cada quien, a traves de su propio dinero, se consiga lo que necesita a traves de su propio trabajo en ves de ser exclavos del estado, tu puedes apoyar o no esa politica pero no hay nada ""malefico"" ni diabolico en ello como tu los estas haciendo ver, es una politica que la mayoria de los Estadounidenses que votaron a Trump a apoyan porque ellos estan en contra de todo tipo de intervencion Estatal en la economia.

Y siendo los Venezolanos como estamos, siendo exclavos de una mafia internacional, a mi no me disgusta que la soberania de las Naciones surga sobre proyectos tiranicos de megapaises unidos bajo unos magistrados que nadie eligio, el ALBA es la copia de la EU que el traidor eterno quiso imponer en sudamerica pero en vez de basarle en el Socialismo Electivo como la EU, decidio que su base seria el Socialismo Marxista

&gt;el mundo esta cambiando muy rápido con los avances tecnológicos pero las ideas se quedan atrás es hora de mirar adelante y no para atrás.

Ese es el punto, es en el pasado donde nuestra mayor gloria y prosperidad se ubica, nosotros en vez de avanzar fuimos para atras tras el desastre de 1958, todo bajo nociones ridiculas de progreso y igualdad que a los ojos de estudiantes soñadores sonara dulce pero los que sufrimos bajo el Marxismo sabemos todo lo que eso conlleva

The-SaltLife,,," Have you *actually read* the Paris Agreement? The *goal* and *idea* behind it is noble, but the way it's carried out is utterly insane. Before you down vote me, at least read what I am about to write. 

The Paris Agreement forced most of the countries to meet emission standards yet the **largest** CO2 emitters - China and India - did not have to comply to the Agreement for another *15 years*. What's even crazier is we had to *pay these countries* to help prevent emissions meanwhile they didn't have to actually do anything about it for 15 more years. Where is this money going? Into their pockets. We, as well as the other 180+ countries are throwing money away. 

I believe in global warming and humans definitely have an impact on it but the data and information on it has not been 100% reliable since the last satellite information gatherings from 1998. There as it stands 73 DIFFERENT mathematical equations for global warming. Far too many and all result in different outcomes, so it's hard to get an actual number - but as I said, I believe in global warming. I'm not denying it whatsoever. 

The craziest part about the Paris Agreement is that the main global warming models predict that by the end of the century, the Earth will be heated up by 2 degrees.... 2 degrees.... 

Take that how you will. It's based on the top global warming scientists observations. Anyway, that means we, the United States will spend *literally TRILLIONS* of dollars each year for approximately 2.0 degrees of Earths warming. How is that logical?

It's not very logical. And as an aside - Many of the U.S agricultural specialists say that if the Earths temp rises by 2 degrees, it will raise crop yields substantially, thus producing excess food, meaning we can lower food  prices and feed the 2+ billion more people we will have on Earth by then. 

Additionally, Europes CO2 levels have steadily risen even though they spend over 1 trillion dollars a year on green subsidiaries (You can find that information on Google. I know it off the top of my head from research.)

In regards to America, our emissions level *has dropped 12%* since 2007 due to our effort to find alternative energy - something that has NOTHING to do with the Paris Agreement or us being in it before Trump pulled out.

clbgrdnr,,,"I've taken a Byzantine history course in college which focused a lot on the fall of the Byzantine Empire due to Islam. Also, I'm a complete history buff; I listen to hardcore history, watch the Great War and Byzantine history channels. A lot of that information was pulled from [this free MIT course I've completed](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/history/21h-601-islam-the-middle-east-and-the-west-fall-2006/index.htm). I've done a research paper on the spread of Islam for my own World History requirement in college.

&gt; At this point, the Middle East was the cross roads of a newly emerging global trade patterns. This accumulated a lot of wealth in the region, which would help fund Islamic scientific innovation, or the 'golden era'

The Umayyad Caliphate conquered Spain, the entire Maghreb region, and Persia. Conquest that brought riches to the region, not trade. They were not a peaceful existence, as they forcefully converted any Coptic Christians they came into contact with. The Abbasid Caliphate that followed continued the conquest and raiding of European and Anatolian Christian communities. Like I said previously, over 1 million European Christians alone found themselves forced into slavery in only 250 years time. The silk road trade was a minor boost to the already vibrant economy, but that was being driven by the Mongolian conquests, and Islam spread only semi-peacefully and mostly unsuccessfully along the trade route. Islam didn't reach much farther than the empires land holdings.

&gt;  Secondly, yes you can argue that the Crusades were not religious, they did say it was in 'protection' from infidels. But it was the Popes army who went to war against them (also, why should the Pope even have an army with no checks and balances?). It is the same argument used in the US Civil War. The South said that they were fighting for states rights, but we all know what they really were fighting for.

The first crusade was the collective European answer to the Byzantine Emperor asking for help against the Turks invading Anatolia. If you were Europe, and you see this massive multicultural Islamic Army that is destroying an old empire like the Byzantines, attacking your coastlines, imprisoning/killing Christians who don't denounce what would you do? Also it's interesting to point out that Rome still considered itself whole. As the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantine were both considered East and West Rome at that time; so it was like a call to their political brother.

Also, the papal states were nothing more than the political arm of the Roman Catholic Church; which first and foremost is a political organization that helped mediate and run European government. 

The pope's army was actually not all form the Papal state. Kings answered the call to arms, mainly to protect themselves from the Great Islamic armies as a coalition.

You and your parents, like absolute savages, decided to stay and brave the storm and I found your stream through Reddit. After watching that stream I gave you a follow on Twitch, but really didn't have any intention of watching your stream again. You were meant to be a one and done situation. After your ban ended and you moved to LA I decided to check out your first stream at your new apartment, and sure enough, very quickly, I became a huge fan. There isn't a day that goes by now that I don't check into the stream for at the very least a few minutes, and more often than not, I watch the whole thing, or keep it on while I do other things. Your energy, your positive vibes, everything, its so damn infectious and you really are an incredibly entertaining person. You truly were meant to do this for a living and don't let these 12 year olds tell you otherwise. You really do have a gift for entertainment and comedy.
With that out of the way I want you to know that I do believe you are genuine in your apology today. All of these people raging at you, saying how everything is scripted, they can fuck off. Unfortunately, because your community is so young, they have a strong mob mentality. Something goes wrong, a couple trolls feel a certain way/express hatred and displeasure towards you, and they all jump on the bandwagon. Its sad, but you can't listen to that. Just know that they will continue to watch your streams and you won't lose them as viewers, they think this is a fun game and receive pleasure out of tormenting people online when they know there is no way to be held accountable. So disregard these people entirely and I am going to tell you how it really is.
You fucked up, not that badly, this isn't the end of the world, but you did. One thing I am happy about is that your realized your mistake. You didn't just rub this off and say ""MAFUCKIN ASS BITCHES, WATCHU MEAN, NOOO"". you man'd up and that is a great first step. We all make mistakes and we can't be perfect. You learned a valuable lesson in the last 24 hours and you can take that with you going forward in life. You can't treat people like toys or objects. They are no different from you or I and you have to treat them the way you want to be treated. In the case of this love triangle, you were playing with peoples emotions, how would you feel if Geisha said she was sleeping with another guy? I can't imagine you would feel 100% okay with it. Regardless you will move past this and I think the number one lesson you have to take away from all of this drama is you need to learn to treat people the way you want to be treated. Its the way I live my life, and while it didn't help me when I was younger and in school (I was bullied a lot for being too nice) it has helped me amazingly in the last few years, and I think it will help you too going forward. It doesn't mean you can't still be your crazy autistic self on stream, keep doing you, we love it, but try and think about how what you do affects other before you do it.
Anyway this is a long ass post, many of you probably won't read it and will downvote me for being a normie or some shit, saying how Ice won't read this cause its too long and he's autistic. Whatever. All I hope is that Ice maybe reads this and it helps him ever so slighty. I want Ice and the purple army to continue to grow and provide entertainment for many more years to come.

[deleted],,,"&gt; ROFLMAO. Perhaps you should look at the total wealth of the country, not the per capita amount.

But ""total wealth"" also isn't an accurate representation of a countries economic situation either. At least GDP (PPP) includes the size of the country in relation to its output. Although, I think to say the UK will continue to remain in the ""top five"" wealthiest nations after leaving the EU is a grave error.

&gt; The totality of exports of goods and services to the EU at £230Bn

Wasn't that out of £550Bn, though? Making that 44%, not 10?  [Best source I could find on this](https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/) I will admit, I'm not too sure about our output to the EU, so, I could be wrong here.

&gt; Given there are over 150 nations outside of the EU there doesn't seem to be a big queue trying to get a FTA with it

My issue with not remaining in the FTA isn't anything to do with our output it's what we import.

Meaning, transport costs are going to cost a hell of a lot on top of the presumably hefty sum we'll be paying for products. We need a deal with a FTA, fuck nationalism, fuck ""independence"", we're in big, big trouble if we just pull-out.

Just no.  Your orientation is not something you choose.  Gay kids dont look at a menu and say ""you know, I think that cultural stigma and constant prejudice would work really good for me"".

Often people who arent actually being labeled, self-label themselves by taking offense to comments that arent directed at them.

Everyone: ""There were a bunch of Neo-Nazi's at that Trump rally.  Literal Nazis who are part of Neo-Nazi groups and keep shouting Nazi slogans.""

It's genetic but also cultural. The Jews are essentially a race and a sub-culture. 

&gt; what exactly causes them to do all these things?

The same cause that drives Germans to be Germans and Chinese to be Chinese. They can't be anything else than Jews because that's their nature. Its like asking why a Lion behaves like a Lion and a rat like a rat. If you think races and genes dont have influence...Go travel. Go work in Germany, or live in Germany for some years, tell me the Germans don't have an order to them, how they work, etc...Compared to going to Ghana or Senegal. Go to China or Japan and look at the way people behave there.

I actually speak with a number of influential Jews (friends of family members, we go out with my family on trips, etc, and will discuss politics), and most of the stuff they believe feels heartfelt, even if its batshit insane to any conservative or nationalist. I know this rich Jewish doctor, living in a 100% white neighborhood in a European country, he is 100% capitalistic and made his wealth off capitalism. Yet politically he is far left. He is 100% ""socialistic"", wants mass immigration, finds Christianity ""backwards"", and will tell you socialistic drivel all day. Even though he has nothing of the socialistic background (working class gentiles, etc). 

And the funniest part is, after saying all that socialistic drivel, he will go and place his cash in various tax havens to avoid paying them. He gloats about not paying lots of taxes whilst being a so called socialist. He also frequently disses the working class he supposedly loves, saying how he hates ""simple minded"" policemen and ""cannon-fodder"" soldiers. Guy also stole a watch at a local pool (that was forgotten by someone) instead of giving it back (despite being a millionaire), saying ""fools deserve to be stolen from"". 

These people are incredible but only Jews can be that. Double faced in a way, like there is always schizophrenia of some sort in them. They are incredibly cunning and relatively smart individuals. They can tell you a bold faced lie in your face and then be proud internally about how they fooled you.

LoveSignMasterSpark,,,"&gt;And now that automation is oncoming

Oncoming? It's been here for decades. It's not going to suddenly displace a large portion of the population either, it'll be gradual and won't be a serious issue for a long time, if only ""greedy CEOs"" won't want to spend a ton of money on automation when it's cheaper to just hire people. Even then medium and small businesses will take even longer to reach that point. The problem of automation is overstated. 

&gt;And $15 would become the baseline. Workers pay all around would be forced to go up.

Why is that? 

&gt;Regardless of the minimum wage automation is going to make most jobs today non existent. Then we get into the realm of basic income and socialism.

What makes you think that? Even now companies are still hiring people to work call centers because people find computers annoying. Automatic trucks can only drive so far until a driver *must* take over to do things like back into the correct docks (There is no standard for dock numbering, no standard for computers to identify docks, and plenty of docks which require strange/illegal maneuvering to even get into) or exchange copies of the bill of landings, and even large corporations are unlikely to make the dramatic infrastructure changes needed to automate even half of their positions. Don't forget programmers, mechanics, engineers and other jobs which simply can't be done by computers.
 
Even if you assume those jobs will be replaced, that doesn't make basic income magically feasible, even if you took 100% of all the 1%'s wealth. The math simply doesn't add up. Socialism in its pure form has never worked, and will work even less if the means of production is automated. Democratic Socialism like you see in Europe is a form of mixed capitalism, so it wouldn't work if there was full automation. 

&gt;I'm a working poor adult who has life experiences galore to backup everything I've written. I've been homeless. I've slept with a hungry belly. I've worked backbreaking jobs for shit pay. Dont go there with me.

So you understand how hard it is to get a job. Make the minimum wage $15 an hour and you now have to spend $31.2k on the lowest skilled full time jobs in your company. High school kids can kiss their chances of getting a job good bye, as can anyone who doesn't have a spotless work record with good references.

Para manteres a frequência podes ir postando WIPs em vez de apenas ilustrações acabadas. Competições como o Inktober também ajudam nisto.

standy85,EMRM,Bologna,"&gt; That's likely to be what the Labour Party would pursue,

No. There is a clear difference between having access to the single market and being inside the single market. 

For a start, any country not under embargo or sanctions is free to trade with the EU, as long as it does under the WTO legislative framework. The US can, for example, trade in goods such as fridges or cars, but only if they meet the EU quality and safety standards. They are however subject to controls to ensure that they are compliant and they are subject to tariffs ( which cannot be higher than WTO set ones). Also note that a free trade deal sets which goods can enter the internal market and which not, while members of the single market have the right to demand all their goods, services, capital money to flow without restrictions inside the EU. The UK will see the palette of goods restricted to the ones, the commission deems valuable for the members of the EU. 

Secondly, goods and services manufactured by members of the single market are not subject to tariffs nor controls (since they all abide to a common legislative framework and controls on goods and services between the members of the single market have been abolished). So, when it comes to trade in goods, even the ones that the EU decides to allow in from the UK will compete with goods of the same product category made in the EU and subject to 0% tariffs, no waiting line and full protection of consumers rights. 

Thirdly, the palette of products allowed in will shrink, once the UK regulations drift away from the one set by the EU. Brexiteers claim that a regulatory equivalence will have UK regulations mirror the EU ones, but the next logical step would see the UK setting its own regulations (otherwise why bother leaving?) and thus losing further access to the single market. They can of course reorient their production in order to meet non EU standards ( e.g. PAL vs NTSC video standards in the US), but for most companies manufacturing in the UK it is antieconomical to have two production lines for two different markets. 

Forthly, even the single market for services is an ongoing project, not fully achieved, and free trade deals, do not cover services. Regulations on services are even more difficult to harmonise than goods, so the UK will be in a difficult position with regards to the provision of services to EU businesses. Given that Westminster wants to pull the UK out of the ECJ jurisdiction, it'll be very difficult to allow UK business services companies in the EU. Unless it stipulates a strict compliance with the EU rules (and again, it is not logical to withdraw from the EU, if you intend to follow its rules afterwards. It'd be the worst of two worlds).

The UK has put itself into a bottleneck position. It can strike a deal where some of its goods get preferential access to the EU (but it will incur nonetheless in customs controls and tariffs), but there is little it can do to retain the current benefits.

What it can do is see if new trade with the outside world can replace lost revenues from the EU. However, the fundamental conundrum of today's commerce remains. Which regulatory framework will it use? There is no trade nowadays that does not entail legislative harmonisation, regulatory equivalence or something similar.

The show start in a small european-like village. Warm colors, serenity and beautiful images to stablish the setting.

My first -and only- major complain is the music, **bombastic**, over-elaborated and distracting in some scenes. Something about the soundtrack and sound design was too much for me.

The OP and ED themes were acceptable, not bad, nor great, just good enough.

- **Cocoa** seems like a nice girl. Self-insert protagonist, a little basic and predictable as character. I need time to get adjusted.

- **Chino** is, hands down, the ~~best girl~~ most appealing of the bunch. I could watch a whole anime only about Chino, but i don't think i could watch this *without* her*. She is the main source of cuteness and fun. The gags work because of her and i like it. Great VA.

- **Rize** was a little annoying. Again, i need more time to get used to the cast. 

As introductory bunnisode, GochiUsa plays safe and showcase the fundamentals of any anime show and the basic for a proper *CGDCT.*

She questions the irate guy first and knows he's spouting nonsense about just passing through. She tells that to him to his face and says if he overstays he will be kicked out and not allowed to return for 10 years or something, then lets him into the country.

She then questions us about why we were there and such. She asks about our financial situation, etc. Then denies us access. They load us up into the jail car and send us to the airport holding cell to process us. 

But we didn't come from the U.S. where we live, we came from Spain. So they intend to send us back to the airport from which we came, but that airport only does 2 flights to/from Ireland a week.

Because stuff got more serious once there's several eastern member states actively undermining rule of law and their own liberal democracies.

lookmeat,,,"Actually this is the reason why Exxon probably pushed for the US to stay in the first place.

Here's the thing. Renewable tech will win in the medium term (if it isn't winning already in various areas). If green sources, and not just solar and wind, but crazier stuff such as fusion keep going the way they are they'll beat gas and oil hands down. In many ways the tech is already mostly there, but infrastructure still has some ways to go. The thing with this tech is that once you go over the infrastructure hump, the variable costs are very close to zero, once you've recovered your investment you can keep pushing your gains to create more green plants, which results in exponential growth.

Green energy sources will win, which is bad for Exxon and such, because this will lower the demand for oil and gas greatly. The solution is obvious: grow into the markets that will replace you, so that you keep that money. The thing is that this investment costs money.

Exxon wants the US to stay in the Paris deal because that way they can use that sweet government money to grow into green tech. Public risk, private gains as usual.

Now that the US is out of it, the rest of the world will keep investing. China, Europe, etc. will invest public money into companies and they will get better tech and out-compete US companies. This is bad for the US.

A great example of how this could end for the US is many of the coal states. Montana could produce huge amounts of wind and solar power, and they are building it [privately](http://montanawindresources.com/).

The joke is that coal is mostly dead, it wasn't killed but died of natural causes: technology obsolesce.

The sad thing is that Montana could recover and become a huge powerhouse by investing on green energy tech and becoming leader in this area.

I believe this result. My family's roots are firmly in the South Western part of Korea, going back centuries according to our family registry. A part of Korea that was once the kingdom of Baekche which was destroyed in the middle ages. Many of the royalty and the peoples fled the country, into Japan, after it was attacked and defeated by another Korean kingdom called Shilla (who eventually unified the Korean kingdoms). My family were probably the Baekche people who stayed and became Koreans. The ones who fled to Japan, carried our genes.

From looking at the other results of other Koreans and Korean Americans (that I've seen so far), the broad theme for most (if not all) seems to be that we Koreans are genetically closest to the Japanese. Then followed by the Chinese further away.

Zebba_Odirnapal,vu,skookum olsem frig,"Cool stuff indeed. Nukes have so much extra stuff to deal with.

Slightly funny, long story: I remember one time there was a fossil plant being installed somewhere in Central Europe, using a legacy British design for the LP steam hoods. The Brits, being early adopters of steam power (once bitten twice shy) had the extra safety feature of burst diaphragms specified on the as-built steam hood. Orignally, the diaphragms would have been connected to vent chimneys that went up and out the roof of the powerhouse. However in this case, there was no code and no real engineering reason for having the burst diaphragms. The steam hoods just had big steel plates bolted over the holes.  

So halfway through installation, we got a worried message from an engineer at the site. They were not able to source 1.5 meter wide gasket material per the drawings. They wanted to know if it would be OK to cut a spiral gasket instead.  

The chief engineer stateside (who happened to be a Brit, funnily enough) looked at the drawings, thought for a moment, and told them ""Well, the steam hoods already have separate manway hatches.

""The Paris climate agreement was deeply flawed from its start. It was legally and constitutionally suspect, based on politics rather than science, and contained unrealistic goals. It promised not only a dramatic expansion of the administrative state and a huge increase in the regulatory burden on American businesses, it threatened to put the brakes on U.S. economic output at a time when most economists think the U.S. will struggle to achieve even a meager two percent growth.

It’s likely that it was already acting as a drag on the U.S. economy. After President Barack Obama unofficially committed the U.S. to the Paris agreement, businesses began preparing for its impact. Knowing that it would diminish U.S. economic output, businesses invested less and directed more investment toward less-productive technology to meet the climate deal’s mandates. Banks and financiers withdrew capital from sectors expected to suffer under the climate deal and pushed it toward those expected to benefit. A classic example of regulation-driven malinvestment.

The Paris climate agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015 at the conclusion of the United Nation’s Climate Change Conference. Parties to the agreement are expected to begin taking measures to reduce emissions in 2020, mainly by enacting rules that sharply reduce carbon emissions. Countries are supposed to publicly announce “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” to combat climate change and periodically report on their progress.  The Obama administration announced the U.S. would commit to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, a quarter of which was supposedly achievable by the implementation of the previous administration’s legally-questionable Clean Power Plan.

To get the rest of the way, the U.S. would have to make major investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner motor vehicles. This likely explains why the Paris climate deal was so popular with many in Silicon Valley and many on Wall Street. It promised a bonanza of spending and investment, most likely subsidized by taxpayers, in technologies that wouldn’t otherwise be attractive. It was practically calling out for making self-driving, solar powered cars mandatory.

Dropping out of the agreement will let the U.S. avoid several deleterious effects of the agreement.

    Goodbye to ‘American Last.’ The Paris agreement was basically an attempt to halt climate change on the honor system. Its only legal requirements were for signatories to announce goals and report progress, with no international enforcement mechanism. As a result, it was likely that the United States and wealthy European nations would have adopted and implemented severe climate change rules while many of the world’s governments would avoid doing anything that would slow their own economies. The agreement basically made the U.S. economy and Europe’s strongest economies sacrificial lambs to the cause of climate change.
    Industrial Carnage. The regulations necessary to implement the Paris agreement would have cost the U.S. industrial sector 1.1 million jobs, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These job losses would center in cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining. Industrial output would decline sharply.
    Hollowing Out Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The industrial carnage would have been concentrated on four states, according to the Chamber of Commerce study. Michigan’s GDP would shrink by 0.8 percent and employment would contract by 74,000 jobs. Missouri’s GDP would shrink by 1 percent. Ohio’s GDP would contract 1.2 percent. Pennsylvania’s GDP would decline by 1.8 percent and the state would lose 140,000 jobs.
    Smashing Small Businesses, Helping Big Business. Big businesses in America strongly backed the Paris climate deal. In fact, the backers of the climate deal reads like a “who’s who” of big American businesses: Apple, General Electric, Intel, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, General Mills, Walmart, DuPont, Unilever, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. These business giants can more easily cope with costly regulations than their smaller competitors and many would, in fact, find business opportunities from the changes required. But smaller businesses and traditional start-ups would likely be hurt by the increased costs of compliance and rising energy costs.
    Making America Poorer Again.  A Heritage Foundation study found that the Paris agreement would have increased the electricity costs of an American family of four by between 13 percent and 20 percent annually. It forecast a loss of income of $20,000 by 2035. In other words, American families would be paying more while making less. 
    Much Poorer. The overall effect of the agreement would have been to reduce U.S. GDP by over $2.5 trillion and eliminate 400,000 jobs by 2035, according to Heritage’s study. This would exacerbate problems with government funding and deficits, make Social Security solvency more challenging, and increase reliance on government’s spending to support households.

The Paris deal was, in short, a disaster for America and a nothing-burger for climate.""",True,1,1496361146,,1496361563,0,dicayv4,t3_6ep9fd,t3_6ep9fd,1498990690,12,False,news,t5_2qh3l,

Honestly my impression has been the complete opposite. Saying ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" does not mean we are aiming for no deal, only that we are willing to accept that rather than concede to any demand made upon us.

While Corbyn hasn't explicitly said he would accept anything the EU offers, no matter how ridiculous it could potentially be.

&gt; Theresa May has told Donald Trump that she is &amp;quot;Disappointed&amp;quot; at his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Accord on climate change.

&gt; As well as the leaders of the four European countries, political leaders from across the globe have reacted with condemnation and shock after Donald Trump confirmed the US will abandon the landmark global climate change deal.

&gt; President Trump had previously described climate change as a hoax by the Chinese to damage US manufacturing.

&gt; BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the U.S. company.

&gt; Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results.

&gt; Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing.

Contivity,,ENFP,"So far, I have tried alcohol, nicotine, weed, mdma, vicodin (taken as recreational), valium (taken as recreational). If it adds perspective, I'm 36/M. I used to think I'm ENFP, but recently find myself more ENTP. I started alcohol and nicotine early in my youth (15-16) but the rest I took only after 30+. When I was younger, I tend to drink and party hard with alcohol to the point of blackout. I don't do it often, but if I party, i party hard with alcohol. Other than nicotine, my relationship with drugs are as enhancers. I don't try to get wasted or party hard nowadays, just as supplement to enhance my chill and relax time.

**Alcohol**: the easiest to find and the most you see in social situation. I hate the taste of liquor, but don't mind it mixed in cocktails where I can't taste the liquor. I hate wine, but can tolerate simple white wine or champagne. Beer is fine. I prefer not to drink them, but like the buzz/intoxication from it.

**Nicotine**: The worst drug to be addicted to. There's not much high/upside to it, but the addiction is hard to beat. I have almost quit once (stopped for almost a year), then picked it back up.

**MDMA**: I tried it twice and doesn't really like it. First time it has a horrible come down. Both time I have a really sore jaw despite having gum. Not really my type of drug.

**Weed**: My goto drug. It gives my mind a rest from the constant racing condition. It makes me able to focus on my bodily sensation. Downside is muchies and cottonmouth. When high, I tend to watch movies that carries me to a totally different reality. I like watching period pieces (medieval), or foreign movies (European/South American/etc) and immerse myself with the local/period perspective.

**Vicodin**: This one works well with weed and gives a euphoria/drunkedness feel. Opioid addiction is real, so I do this very sparingly (2-3 times a year). The most I have done is once a week for a month and then paused for a few months before taking another one. I took 15mg.

**Valium**: Sometimes I just take them if I know I'm going to meet a lot of people for anxiety. Makes me relax and calm down. It also pairs well with weed to reduce paranoia. This substance is also addictive and I try not to take it more than once a week. I usually take anywhere from 5-20mg, but mostly 10mg.",True,0,1496361612,,1496361885,0,dicbb84,t3_6epgvy,t3_6epgvy,1498990856,2,False,ENFP,t5_2r4yi,

&gt; АукцЫон (Auktyon) is a unique phenomenon on the contemporary music scene of Russia: in contrast to the majority of genre-challenged and as a rule stylistically within the framework of contemporary canons, this group draws its inspiration from such remote sources as ska, reggae, new-jazz, ethnic music of North Africa and Middle East, beat- and pop-music of the 1960s; in spite of the eternally present messianic idea in Russian rock and its inherited didacticism, this group did not teach as much as it entertained, which apparently resulted in it being the only representative of Russia on the European club scene. 

&gt; In different forms and under different names, the group exists approximately since 1978, however, its current name, Auktyon received only in May of 1983, when it was granted a membership in the Leningrad Rock Club, and its present appearance, style, and core musicians were formed in spring of 1986, when the group was triumphant on the stage of the 4th Leningrad Rock Club Festival in the following line up: Leonid Fedorov (guitar, vocal), Oleg Garkusha (dance, vocal), Sergei Rogozhin (vocal), Victor Bondarik (bass), Dmitriy Ozerskiy (keyboards, vocal), Nikolai Rubanov (saxophone, flutes), Nikolai Fedorovich (saxophone), and Igor Cheridnik (drums). In one year, Auktyon was repeatedly successful in the 5th festival, after which Sergei Rogozhin left the group for the pop-band FORUM, while the percussionist Pavel Litvinov strengthened the rhythm section. The second guitarist - Dmitriy Matkovksiy from the cult band of the early 80's MANUFAKTURA - joined Auktyon that fall. During that period, the group attained acknowledgement on the scale of the whole country, performing at the rock-festivals in Kiev, Ekaterinburg, Vilnyus (""Lituanika-8""), and taking part in the cultural program of Moscow International Film Festival. 

&gt; In 1988 Auktyon recorded an album ""Return to Sorrento"", which has not been professionally released until now; Igor Cherednik, who left for IGRY, was replaced by a hard-rock drummer Boris Shaveinikov; and the visual image of the group had acquired a new quality, when a gifted dancer Vladimir Veselkin joined the group. A significant role in formation of the image of Auktyon during this period was played by a famous avant-garde artist from St. Petersburg Kirill Miller, who was responsible for the covers of the first albums: in particular ""How I Became a Traitor"" (1989), released in France by Voyla Productions, and ""All Quiet in Baghdad"" (1990), recorded in Russia at ""Melodiya"". 

&gt; In 1990 Auktyon took part in grandiose ecological action ""Rock of Clear Water"", and along with other participants went down the river Volga, giving concerts in Volga cities. 

&gt; From the late 80's Auktyon began to regularly travel to Europe: in the last ten years they have had several hundred concerts in France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Holland, and Check Republic. In the 90's new work continues to appear: ""Asshole"" (Erio, 1990), ""Hangover"" (SNC, 1991), ""Bird"" (Dyadyushka Records, 1994), ""Best Of"" (SNC, 1996). Furthermore, Auktyon discography also contains two collaborations with the Parisian artist, poet, and bard Aleksey Khvostenko: ""Teapot of Wine"" (1992) and ""Mountaintop Dweller"" (SNC, 1995 - based on the verses of the poet and language reformer Velemir Khlebnikov). 

&gt; After the period of relative stability, in May of 1992, Vladimir Veselkin left Auktyon, who began a relatively successful solo career (in 1991 his album ""Impossible Love"" was released by FeeLee), and in November of 1995, Dmitriy Matkovskiy has played his last concert with the group. Almost at the same time Auktyon has invited a tuba player Mikhail Kolovskiy. The main creative force of the group - guitarist and singer Leonid Fedorov. His songs (which are usually written to the lyrics of the colleagues - Dmitriy Ozerskiy and Oleg Garkusha) have a characteristic melodic language, in which jazz and ethnic intonations neighbor with a straightforward ""hit""-like key phrases, and where the rhythm allows you to stretch the most ""unfit for the voice"" phases. 

&gt; In 2007 an Auktyon's album ""Devushki Poyut"" (released in English language countries as ""Girls Sing"") of was released. It was recorded just in a few days in USA with participation of Marc Ribot (worked with John Zorn, Marianne Faithfull, Tom Waits and more) on guitar, John Medeski on keyboards, Frank London on trumpet, Ned Rothenberg on sax, Vladimir Volkov (Владимир Волков) on contrabass.

&gt; For the extent of its biography, the group appeared in various films and documentaries: ""Burglar"" (Lenfilm, 1986), ""Half-Official""(Germany, 1987), ""Rock"" (LSDF, 1987), ""Let's rock-n-roll!""(Germany, 1988). The main movie star of Auktyon is Oleg Garkusha, who played in ""Presumption of Innocence"" (1998), and ""Khrustalev! Get the car!"" (1996). He regularly appears and reads his poetry and is an author of two collections of poems. 

&gt; The many-sided and experienced musicians, the members of Auktyon regularly participate in recordings and multiple projects - Rubanov and Litvinov together and separately played in JUNGLE, ADDIS-ABEBA, MARKSCHEIDER KUNST; Rubanov played in BEES AND THE HELICOPTER, TIME TO LOVE, and METAMORPHOSIS; Kolovskiy and Rubanov play in Z-ENSEMBLE and UNION OF COMMERCIAL AVANTGARDE; Fedorov played and recorded with Nizhniy-Novgorod bard Aleksey ""Colonel"" Khrynov; Shaveinikov played with Yuri Naumov, TIME TO LOVE, and METAMORPHOSIS; Matkovskiy recorded a series of albums of his minimalist experiments called ""Hunting of …"" Read more on Last.fm.

There is the history of CO2 pollution. China is now polluting more than the entire world did this year than the world did for 100 years. 

The technology is there to reduce pollution. Chinese businesses don't use it. For example mining in Africa. Chinese companies will setup mining companies in Africa. These companies pollute much more than Western companies, yet they have the technology available to reduce it.

So while China now pumps out more CO2 than the US and Europe combined they have special status in this treaty. The US has to pay billions of dollars in free money to help developing countries and has to adopt much higher pollution standards than these countries which either surpass or on pace to surpass the United States in a decade.

Link to those many times? No League play I have seen was on those maps and neither no semis/finals. 

&gt; Your failure to watch often enough to see that is not my problem.

Your failure to comprehend the evidence presented to you is not my problem. Find one pro who is strongly approving of those maps. I found many who disprove, secondly the amount of times Standard maps were played in RLCS/ Tournaments = at least 10x more then non standard (if more then 10 ever). 

&gt; If the maps were 'banned' from ESL and Gfin then you wouldn't be allowed to play them at all. By that logic literally every map except DFH is 'banned' because you have to agree unanimously to play them.

That is literally what I wrote. DFH Stadium is a default pick since is the standard map most players agree to. They can alter the map choice (some played manfield and urban) but never to my knowledge was it on NEO, Starbase or Wasteland. Please go ahead and prove me wrong. I don't mind.

AlotOfReading,northamerica,American Southwest | New Spain,"If you'd simply like other examples of populated desert cities, Phoenix, Faiyum, Riyadh, Hermosillo, Arica, and so many more exist.

Some of these were founded in the colonial era, but urban centers in the desert predate Europeans by centuries or millennia. Great examples can be found in what is now Phoenix, Arizona and the ruins of Paquime in Chihuahua, Mexico. Both of these areas were home to thriving urban centers with high population density and in fact both are home to cities today, despite consistently arid climates. Moreover, both are (and were) well-established agricultural centers, with the nearby and incredibly arid Yuma county producing [""90% of all leafy vegetables grown in the United States, November through March.""](http://www.yumachamber.org/agriculture.html) in modern times. What's key here should be the understanding that desert climates are not necessarily inhospitable, nor were they barren even before modern hydraulic engineering. This is particularly obvious when we look at Hohokam Arizona, where [this extensive canal system](https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/p1sign028.gif) was uncovered by early settlers, lifelines of urban centers long since turned to dust. These canals and the upstream-most ""Lehi"" branch in particular used vast amounts of water, often consuming the entirety of the Salt and Gila River outflows.

Now, the overall argument being made is that urban centers are co-located with the resources to sustain them. I'm certainly not contradicting this, but it seems almost a tautology. People who are alive will obviously be living where they can access the resources to stay alive. In some cases like Phoenix, the desert itself can offer sufficient resources to enable this. In other cases like that of Arica, it is the primary port of access for the Bolivian highlands and the vast mineral wealth they contain, as well as that of the Northern Atacama. The trade these linkages produce allows inhabitants to simply import what they need, even if it's not available locally. A simple ""deserts are uninhabitable"" peeve belies the very complex and varied ways people learn to survive.

Lang’s worldview seemed to resonate. “[The weather] is obviously getting colder and colder, but they are still lying through their teeth. These disgusting Westerners never stop trying to topple China,” argued one online commenter in response to Lang’s show. “These foreign bastards are so worried that China will rise and surpass the United States. Because they are jealous of China, they even made up lies about China … the scientists are all puppets controlled by politics,” read another. The commenter continued: “Copenhagen liars! American liars!”

Over the next year, more than a half-dozen books on the West’s climate conspiracy were published in China. Social media posts theorizing an American conspiracy proliferated.

Then something strange happened. After 2011, no more climate skeptic books were published. China’s state leaders stopped their skeptical statements, and the intense online discussions diminished. Just as it was gaining steam, the conspiracy theory seemed to disappear. And along with it, any public mention of climate change denial. As climate skeptics were gaining a steady foothold in U.S. politics, why did China’s suddenly vanish?

The origins of climate change skepticism in China can be traced to a scientist named Coching Chu. A pioneering meteorologist in the 1920s and 1930s, Chu later became vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and attained national fame after authorities decided to teach his life story in school textbooks. In the early 1970s, toward the tail end of his career, he drew from historical Chinese records to hypothesize that global temperatures had risen and fallen by several degrees Celsius during the past 5,000 years — due to natural fluctuations. It was a different conclusion from that reached by researchers in the United States and Europe, some of whom speculated that the planet was cooling. Others were already finding links between human activity and the steady rise in global temperatures. And though to most, Chu’s work on cooling was a footnote at the end of his career, China’s climate skeptics latched on — less for the particulars of his conclusions than for the fact that he’d reached them independently of the West.

It is hard to overstate how critical that distinction would become in validating Chu’s work in his native country. The conviction that Western powers are trying to control and humiliate the country is a recurring theme of China’s modern political development — and closely linked to its wave of climate skepticism.

This sense of aggrieved nationalism has a legitimate historical basis. China was often treated like a lesser power by Europe and Japan in the mid-19th and early 20th centuries. Even as the Communists opened China to globalization in the 1970s and 1980s, wounded national pride remained a potent undercurrent of political life. It would eventually give rise to an intellectual movement that started in the late 1990s loosely known as the “New Left.” Members of this cadre believed China had too firmly embraced Western-style capitalism, and that to address widening inequality the state must take more control over economic life.

    In 2006, after decades of unchecked industrial growth, China’s cities were choked with smog and the country was poised to surpass the United States as the top emitter of greenhouse gases — a superlative it would claim the following year.

In 2006, after decades of unchecked industrial growth, China’s cities were choked with smog and the country was poised to surpass the United States as the top emitter of greenhouse gases — a superlative it would claim the following year. The Communist government responded by enacting the Renewable Energy Law that same year, which ordered that 15 percent of the country’s electricity needs be met by alternatives to fossil fuels. It created some paradoxical numbers. In 2009, air pollution was so bad that China spent an estimated $110 billion dealing with the health impacts, according to the World Bank. At the same time, it had quickly become the biggest global investor in clean energy, spending nearly $35 billion in 2009 alone, compared with about $19 billion in the United States. There was a strong economic rationale for doing so. Former President Hu Jintao argued that China must “seize preemptive opportunities in the new round of the global energy revolution.”

*****
&gt; SANTIAGO - Europe&amp;#039;s recent experience suggests that a fiscal contraction cannot be expansionary.

&gt; Fiscal contraction can be expansionary if markets expect that tightening today will prevent larger and more disruptive budget cuts in the future.

&gt; Despite the International Monetary Fund&amp;#039;s mea culpa for underestimating the short-run adverse effects of fiscal austerity on European growth, over the longer term, Fund studies make clear, &amp;quot;Reducing government debt is likely to raise output, as real interest rates decline and the lighter burden of interest payments permits cuts to distortionary taxes.&amp;quot; One does not have to stick to the controversial 90%-of-GDP threshold identified by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff to believe that a stronger fiscal position can help long-term growth - especially in perennially low-savings, high-interest economies like Brazil.

Better resolutions/bigger montiors/tripplehead benefits even much more.

Shall we limit possible resolutions? Shall we start banning for forcing Nvidia/AMD driver tricks of the same kind?

Shall we ban people with better pings or higher framerates? That helps a lot, providing unfair advantage against people in ShriLanka or Brazil. It is not their fault that they live in ShriLanka.

You know that net income (loss) = revenues - expenses, right? Which means Hulu's subscription revenues are on a different line than the licensing fees Hulu pays to Fox and others. Seems like you're mixing up 'revenue' and 'income'.

&gt;it would be incorrect to say 30 percent of direct income made from Hulu goes back to Fox or any other stake holder.

&gt;David and Jonathan (right). Left - Abraham and Lot . The so-called ""Medal of Friendship"". Author stamp Philipp Heinrich Müller (1654 – 1719). Minted in Augsburg , Bavaria , approx. 1710

https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD

&gt;Philipp Heinrich Müller (1654 – 1719) a German medalist (artist, engraver) was one of the most famous medallists of the end of the seventeenth century and early part of the eighteenth. He was born in Augsburg where, under the protection and patronage of the Augsburg town councillor, Leonhard Weiss, he began the art of medal engraving. 

&gt;Indeed, one of Müller’s earliest medallic productions was a portrait of Leonhard Weiss, made in 1677. In addition to the mints at Augsburg, Müller worked at the Mints at Nuremberg and Salzburg, among others. As such his medals became known and admired all over Europe, and they belong to the best of the time. He executed portraits of most of the rulers and princes of his period, and commemorative medals depicting important events in contemporary German history as well as those connected with other countries, including Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Russia, and the Republic of Venice. Müller also made a large number of dies for striking draughtsmen in wood, which even excel the silver medals.

beaulingpin,,,"The US also has a lot of natural resources, many of which are gained because of our global military presence and the marketplaces we enable by keeping peace in Europe. We get a lot more than we spend on NATO (WWII cost $4 trillion in todays dollars, not including the loss of productivity from the 0.450 million young Americans killed in combat). But I brought up Norway (which is a different country from Denmark) because life is so much better there and their markets are less flawed. It contradicted the premise of your question.

As I stated, a DRO or DRO system large and powerful enough to regulate all major CO2 producers would have to have the power to dig into the private inner workings of a company. The DRO(s) would have to have the power to use force when a market actor defied a ruling. I suppose you could force all consumers to buy things through a marketplace approved by their DRO, but then the marketplace would have to have the authority to initiate force on violators.  Either the DRO or the owners of the marketplace would be a de facto government. As the number of available DROs or marketplaces increases, transnational costs will increase as your DRO has to hire more people to develop contracts with other DROs as well as maintain sufficient knowledge of the laws of the other DRO.  It seems like having a government, but with more expensive steps and lawyers. And that doesn't even begin to address the problem of going from where we are to a world where these corporations that have failed to pay for their carbon output for many decades, as well as the lives lost due to climate change related stresses on their water supplies, or the cost of climate change refugees.  How will DROs address decades of this unfair advantage? How will they strip these companies of any gain in power attributable to a violation of property rights of others?
Also, how will DROs address the free rider problem? 

Regarding ethical consumerism, that is empirically ridiculous. I assume, as you assert you're an AnCap, that you're more concerned about being an ethical consumer than most people.  Have you researched all of the products you used?  Are you sure they haven't relied on any unfair government assistance/advantage?  Are you sure that they haven't violated someone elses property rights and failed to make amends?  Do you have time for that? Does a functioning economy have time for all actors to do that? 

Regarding your argument that a majority consensus that pollution is a property rights violation is adequate to address the problem: by what mechanism is that enforced on those that disagree with the consensus? 

And regarding that last line, diplomatic means had been used to set up an agreement to curtail pollution.  All countries except for Syria, the United States, and Nicaragua have no intention of leaving the Paris agreement, and there will be stiff market penalties (TBD) for the countries not party to the agreement. As basically the entire world has entered a collective agreement, that collective has a massive amount of economic leverage over the marketplace.

evaned,,,"&gt; Quick google search for 'no earphones takeoff' and you will see it is the majority experience

I actually *did* search for ""headphones take-off landing"" or something like that before making my earlier comment, and my experience with both searches mostly contradicts yours.

Are you Canadian perhaps?

With your suggested term, I get a link about [*one* Canadian airline](http://gofar.aircanada.com/en/go-far-answers/question/earphones-during-ttl/) that prohibits it, [a seven-year-old post](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/british-airways-executive-club/1102452-headphones-banned-take-off-why.html) about it being prohibited by the UK aviation authority (though I didn't have any problems the couple of times I've flown BA), a few other discussion threads about it being banned on one of those two airlines, [this thread](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k9778304-o10-Headphone_Earplugs_not_allowed_during_takeoff_and_landing-Air_Travel.html) about it being banned on certain middle-eastern airlines, and a bunch of irrelevant stuff (and the Gizmodo link I link below). No mention of bans on any US airlines that I saw. (Potentially you have different search results than me. Do you have any relevant hits?)

When I did my search earlier I found a couple people talking about it in a way that might have applied to US airlines, but I can't find those threads again -- and even when I *did* see them before, most people in the comments were saying things like ""I've never had a problem with it."" I also did not come across any airline policy pages (like the one for Air Canada I linked above) stating that they prohibit headphones as a matter of policy.

&gt; There's even a gizmodo article about how to 'get away' with it

You're talking about [this](http://gizmodo.com/5901044/how-to-use-your-electronics-during-takeoff-without-getting-busted)? That's not relevant to this discussion; that's talking about how to get away with using *any* electronics *prior to the FAA's rule change* made [a year and a half later](https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15254).

&gt; And here's an article talking about how noise cancelling headphones might be fully banned, even for ear-buds plugged into the entertainment system. http://pointmetotheplane.boardingarea.com/2017/03/27/electronics-ban-headphones/

That article is *also* not particularly relevant; it's discussing the rules for flights from the handful of cities where large electronics are prohibited from carryons, and whether the headphones count as large electronics.

*Edit*: Actually, one of the threads that came up has a lot of posts supporting my view. Here are all the posts on the first three pages [of this thread](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/air-canada-aeroplan/1631989-absurd-headphone-rules.html#11) that talk about non-Canadian airlines:

&gt; \#11: If it's good enough for US carriers to allow all of this....

&gt; \#16: Most European airlines do not have this restriction at all.

&gt; \#20: To be honest I am more amazed at the ability to use noise cancelling headsets on my iPad on US carriers. I can completely tune out the safety video, knowing that I have seen so many times before.

&gt; \#37: On two flight segments on WestJet I've been allowed to use earbuds plugged into my own electronics at all times - and I specifically asked the cabin crew about it, because they made no announcement forbidding it.

&gt; \#42: I've flown at least a dozen airlines in/out of Canada in the last couple years, and the headphone ""rule"" only has ever been enforced on AC. Are you saying all the other airlines are breaking TC rules? [Even Canadian airlines, where it's clearly prohibited by the aviation authority, don't seem to routinely enforce it.]

&gt; \#45: *It seems weird that I could take an AA flight from YYZ and not have to deal with this arbitrary rule,* but if I took an AC flight from YYZ, I would have to deal with it. I understand why this is so, and I do not blame AC per se.

&gt; \#46: I noticed on United they let you keep your big noise-canceling headphones on during take-off/landing, while connected into my personal media device

&gt; \#52: all of Europe has decided this rule is daft

&gt; \#60: Other airlines like United and American Airlines allow any headset.

My conclusion is that the airlines that *dis*allow this, especially in practice and not just in policy, is the outlier, and if you're not flying on Air Canada (or maybe British Airways) you're extremely unlikely to be unable to wear your headphones.",True,0,1496372724,,1496374049,0,dicjrlz,t3_6e6kqw,t1_dibtzsc,1498994940,1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,

Myanmar, having warmed to the West, turns to China again

By MATTHEW PENNINGTON

May. 27, 2017

WASHINGTON (AP) — Myanmar was supposed to turn away from China and toward the West when the United States helped the Southeast Asian country make the transition to a civilian government after five decades of military rule.

The opposite is happening: The new government is failing to attract Western investment and Beijing is on a charm offensive. China is offering economic and political support and a relationship free of the human rights concerns straining Myanmar’s ties elsewhere.

Myanmar, also known as Burma, was a foreign policy success for President Barack Obama. He helped coax its powerful generals into ceding power by normalizing diplomatic relations and rolling back years of economic penalties, paving the way for Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to take power after winning elections.

Suu Kyi’s historic struggle for democracy still evokes deep respect in Washington and Europe, but running a civilian government for the past 14 months has exposed her inability to bring peace to a country riven by ethnic conflict. She also has struggled to produce economic growth, hobbled by a lack of control over the nation’s still powerful military and a rigid management style.

Finding less love among the Western democracies, Suu Kyi is cautiously embracing closer ties to China.

“Amid the unpredictable challenges of this democratic transition, Western influence on Burma is waning, while Beijing is becoming more assertive,” Myanmar’s Irrawaddy news website said in an editorial.

Recent weeks have seen a flurry of China-Myanmar engagement. Suu Kyi met Chinese leader Xi Jinping at a Beijing summit in mid-May, her second visit there in the past year. Earlier, Myanmar’s titular president, Htin Kyaw, received a six-day state visit. Suu Kyi’s trip ended with an agreement with China to create an economic cooperation zone as part of the Asian giant’s “Belt and Road” initiative to connect with Asian and European markets.

Last weekend, Myanmar’s Navy held drills with Chinese warships. China’s state-run Global Times said the military cooperation demonstrated “political trust.”

That trust was expected to develop between Suu Kyi and the U.S.-led West.

Myanmar’s enduring fear of being dominated by its much larger neighbor, China, was one reason it improved ties with the United States in the first place. The Obama administration seized the opportunity while trying to “pivot” American foreign policy focus to Asia, hoping deeper relationships with its booming economies would provide the U.S. long-term strategic and economic advantages.

Derek Mitchell, the former U.S. ambassador who spearheaded Obama’s Myanmar rapprochement, said China was “stunned” when the country reached out to the West between 2011 and 2015. China is now making up for lost time, and capitalizing on President Donald Trump’s reduced attention for Myanmar, he said.

“It gave an opportunity for China to say, ‘See we’re on your border and we’re here to stay. You can’t count on the Americans,’” Mitchell said.

Katina Adams, a State Department spokeswoman for East Asia, said the U.S. remains committed to consolidating democracy in Myanmar and is helping the government address many inherited challenges, including the disproportionate role of the military in the economy and the need for responsible investment.

Trump has started to reach out to Southeast Asian leaders, praising Philippines’ president Rodrigo Duterte for his deadly war on drugs and inviting him and Thailand’s prime minister, who took power in a coup, to the White House. In the coming week, Trump is hosting communist Vietnam’s prime minister.

Trump has yet to speak with Suu Kyi.

For two decades, while Myanmar was under military rule, U.S. administrations and influential lawmakers adored Suu Kyi. Obama helped her transformation from political prisoner to national leader, fostering democracy on China’s doorstep. Republicans and Democrats promoted the change as a victory for U.S. interests and values.

China, which sees Myanmar as a land bridge to the Indian Ocean, saw a strategic setback.

Yun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center in Washington, said Chinese policy experts even characterized it with a proverb: “The cooked duck flew out of the window.”

She said the proverb’s meaning is clear: “Myanmar was already in our pockets but somehow the Americans stole it from us.”

But Trump may have little political incentive now to prioritize U.S. ties with Myanmar.

“What are left now are the problems,” Sun added.

—sluggish economic growth. Washington has increased foreign aid and encouraged American investors last September by lifting the remaining economic sanctions other than on arms sales. But the moves haven’t spurred economic activity in one of Asia’s last untapped markets.

Myanmar ranks 170th out of 190 nations in the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business rankings, and third-worst globally for contract enforcement. Foreign investment dropped almost a third between April 2016 and April 2017, according to Myanmar government figures, with no new U.S. projects.

—human rights. Western nations in March backed a U.N. fact-finding mission on reported atrocities against Myanmar’s downtrodden Rohingya Muslims. Suu Kyi opposed the idea, tarnishing her international reputation.

—ethnic conflict. Suu Kyi has prioritized resolving Myanmar’s decades-long wars between the army and ethnic rebels, with little success. She tried again this week, bringing rebel groups together for talks with the government and military. China has leverage with rebels near its border and says it supports peace. Resolution, however, hinges on Myanmar’s willingness to cede power to minorities and facilitate greater federalism.

On economic development, China faces wary Burmese citizens. Chinese projects have uprooted villagers and hurt the environment, factors that led Myanmar in 2011 to suspend a $3.6 billion dam primarily funded by Chinese energy interests. The suspension remains a sore point.

Mitchell, the former Obama envoy, warned of a larger strategic setback for the U.S.

Failing to consolidate Myanmar’s transition would tell the region’s autocratic governments they were right, he said, that “democracy doesn’t work in Asia.”

&gt; I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, **while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.**

&gt; For example, under the agreement, **China** will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years -- 13.  They can do whatever they want for 13 years.  Not us.  **India** makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.  There are many other examples.  But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.

&gt; Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America -- which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.  We’re having a big opening in two weeks.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.  A big opening of a brand-new mine.  It’s unheard of.  For many, many years, that hasn’t happened.  They asked me if I’d go.  I’m going to try.

&gt; **China** will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.  So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.  **India** will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  Think of it:  **India** can double their coal production.  We’re supposed to get rid of ours.  Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

As another redditor pointed out, 1/4 to 1/3 of China's greenhouse gas emissions are produced by manufacturing products for export to Western countries. And I bet the statistic is similar for India. So with that in mind, I think the answer is really simple here: China and India need to stop manufacturing products for USA, and USA can have those manufacturing jobs back. Everybody wins, except for the global environment and USA's local environment, but clearly those aren't meaningful issues here.",True,0,1496374684,,False,0,dicl8bf,t3_6erokr,t1_dicjjtp,1498995645,3,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,
