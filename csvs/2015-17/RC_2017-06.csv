Also, your point about conditioning in today's game is almost completely irrelevant, everyone is at the same level playing field today and back then no matter what type of football you're looking at. Unlike my original point, that Pele in Brazil's best team dedicated hos entire life to football, while his opponents literally could not. Similar to your way of thinking, would Pele be just as dominant if everyone else is putting 100% into their career instead of having real jobs on the side? I highly doubt it

But historically other than royalty/wealthy people, it would likely be more common anyways for a couple to have only one witness/attendant each.

""So for instance you had the Jamestown colonists laughing at the dumb ol savage injuns, running around in the woods, living in weird tents?
And the natives? They were laughing at the idiot boat people starving their winter away.
Africa had empires while the ""whites"" of Europe were squatting in bushes shoving berries up their noses.""

Don't equate me to those people, that's not at all what I said or how I feel. You're misrepresenting me.

&gt;But that reality doesn't make you feel good about your DNA so it's all ignored in favor of false equivalencies like:
certain populations are susceptible to sickle cell,
Yes and they're immune to malaria because of that particular evolutionary pressure but what the fuck does that have to do with intelligence?

That's to highlight that there are some differences in lineages, that in itself has nothing to do with intelligence, but to say Intelligence is the ONLY metric that does not vary across different groups is pretty naive. Intelligence is hereditary. ""Races"" are just extended hereditary lineages. This DOES NOT mean all of one race is smarter than another or intelligence is capped for one race and not for another, it means that averages vary slightly. Nearly all of the variability occurs within groups as opposed to between. There are millions and millions of smarter folks that don't look like me, so Spencer's ideology falls way flat.

&gt;It's like saying because some black people have curly hair it means we all have a different vertebrae count or our livers and kidney's are flipped.

Oh come off it that's not what I said at all and you know it.

OrganicRedditor,74third,,"Ottawa Sun's journalist Bruce Garrioch reported on Tuesday evening that Senators are not offering Jyrki Jokipakka a follow-on contract and that Jokipakka is returning to Europe.


- Either Garrioch misunderstood or the media in the subject misunderstood the message. The joke is not really coming back to Europe, that interpretation is a complete misunderstanding. Jyrki has already come to Europe and Finland, but this is what the players are doing during the summer break, Jokipaka's agent Ilkka Larva told Iltalehde.


Larva recalled NHL transfer rules.


- It may be that Senators will not offer a contract to Jyrki. Then he becomes an unlimited free agent on July 1st. If the club offers an agreement but we do not accept it, we will have 1.7. Limited free agent. We can't start negotiations with other NHL clubs until July 1, Larva recalled.


According to Larva, Jokipaka's only goal is to continue his career in North America.


- To continue his career in North America, we have not even discussed returning to Europe. You might think he could be found at NHL, Larva said.


Senators acquired the 25-year-old Jokipakka in NHL Trande from Calgary Flames. The Finnish defender played in Senators three regular season games but was not in any of the playoff matches.


Jokipakka has been playing in North America since the fall of 2013. He has been part of the Dallas Stars, Calgary Flames and Ottawa Senators, and has collected 28 points in the NHL match for 28 (3 + 25) power points. In AHL Matches The Ilves defender has 87 with 26 (8 + 18) power points.


Jokipakka represented Finland last autumn in the World Cup and the 2015 World Cup.

In a major control on the A45 the police on Wednesday (15.03.2017) several vehicles from the traffic pulled. Among other things, truck drivers had massively exceeded driving times.
New section
Altogether, the officials inspected 78 vehicles. Twelve truckers were not allowed to continue. A driver was the dangerous record holder: he had been sitting at the wheel of a Turkish 40-ton driver for 38 hours at a time. For the police, this was just one of the crass cases in the current control.

Tires and brakes broken, diesel and oil ran out - despite a fresh HU badge

On a truck, which was only a few days ago at the main examination (HU), not only the tires were broken, the brakes also did not work properly. In addition, diesel and oil ran out. The police now suspect that the truck was not allowed to get the HU badge. In another truck, the officials found a fake disc of the tachograph.

Unsecured cargo was also checked. The officials found around 80 used batteries. And indeed, ""old"": the battery acid was already running out and flowed through the holes of the crates on the loading floor. ""A case for the scrap yard and not for the highway,"" the police wrote in her report.

My stats are:

  -PC

  -EU player that wants to play in NA (regardless of high-ish ping, around 120-140ms) solely because of team coordination and no language barrier. (I speak fluent english, being Scottish, with an American accent) 

  -Haven't played much comp, but I'm currently ranked mid gold, and aiming for diamond, haven't gone lower than gold.

Tundur,,,"Indeed, if you accept the principle that arbitrarily giving some people property and letting them exploit the labour of others for profit is immoral, then attempting to defend that property and the system which gave you it is unjustified violence. From a communist perspective it is essentially self-defence. There are plenty of examples (like, half of what Stalin and Mao got up to, seriously what the fuck were they doing) of atrocities that must be blamed on the people who carried them out, but we should still bear in mind *why* they were in power in the first place before ascribing it to a structural flaw in communism.

I have the Russian Revolution as an example but you can pick any other and see the same patterns emerge. People do not resort to revolution until they are desperate. China, Vietnam, Korea (don't worry I'm not a Kim apologist), Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, South America, Thailand, Malaya, Burma (again, fuck the Khmer Rouge). All states held up as examples of unwarranted communist aggression and all states where, looking at the actual history, it was in fact incredibly warranted.

I disagree that a blank slate is necessary - merely a critical mass of power is necessary, and in the early 20th century it came incredibly close. All the nations of Europe came very close to revolution - the UK had the military deployed on the streets, Germany had a revolution which was only barely interrupted by a series of unfortunate mistakes, Spain was plunged into a brutal civil war, France almost capitulated in WW1. If it wasn't for the violent repression of these movements then we would have seen the majority of the world's industrial might in the hands of communism and a very different path being trod.

I can talk about the usual communist  reasoning why a moderate solution - capitalism regulated and complemented by socialist policies - is untenable but their basic conclusion is that the two cannot exist in equilibrium because capital's power is global and inherent/mechanical while socialist policies are local and based on human political will. This is avoiding entirely the ""exploitation is immoral"" aspect. This also ties in to the ideological basis for fascism and why some prominent fascists were, in an earlier life, socialists but that's a whole 'nother deal.

I can kind of rant, sorry about that. It sounds like you're at least somewhat interested in all this and it's hard to ""stumble upon"" what communists actualy believe without specifically looking for it. I'd recommend checking out /r/communism101, even if you've no intention of 'converting'. There's plenty of easy to read literature there that explains it in far better terms and language than I'll ever manage and - given how it defined the last 150 years of history - it's a useful concept to get to grips with, even if it's just for hitting on sociology students.",True,0,1496281656,,False,0,dias9je,t3_6ehd0b,t1_dian8s3,1498964115,2,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,

maryfamilyresearch,DDR,GDR,"1) Sticklers about degrees. Even if you can convince a potential employer to hire you, the employer will have an uphill battle with the Arbeitsagentur and the foreigner's office, struggling to convince the clerks there to give you a work permit. Your employer would need to prove that there is no other person (EU citizen or non-EU citizen with a work permit) who is equally as qualified as you for the job. If your only qualification is ""university degree"" the job center will find 20+ liberal arts grads and send them to your potential employer, telling your employer to ""see whether these people we send you (and who don't need a work permit or already have one) would be a good fit for the job you want to give to u/newthrooawayyy"". Unless your potential employer is your best buddy from childhood or a relative he will soon give up and hire an EU citizen. 

2) see above

3)freelancing is generally a good idea, however you'd need to show that you have relevant qualifications and or potential clients lined up. It helps if you already have a client base in the USA when you make the move to Germany and can continue to rely on that client base. Make sure you understand the difference between freelancer and self-employed. All freelancers are self-employed, but not all self-employed people are freelancers. 

4) In Germany you end up with approx 50% of your salary because in addition to tax you pay significants social security contributions, so your take-home would be even lower. 

Moving to Germany won't change your student loan debt one bit. 

Add in struggles with a work permit and the situation in Germany vs the situation in the USA will be in favour of the USA.

&gt; &amp;quot;The moment when Trump announces the Paris pull-out will mark the divorce of [the] U.S.-China climate relationship and the beginning of a reinvigorated partnership between China and the E.U.,&amp;quot; he said.

cromerax,whitenat,"Community Economics l Guns,Gold and Glory l Tribe above All","Diamond in the anthropological and historical community is disliked to say the least, actively hated at worst.

I'm not an anthropologist, and I feel that people who have read much more of Diamond's work than I could better express the criticisms that people have.

Here's are some reddit threads from /r/AskAnthropology and /r/AskHistorians 

[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1rzm07/what_are_some_of_the_main_anthropological/)

[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2mkcc3/how_do_modern_historians_and_history/)

With that being said, I'll do my best to offer some feedback on your questions.

&gt;Also, one of the alt-Right's arguments for higher IQ in Europeans is the harsher climate. How does this square with Diamond's idea that a homogenous climate there actually was ""easier""?

I have honestly never heard the ""harsh environment made higher IQ"" argument before. However, I think Diamond is missing that Europe has a fairly diverse climate from the Mediterranean South to the insane far-north ie Nordic areas, this combined with the plethora of rivers, lakes, and mountain ranges make Europe not really this ""homogenous"" utopia that Diamon thinks it is. 

&gt; Why didn't Africans domesticate ""Prey Domesticates"" to learn the skills that they could then use for ""Directed Domesticates""?

This may boil down to low-time preference. Africa is a very rich continent in terms of vegetation and agricultural capacity, so there isn't a need to domesticate these big animals, because smaller creatures are more than enough to supplement the large amount of edible vegetation.

&gt;Diamond argues that mountainous terrain allowed for fragmentation that benefited Europe over Asia by creating internal competition.

I haven't found much argument against the fracture theory, but your counterarguments are actually fairly solid. Fragmentation isn't always and advantage, nor is it always a disadvantage. It's important to account for other variables in this, and this is why Diamond has been criticized by people in his field.

&gt;Larger Population(this point was made by a History Cooperative writer in a review of Diamond's points)

From what I see the argument here is pretty good, however, if we're going to talk about how colonists diseases wiped out indigenous diseases, and somehow this trend didn't apply in reverse, we should also consider the enhanced medical knowledge and practices of colonist groups which may have contributed to them holding out longer than natives and thereby seizing the land.

All in all, Diamond isn't exactly who I would turn to for legitimate insight into development and what not. Is he entertaining? Yes, but I wouldn't count on his info too much.

&gt; Like it or not, the US dictates international relations and that influence is partially out of respect for it's diplomacy and constituents.   

The US *helps* dictate international relations. It's a big voice, but it's not the only one. The EU, China, even smaller countries like Canada and Australia, are more than capable of shaping international issues as well. They're all certainly more than capable of ignoring or actively going against the US and all have multiple times.  

&gt; When the entire country makes a mockery out of the leader, other countries don't share the same level of protest. They just assume that we're becoming a joke. And 99.9% of the information used to ascertain that conjecture comes from the US media.   

The problem is that you're ignoring that international media can report on Trump too. Most of the world hates him because he's laughably incompetent. China and all of the EU countries that have mocked him do so without the help of American media. The BBC is capable of covering his ridiculously inept attempts at governance as well. The only way to put him in a positive light is to flat out ignore the vast majority of the things he says and does, which foreign media isn't going to do anyways. Criticism is coming from within and without your country so saying ""99.9% of information"" used to reach the international consensus that Trump is a buffoon is disingenuous at best, ignorant at worst.  

&gt; Just look at the start contrast between the portrayal of US presidents over the past 25 years and the Royal Family in England. England generally does everything it can to protect it's reputation...well, outside of literally pantsing itself with Brexit, but that's a different story.  

Don't compare an elected official to the Royal family, compare him to the coverage of UK politicians. The Royal family is a family of figureheads that, because of their lineage and history, provide the country with a living connection to their heritage and culture (and a ton of tourism money). They have no real power in UK (or any other country in which they are a figurehead). They're respected, but they're not at all in the same position as the president.

Quardah,QC,Québec,"In this thread i see many people failing to realise or refusing to acknowledge the obvious factual difference in between the society that is Québec versus the Rest of Canada. Not only Québec has french roots and still stays the epicenter of french in North America, the society deeply functions differently has we have many laws overriding the federal ones.

How many times can you recall noticing ""Except in Québec..."" or ""If you are a resident of Québec..."" on things like purchasing parts in mutual funds or filling up a federal tax return? The law differs greatly.

Also the way our major cities look like is much more European that anywhere else in Canada. Look at Montréal or Québec City, the European roots dating back from the 17th century are obvious.

Not to forget the high presence of catholic heritage throughout the landscape in cities or in nature such as crosses on top of many mountains throughout the province.

And the strong nationalist sentiment... And the present culture...

And so on...

As a Québecois i have to tell you, while i've learned to accept the best out of every people i've ever met throughout the cosmopolitan city of Montréal that i live in and made a tremendous effort to become acceptably fluent in the english language to permit myself to share my heritage with everyone i would encounter in life, i find this deeply troubling that the Rest of Canada online always tries to justify it's deeply rooted hatred against my people. If you would take a moment and listen to us, you would understand we never hated the Canadian people but we only dislike the federal government for ignoring us and stepping over the will of our people every time.

Because for the federal government we're Canadians when it matter (like in 95) and we ain't when it doesn't matter (like the Churchill fall project, that they'd rather throw a gigantic amount of taxpayers money to the failing project instead of giving the contract to Hydro-Québec).

If for a moment you would give it a break maybe we could work together to achieve unity, otherwise the separatist menace will never die as we can never feel part of this country. We're outcasts and that's how the federal wants it to be.

Molly is, as we already know, a specific kind of person, with many a bias and some behaviours that are quite ... pushy, let's say. Remember the Howler in the second book? Yeah, that kind of stuff, she is vocal about anything she is against without actually checking her facts and letting anyone tell her what is happening. But, at the same time, she takes what Skeeter writes as truth, which goes against that attitude because she is letting someone she doesn't actually know dictate her what to think. Since a lot of what Molly does is *stuff that Molly does*, it's hard to use her as an example of anything as far as stuff of this kind goes unless you go “people are sheeple” which ... may not be far from the truth, actually, but that's still *guessing*.

With Ron, it probably counts, but if you think about it Ron has quite a lot of pent-up jealousy for Ginevra which doesn't *excuse* him having a verbal go at her due to her dating Dean, but certainly does *justify* it, one way or another. As his motivation for that seems to be rooted in the specific situation he is in, we could use the fact that he does it as proof that this kind of behaviour does happen at all, but we cannot really use him as an example of what is normal because of the specific circumstances. That one, of all the ones we've seen, I would tentatively count as slut shaming, but yeah, no cultural trends from it.

And as for Hermione, her behaviour towards Lavender during the sixth year, though you could count it as slut shaming if you really wanted (I personally don't) because there is more to it than just words, is quite similar to her behaviour during the third year cat/rat debacle. She disapproves *of something*, certainly, and in hindsight we do know what it is, but looking at the whole thing with only the knowledge one would have at the time it's hard to see anything but disapproval there. Certainly, we do know why that disapproval is there, but, again, with limited knowledge it's hard to say what it is other than just that, so I do not think what she did was explicit enough in its meaning to call it slut shaming.

That said, Britain, just as the rest of Europe, tends to treat sex as something a bit less taboo than USA does. As such, while slut shaming does exist, I don't think it's a normal thing as much as simply a chosen way of being cruel towards someone (or something like that).",True,0,1496287077,,False,0,diawdar,t3_6e7u94,t1_diabeyv,1498966116,1,False,HPfanfiction,t5_2t100,

hborrgg,military,Early Modern Small Arms | 16th c. Weapons and Tactics,"Typically when a new regiment of Landsknechts needed to be raised, recruiters would travel to nearby towns and cities and typically set themselves up in some local inn or tavern waiting for volunteers to sign up (if necessary, free beer might be offered to help entice potential recruits). Once recruits signed the contract they would be given a small bounty and then marched to another town where the main muster is taking place.

Once there, the recruits would be organized into companies of around 300-400 men each and receive free food and shelter courtesy of their superior officer until they had earned their first paycheck. Their equipment and fitness would be checked to ensure that they were satisfactory, and they would be taught the rules and customs of the company. A regiment would then be made by combining around 10 companies together into a single pike square commanded by a colonel.

The landsknecht pike square was based on those of the Swiss and would have included primarily pikes backed up by a smaller proportion of ""short weapons"" (greatswords, halberds, and other short polearms), and by the end of the 15th century, around 1/10th of the men would be armed with arquebuses. Over time the proportion of arquebusiers would gradually increase, but for the Black Bands of Guelders raised in 1514 the proportion was still 70% pikemen, 12% swordsmen, 6% halberdiers, and 12% arquebusiers. 

It was generally the duty of sergents and corporals to ensure that each man was drilled with his weapon and knew his place within the formation. A typical square would be organized into either what looks like sort of an onion or a hamburger. The onion would involve the best armored and most experienced pikemen positioned in the outer layer all the way around the edge of the pike square, this would be followed by layers of less well equipped pikemen, and then finally a dense square of men in the very middle armed with shorter weapons surrounding the standards, musicians, and higher-ranking officers. The hamburger would be similar but done only by ranks, so it have several ranks of pikemen in front, follwed by a few ranks of shorter weapons including officers and standards, and then several more ranks of pikemen in the rear. 

The arquebusiers for most of the Italian Wars would be deployed a short distance in front of the pike square in a loose skirmish line which came to be known as the ""forlorn hope"". Their duty would be to skirmish with the enemy, and screen the square as it advanced. Once the enemy got close they would have to either fall back behind the square or somehow squeeze through the ranks into the center. The arquebusiers could sometimes also have troops with shorter weapons mixed in with them to help provide protection during a skirmish or for leading the assault into an enemy entrenchment where pikes would be too long.

On open ground it was generally agreed that the best way to counter a well-ordered phalanx of pikes was with another well-ordered phalanx of pikes, so at first impact or the ""push of pike"" it would be the pikemen who did most of the actual fighting. If the formation ever fell apart the pike was considered too long and unwieldy to be very effective, thus if that ever happened the front ranks of pikemen would attempt to melt away, and it became the duty of the halberdiers and swordsmen with their more versitile weapons to protect the standards and cover the retreat of their comrades as best they could. Conversely, if an enemy pike square began to rout, the men with short weapons in the center of the formation would be expected to wade past the pikemen in front of them and charge into what's left of the enemy in order to pursue, execute and capture as many as possible.

sunagainstgold,europe,Moderator | Medieval &amp; Earliest Modern Europe,"Yes, the All Saints' Eve dating of the *disputationes* was probably significant--Martin Luther was not without a flair for the dramatic nor a finely honed sense of how to twist the knife once he'd inserted it. But to understand why he picked this date means looking at how the ""95 theses,"" as we call them, were unleashed.

It's *possible* Luther posted them on church doors of Wittenberg. This would not have been particularly unusual; they served as bulletin boards for announcements. In particular, for annoucements of university events like disputations (formal debates using scholastic methodology) to be held in public. Luther's theses ostensibly took the form of propositions to be debated as such, hence his original Latin label them as ""my disputations."" Taken as a whole, however, the text doesn't really lend itself to the format of propositions for an actual debate: the ""theses"" are more like bullet points or steps in an argument, with several points leading to a conclusion leading to the next conclusion.

The story that Luther posted the theses in public in Wittenberg is told by others, and later--scholars have devoted enormous effort to getting as close as possible to the event, but the best we can do is within a few years. But as several of Luther's biographers have pointed out, unleashing the theses *in Wittenberg* was kind of a dead end as far as wider polemical purpose went.  They were in Latin initially, so only legible to the elite, and Wittenberg was neither exactly the leading university of Europe *nor* a hotbed of lay (non-university) Latinate humanism. So whether or not the so-called ""Thesenanschlag"" occurred as legend has it, is more relevant for the mythmaking of Luther as iconoclastic hero from the beginning (in contrast to his initial stance of reforming the existing Roman Church, not Reforming).

Instead, we can look at how Luther actually first publicized his theses: via letter, to the archbishop of Mainz (in whose archdioceses Wittenberg lay). Letters in the late Middle Ages/early modern era weren't just bits of communication from one person to another; they served as vehicles for texts of all sorts, including sermons and treatises, with the added bonus of the ""letter"" part perhaps supplying some context (recipient, date) towards legitimizing the contents. That is, they were *public documents*--hoped, assumed, or at least grudgingly accepting the possibility of being publicized at some point.

So when Luther sent his *disputationes* to Albrecht on 31 October, the eve of All Saints', that date would be attached to the document for the learned, especially ecclesiastic (because Latinate) readers in Albrecht's household and beyond. Now, keep in mind that Luther's original opposition was not to the cult of the saints as such; in fact, Luther's own theological development shows he was perfectly fine with preserving saints' *cultus* fairly far into the 1520s, and adapted his views more or less in response to trying to tame the wilder/more radical reactions of evangelical enthusiasts.

But All Saints' Day, in electoral Saxony, wasn't just yet another day to honor *saints*. Rather, amidst the rich liturgical calendar of the late medieval Church, it was the day that the *insanely large* relic collection of Saxon prince-elector Frederick the Wise went on display--with lavish promises of indulgences for pilgrims who went to view it. Archbishop Albrecht, the letter's/theses' initial recipient, would have known this; the scribes in his secretariat would have known this; the initial discussants of the theses would have known this. And, of course, when the letter mysteriously leaked to the public--first in Latin, but quickly in vernacular German as well--the monastic, ecclesiastic, and *university* communities of Wittenberg would have recognized this.

And, Luther clearly hoped, would have been taken aback by the audacity of his proposition: funding for the university was heavily abetted by proceeds from the relic-show pilgrimage. *Doctor* Luther's willing attack on the source of monetary life for his own university, the professor evidently hoped, would help convince his elite, Latinate, local audience just how severe the state of indulgence abuse in the Church had become.

I've played a draft-format league before, but I ran into a number of unforeseen problems while playing in in that can be fixed/ addressed now (mostly due to timing error on my part, my semester at college was just starting :p).

1. What draft format do you follow? There are a number of different ones i.e. you get 3 mons from each Smogon-based tier or do you use a point system?

2. What time zone are a majority of players in? In my last league, I ran into quite a few time zone related problems because a majority of the league was in Europe and I'm in America. I know battles are going to have to be scheduled on a per-week basis, but +/- over 6 hours of a time zone difference can really get strange with timing.

3. And to follow on that question, how much of a time commitment would it be per week? I know you said the league lasted about 3 months, but I'm just wondering out of curiosity and also when would it start. (I'm starting a new job soon, so I'm going to have to work out some scheduling details.)

**An international airline owes me money, and has admitted to that as much multiple times in writing. But they simply have not paid me. How can I make them give me my money?**
&gt;A European airline refused to board me on a flight back to america because they did not have a plane available. Due to EU regulations, they must *immediately* pay EUR600 per affected ticket. I had multiple tickets on said flight. **The airline in question has admitted to fault in this matter and promised to pay the money in question multiple times, both verbally and in writing** (both paper and written correspondence). 
&gt; 
&gt; The thing is, they simply haven't paid me. They have told me a check in on the way, multiple times, but even after confirming the address (and for personal reasons, I receive international post regularly without issue), a check has never come. I have also given the necessary information for an international wire transfer but the money simply never arrived. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, they will not respond to my emails and customer service representatives reached over the phone consistently tell me i will be called back by their managers to solve my problem. Several months and a half dozen calls later, I have still not been paid. 
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, how can I make them pay me money they legally owe me? I would rather not hire an attorney if I will end up having to pay the attorney some portion of the money owed to me, but I don't know how to coerce them to pay me.

It's often referred to as capitalist during this period, thought admittedly not as fully capitalist a country as modern day US.

There's a lot wrong with this... but I'm not sure what you mean by murderhole exactly, since you admitted that capitalists DO commit atrocities.  
The Indigenous peoples of North America were murdered in the millions in order to clear the land to make way for farms and settlers;  free markets and capitalism. People living in Africa were raped, murdered, tortured, enslaved and kidnapped to the US and Europe consistently for hundreds of years in order to maintain capitalist economic production.

&gt; Steven Wilson returns with a new album, a new label and the announcement of a 2018 European tour. Titled To The Bone, Wilson’s fifth solo record will emerge on August 18 on Caroline Records – home to Peter Gabriel, Iggy Pop and Underworld – and although it’s not a concept record there is a theme: the era of post-truth.

&gt; “Looking around at the world today, it’s hard not to feel some sense of disenchantment at everything that’s going on,” Wilson tells Prog. “Not just politics, but the way people are with each other – very rude and aggressive, intolerant. It seems like something’s gone terribly wrong.

&gt; “To The Bone is the first song on the record and it seemed the right title,” he continues. “It’s about how truth is now a flexible notion. In the post-Trump era, truth can be twisted and used to support whatever argument you care to put across. To The Bone was a cry from the heart to say: ‘Please can we get to the one truth, the reality here, because I can’t tell anymore.’”

&gt; Wilson began to write To The Bone in 2015 while on tour for Hand.Cannot.Erase., amassing songs that were whittled to 11 and recorded and co-produced in December with Paul Stacey (Oasis, Black Crowes) at his studio in Clapham. The songs are more melodic than previous work and (relatively) upbeat, inspired by Wilson’s favourite 80s pop records. “This isn’t me being nostalgic,” he says. “As I’ve gotten older, my listening diet has changed and I’ve gotten immersed in certain artists again after seeing them on things like old Top Of The Pops shows. In the last couple of years I’ve found myself listening to the progressive pop albums of the 80s: Kate Bush’s Hounds Of Love, Peter Gabriel’s So, Tears For Fears’ Songs From The Big Chair and The Seeds Of Love, and Talk Talk’s Spirit Of Eden. People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era, but those records were really smart.

&gt; “I’ve got nothing against the guy but we’re living in the climate where Ed Sheeran is cutting edge,” he continues. “Those prog pop records would never get on the radio now. However, there’s still some great, clever, complex pop music out there. It’s not a particularly optimistic prognosis for my record getting into the charts but, you know what, I’m going to do it anyway!”

&gt; Maybe new label Caroline can help. “I’d always been a little sceptical about being compromised by a major label,” Wilson says. “I found out I had fans at Caroline and they’re part of Universal so the potential to reach a bigger audience is there. We’re thinking of doing three singles,” he laughs, “that should give you an indication of the nature of the record – in the past that would have been unheard of!”

&gt; The artwork for the album is also a departure. In images art-directed by long-time collaborator Lasse Hoile, head and shoulders shots show Wilson shirtless, bombarded by multi-coloured paints and powders. “I’m really pleased with it,” he says. “The first time I put myself on the front cover of an album I had a gas mask on my face. The second time I was a silhouette. For Transience, it was a stark black and white portrait. What I’ve come to realise is I do have strong personality and for a lot of my career I’ve hidden behind artwork. The time has come to not hide anymore. I also wanted to look a little more alien, so there’s a little bit of Bowie in there.”

&gt; The band line-up is also quite “intimate”, he says, with Wilson leading on guitar. “People might be disappointed by that,” he elaborates, “but as it was a different approach my guitar style was better suited.” He also plays most bass parts, joined by regulars Adam Holzman on keys and drummer Craig Blundell alongside King Crimson drummer Jeremy Stacey – brother of co-producer Paul – and harmonica player Mark Feltham. Israeli vocalist Ninet Tayeb returns, and Swiss jazz singer Sophie Hunger guests on a track called Song Of I: “There’s a very sexy, sinister vibe on that,” Wilson says. Ex-Mansun frontman Paul Draper also appears on the title track, and he and Wilson have been working together on an as-yet untitled song. “We talked about making an EP together,” Wilson says, “but let’s see what happens, at the moment we’re having fun and that’s the main thing.”

hepatitebolaids_b,,,"&gt; There's no country capable of invading Central and Western Europe.

It's happened before and I am stalwart in the belief that it can and will happen again. Up until WWII the European nations had a strong culture of militarism that is comparable to what the US has today, and even up until WWII the US didn't have the strongest military in the world. The war so thoroughly destroyed European military centers that, barring the UK and partially France, most of Europe ended up permanently losing the culture of militarism. Furthering this was the Marshall Plan extending US hegemony over Western Europe, and to keep up with this the USSR began taking control of Soviet satellite states, especially through Brezhnev's doctrines of forced membership/solidarity. The formation and cementing of NATO and the Warsaw Pact saw the US and USSR becoming joint hegemons of Europe within their own spheres, and as a result those states took direct military control in many areas, essentially disarming most of Europe in favor of Soviet and American military emplacements across the continent.

As the USSR dissolved, many of the previous strategic locations dissolved, leaving a power vacuum. There's a reason you never hear of US military bases in Eastern Europe, as one; Russia still holds some *de facto* power in the region, making any American militarization be seen as encroachment on their ""territory"" (more aptly ""stomping ground"") and furthering possibility of war, and two; Eastern Europe is economically weak from Communism and Soviet totalitarianism, namely Stalinism furthered under Brezhnev, and as such isn't worth protecting.

So, in totality, Western Europe and Germany is reliant on the US and US hegemony as a relic of the Cold War, and as a result, has barely put any effort into rebuilding their militaries from their post-WWII state.

SarcasticAssBag,,,"Honestly, I don't think that's it.

I used to hang around some skinheads in my youth in the 90s. I never shared their ideology but it didn't really matter since, at the time, they were mostly concerned with going hiking, drinking beer and bbq. It wasn't a reaction against the jews/muslims/blacks/enemy-du-jour that made them skinheads, it was a sense of belonging to something they felt they could take pride in like the cultural history of their people. This was especially important because, in their view, being interested in ""white culture"" like listening to Wagner was under attack by mainstream society.

They became ""radicalized"" when they were attacked from outside. Whenever the news did another ""PS the skinheads are still evil"" story, their prejudices about the rest of society were strengthened. ""Everyone's out to get us and you know whose behind *that*, right?"" etc.

Fast forward to today and white people, men especially and *christian* men in particular, are told that they should stfu about pretty much everything because their opinions are irrelevant by virtue of their skin color, gender and/or religion and that they are evil misogynist racists for thinking otherwise. The racial issue is more a thing in the US and the religious issue is more a European thing from what I understand. Already you have established an in-group/out-group dynamic and this is strengthened by constant ridicule from outside. ""You can't be racist towards whites"" or the idea that everything white people have or do that is also found in cultures of traditionally non-white people is appropriation and colonialism or something like that. But this is ridicule *from white people* with some sort of white savior syndrome, not from immigrants usually.

Selderij,,,"&gt; What we think of now as ""gongfucha"" was described as far back as 1801.

Here is what your source has to say:

&gt; The foreignness of this way of drinking tea was apparent, because the tone in which both Yuan and Yu wrote their observations indicated they were observing something they had never seen before and thus they described it in detail in a way only outsiders would; in both cases there was a revelation that this way of brewing tea yielded a vastly different experience than their normal usage of tea. This impression of the uniqueness of gongfucha as a way to drink tea persisted into the twentieth century.

Gongfu was already an established tradition by the time the British were looking to produce tea in their colonies. But it really was an obscure tradition even to most Chinese people. There's little chance of a westerner stumbling on it, understanding what the fuss was about, and then going back to Europe to popularize it. Even Chinese people in China didn't do that. For that to take place, gongfu had to be reinvented into a more accessible and artful form in Taiwan first.

&gt; Even if you ignore gongfu, there is a difference between other tea brewing methods in China (for example, ""grandpa style"") and western-style brewing. This had to develop at some point.

PortugalBot,,,"&gt; r/portugal *-* Ministério da Saúde quer “responsabilizar” pais que não vacinem filhos ([104 comentários](https://www.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/6el9rq/))

## O ministro da Saúde diz que ainda está a estudar a forma como a ""co-responsabilização formal"" pode acontecer. Um documento escrito é uma das hipóteses. Novidades vão ser anunciadas nesta quinta-feira, Dia Mundial da Criança.

O ministro da Saúde, Adalberto Campos Fernandes, está a trabalhar com as escolas para identificar as crianças não-vacinadas, aquando das matrículas, para que as autoridades de saúde possam contactar as famílias. A ideia é dar-lhes informação sobre a importância de vacinar, para poder haver um “processo de co-responsabilização formal dos pais”. O ministro é cauteloso mas, em entrevista ao PÚBLICO, assume que a “possibilidade mais prática” é um documento escrito.

Centralizar a compra e a distribuição de vacinas para garantir que não há falhas nos centros de saúde e alargar os horários de imunização são algumas das ideias antecipadas e que Adalberto Campos Fernandes apresentará nesta quinta-feira, durante uma sessão organizada pela Direcção-Geral da Saúde (DGS) para assinalar o Dia da Criança.

**Face à recente polémica por causa do surto de sarampo, tem alguma medida pensada para tornar as vacinas do Programa Nacional de Vacinação (PNV) obrigatórias para profissionais de saúde ou outro grupo-alvo?**  
Vamos apresentar no dia 1 de Junho [nesta quinta-feira], Dia Mundial da Criança, um novo modelo de governação do PNV, mas que tem muito mais que ver com fazer ainda melhor aquilo que tem sido uma história de sucesso das últimas décadas. O sucesso da vacinação em Portugal tem sido claramente reconhecido por todos, a nível nacional e internacional. Ocorrências conjunturais como as que se viveram no primeiro quadrimestre em Portugal, mas também noutros países na Europa, não devem levar a que se tomem medidas precipitadas e sobretudo não reflectidas.

**Que novo modelo de governação é esse?**  
Vamos apresentar um reforço da cooperação entre o sector da saúde e os múltiplos parceiros sociais, com particular enfoque numa parceria reforçada com a comunidade educativa, envolvendo as famílias e as escolas. Queremos introduzir medidas que vão no sentido de fazer um maior apelo à responsabilização individual e colectiva e nomeadamente no que diz respeito aos pais.

**E como é que esta cooperação se faz?**  
Aprofundando as medidas activas de divulgação das vantagens da vacinação, nomeadamente com campanhas de informação que passarão a ser regulares, duas vezes por ano. Queremos também trabalhar com o apoio das próprias escolas para que o valor superior que é reconhecido às vacinas seja interiorizado e para que o risco do aparecimento de bolsas de comunidades que rejeitam a vacina sem nenhum fundamento científico seja mitigado. Queremos continuar a ter taxas de cobertura vacinal que garantam uma imunidade de grupo muito efectiva. Paralelamente vamos alargar os pontos de vacinação, com o objectivo simples de que não se pode perder um único momento de vacinação.

**Qual é a cobertura nacional a nível de locais para vacinação?**  
Temos a rede nacional do SNS [Serviço Nacional de Saúde], com centros de saúde muito eficientes e próximos das famílias. Mas se houver a oportunidade de alargar estes pontos a outros sectores, nomeadamente ao sector privado e social, vemos isso como uma oportunidade.

**Quando fala em perder está a pensar nos casos recentes de ruptura de *stock*? **  
Não é tanto isso, é mesmo a capacidade de distribuição no território, dos pontos de oferta, dos horários. Por exemplo, adaptar os horários às necessidades das famílias, nomeadamente em zonas urbanas e com casais jovens. Também querermos ter uma aplicação integrada de governação da vacinação em Portugal, com as vacinas que integram o plano e com as outras, para que haja uma partilha de informação. Por exemplo, se alguém foi vacinado numa unidade privada quando regressa ao SNS essa informação está completamente partilhada. A aposta no boletim de vacinação electrónico vai ser muito forte. Vai permitir que a Direcção-Geral da Saúde tenha instantaneamente uma visão nacional do território, com informação actualizada e muito rápida sobre taxas de cobertura nacional.

**Depois do surto de sarampo houve uma maior procura de vacinas?**  
Houve claramente aquando das notícias na comunicação social, sobretudo nos casos mais graves que foram detectados, um grande afluxo aos serviços de saúde e um aumento significativo da procura de vacinas. Depois naturalmente abrandou. Com estas medidas que vão ser anunciadas a 1 de Junho [nesta quinta-feira] queremos uma integração plena da informação e em 2018 vamos ter um sistema inovador em que todo o circuito de distribuição logística passa a ser feito de uma forma centralizada para garantir que vacina administrada é vacina reposta e que não existem falhas de abastecimento ou de distribuição.

**Mas temos tido problemas que não são só de distribuição. Que são de ruptura de *stocks*. O que pode Portugal fazer?**  
Os problemas pontuais de ruptura foram ultrapassados e existiram também nos outros países. A produção de vacinas a nível mundial é um bem escasso, podendo acontecer atrasos. Sempre que há uma perturbação epidemiológica, como na hepatite A, estes problemas pontuais podem acontecer. 

**No caso da hepatite A os viajantes passaram a ter dificuldades em receber a vacina. Isso já está resolvido?**  
A DGS fez o que lhe competia, que foi atacar o surto da hepatite A e que mobilizou grande parte do *stock* de vacinas. Mas neste momento a resposta está estabilizada.

**Está prevista alguma medida, quando os alunos se matriculam, para saber se estão ou não vacinados?**  
Estamos a estudar a implementação de um procedimento que permita assegurar o máximo de informação aos pais para que os processos de decisão sejam conscientemente informados. No essencial pretende-se assegurar um processo de co-responsabilização formal dos pais e educadores que seja suportado num elevado grau de informação e torne claras as consequências da opção pela não-vacinação não apenas no plano individual mas também no plano comunitário. Está a ser desenhado o modelo operacional que permita garantir que essa responsabilidade é formalmente assumida. Quando as escolas detectarem através do sistema de partilha de informação electrónica que uma criança não está vacinada, automaticamente essa informação será partilhada com a [entidade de] saúde pública regional e haverá um contacto dos serviços de saúde.

**Mas será um documento escrito [assinado pelos pais]?**  
Essa é naturalmente a possibilidade mais prática.

**Isso poderá estar pronto quando?**  
Está neste momento em processo legislativo e contamos que durante o mês de Junho esteja aprovado para entrar a tempo do próximo ano lectivo.

**Temos pessoas que não se querem vacinar, mas temos outras que pedem a introdução de mais vacinas no PNV, como uma contra a meningite que faz parte do plano inglês. Estão previstas alterações?**

PETAAsia,,,"Hi! There are lots of ways ro replace animal testing. As long as companies like ourselves keep funding the development and validation of these tests and working closely with government agencies, industry, and educational institutions to push for humane, effective non-animal tests.


Some of the ways we can successfully test are here:



In Vitro Testing

- Harvard’s Wyss Institute has created “organs-on-chips” that contain human cells grown in a state-of-the-art system to mimic the structure and function of human organs and organ systems. The chips can be used instead of animals in disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing and have been shown to replicate human physiology, diseases, and drug responses more accurately than crude animal experiments do. Some companies, such as the HµRel Corporation, have already turned these chips into products that other researchers can use in place of animals.
- A variety of cell-based tests and tissue models can be used to assess the safety of drugs, chemicals, cosmetics, and consumer products. CeeTox (bought by Cyprotex) developed a method to assess the potential of a substance to cause a skin allergy in humans that incorporates MatTek’s EpiDermTM Tissue Model—a 3-dimensional, human cell–derived skin model that replicates key traits of normal human skin. It replaces the use of guinea pigs or mice, who would have been injected with a substance or had it applied to their shaved skin to determine an allergic response. MatTek’s EpiDerm™ is also being used to replace rabbits in painful, prolonged experiments that have traditionally been used to evaluate chemicals for their ability to  corrode or irritate the skin.
- Researchers at the European Union Reference Library for alternatives to animal testing developed five different tests that use human blood cells to detect contaminants in drugs that cause a potentially dangerous fever response when they enter the body. The non-animal methods replace the crude use of rabbits in this painful procedure.


Computer (in silico) Modeling

- Researchers have developed a wide range of sophisticated computer models that simulate human biology and the progression of developing diseases. Studies show that these models can accurately predict the ways that new drugs will react in the human body and replace the use of animals in exploratory research and many standard drug tests.
- Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are computer-based techniques that can replace animal tests by making sophisticated estimates of a substance’s likelihood of being hazardous, based on its similarity to existing substances and our knowledge of human biology. Companies and governments are increasingly using QSAR tools to avoid animal testing of chemicals, and PETA actively promotes and funds their use internationally.



Research With Human Volunteers

- A method called “microdosing” can provide vital information on the safety of an experimental drug and how it is metabolized in humans prior to large-scale human trials. Volunteers are given an extremely small one-time drug dose, and sophisticated imaging techniques are used to monitor how the drug behaves in the body. Microdosing can replace certain tests on animals and help screen out drug compounds that won’t work in humans so that they won’t needlessly advance to government-required animal testing.
- Advanced brain imaging and recording techniques—such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)—with human volunteers can be used to replace archaic experiments in which rats, cats, and monkeys have their brains damaged. These modern techniques allow the human brain to be safely studied down to the level of a single neuron (as in the case of intracranial electroencephalography), and researchers can even temporarily and reversibly induce brain disorders using transcranial magnetic stimulation.




Human-Patient Simulators

- Strikingly life-like computerized human-patient simulators that breathe, bleed, convulse, talk, and even “die” have been shown to teach students physiology and pharmacology better than crude exercises that involve cutting up animals. The most high-tech simulators mimic illnesses and injuries and give the appropriate biological response to medical interventions and injections of medications. Ninety-seven percent of medical schools across the U.S. have completely replaced the use of animal laboratories in medical training with simulators like this, as well as virtual-reality systems, computer simulators, and supervised clinical experience.
- For more advanced medical training, systems like TraumaMan—which replicates a breathing, bleeding human torso and has realistic layers of skin and tissue, ribs, and internal organs—are widely used to teach emergency surgical procedures and have been shown in numerous studies to impart lifesaving skills better than courses that require students to cut into live pigs, goats, or dogs.
If you visit the PETA International Science Consortium website you can access more information on the global work of PETA and its affiliates to promote the development and use of modern non-animal research and testing methods. A list of alternative toxicity-testing methods approved by regulators can be found here, and a list of organizations involved in the development of non-animal methods can be found here.

chatdecheshire,,,"&gt; Je sais très bien dans quel sens tu l'emploies, et tout mon post est écrit avec cette idée en tête, tu peux donc le reprendre et le relire avec cette information. J'ajoute à cela que pour pouvoir enchaîner sur Mélenchon, tu ne choisis que les critiques caricaturales et minoritaires, et prenant grand soin de ne pas retenir les très nombreuses critiques légitimes qui lui ont été faites. Du coup tu regardes les autres et tu parles des critiques légitimes qui leur sont faits, mais tu ne regardes pas les critiques non-légitimes qui leur sont faits. Puis tu regardes Mélenchon et tu ignores les critiques légitimes qui lui ont été fait, et ne regardes que les critiques non-légitimes qui lui ont été fait. 

Je n'ai jamais prétendu que Mélenchon n'a subi *que* des critiques illégitimes. Et les critiques légitimes ne posant aucun problème particulier (au contraire, elles sont souhaitables, pour tous), je ne vois pas pourquoi je les citerai. Le problème est qu'il en a subi **aussi** des illégitimes, qui relèvent de la pure invention, et que ce procédé n'a pas été appliqué aux autres candidats, avec autant d'outrance.

&gt; Bon j'arrête là pour le moment, je reprendrai si ça te suffit pas. Des sources comparant, rapprochant, assimilant Fillon et Le Pen il y en au des centaines, allant de la comparaison de programme à la comparaison idéologique, voire la comparaison judiciaire. Rien n'a été épargné. Mélenchon n'a pas connu le quart des comparaisons avec le FN de ce qu'a connu Fillon.

Aucun des liens que tu cites ne fait de comparaison point par point du programme de Fillon et de Le Pen comme ça a été le cas avec Mélenchon, sauf un seul : l'article de ""résistancerepublicaine.eu"", dont je pense sans peine qu'on peut l'exclure des ""médias mainstream"" en terme d'audience. Mélenchon a subi cette comparaison *sur France 2 à une heure de grande écoute* (entre autres).

Au passage, pas mal l'article de Slate qui date de 2012 et parle de Sarkozy. Ou l'article de la dépêche, qui ne parle à aucun moment de similitude entre les programmes de Fillon et Le Pen.

&gt; Tu fermes les yeux quand les autres se font attaquer de manière injuste, comme quand Fillon subit des attaques à répétition alors que la justice n'a pas donné son verdict, et tu es outrée quand c'est pour Mélenchon.

Je ne ""ferme pas les yeux"", c'est toi qui as du les fermer lors de ta lecture de mon post précédent, notamment sur le passage où j'évoque le traitement médiatique de Fillon.

&gt; Dis-moi, est-ce que même tu arrives à concevoir que en tant qu'individu non-omniscient, et non-affranchi de sentiments, tu puisses ressentir plus fortement les attaques allant contre ce ou ceux que tu défends, que celles contre ce ou ceux que tu ne soutiens pas voire que tu attaques toi-même ? Ca m'intéresse parce que tu donnes tous les signes de quelqu'un qui ne comprend et ne conçoit même pas d'être victime d'un biais de confirmation.

Question rhétorique ad personam qui ne prouve pas grand chose, mais bon, je réponds (ce qui ne prouve pas grand chose dans l'autre sens non plus) : évidemment, quel être humain pourrait prétendre le contraire ? Maintenant : 

1/ j'essaie autant que je le peux de demeurer objectif, comme tout un chacun. Que Mélenchon subisse un traitement inique des médias dominants ne signifie pas que toutes les critiques qui lui sont faites sont infondées ni qu'elles procèdent toutes de ce traitement. Quand Mélenchon évoque Castro ou Chavez, il est digne de critiques (et de critiques approfondies, sur ces vrais propos et pas sur la caricature qu'on en fait). Quand Mélenchon n'appelle pas clairement à voter Macron, je suis d'accord avec ce choix, mais j'en comprends tout à fait les reproches qui lui sont faits. Quand Mélenchon accuse Cazeneuve d'avoir organisé l'assassinant de Rémi Fraisse, c'est indéfendable, impardonnable, c'est de la saloperie, et il aurait du présenter des excuses publiques, mais il est trop orgueilleux, voire aigri en ce moment, pour cela (ce qui causera sa perte).

Et j'essaie de faire de même avec d'autres candidats ou hommes politiques. Je n'aime pas le nouveau ministre de l'Education Nationale, et je crains que ses réformes à venir soient catastrophiques, mais sa proposition de mettre au fin au travail ""à la maison"" à l'école est une excellente idée, que je loue. Je déteste Macron, mais je trouve que son intervention à l'usine Whirpool était courageuse, honnête et digne sinon d'un président, au moins d'un homme d'Etat. Et quand il subit des attaques par rapport à sa femme, je trouve ça indigne. 

2/ les différences de traitement dans les médias de diverses idéologies et de divers hommes politiques, je les avais observées depuis bien avant Mélenchon. Elles ont été relevées et analysées depuis bien plus longtemps. Là où elles ont atteint un certain paroxysme, c'est que pour la première fois depuis disons Mitterrand, un candidat de gauche radicale était susceptible de passer au second tour, et ça, il fallait absolument l'empêcher, tous les moyens furent donc bons et l'iniquité est devenue flagrante, quantifiable.

3/ Je te retourne la question : es-tu capable d'accepter que les médias dominants ne traitent pas tous les hommes politiques de la même manière (en intensité et en méthode), que ce soit dans la louange ou la critique ? Peux-tu admettre que l'idéologie économique dominante dans tous ces médias est le libéralisme, voire le néo-libéralisme, et qu'on voit très peu dans ces médias des représentants d'idéologies économiques hétérodoxes ? Peux-tu imaginer que le fait que la presse française soit possédée à 90% par des oligarques, que les journalistes et éditorialistes les plus importants et influents fraternisent avec des politiques et des industriels (cf le Siècle), puisse avoir une influence quelque peu néfaste sur la pluralité des points de vue, sur les idéologies véhiculées ? **Penses-tu que le classement RSF à la 39ème place de la France en terme de liberté et d'indépendance de la presse**, derrière le Chili, le Ghana ou la Namibie, est sorti de nulle part ou que c'est l'indice qu'il y a un *vrai* problème d'indépendance de la presse et de pluralité d'opinion ?

&gt; Oui, c'est ce que je dis. Tu prends un élément isolé et prétends que c'est comment Mélenchon a été traité en général: c'est une caricature. Je ne peux que te le répéter: je n'ai jamais entendu ces attaques avant de les avoir lu ici.

Je m'en fiche de ton expérience personnelle, elle ne vaut rien par rapport aux analyses exhaustives transmédia des organismes spécialisés dans la question. D'ailleurs tu dois vraiment vivre isolé, parce que Macron et Fillon (qui ne sont pas les médias, mais au moins le propos a existé par eux) ont dans leurs discours accusé Mélenchon de communisme, c'est quand même dingue de ne l'avoir jamais lu ou entendu pour quelqu'un qui prétend autant suivre les médias mainstream. Par ailleurs :

&gt; Ruth Elkrief est parfaitement médiocre dans ses analyses, et pour l'avoir écouté au sujet d'un autre candidat (de mémoire Hamon) et elle était tout autant dans le n'importe quoi; au passage la raison pour laquelle je ne l'écoute plus.

&gt; Les analyses dont j'ai demandé un lien et que tu n'as pas donné ? Ou alors c'est peut-être que les analyses en question disent quelque chose de différent que ce que tu essaies de faire passer en forcer ?

Je t'ai donné le lien vers le site d'Acrimed et d'@SI. Tu as juste à faire ta recherche d'articles par toi-même (il ont chacun un moteur de recherche, le mot clé ""Mélenchon"" renverra déjà de bons résultats préliminaires). Tu peux aussi regarder ""Les Nouveaux Chiens de Garde"", c'est relativement édifiant.

&gt; L'élégance quand on réalise son erreur, en l'occurrence de prétendre que les journalistes et médias détruisent ceux qui sont une menace pour eux, c'est de le reconnaître. 

Dit le mec qui n'a même pas lu ma phrase en entier, et qui fait passer son expérience médiatique personnelle avant celle de spécialistes de la question. Alors je répète : ""Qui est un épiphénomène lié au scandale de ses affaires judiciaires. **Le reste du temps le constat est exactement le même, et l'était déjà en 2012.**"" (autrement dit : sans ses affaires, Fillon aurait été traité comme l'a été Sarkozy en 2007 ou en 2012, avec la même neutralité voire bienveillance, là où Mélenchon et tout ce qui est de gauche radicale se serait fait défoncer et/ou ignorer). Le traitement inique par les médias de tout ce qui est de gauche authentique ne date pas de Mélenchon, Mélenchon n'est qu'un exemple parmi d'autres, qui, de par son relatif succès en terme d'intentions de vote, a été un révélateur plus limpide de cette iniquité. 

&gt; Mais cette théorie, impossible à prouver de manière bien pratique (c'est l'intérêt d'une théorie du complot), permet de se rassurer plutôt que d'essayer de remettre en question Mélenchon, alors tu la suis. Essaie de te dire qu'il n'est pas parfait, un instant, et peut-être que tu réaliseras qu'il n'a été traité que injustement.

C'est de qualifier cette ""théorie"" de ""complot"" qui est au contraire bien pratique pour la balayer sans avoir à approfondir les éléments qui la soutiennent. Mais comme disait l'autre, ""les faits sont têtus"".

Customers therefore *want* cleaner, more efficient cars because they are cheaper to run, so the manufacturers respond.

The reason the tax is higher is the governments. Now we can argue *their* reasons for doing so, it would be naive to think that's just a way to fight climate change, but the result is still valuable.

CertifiedRabbi,,,"Don't forget the racial IQ differences. If you don't factor those [thoroughly proven scientific facts](https://youtu.be/WGp06vMPERE) into your explanations for why some racial groups are more advanced than others, then your work is anti-White Supremacist propaganda - which he more or less openly states was his primary motivation for writing that book. 

Forgive me if I'm remembering incorrectly, I read his book when I was 13 and I'm almost 30 now, but I'm pretty sure that the beginning of his book started off with him explaining his motivation for writing this book. He said that a Papua New Guinean asking him why the White men were so much more advanced than Papua New Guineans inspired him to answer that question from an anti-racist, environmental explanation. 

And because his work seemed somewhat plausible, the left-wing academic and media establishment jumped on his work and spread it like gospel as part of their larger effort to combat White Supremacy - which has brainwashed millions upon millions of people. So, mission accomplished... 

The parts of his book that still stick out in my mind as being especially absurd were his attempts to argue that Papua New Guineans were just as intelligent as Whites, and his attempt to dismiss the stark differences in living standards between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

If I remember correctly, (((Jared Diamond))) completely dismissed the idea that Whites could possibly be genetically superior to Papua New Guineans by arguing that Papua New Guineans were capable of flying passenger jets just like White people. What the fuck kind of argument is that? Modern passenger jets pretty much fly themselves these days. And just because *some* Papua New Guineans have the brainpower needed to fly a passenger jet, that doesn't debunk the mountain of scientific data (not to mention the simple common sense) which points to Papua New Guineans being primitive savages that are obviously genetically inferior to Whites. You'd have to be completely insane in order to genuinely believe that Papua New Guineans have the exact same genetic potential as Germans, and that the only major differences between those two ethnic groups can be explained away by random environmental factors. 

It seems like he was fully aware that the stark differences in living standards between the black Haitians and their mulatto Dominican neighbors thoroughly debunked the environmental deterministic propaganda that he was promoting. After all, both countries share the same island and have roughly similar histories, yet the Dominican Republic is much more advanced than Haiti. Therefore the **only** logical explanation for Haiti's chronic failings is that black sub-Saharan Africans have inferior genes. His attempt to dismiss this glaring flaw in his theory was to essentially argue that the stark differences in living standards between Haiti and the Dominican Republic were a kind of racist psyops campaign that was launched by Trujillo in order to make Haiti look bad. He actually argued that Trujillo intentionally invested a lot of effort into building up the Dominican side of the Haitian-Dominican border in order to make the Haitians look like shit in comparison. The man is delusional and dishonest - just like most ""anti-racist"" (i.e., anti-White) propagandists. 

Having said that, his work isn't complete bullshit. There's some merit to to the idea that environmental differences and random luck played a role in the rise and fall of civilizations throughout history. But where he goes astray is when he tries to argue that **modern** racial inequality is also mostly caused by random environmental influences. Modern civilization is much more meritocratic and reliant on the genetic quality of your citizens. The rapid rise of East Asians is the perfect proof of this. You could also swap Africa's population with Europe's population and the racial achievement gaps would still persist.

**Salsa de roșii cherry coapte cu piept de pui la grătar**

[poze](http://imgur.com/gallery/IVbLc)

Ingrediente:

400g roșii cherry;

Ulei de măsline;

Oțet de vin alb;

3 căței de usturoi;

2 cepe roșii;

3 lingurițe capere;

1 lămâie;

Busuioc;

Pătrunjel (eu am avut creț);

Sare;

Piper;

Piept de pui.

 

Caperele se usucă pe șervețele de bucătărie. Eu am pus și șervețele deasupra și după 10 minute le-am răsturnat să se usuce de tot.

Roșiile cherry se stropesc cu 2 linguri de ulei într-un vas termorezistent. Se toacă usturoiul și se adaugă, alături de sare și piper. Într-un alt vas termorezistent mai mic se pun caperele și se dau la cuptor la 220C. După 10 minute se scot caperele, iar roșiile mai stau încă 5 - 10 minute. Roșiile se pun apoi peste capere.

După ce se scot roșiile sucul rămas se fierbe într-o tigaie la foc mare timp de 2-3 minute timp în care se adaugă 1 linguriță de oțet și jumătate de lingură de suc de lămâie. Trebuie să se îngroașe un pic și apoi îl turnăm peste roșii. Trebuie apoi să se răcească.

Ceapa se taie și se freacă cu sare și se lasă să stea timp de 10 minute. Apoi se scurge apa din ea și mai stă la marinat în jumătate de lingură de suc de lămâie timp de 10 minute.

Se adaugă ceapa și pătrunjelul și busuiocul tocați peste salsa și se amestecă cu grijă.

Merge foarte bine cu un piept de pui la grătar și alături de niște cartofi noi natur.


**Clătite cu căpșuni**

Un desert delicios și ușor de preparat, însă trebuie pregătit din timp întrucât trebuie să stea la frigider la răcit (de preferat dacă se poate peste noapte).

[poze](http://imgur.com/gallery/sOf3s)

*Pas 1*

Ingrediente:

500g căpșuni;

80g zahăr;

30g unt;

2 lingurițe oțet balsamic;

Jumătate de lămâie.

Se caramelizează zahărul într-o tigaie și apoi se adaugă untul.

Se adaugă căpșunile (ale mele erau mici, dar le puteți tăia în 2 sau 4 dacă sunt mai mari) și oțetul balsamic, suc de la o jumătate de lămâie, și coaja rasă de la un sfert de lămâie. După 2 minute se scot căpșunile și sosul se mai lasă să fiarbă încă 2 minute apoi se toarnă peste căpșuni.

Se lasă să se răcească și apoi se pun la frigider.

*Pasul 2*

Ingrediente:
200g iaurt grecesc;
150ml smântână de frișcă;
1 linguriță zahăr vanilat.



Se bate smântâna până se face frișcă. În iaurt se încorporează bine frișca proaspăt bătută și se lasă apoi la frigider.


*Pasul 3*

Ingrediente:

1 ou;

35g zahăr;

150ml lapte;

100ml apă;

100g făină;

Jumătate linguriță praf de copt;

Jumătate linguriță scorțișoară;

Un vârf de sare;

2 linguri ulei.

În făină se adaugă și se amestecă scorțișoara, praful de copt, și sarea.

Se bate un ou bine cu zahăr apoi se adaugă încet laptele și apoi apa. În cele din urmă adăugați făina. După ce se integrează făina bine de tot adăugați uleiul.

Se fac clătitele și se lasă să se răcească un pic. Se umplu cu crema de iaurt și apoi se alătură cu niște cășuni și sos.

Can Solar Activity Cause Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Extreme Weather?

Posted on August 25, 2011 *by WashingtonsBlog*
 

Some Scientists Believe Solar Activity Can Cause Earthquakes, Volcanoes or Extreme Weather


A 1967 study published in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters found:


Solar activity, as indicated by sunspots, radio noise and geomagnetic indices, plays a significant but by no means exclusive role in the triggering of earthquakes. Maximum quake frequency occurs at times of moderately high and fluctuating solar activity. Terrestrial solar flare effects which are the actual coupling mechanisms which trigger quakes appear to be either abrupt accelerations in the earth’s angular velocity or surges of telluric currents in the earth’s crust. The graphs presented in this paper permit probabilistic forecasting of earthquakes, and when used in conjunction with local indicators may provide a significant tool for specific earthquake prediction.


A 1998 report by a scientist from the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, also found a correlation between low solar activity and earthquakes:


It has been found that:


(1) Earthquakes occur frequently around the minimum years of solar activity. Generally, the earthquake activities are relatively less during the peak value years of solar activity, some say, around the period when magnetic polarity in the solar polar regions is reversed.


(2) The earthquake frequency in the minimum period of solar activity is closely related to the maximum annual means of sunspot numbers, the maximum annual means of solar 10.7 cm radio flux and solar proton events of a whole solar cycle, and the relation between earthquake and solar proton events is closer than others.


Mitch Battros theorized in 1998 that large solar flares affect Earth’s magnetic field, which in turn shifts the oceanic and atmospheric currents, which can cause earthquakes and extreme weather. As Battros summarizes his formula:


Sunspots =&gt; Solar Flares (charged particles) =&gt; Magnetic Field Shift =&gt; Shifting Ocean and Jet Stream Currents =&gt; Extreme Weather [including earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes or other extreme natural events]


Battros’ theories have been endorsed to one degree or another by:


Dr. Ernest Hildner, Director NOAA Space Weather Center
Dr. Tom Van Flandern, former US Naval Observatory Chief of Celestial Mechanics
Dr. Stefaan Poedts: Lead Scientist University of Leuven Center for Plasma Astrophysics
Dr. Ronald van der Linden, Director of Solar Physics Department of the Royal Observatory
Dr. Pål Brekke, Deputy Director of SOHO project- European Space Agency
The BBC pointed out in 2008:


Nasa scientists have said they could be on the verge of a breakthrough in their efforts to forecast earthquakes.


Researchers say they have found a close link between electrical disturbances on the edge of our atmosphere and impending quakes on the ground below.


Just such a signal was spotted in the days leading up to the recent devastating event in China.


They have teamed up with experts in the UK to investigate a possible space-based early warning system.


Many in the scientific community remain deeply sceptical about whether such signals are indeed indicators of an approaching earthquake.


But Minoru Freund, a physicist and director for advanced aerospace materials and devices at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in California, told BBC News: “I do believe that we will be able to establish a clear correlation between certain earthquakes and certain pre-earthquake signals, in an unbiased way.”


The ionosphere is distinguished from other layers of Earth’s atmosphere because it is electrically charged through exposure to solar radiation.


On a significant number of occasions, satellites have picked up disturbances in this part of the atmosphere 100-600km above areas that have later been hit by earthquakes.


One of the most important of these is a fluctuation in the density of electrons and other electrically-charged particles in the ionosphere.


One study looked at over 100 earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or larger in Taiwan over several decades. The researchers found that almost all of the earthquakes down to a depth of about 35km were preceded by distinct electrical disturbances in the ionosphere.


The analysis was carried out by Jann-Yeng Liu, from the Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research in Chung-Li, Taiwan.


Though full details have yet to be released, the BBC understands that scientists also observed a “huge” signal in the ionosphere before the Magnitude 7.8 earthquake in China on 12 May.


Minoru and his father Friedemann Freund, also from Nasa Ames Research Center, developed the scientific theory behind these earthquake precursors. It boils down to the idea that when rocks are compressed – as when tectonic plates shift – they act like batteries, producing electric currents.


“We now pretty much understand the solid-state physics of these rocks,” Minoru added.


According to their theory, the charge carrier is a “positive hole”, known as a phole, which can travel large distances in laboratory experiments.

And I agree with you that just because they can deliver pretty much the same outcome, they're not identical: they have different overheads, probably require different auditing and enforcement regimes, and so on. In many ways, the tax ought to be simpler. The thing is, we probably only get two shots at this - one attempt at a cap-and-trade, and one at a carbon tax. The EU already has a cap-and-trade scheme - EU ETS, so will only relinquish that as a very last resort, because after it, there's only one bullet left.

The UK took the unusual approach of setting a carbon price floor to complement the EU ETS. So a cap-and-trade plus a price floor - a (quasi) carbon tax.

TOModera,australia-canada-india-ireland-japan,VatoutofHell,"[The Celtic whiskey shop](http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/). For those of you who are following along on this mish-mash of Dublin whiskey tours, I went to the Celtic whiskey shop before going to the [Dingle Whiskey Bar](http://www.theporterhouse.ie/bars-dingle-whiskey.php).

While shopping in a foreign nation, I have my questions down to a science: I ask if they have any store specific bottlings, any single casks, and any store specific bottlings. I then give them a price range, snap my fingers, and put my nose up. As is expected of me.

So while at the Celtic whiskey shop, I discovered a range that is specific to them called the Celtic Cask Series. They pick a cask from an Irish distiller and then add them to a cask from either a European bodegas or wine house.

Thus I see these, and they are out of my price range. Because I'm cheap. Unless it's about food, then you better hope I'm kinky based on how much I'll cost you.

Getting back to it, I walk into Dingle Whiskey Bar, and low and behold they have 6-8 of these Celtic Cask Series. I ask for the best one for the money, and the extremely smart bartender recommends **Celtic Cask 2000 - Sé Déag 16**.

So what is this? Well it is a double distilled single malt from an Irish distiller. Given it's not triple distilled, and is a single malt, my guess is Bushmills. However I have nothing to back that up.

But they don't stop there. No, after being aged for 14 years in ex-Bourbon casks, it's placed in a special Anima Negra red wine barrel. What's that? It's a red winery off the coast of Spain near Felanitx in Mallorca. They use Callet grapes.

So that's a lot to take in. I'm glad that I a) didn't research this at all while drinking it and b) was now a bit tipsy due to the hot temperature and the alcohol.

I did take my time on this though, I did have a large water before, and did give myself time before reviewing it.

So this is a rare independent cask that was finished in a rare cask. Glad I got a dram. Let's see how this tastes, shall we?

**Price:** €250 in Ireland, however I think it's sold out.

**Region:** Ireland

**Cask No:** 1747

**Cask Type:** Anima Negra Red Wine Barrel Finish for the final 2 years

**Casked On:** 19th September 2000

**Bottled:** 17th November 2016

**Bottle No:** 358/369

**Abv:** 46%

**Colour:** 10YR 6/8

**Nose:** Lilac buttercream icing, tangerine, cinnamon raisin bread, honey, malt/milkshake, cardamon

It's hard to separate the floral aspect from the sweets. And the sweets go from light sugar to a more molasses based sugar as it opens up. Lots of malt, good amount of orange and spice.

Really nice unctuousness on the nose. Very inviting with lots of Xmas spices, developed sweet bread notes, and floral aspects. Hell I'm not the biggest orange fan and I love the acidic nature and what it does here.

**Taste:** Violets, plum, heather/honey, candied yogurt, raisins, cereal

Floral continues with some darker fruit notes. Not as complex on the taste than the nose. It's the right amount of cereal, right amount of sweetness, and an odd creamy note.

I guess the closest I can say it is is those yogurt covered raisins but not developed enough for both of the flavours to be intrinsically tied together. Does that make sense? Maybe it doesn't. I don't know. I feel like this could almost be given a few more months and they would connect.

**Finish:** Malt, candied plum, floral chocolate, oak, pickled hot pepper

There's some vinegar here with some sweet heat. Floral and chocolate aspects can't be separated. Good amount of candied flavour.

This tries to be close to the nose, but the malt aspect hasn't grown as much. Or rather there's still a ""raw"" malt flavour here with the other flavours that grew out of it.

**Conclusion:** Wow, what an interesting whiskey. Honestly has some really unique, interesting, and complex notes.

Finish was a lot longer than other Irish whiskies I've had. The finish needed some more time, or picked up some heat from the red wine. Could be either. The honey/floral elements throughout are amazing. The unique aspects are picking up.

Add to that this isn't cask strength. I can only imagine what 4% more would have done. Maybe too hot? Or perhaps some of the disconnected parts wouldn't have been. However that's just me going back and forth. This is like a nice Lowland that hung out with some older Bourbons or some strong Sherry casks. Really tasty, not to be missed.

SaveJunyo,,,"A ce sujet, je n'ai que quelques pistes qui me viennent de mon expérience personnelle : 

* Je place le curseur à partir des attentats du 11 septembre. Les années 2001-2006 ont été très compliquées à vivre pour les musulmans installés en Europe, qui se prenaient dans la gueule des flots de merde issus des responsables politiques, des médias et de société en général pour un truc avec lequel ils n'avaient rien à voir. Ça a participé à un repli communautaire fort : tout à coup, les Français de confession musulmane (pour parler de nous) se sont rendu compte qu'ils n'étaient pas Français aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes : ils étaient redevenus musulmans, ils étaient redevenus arabes. Donc, le premier réflexe a été de se réfugier dans le communautarisme ; soit par peur, soit par dépit, soit par défiance. 

* Internet a beaucoup joué dans la transmission. Il y a des communautés qui se sont créées sur Internet, et comme souvent, ceux qui y prennent la parole sont les plus rigoristes. Du coup, y a ce que j'appelle (parce que je n'ai pas d'autres mots) un Islam internétisé qui a débarqué depuis quelque temps : des mecs se sont mis à prêcher de manière très rigoriste, mais en utilisant les codes de Youtube par exemple (ce qui a participé à la popularité de leurs propos), des pages Facebook se sont créées, etc. Certains mots/expressions sont limite devenus des mèmes, ont été popularisé chez les plus jeunes, etc. Désolé, je bâcle un peu car je suis pressé. 

* Le marasme identitaire dans lequel sont plongé, encore aujourd'hui, les personnes issues de l'immigration nord-africaine et de la tradition musulmane. En 2017, si tu as des gosses de 8 ans qui brandissent le drapeau d'un pays dans lequel ils n'ont jamais foutu les pieds, dont ils ne connaissent ni l'histoire, ni la langue, alors que leurs propres parents sont nés en France : c'est qu'il y a un souci. Souci qui ne peut pas être toujours imputables à ces populations : je ne reviendrais pas sur les problèmes de ségrégation géographique, de chômage, de difficultés d'accès à la culture, d'impression d'être marginalisés, etc. 

Je viens d'une famille algérienne, traditionnellement musulmane. Quand j'étais gamin, il n'y avait que les vieux qui priaient ; le Ramadan se pratiquait à l'Américaine comme on disait à l'époque (il était fait de manière aléatoire, surtout par les jeunes) ; seules les femmes âgées portaient le voile ; personne ne mangeait vraiment hallal. Tout a changé après le 11 septembre et l'invasion américaine en Irak. 

Je connais beaucoup de gens qui se sont tournés vers une pratique plus forte de l'Islam lorsqu'ils se sont rendu compte que quoiqu'ils fassent, qu'importe qu'ils soient bardés de diplômes, qu'importe qu'ils aient un statut social important, qu'importe qu'ils embrassent les valeurs de la France comme on dit et qu'ils se comportent comme des citoyens investis et responsables : ils ne seront jamais assez Français. Toujours trop arabes, toujours trop musulmans. Résultat des courses : l'apparition récente d'une pratique plus forte, encouragée par les pays de la péninsule arabique, éloignée de la pratique de leurs parents/grands-parents berbères ou africains. 

La recrudescence du voile dans la rue en est le résultat visible. ",True,0,1496316162,,False,0,dib9bbk,t3_6elfnt,t1_dib7t93,1498972431,16,False,france,t5_2qhjz,

Yeah, that's a whole​ 'nother story. But then again it shouldn't be forgotten that the EU is primarily a coalition of sovereign states. So those states need a strong representation in shaping the union. So council and (to a lesser extent) commission are necessary. My point was more that in general the consensus based operations of the EU parliament are much more like continental systems  and British politicians never quite fit in there. They tried to win their battles by blocking and vetoing when they should have done so by coalition building with like-minded MEPs from other countries .(You can even see that difference in philosophy in the shape of parliament rooms, the antagonistic benches of Westminster and the inclusive amphitheatre of the German or EU parliaments).

If you want to purge atmospheric CO2, there are two serious routes. One is to grow biomass, reduce that to char and bury it. As it is both stable in soil and active in ion exchange you can use it as a soil conditioner, up to a certain point. But how do you get paid for this? 

The second mechanism is to accelerate geochemical ageing. The erosion fo the Himalayas removed huge amounts of CO2 as carbonate, depositing it under Bangladesh and offshore. Crushing basic basalts - such as the Indian Deccan traps - will have the same consequences. You can make rice paddy with the powder whilst it fixes carbon. I suggested a scheme that would sell carbon credits, whereby Indian peasants would learn to construct wind-powered stamp mills from local materials, thus getting and income and new paddy. 

In truth, though, even though humans have now moved about one and a half times the mass of the Himalayas in construction materials, the likelihood of either route having significant impact is negligible.

Some of these methods are illegal in parts of the Europe like, for example, attaching IP's to persons identity without their consent.

&gt;The assumption I would do would be that if the person is willing to go as far as to open up an alternate account for nefarious purposes using a small pile of real cash he/she would also do its best to make sure that alternate account can not be connected back to his main.

Right, and opening a second internet account or using a proxy would be those methods.  Still, just because it is spoof-able does not mean we shouldn't take every precaution.  The alternative is a game universe where consequences for actions only apply to those who are unable or unwilling to spend extra cash.

Lepew1,,Not A Liberal,"Look, I think perhaps we are emphasizing different things.

Let me first begin with a real life story of a friend of mine and his daughter. His daughter, K., was playing basketball in middle school. She threw in a ball and it accidentally hit another girl. That girl got mad and accused her of deliberately hurting her, and told her she was going to get her. Pretty typical middle school stuff so far. Later in the day, K. noticed she was getting dirty looks and having people avoid her. The girl who had been hit had spread it far and wide that K. was a racist. She was shunned, and went through a period of mental illness. Even though my friend went to the principle to straighten this out, there was not much that could be done. Things came to a head in high school when her black boyfriend stood up and defended her against charges of racism that persisted. To this day that girl is withdrawn, has no good friends, now has weight issues, and has self esteem issues.

When I cite this, I do not say misusing charges of racism is normative. Nor do I discount there are indeed real instances of racism. Please please do not put me in those positions, I do not hold them.

The reason why I cite this is because some people use allegations of racism to hurt others, to control others, to take others out of the picture. And I have seen enough instances of this kind of abuse with cries of Islamophobia, as well as strategy of our enemies to know terrorists are exploiting this to their advantage. 

This does not mean I discount real instances of religious bias against Muslims. I would like to say however that the FBI hate crime registry shows antisemitism is far far more common than anti Muslim bias in this nation right now, and my perception from media coverage is the exact opposite.

I think we can do both here. Make American Muslims who abide by our laws and Constitution welcome, and yet remain vigilant and wary of those who will misuse our compassion against us.

I did ask RichardAClark on IAMA about causes of radicalization, and he said

&gt;Radicalization in Europe and the Middle East are somewhat different one from the other. In Europe, young Muslims are often disaffected because they feel discrimination by the majority. In the Middle East, the allure is more ideological. The terrorist distortion of Islam is appealing to youth who seek a cause and find none in their own societies. There needs to be an ideological counter-weight, something for people to believe in, something that offers a future better than the past, something they can participate in.

It was a bit unsatisfactory because his response did not cover the US, but it does show that for Europe, perhaps your view may have some weight, but not so for the Middle East.",True,0,1496319038,,False,0,dibasc0,t3_6cyi5l,t1_diapacu,1498973146,1,False,AskALiberal,t5_2ukxe,
chatdecheshire,,,"&gt; J'ai lu ta phrase, elle ne change rien à ce que j'ai dit. Et le sous-texte que tu ajoutes renforce ce que j'ai dit, à vrai dire. Si les médias font et défont les candidats selon leur volonté de détruire ""la gauche authentique"", et mettre au pouvoir les amis des ""oligarques"", alors Fillon n'aurait pas été détruit par les médias. Ses affaires n'auraient pas été reprises en boucle, etc. 

Il ne l'aurait pas été s'il avait été le seul candidat susceptible de mettre en place une politique favorable à l'oligarchie. D'ailleurs durant la campagne présidentielle, le financement douteux de sa campagne, que Hamon avait pourtant pointé lors d'un débat, n'a jamais été monté en épingle par les médias malgré le côté louche. De même que la déclaration de patrimoine de Macron (qui déclare à peine plus que Nathalie Arthaud), alors que le type a gagné des sommes très élevées il y a quelques années.

Ensuite, nous ne sommes pas dans une république bananière (pour contredire nous-savons-qui :D ) : les médias ne sont pas dans une propagande simpliste digne de Goebbels, ni dans un contrôle total des imprévus. Ils orientent les sujets de manière subtile (par exemple, lors d'un mouvement social, en faisant un micro-trottoir de 2 minutes pour relever le mécontentement des usagers qui subissent un blocage, en recueillant l'avis du ministre ou du gouvernement pendant 1 minute, puis en interrogeant 20 secondes un délégué syndical), parfois s'adonnent à la censure mais discrètement (comme TF1 qui oublie entièrement de parler dans le JT d'un accident survenu dans une maintenance de centrale nucléaire sur un chantier ... Bouygues), mais ne peuvent passer sous silence des évènements importants. La manipulation ou la censure ne doivent pas (trop) se voir, quand même, quand elles surviennent. Et l'affaire Fillon, ils ne pouvaient pas faire autrement que d'en parler, pour plein de raisons : la première fois qu'un candidat à la présidentielle est aussi ouvertement soupçonné de scandale judiciaire, cette situation étant aggravée par le statut du candidat (le favori + se présentant comme le chevalier blanc), et le tout ayant pris des allures de feuilleton de par la persistance (il n'y aurait rien de toute cette hytérie si Fillon s'était désisté dès le départ en laissant la place à un autre) et la défense catastrophique du candidat partant dans la surenchère, et les révélations successives. Tous ces facteurs *exceptionnels* ont fait que les journalistes ne pouvaient pas faire autrement que de l'évoquer, il n'était plus possible de dissimuler ou détourner dès lors que la machine était emballée. C'est pour ça que je parle d'épiphénomène (on n'a jamais eu ça avant, d'ailleurs). D'exception qui confirme la règle si tu préfères. On peut observer les traitements médiatiques de la gauche radicale en dehors de ce phénomène là (en faisant abstraction ou en regardant les occurrences d'élections précédentes) pour voir que le constat persiste. Le dernier candidat se présentant comme gauche radicale, c'était Mitterrand, et il a lui-aussi été qualifié de ""communiste"" par ses opposants (et à la limite, étant donné qu'il avait fait un ""programme commun"" avec le PCF, PCF qui à l'époque était encore communiste avec Marchais, la critique était ""légitime""), et ceux-là ont même évoqué qu'à son élection, ""les chars russes déferleraient sur Paris"". Ça ne date pas de Mélenchon, donc.

&gt; Ta vision des médias est bien trop simpliste pour te permettre d'avoir une compréhension pleine de la situation. Tu sembles imaginer les journalistes comme des fourmis dociles, sans conscience ni opinion, répondant au doigt et à l'oeil à des éditorialistes, eux-même fourmis dociles et au cerveau lavé, qui répondent aux oligarques. Tu ne t'arrêtes pas pour te dire que si c'était vrai, Fillon serait président aujourd'hui, qu'importent ce qu'aurait dit un Canard qui pour le coup aurait été enchaîné, ostracisé dans un coin.

Ce n'est évidemment pas aussi caricatural, mais ce n'est pas non plus l'exact inverse. Oui, les oligarques et leurs actionnaires ont une *influence* sur les lignes éditoriales des organes de presse qu'ils possèdent (et comme ils possèdent 90% de la presse, cela signifie que 90% de la presse sera *influencée* pour être hostile à des candidats qui menacent leurs intérêts, donc Mélenchon dans le cas de 2017). Serge Dassault est connu pour censurer des articles du Figaro, et l'oeuvre récente de Bolloré est édifiante (il ne se cache même plus). La presse n'est pas ""aux ordres"", et les journalistes ne sont pas des petits soldats, mais il y a des influences, des tendances, une manière de manipuler l'information ou de l'auto-censurer qui existent et ont déjà été décrites. Je t'invite, en plus des Nouveaux Chiens de Garde, à lire divers articles ou livres de Aude Lancelin, qui a été notamment licenciée pour motifs politiques. Et également à visionner ""la Fabrication du Consentement"", de Chomsky, qui traite de cette manière dont les médias font de la propagande dans un contexte de démocratie (là encore, on voit que ça ne date pas d'hier).

&gt; Du coup non, je ne balaye rien du tout. Les faits sont têtus, et les faits sont que cette théorie se fait fracasser par ceux-ci: il n'y a pas de complot.

Tu es le seul à parler de complot. Personne n'a parlé de complot, personne n'a dit que les méchants oligarques se réunissent dans une salle obscure autour d'une table pour décider de comment ils vont conquérir le monde le mois prochain. La critique des médias ne relève d'ailleurs jamais du complotisme. Les Pinçon-Charlot (à qui tu n'accordes pas de crédit non plus d'ailleurs) expliquent justement en quoi ça n'a rien d'un complot, que c'est davantage une forme de ""corporatisme"", même si eux préfèrent, avec leur vision marxiste, parler de solidarité de classe. De la même manière que j'ai dans mes proches un policier qui va avoir tendance à défendre la police quand il y a aux infos des sujets relatant les violences policières. Et bien à aucun moment je ne me dis qu'il y a un ""complot policier"", et que les policiers se réunissent tous en secret pour se mettre d'accord de toujours se défendre entre eux quand ils sont critiqués.

Sur ce, je vais te laisser répondre et ce sera toi qui auras le dernier mot, je ne répondrai plus ensuite. C'est trop fatiguant de discuter avec toi : tu fais de l'ad personam, tu martèles avoir des ""arguments"" ou ""avoir réussi à démontrer"" des choses qui ne correspondent pas aux propos de ton interlocuteur, tu remets en question la crédibilité des organismes spécialisés dès lors qu'ils contredisent ta vision des choses (sûrement de la dissonance cognitive), et tu parles d'idéologies dont tu n'as qu'une connaissance très primaire.

KronckTE,avatar avatar-faris0,Faris Nyannyan,"0 is confusing man, the way which they wrote the history wasn't the best... But don't worry there's explanation for everything:

1 - I'll summarize this one (it's too damn long), the worldline where we start (1.129848%) is a worldline already affected by Promised Rinascimento's actions, Okabe is already supposed to receive the D-Rine even in your first playthrough (going to promised is just a gameplay factor), but okay... At the shrine, not receiving the D-Rine after turning the phone off will cause a HUGE worldline shift, in this branch of the story, Kagari run away in 1998 (because of Leskinen's brainwashing), but got caught by Reyes first, she got interested in Kagari's brain and decided to brainwash her and then put Kurisu's memories on her brain, but she escaped before that (in some worldlines, she only escaped after having Kurisu's memories downloaded already).

After escaping, she was hit by a truck and lost her memories. Ok, jumping to Promised, the fact that she was attracted by the music, is proof that she was at least half brainwashed, and then 1 year later, Okabe reached a dead end in his research for Steins Gate. He noticed that PR worldline wasn't enough, he would need to experience new futures and new pasts, and luckily one of them would lead to the door, that's why he erased the entire PR worldline, only carrying the hint of ""deceiving the world"".

He sends the D-Rine after the shrine, because it was from this point beyond that he stopped talking to Kurisu, and he wanted to change that (YES, in PR worldline, Okabe's phone was on after the shrine and he didn't went to Vega, he was still lead to PR), after receing the D-Rine, Leskinen which was spying Okabe's phone through a hidden function of the Amadeus, noticed that and therefore got more interested in Okabe.

But, that's not everything... By sending the D-Rine, Okabe went back to the original worldline (1.129848%) and this one is already affected by the future as well, for example: In this worldline, WW3 will start sooner that PR, because Leskinen will get the information quicker because of the D-Rine and take control of the War at the start at least, so... In the future, when he brainwashed child Kagari, he passed to her information about how to find him, so at 1998 Kagari got caught by Leskinen instead of Reyes. After discovering that she was brainwashed by his future self, he cooperates with her, promising the safety of Mayuri, she is trained to be a soul less soldier and goes through that transformation to look like Yuki (Leskinen then makes the real Yuki goes to Europe), by this... She would be watching the labmems and their actions as a spy and still be close to her mother. And by Kagari, Leskinen even gets information of Suzuha's Time Machine and that leads to Vega.

2 - Will lead to WAR and that horrible future, in Recursive Mother Goose, Kagari goes with Suzuha to make Mayuri slaps Okabe, but it probably failed and they got stuck in time just like Vega.

3 - When Suzuha and Mayuri went to the past, their time machine appeared just after Suzuha and Okabe went to July 28th in their first attempt to save Kurisu, so... Without going out of the time machine, Future Mayuri called Past Mayuri by phone and explained everything to her, to be strong and to don't let Okabe give up, or else Hououin Kyoma would die. But the first time machine (Okabe and Suzuha) was about to come back, so Suzuha and Mayuri quickly vanished to avoid a Paradox, but the time machine went out of fuel and the kerr black hole got crazy and sent them millions of years away. In MWC, that's not the same Okabe as Vega, that's a totally different worldline where during 14 years Okabe changed again and again until he reached the perfect one. And then he had to enter into that time machine which could track at what time Mayuri and Suzuha where and save them! If he suceeded or not... We don't know.

Edit: One more detail... Reyes and Leskinen works for Stratfor, BUT Reyes also works for DURPA she's not Leskinen's ally, she's there only to get information of the Amadeus. Since she doesn't have acess to Amadeus, she wanted to find someone with the perfect brain to download Kurisu's memories into it and then torture the person to speak everything about the Time Machine thesis.",True,0,1496319604,,1496320257,0,dibb439,t3_6ef0e7,t3_6ef0e7,1498973303,6,False,steinsgate,t5_2t8ve,

- Location of Duchies: Since RD's Prosperity changes it really doesn't matter where you start, you can always develop your land. Therefore now it isn't a matter of which duchy is the biggest/most wealthy, but rather where it is. If you choose 12/13 counties which fit into 2/3 duchies and they're all connected(even by straits) and in the same De Jure Kingdom, you're set.

- Coastal: The more coastal counties you have in your demesne, the better. Others have already explained why. Just make sure to have a MR nearby to reap its benefits.

- Silk Road: If you happen to play not in Europe, than go after those sweet Silk Road TPs. They give quite a bit of money. They even make some landlocked counties better than coastal ones who don't have them.

One extra thing: be sure to only have 1 castle and 1 temple in each county you own. Fill the rest with cities and give them to the same person(without exceeding their demensne limit, of course). For example, having 5 cities in your capital and giving 3 of them to one mayor and 2 to another can net a total of 20 ducats a months in the lategame, just from *one county*.

TheForeignMan,,,"Well not really it is quite clear; liberalism is focussed on ideas of freedom and equality.  
In terms of economy, this means freedom from barriers to trade (ie no tariffs, no government intervention, no subsidies etc), freedom for workers (ie no controls of immigration, no rules banning classes of workers from working certain jobs etc).  
It is well established economically that markets work best if they are perfectly competitive - that is to say there are no barriers to entry or exit, everyone (businesses and customers) have perfect information and everyone acts rationally. This leads to perfect allocation of resources. However, it is quite obvious that this is very difficult (perhaps impossible) to achieve in the real world. As a result, all markets are inefficient in some way and likely leads to someone (either businesses or people) being disadvantaged and this needs to be corrected.   

This is where liberal government comes in - although in an ideal world there wouldn't be any need to implement rules, this is the real world. An example of this is smoking: it is well established that it is bad for your health, however this only occurs 20-30 years after you start smoking. Therefore people act irrationally and buy cigarettes, people get ill which costs them and the economy (cost of healthcare and opportunity cost from loss of output). This leads to what's called a negative externality - the whole cost of the product isn't fully priced into it. So government sticks a excise duty to try to combat this.  
Similar things are done throughout everything, from immigration controls to child tax credits.   

This is why you can get parties or people who are liberal but have differing views on things.   
The EU is extremely liberal if you are a member as there very few barriers to trade with other members. But they are extremely protectionist to non-members. Would a liberal be for or against the EU?  
What about taxation? Obviously government needs funding, but what level should tax be set at? etc.   

I imagine your criticism of Thatcher, Major etc is they didn't support individuals who were not treated well by their economic policies, and I definitely agree with this - they essentially forgot about the individual freedom branch of liberal policies.

attofreak,india,India,"&gt; btech(fron the engineering colleges) is an option but it won't help something who plans of getting into academia.

Ahem. Former Engineer, current scientist here, living in Europe. A bachelors is not the final word on your fate or profession. It is absolutely nothing but a starting point. The whole point of Bachelors is to teach you how ignorant of the world you have been till now.

I was interested in Physics, Computers, Math. I went with engineering, because at the time, I really, really wanted to know what the hell is going on inside that big box (we had those old, giant CRT monitors) and how does it do all the awesome stuff? Reading more and more, I got really interested in the fundamental Physics part, so I went for my Masters in Theoretical Physics. Did PhD last year in Physics and now working as a researcher. I want to get into academics as well, and am planning on such a trajectory with my supervisor. There is still a long way to go.

To get into academia, you have to get a PhD, *at least*. So you can do a B. Tech./B.E. now, and later switch to Physics during Masters. I would still recommend the B.Tech route because it has the 4 year mandatory course. Some BSc colleges are still stuck with the 3 year system, and that is not always recognised in universities/colleges abroad (an option you should keep in mind for Masters). There is also more experimental/practical focus in BTech/BE, whereas BSc tends to be theoretical. It should not be this way, but that's the system we currently have to work with.

Some top DU colleges are a great starting point. Just keep in mind that a Bachelors doesn't define you, and it isn't even that relevant. Even our engineers need to be trained for months before they do the real job.

Study with diligence in college, no matter which line you pick, B. Tech. or B. Sc. Keep an eye out for any research groups. Usually, there is an Applied Physics/Engineering Physics department, which comes close to experimental/theoretical Physics research. Get a feel of that environment, the struggle the PhD students there go through. Be proactive and wake up every day with this goal in mind.

[deleted],,,"That isn't very strange at all. Most true Neo-Nazis(ideologues as opposed to social affiliation) because they see the liberalized western world as being corrupted. Some take it to an extreme of it being completely rotted out and incapable of being salvaged. Their views about religion differ, but its generally between ""Christianity is the foundation of European culture and will again be our guiding light"" and ""Christianity in its reformed state is/has become a tool of the wicked and exists in contrast to our goals."" Those who take the latter approach often find themselves in alignment with Islam's uncompromising and unreformed warrior/divine justice ethos. It wouldn't take too much to make that jump imo. 

People like to think of those with fascist ideology as being ""just a sad little existence with violent tendencies who wants to belong to a group that tells him that he's great and special"" but that is honestly really naive. Do people think the same of revolutionary communists? No, they see those people as generally intellectual and forthright people who just occasionally go too far. The fact is that fascism was a fairly legitimate ideology at one point and has plenty of literature that presents arguments that can be persuasive, even for average people, as has been proven in whole countries electing fascist leaders. The truth is what you described is actually all people, not some small out-group of pathetic weaklings. I agree fascism is often taken up because of some feeling of a lack of control or inadequacy being projected outwards onto society, but you probably aren't totally right in your assessment about the reason for this change. Just because it feels right to mock and belittle people who commit evil acts doesn't mean they are all one-dimensional pathetic simpletons looking for an outlet for their blind hatred. I find its often quite the opposite.

Nigel_Kervane,,,"&gt;**Les documents Malta Files montrent que Renault, PSA Peugeot Citroën et Auchan ont économisé 141 millions d'euros d'impôts en localisant leurs activités d'assurance à Malte, asséchant d'autant les recettes fiscales de la France. Une pratique légale, mais d'autant plus choquante que Renault et PSA ont l'État à leur capital.**

&gt;Le salarié le plus productif du groupe Renault ne travaille pas au siège de Boulogne-Billancourt, mais à Malte. Ce collaborateur injustement méconnu réalise, à lui tout seul, 108 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires par an. Mais ce n’est, en réalité, pas un génie des affaires. C’est seulement l’unique employé de RCI Insurance Limited, l’une des deux sociétés d’assurances maltaises du constructeur automobile. Des boîtes à fric, dont l’unique objectif est d’échapper à l’impôt et de priver la France de recettes fiscales, dont elle a pourtant grand besoin.

&gt;Les sommes en jeu sont considérables. Grâce aux documents Malta Files, analysés par Mediapart et ses partenaires de l’EIC, nous avons pu établir que Renault a économisé 62 millions d’euros d’impôts en quatre ans en localisant ses activités d’assurances à Malte. Pour son concurrent PSA Peugeot Citroën, ce sont 57 millions en cinq ans. Tandis que le groupe Auchan a réduit sa facture fiscale de 22 millions en trois ans. Soit un total de 141 millions d’euros d'impôts éludés, dont les services publics français ne verront jamais la couleur. Et la somme ne cesse de gonfler, année après année.

&gt;Cette optimisation fiscale est a priori légale. Elle n’en est pas moins choquante. En particulier pour Renault et PSA, qui ont l’État à leur capital. La France reste, avec 19,7 % des actions, le premier actionnaire de l’ex-régie Renault. Chez PSA, l’État a pris 13 % du capital en 2014 pour 800 millions d’euros, afin de sauver le constructeur de la faillite. Guère reconnaissant, PSA n’en continue pas moins à réduire ses impôts en France grâce au paradis fiscal maltais. 

&gt;Le montage concerne les « captives d’assurances », qu’on appelle ainsi parce qu’elles travaillent exclusivement pour les grands groupes qui les ont créées. Chez Renault (RCI Banque) et PSA (Banque PSA Finance), elles vendent bien sûr des assurances auto. Oney, la banque des supermarchés Auchan, assure les voitures, mais aussi les habitations. Toutes font également dans l’assurance vie, pour couvrir les crédits qu’elles accordent. Par exemple, lorsqu’un client emprunte 10 000 euros chez RCI Banque pour acheter le dernier Renault Kadjar, il doit souscrire une assurance qui remboursera Renault en cas de décès. Idem lorsque qu’un client puise 100 euros dans le crédit revolving de sa carte Auchan pour payer ses courses du samedi.

&gt;Ce que les clients ignorent, c’est que leurs primes d’assurance atterrissent à Malte. Dès 2013, un rapport parlementaire sonnait l’alarme sur l’usage des captives d’assurances comme outil d’optimisation fiscale à grande échelle : « Il est ainsi particulièrement aisé de localiser une captive dans un État fiscalement accueillant. […] L’activité de la captive étant par nature immatérielle (il s’agit de simples flux intragroupe), la société dédiée à l’assurance peut être implantée n’importe où sur le globe. »

&gt;Traditionnellement, les multinationales européennes installaient leurs assureurs en Irlande et au Luxembourg. Mais Malte a fait de gros efforts pour les attirer sur son sol, avec ses deux armes maîtresses : une législation souple et des avantages fiscaux massifs.

&gt;Le plus important, déjà décrit dans nos précédentes enquêtes Malta Files, est un remboursement d’impôt sur les sociétés (IS) pour les entreprises étrangères qui distribuent des dividendes à leurs actionnaires. Les sociétés commencent par payer l’IS au taux officiel de 35 %. Mais après remboursement, le taux réel tombe à 5 %, contre 33,3 % en France (lire ici).

&gt;Renault, PSA et Auchan ont mis en place des montages identiques pour profiter de l’aubaine. En bas, deux sociétés maltaises : une pour l’assurance vie et l'autre pour l’assurance classique (cette séparation est imposée par la loi). Au-dessus, une holding qui encaisse les dividendes. Mais nos trois géants tricolores sont des cachottiers. Leurs holdings maltaises publient dans leurs comptes le paiement de l’impôt officiel, à 35 %. Mais le montant remboursé par le fisc n’est jamais indiqué clairement.

&gt;Nous sommes tout de même parvenus à dénicher ces ristournes grâce aux documents comptables maltais de la banque Oney. Filiale d’Auchan, cette captive travaille pour l’ensemble des magasins de la richissime famille nordiste Mulliez (Decathlon, Leroy-Merlin, etc.), mais aussi pour d’autres distributeurs comme la Fnac et Darty, soit 50 enseignes au total (la liste est ici). 

&gt;Dans les comptes 2016 de Oney Holding Limited, on voit que la holding a touché l’an dernier 23,8 millions d’euros de dividendes des deux assureurs qu’elle contrôle, et 7 millions d’« autres revenus ». Lesquels ? La réponse figure dans une courte note publiée en annexe : il s’agit des « remboursements reçus au titre des articles 48(4)(a) et 48(4A)(a) » du code général des impôts maltais (notre document ci-dessous). Ceux qui détaillent la fameuse ristourne sur l’impôt sur les sociétés.

&gt;Cette note dans les comptes de la holding maltaise du groupe Auchan prouve que les recettes pudiquement qualifiées d' ""autres revenus"" correspondent bien aux remboursements d'impôts du fisc maltais. © Mediapart

En 2016, l’assureur du groupe Auchan a donc réalisé 23,7 millions de profits, a payé 8,3 millions au fisc maltais et s’en est fait rembourser 7. Résultat : Oney Holdings a payé seulement 1,3 million d’euros d’impôt sur les sociétés. Soit un taux ridicule de 5,5 %, six fois moins élevé qu’en France. Au total, entre 2014 et 2016, Auchan a ainsi économisé 21 millions d’euros d’impôts.

&gt;On retrouve les mêmes « autres revenus » chez PSA Services Limited, la holding maltaise qui détient les sociétés d'assurances PSA. Curieusement, il n’y en a pas eu en 2014 et 2015 (derniers comptes publiés). Mais au cours des cinq années précédentes, le constructeur s’est fait rembourser la bagatelle de 57 millions d’euros. Ces « autres revenus » correspondent bien au « cumul d’impôt sur les sociétés remboursé par l'État maltais depuis 2009 », nous a confirmé par mail un porte-parole de PSA.

&gt;Mais le champion de l’optimisation fiscale à la sauce maltaise est l’ex-entreprise publique Renault. Ses sociétés d’assurances ont bénéficié de 62 millions d’euros de remboursement d’impôts entre 2012 et 2015. On ignore le montant pour 2016, les comptes n’étant pas encore publiés. Mais la ristourne n’a cessé de croître, passant de 3,4 millions en 2013 à 21,3 millions par an à partir de 2014.

&gt;Les deux captives d’assurances de Renault sont en effet d’incroyables machines à cash. L’une d’entre elles, RCI Insurance Limited, a encaissé 108 millions de primes en 2015, et n’en a reversé que 10 millions à ses clients pour couvrir les sinistres. Soit une marge brute hallucinante de 90 %. « C’est complètement hors norme. Dans notre métier, 20 % c’est déjà beaucoup », commente le directeur financier d’un assureur, à qui nous avons soumis nos documents comptables.

&gt;Au bout du compte, RCI Insurance et RCI Life, les deux sociétés d’assurances maltaises de Renault, ont réalisé en 2015 un profit cumulé avant impôts de 86 millions d’euros avec seulement 17 salariés. Dont un seul chez RCI Insurance, celui-là même qui explose tous les ratios de productivité financière.

&gt;Renault, qui a refusé de nous répondre, semble donc avoir logé juste assez d’employés à Malte pour que ses compagnies d’assurances ne soient pas considérées comme fictives par le fisc français. PSA, qui emploie 31 personnes à Malte, assure pour sa part qu’il s’agit de la totalité de ses salariés dans les assurances. « Il n’y a pas d’effectif travaillant sur l’activité assurance en France, ni d’ailleurs dans d’autres pays que Malte (hors fonctions commerciales). Le nombre assez réduit de collaborateurs est lié au fait que la palette des produits vendus est en réalité assez simple (deux) », nous a écrit un porte-parole.

&gt;Pour le reste, PSA assure que ses structures maltaises ont été « examinées et validées par les services fiscaux européens des différents États membres, et n’ont jamais fait l’objet d’une remise en cause ». Idem chez Oney/Auchan, qui indique que « ces opérations sont effectuées dans le strict respect des conventions internationales signées entre les pays avec lesquels cette filiale opère, et l'État de Malte ». 

&gt;En réalité, Renault, PSA et Auchan sont très embarrassés que leurs manœuvres d’évitement fiscal à Malte soient mises au jour. Aucun dirigeant de ces trois groupes n’a accepté de parler à Mediapart. Pour toute réponse, nous n’avons obtenu que de brefs courriels, avec des éléments de langage gravés dans la langue de bois.

Requires a lot more than just money to fix impoverished nations. We've been sending money to Africa for over half a century and there hasn't been any significant development of note. 

Most of those countries go from corrupt government to corrupt government. Uprisings by liberation groups in turn lead to yet more corrupt leadership. 

Money isn't always the answer. At the very bare minimum, they need to educate a generation of farmers. Foreign aid groups do go and teach how to farm but these methods needs to be internalized and spread by the local population and initiatives need local government support. 

I'm not convinced that this happens. Take a look at what happened in Zimbabwe. Since the 1980's their government tried to push land reform, slowly at first, but by the late 1990s funding dried up and their government began pushing their white farmers (people from European descent) off their lands. By the 2000's, only a fraction of the country's farmable land was even being used and, no surprise, they were suffering massive food shortages and, again no surprise, are costing the international community. 

My point in bringing up that example is to show that although there is a minimum cost threshold to just about everything, budgeting and finance management trumps the actual dollar amount. 

Why is there widespread starvation in impoverished nations? It's not because no one cares or no one is paying. That's false. There are billions of dollars every year that go into those regions of the world. The money is being poorly managed, farming is not being taught, and farming is not being supported by the government. 

As for clean drinking water, think about what goes into clean drinking water. You need infrastructure for clean drinking water. Period. Yes sure you can tap the ground and all of that, but on a large scale, when you're talking about providing a population with drinking water, there needs to be infrastructure in place for it. 

This means, you need trained engineers, plumbers, scientists, builders, etc... Plumbing needs to be in place and water purification plants need to be in place as well, at a minimum. 

All of this requires stability, which again comes back to government responsibility. You can send as much money as you want, but until there is a powerful government in place, able to provide stability, and willing to support the necessary infrastructure for civilization growth, you're just not going to see these developments. 

TL;DR- Has little to do about not sharing money. Developed nations have been sharing money voluntarily and involuntarily for over half a century. Impoverished nations are not managed well. They have corrupt governments with a high turnover rate and have shown to be either disinterested or incapable of supporting realistic farming initiatives. No support for infrastructure and personnel required for water purification and distribution. ",True,0,1496322460,,False,0,dibcw6u,t3_6ek0n3,t1_diavs4i,1498974167,27,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,

So, my interpretation is that ancient Egypt and Europe were were a fairly well-mixed group due to trade etc. within the ancient civilisations.

LogicDragon,,,"&gt;Dumbledore knew that Harry was mistreated at the Dursleys. He had his personal Squib-informant stationed there, who also was cruel to Harry on purpose, otherwise she would not get to babysit him.

*Did* Dumbledore know? Figg was obviously in the wrong (a woman of her time, maybe, but still, she could have said *something*), but there's no indication that Dumbledore knew the extent of what was happening. He's the Chief Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, Grand Sorcerer *and* Headmaster. He's a busy guy. He's not going to have time to personally check up on Harry.

Even if he did, the blood magic was the only foolproof way to keep Harry safe.

&gt;Due to the prophecy Dumbledore assumed it had to Harry vs Voldemort one on one. He always wanted and expected Harry to die, therefore no need to really train him

There's no way in hell even Dumbledore could have trained a sixteen-year-old to take the Dark Lord in a fair fight. Also, Dumbledore *didn't* expect Harry to die: in GoF there's ""a gleam of triumph in his eyes"" when he hears about Voldemort taking Harry's blood. 

Finally: Harry's death would be sad, but Dumbledore was *fighting a war*. You can't fight a war without losses. Voldemort *had* to be stopped, and the life and happiness of one boy just doesn't begin to compare to the horrors of Voldemort winning. Yes, Dumbledore could have been *nice*, and the result of that would have been the Dark Lord ruling over the Earth forever. 

&gt;Why to involve experts like for example the DoM. No, he is Albus fucking Dumbledore, so he knows best.

Because Voldemort was trying to take over the Ministry, and him finding out Dumbledore knew about the Horcruxes would be disastrous. You don't go sharing extremely sensitive information like that. And also, yes he *is* Albus fucking Dumbledore, the most powerful and knowledgeable wizard of recent history, and trusting some jumped-up chucklehead working for the organisation that brought you Azkaban would be *insanity*.

&gt;Dumbledore is Chief Warlock. Do we really need to talk about how bribes just let everyone scream ""I was imperiused."" and get off scott free?

Magical Britain is a complete shithole. Remember the time Wizard Hitler took over? *Nobody noticed*. Voldemort's ideals weren't that far from public opinion. The resistance amounted to Dumbledore and a few dozen of his friends. Out of a *country*. Where was the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the Battle of Hogwarts? Running around murdering Mudbloods, of course. Chief Warlock or not, Dumbledore has only so much sway over a country that deeply fucked up.

&gt;What did he do? Nothing of course.

We don't know what he was doing until the Ministry had him kicked out, and then *didn't do anything else* like, say, close down the school *while students were being Petrified* and send in Aurors.

&gt;Dumbledore just wanted to redeem himself by giving Harry and Voldemort similar upbringings

Redeem himself? For what? He didn't know Tom Riddle existed until he met him that day at the orphanage.

&gt; At least if the prophecy is done, it does not really matter who lives, since now anyone can kill Voldemort.

That's not how prophecies work. Harry is ""the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord"". *That* is why Harry's physical safety is *the* priority - he's the only way to destroy Voldemort. 

Dumbledore is the Only Sane Man of the whole country of magical Britain. Grindelwald starts taking over Europe, and who has to personally intervene to stop him? Dumbledore. Voldemort arises, gathers together the most powerful nobles in Britain, and steamrolls the whole country (which more or less doesn't care about *Wizard Hitler 2, Electric Boogaloo taking over*), and who has to stop him? Dumbledore and Friends. Voldemort comes back, leaving a child dead by AK and an Auror imprisoned and impersonated by an old Death Eater, and who has to stop him *again*? Guess fuckin' who.

Dumbledore spends his life frantically running around trying to fix the shithole that is the wizarding world, running the British legal system *and* the wizard equivalent of the UN *and* acting as the head of the resistance against the local fascist. He's the only character willing and able to make difficult, painful decisions that, unpleasant though people find them, are necessary. He does what's right, not what's easy.

Was never considered world class, has had a good season with us but its not a world class season.

&gt;luiz

Again, was never considered world class. This season, he's been world class - I wonder who helped him reach this level?

&gt;matic

Was considered world class in 14/15, then the injury happened and he's never looked the same. Some Chelsea fans have an obsession with him because of his assist tally, however they are mostly comprised of this one specific set piece routine we used in the start of the season (which was eventually figured out by our opponents) as well as making simple passes to Pedro/Hazard who use their skill to make the goal happen. The fact that we're linked with so many midfield options just says how underwhelming he has been compared to the other players.


The right term to use for this Chelsea team is experienced. Luiz has won titles in France, Pedro has won titles in Spain and Matic has won titles in Portugal. Our team is full of winners which is how we got over the finish line, so many of them have done it before. However you don't just dump experience onto a team and win titles instantly, a system was there for Luiz to thrive in. Same with Pedro, same with Alonso and Moses. Azpilicueta has found his best position after being used in all sorts of areas by Mourinho, now he's one of the best centrebacks in the league. 


Without Conte, we're stuck with the same old 4-2-3-1 which has proven to be useless when it means our best player has to spend time tracking back rather than fully putting his energy on making attacks happen.

As for Europe/Asia it's fairly reasonable, with a few caveats.

It arbitrarily decides to divide some countries into PUs/vassals, or not, largely depending on what happened in the future, not on 1444 situation. It wasn't like Sweden and Norway were some kind of pseudo-independent entities, and king of Denmark couldn't order Swedish troops, or any silliness like that. In terms of local laws, different parts having different feudal laws was the norms not exception. You'd probably get better idea if you just integrated all vassals/PUs.

It arbitrarily decides who's ""independent"" or not. HRE members were as much vassals of emperor, as various (no longer in game) French dukes were vassals of kind of France. In the long term things evolved differently, but it really wasn't apparent in 1444.

One really obnoxious thing is does is making Muscovy a great power dominating all Russia in 1444. It was in fact Golden Horde's tributary bitch, and only became independent power over next century. Horde power was fading, but they were far more powerful than game gives them credit.

An even bigger mistake is pretending Lithuania was independent, while it in unbroken union with Poland from 1386 until their shared end.

In exchange she got direct orders, from an elected Douma representative of Putin's party, to defend the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The emails were published by Mediapart and correspond to a speech she made at Brussels. She read word by word the declaration sent to her by that Russian MP at the European Parliament. 

The intermediary for the transaction was a European MP from her party, Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, who acknowledged that he received a commission of 140,000€ for getting the deal. He officially and shamelessly declared that money as revenue from the deal when the French equivalent of the IRS asked where it was from. As if that was not enough, the money for the campaign was sent through two different fiscal havens to hide its origins.

Of course Le Pen also got orders directly from the Godfather himself by showing up at the Kremlin in the middle of the fucking campaign. And of course they're all being investigated for money laundering, illegal campaign financing and treason.

https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/the-us-franchise-systemcoming-to-a-league-near-you-2374155.html

&gt;The desire of English clubs' American owners to scrap relegation has been met with uproar.

&gt;The US franchise structure and Europe's system of promotion and relegation stand national stereotypes on their head. America is the citadel of tooth-and-claw capitalism. Yet in terms of professional team sport, it is one of the most cosseted and protected places on earth, where cosy and immutable cartels, not the laws of the free market, reign. Baseball even has an exemption from the country's otherwise redoubtable anti-trust laws.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Not though where football, by far the Europe's richest and most popular sport, is concerned. If tycoons from the world over want to get a slice of the action, squandering their fortunes to bid transfer fees and player salaries to the heavens, then so be it. Whatever the market will bear – and then some. And if an owner loses his shirt in the process, too bad. In soccer at least, the law of the jungle prevails.

&gt;The paradox stems from two different concepts of sport. In America a club, or rather a franchise, exists to please the fans and provide entertainment certainly, but above all as a business to make money. In Europe that order is reversed. As not a few Arsenal supporters might feel right now, what is the point of being profitable if the team is indifferent? ""Football is not a matter of life and death, it's far more important than that,"" Bill Shankly is famously reputed to have said, evoking irrational sporting passions that across the Atlantic do not exist.

&gt;American owners make money by cornering the market. In France, Italy, and even England, teams can rise from nowhere. In theory at least, you can set up Tiny Town Rovers and watch your creation, if it keeps winning, rise through the various levels of the English game to the Premier League itself. In the unsentimental US, such Cinderellas cannot be.

Fribbtastic,AsuraReaper,EPIDEMIC ・ﾟ:*☆─σ( ಠ ﾛ ಠ )ﾉ ,"&gt; Assuming I have no guild, and expect to pug a lot, what druid is workable for fractals and maybe a (pug) raid or two?

In Fractals you can almost run anything. you could even run Heal (magi) druid but this isn't really necessary. A friend of mine runs a really old celestial build and we never really had a problem. If you know the encounter and know what you are doing you are good to go.

That however is a different story in Raids. http://qtfy.eu/build/ranger will give you an overview what to expect from a ranger class. Those builds are the one you want if you want to get into raids because these are the meta, if someone is looking for meta builds in a raid pug group then these are the builds they are talking of.

&gt; Magi is likely better support, and may help a lot in a fractal with perma protection and lotsa regen to top everyone if they listen to actually stick together.

Magi is for healer druid and you don't really need that in Fractals since every class is self sufficient. And if someone get downed you pick them up again and continue.

&gt; However, now that DPS meters are a thing (really?), this may end up getting PUGs to kick me for low DPS

That depends, you can test and learn your rotation for a Condi Druid in the Test facility in the Lions arch aerodrome. Going into Raids without doing that first is a big mistake. Research before you go into raids, what encounters are there, how do they work, what do I need to look out for, how do I need to adjust my build, is my build worth taking and can I hold the DPS of the build at all.

On the other hand healer druid is pretty easy to find out. If you team dies because you can't keep the heal going then you probably will get kicked out but as I said before this is all about you knowing what you do. Going into raids unprepared is generally a really bad idea.

&gt; -Vipers seems to be worse support, but may have better numbers for the overall DPS, at a cost of regeneration.

Viper is condition damage but goes for DPS while Magi is support and heal but less DPS so you need to decide which direction you want to go. Getting magi gear for example is easier and cheaper than Viper.

&gt; but what do groups really want these days?

healer Druid is probably the go to class as a dedicated raid healer

&gt; Are druids even accepted outside of raids?

Why not, Druid doesn't mean you are bad. As I said above you can be Viper and do a lot of condi DPS or a Magi healer.

It all doesn't exist in a vacuum. And China's not a first world country. They've had unrivalled economic growth pretty much by hosting all that horrifically polluting production the rest of the world didn't want. I live here. Some of my colleagues grandparents lived through famine.

I don't see how the fact that the U.S. being economically *better* off means they should invest *less* in climate change rather than more.

In fact, if we look at what China has already accomplished in it's very *recent* period of time as an economic super power...

&gt;Efforts to Date: China has already been working for a number of years to reduce its CO2 emissions, improve energy efficiency, expand renewable energy and develop low carbon cities. **China is on track to meet or even exceed its Copenhagen climate pledge, which was to reduce its carbon intensity by 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2020.** China is responsible for over half of the world's energy conservation efforts over the past two decades. China has also installed 40 percent of the world's newly added renewable energy power over the past five years, **while the country's investment in clean and renewable energy exceeded the combined total invested by the U.S. and Europe.**

Having said this, I'm not sure it is a good idea for Isaiah to decide that the nature of God necessarily matches that of our world unless we want to let Isaiah off the hook and assert that he only defined the god of this world (which is not conscious having no free will).  There are many reasons to view our world as corrupt.  John's theory supports the idea that God is innocent of this world in everyway.  And in that regard, he seems to be contradicting Isaiah - which is to argue B.  However, it's not actually B if Isaiah got it wrong and there is no sentient god of this world.  If Isaiah merely just described nature as if it were a free-will sentient being and gave it a name ""Yahweh"" then it's not really a 2nd god.

China isn't a good country on climate change or the environment, in fact it's probably the worst country in the developing world on those measures, but it has 30% of the global population, so having 30% of emissions is not that crazy. 

Most of the rest of the developed world is already on the right trajectory, the UK has a target to cut 80% from 1990 to 2050, and as of 2016 has made cuts of about 40%, while growing at the fastest per capita rate in the G8. France is already at the global average because of nuclear. They and other similar countries have already effectively paid for the further development and scaling up of technologies which used to be expensive, but are now massively reduced in cost, that can be rolled out cheaply elsewhere, for instance solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, third generation nuclear, LED lighting, electric cars, heat pumps, household utilities energy efficiency, and advanced insulation materials have all been driven substantially by European standards and market regulation. 

Compared to most of the rest of the developed world, the US has significantly higher emissions, and has promised a lower level of reduction (something like 60% to 2050). It could honestly meet that by only deploying technologies that are profitable, that save more money in reduced electricity costs than they cost up-front. They could do most of this just by education, and fixing market failures (for instance, preventing energy monopolies from blocking the deployment of solar in the south, preventing NIMBY's from blocking wind power miles off-shore, minimum standards so that someone buying a house knows how well it has been insulated, or modifying zoning laws to allow fitting of electric car charging points, and a thousand other trivial changes).

Its interpreted as an aggressive move that may be a genuine desire to offload a surplus or an intentional drive to temporarily flood a market in order to close down local businesses to then exploit a monopoly you will gain later once the local businesses have died.  

Market segmentation is a practice to ensure that price is according to someone's ability to pay. Therefore an enterprise customer from a fortune 500 company pays more (as the product translates into greater value for them) than an SME from Indonesia.  
Market segmentation allows the west to sell their products abroad to developing nations at a price that developing nations can afford. To have the developing nations then sell that product back to the West defeats the point. The point being that such a situation would significantly weaken the economies of the west that rely on such practices.  

Its not about what is right or wrong or better or worse but how one can transition from one system to another without shooting oneself in the foot. For the record I think free trade is brilliant and would support your aims. However pragmatically speaking I appreciate that some levels of protection are required to ensure we don't end up shooting ourselves in the foot.",True,0,1496328995,,False,0,dibi4sv,t3_6els0p,t1_dibhj73,1498976701,3,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,

The self test I designed for myself to help me tease this out was to try and figure out if a relationship fundamentally made sense/I would pursue it if it WEREN'T for the mental attraction.

1. Am I hypomaniac or manic right now? Is it influencing this decision/these feelings?
2. Is he interested in/ready for a relationship with me (sexual/romantic or not)? Judge this on your own and then ask him.  I don't know how big of a factor his Aspergers should be, I'm fairly sure my dad is, and their BP1 + Aspie relationship is a fucking trainwreck. 
3. Does he share other interests and daily habits that I can stand/find endearing? This might involve some research, aka, hanging out as just friends or talking.

The Eu can enforce its some of its own laws (some are directly applicable) and can also impose fines on non-complying member state. 


&gt;80-90% of our laws are said to come from EU level. Our parliament has some discretionary power for regulations to implement them but most of the time they just have to copy paste...

That is a Brexit lie. By far the largest part of our laws are local, national laws. 


&gt;[Another example look at how the UK now has big problems in starting to negotiating trade deals, the national governments have lost that expertise to the EU. 

Not 'lost' but voluntarily transferred that, because you can have a better deal when negotiating as a large player. We have more stringent rules on food safety, against the WTO codex alimentarius. But we are EU so fuck them.

&gt; Napoléon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph Bonaparte, prince impérial de France (16 March 1856 – 1 June 1879) was the only child of Emperor Napoleon III of France and his Empress consort Eugénie de Montijo. After his father was dethroned in 1870, he relocated with his family to England. On his father's death in January 1873, he was proclaimed Napoleon IV, Emperor of the French by the Bonapartist faction.

&gt; In England he trained as a soldier. Keen to see action, he successfully put pressure on the British to allow him to participate in the Anglo-Zulu War. In 1879, serving with British forces, he was killed in a skirmish with a group of Zulus. His early death sent shockwaves throughout Europe, as he was the last serious dynastic hope for the restoration of the Bonapartes to the throne of France.

Smaller countries were always at mercy of bigger players, that's why countries grew in size, they merged to be more relevant. That's why EU was conceived.

The why behind the allocation is based on the capitalization of these indices at a given time. The US market capitalization is bigger than the European one, hence it being a bigger size. It's not perfectly logical and there's no reason to follow it to the letter other than having a super simple passive rule. That's how XAW is, you find the details under holdings, i.e. XEF is about 35% right now, US is a combination of IVV IJH IJR for 53.72%, and 11.38% to Emerging Markets through the US fund IEMG.

CCP's recommended portfolio may have changed, but the stock allocation used to be something like 30%/30%/30% XUU/XEF/XIC and 10% XEC. Personally, I'm investing based on where I want to travel when I retire, and have a house and plan to have a small pension here that will be tied to inflation, so I go with about 40%/40%/10%/10% XUU/XEF/XEC/XIC. This way, if Europe or the US become super expensive, the investments should in theory reflect that; furthermore, the cost of many things in Canada is tied to the US' economy/currency, and the rest will be payable with my pension.



The MER difference between XAW and the other funds might have been lower before iShares lowered some of their MER.

Not *like stealth*. Specifically and only stealth. This is because one of the primary mechanical purposes of passive perception is to compare against stealth without requiring a roll, which gives away information to the players.

 It wouldn't make sense if you could become worse at noticing things by actively searching, so to avoid punishing players for actively searching, your passive serves as the floor for stealth checks. 

However, in situations other than stealth we have to consider whether passive perception is applicable or not. And thus active vs. passive becomes much less clear cut.

Unfortunately, unless you're one of the greatest force users of all time, your abilities will never be as powerful as the Death Star, or even a decent sized battleship.

&gt; ""The ability of a cannon is insignificant next to the power electromagnetism""

which puts things in a much better perspective. The force is in and around everything, it's alive and has a will of it's own. **Being force-sensitive means you can tap into the power of destiny itself**, and shape the fate of everything around you. Think of all the insane coincidences that needed to happen for Luke to: learn he's force-sensitive, get training as a jedi, from the exact two people that could train him, escape from Vader multiple times, destroy the death star, *twice*, and (indirectly) kill the most powerful Sith that's ever lived.

rewboss,degree,BA in Modern Languages,"&gt; What German does not have is expletive infixation

That's why I asked if you literally meant ""all"". Because that's a ""phenomenon"" that German does not have, therefore German does not have all the ""phenomena"" that English does.

&gt; it would be absurd to assume that any European language would be better at swearing than any other. The languages have co-evolved in close contact for more than a millennium after all.

It's not about being ""better"" or ""worse"" at swearing. It's really about how much innovation there is, which is really a cultural thing more than a linguistic thing.

For example, the basic meaning of the English word ""twat"" is ""vagina"", but it's most often used as a general term of insult. As a verb, though, ""to twat"" means ""to hit fucking hard"" (at least in parts of the UK). There's the hugely popular ""fuckwit"", which very neatly and economically expresses the view that somebody is of an intelligence so low it deserves an expletive, all in one word. I don't think coining a German word ""Fickgeist"" would have the same punch, or be so instantly and universally understood.

The Scots are particularly good at this: when Trump implied that the Scots were in favour of Brexit, many took to Twitter to remind him that most Scots actually voted Remain, and the epithets they invented for him included ""ignorant fuckmuppet"", ""incompressible [sic] jizztrumpet"" and the absolutely priceless ""witless fucking cocksplat"".

It would be interesting to see how German could encapsulate all those ideas so efficiently.

But from NYT

&gt;the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan.

I'm not a fan of this in the slightest. One of the many issues with it stem from how this affects the season. You need to address if the Cheetahs can gain entry to Europe, which for the balance of the league, they'd need to, otherwise there's an imbalance. Even without this, they still gain advantage from never having any international concerns, so if they do somehow create a strong squad, they have advantages throughout the year during these phases. Then there's an extra game to be played in the already busy season, extending it into infringing on internationals. 

The travel sounds insane along with how the seasons and weather match up. Conferences should be a no-go but I'm afraid this is the direction it's headed. 

I'm not sure the Cheetahs bring much for us. It's been argued they're being axed from Super Rugby because they don't have good enough attendances for the league and are financially unsustainable. Cheetahs state they are profitable, yet the damning evidence against them in this case is they don't have the funds to hold onto good players and they seem to have adopted the role of a feeder club, meaning they're not that competitive and when they do get great players (e.g. Lood de Jager), they sell them, instead of making the effort to retain them and strive to compete. Why do we want a club of low ambition joining the league? 

We're saying no to a potential Georgian introduction that has a huge potential to grow and would assist them in striking up a relationship for growth (and they have the fans already, new club in a league would draw a hell of a lot of people), but yes to a SA merger, which is even further away and already failed to deliver to the standard of one league.

Spencer1K,,,"This will actually open up a TON of renaue for all the teams. Currently its a big problem that teams that arnt top tier like TSM and C9 have some issues finding long term sponsers and investors due to relegations existing. From a sponsors point of view if they invest in even just a year for a team and that team gets relegated and goes to the challenger scene then they arnt going to have very many eyes on them so whats the point? Investors are off put because if they invest in a team like say NV and they get relegated, they lose on there investment bigtime. Its simply unsafe for sponsors and investors to put any money on any low or even mid tier LCS teams right now which strangles the market. 

Opening up permanent partnerships creates a much safer environment for sponsors and investors to enter the market. Since a  portion of all sponsorship and merchandise sells is shared through the whole league, even the larger teams like TSM will still gain (although not as much as the lower teams) because now the lower teams will be getting more sponsors and more long term fans which will increase the money flow into the LCS overall which is then shared to all the teams. Teams will be able to find investors much easier to enter the permanent partnership as well due to no more relegation which should also mean that any team that is currently in the LCS should be able to find the money somewhere to stay in as long as they pass the vetting process

This isnt even mentioning the other tons of positives such as player base salaries being risen and teams being able to create academy teams to grow talent similar to MLB which allows them to focus on creating a better roster long term rather then trying to create the best roster as of this split to not get relegated. Teams will be more willing to invest in growing there teams and experimenting with different rosters and different coaching methods because having a single bad split isnt the end of your brand anymore. Rosters will also be expanded and teams will likely get more subs for there teams as well creating a more competitive environment for the players themselves because they will start to be more replaceable so therefore will have to improve themselves to stay relevant because as of right now since teams can get relegated so easily, its generally safer to invest into a player that already has LCS experience and you know there level of player rather then investing in a rookie from solo que because if you do that and they dont turn out to work your team could be dunzo, but now that teams can do that we wills see a rise in homegrown talent increasing the player pools and therefore increasing the competitiveness between the players to stay relevant.

The reason relegations works well in other sports like European Football is because being demoted down a league isnt the end of your brand. Your team can recover from that. Also sponsors arnt the largest portion of there income, but in league sponsors are a HUGE portion of a teams income. I remember regi saying how it can be upwards of 80% of a teams income like a year ago. This is a REALLY big deal because it means if you cant get sponsors regularly you lack funds for pretty much everything and your team goes under. So basically if your team gets demoted in the LCS and loses sponsors your team dies unless you can find the few people willing to invest into the challenger scene currently.

While a serious SHTF event may not be in France's near future; the way of life has already changed greatly over the last few years for many Europeans and as time moves forward there is a serious chance things will change dramatically as Muslims become the majority.

nibbler666,nativespeaker,Berlin,"Regarding expletive infixation this was a misunderstanding. When I was writing, I was looking at your example sentence. As I had already written that the German language does not have a word that is grammatically as flexible as ""fucking"" I was referring to the rest of your sentence when I said that all other phenomena are no problem in German. But again I have to say that expletive infixation really pales in comparison with the tools that the German language provides for word composition, and these are used creatively when constructing new swearwords.

Regarding fuckwit: there are loads of expletives for people with low intelligence. Dumpfbacke, Blödbratz and Vollidiot are coming to my mind immediately, but if I spent a bit more time on it, I would easily come up with two dozens of these. Note that ""Vollidiot"" is way stronger than ""complete idiot"", which would be a literal translation. I think the reason why it sounds stronger is that we can add the syllable ""Voll-"" directly to the idot, making the ""Voll-"" an integral part of the ""Idiot"" (similar to the construction ""fuckwit""), instead of just modifying the ""Idiot"" by an adjective. ""Kompletter Idiot"" would be possible in principle, too, but it is not even half as strong as ""Vollidiot"".

Regarding your idea that there may be a cultural difference: on this general level, there are not really cultural differences between European countries. European cultures in general have co-evolved for more than a millennium, on all levels: economcally, art, literature, poetry, education, law, science, philosophy, politics, engineering, etc. Why on earth should there be any significant cultural difference when it comes to swearing?

Regarding the point of encapsulating various ideas efficiently, ultimately what applies to word creation in poetry applies to inventing expletives: it would be weird to assume that any European language would be less equipped to express complex poetic ideas than any other European language. There also is a second parallel here: poems are often impossible to translate in a precise way because poems encapsulate many ideas in a very dense way, using the specific devices of a particular language, but, of course, you can find highly complex poems in all European languages. Similarly, it is probably nearly impossible to find direct English equivalents to ""Dumpfbacke"" and ""Blödbratz"".

No, the reason for that is because European nations often have a parliamentary system, where people vote for MPs, or vote for parties that select MPs, and MPs vote for PM. Here we elect the President directly. As a result, the coalition process happens *before* the election, not after. Essentially all left and right factions put up their candidate in the party primary, and whichever faction wins becomes the coalition's candidate. The reason that there are no major party socialist (etc.) candidates for the POTUS is that that faction doesn't have the numbers to win the Democratic party primary.

It's also worth considering the difference between our system and, say, France's. If our system worked like France's, with a runoff, during the first round we would have seen Trump, Hillary, Bernie, and possibly one or two other conservatives. Likely Trump and Hillary would have won the first round, and Bernie supporters probably would have rallied around Hillary having had no DNC to blame for their loss. Unfortunately, we have no runoff; if no candidate gets 50%+1 of the electoral vote, the whole election is invalidated.

If our tax is changed too much, or even made equal to the EU average a large number of firms will up and out because they will pay the same tax elsewhere while not needing to pay so much for travel expenses, have access to a larger market closer to production, will have access to a far larger workforce, etc. While being the main English speaking country in the EU now is a nice advantage, it is but one in a situation with many variables.

pfthrowaway21315,,,"&gt;Based on working in healthcare finance and all of the different ideas, companies, and plans in the US, Canada, and Western Europe, I think the best way we can lower costs and help people is by focusing on small, local clinics (urgent care centers). We make these free of charge or a small nominal fee such as $25-$50 and we use them to treat stuff like broken arms, get stitches, meds for viruses, and a yearly physical exam and if it's found that you have an illness then you apply for Medicaid, Medicare to get additional treatment. These facilties will be staffed by experienced nurses and a rotating PA, no doctors would be needed I know it's a crap shoot but it would get people preventative care, keep them out of the ER (which is the highest cost of care), and make people healthier.

I'm pretty conservative, and this is an idea I can get behind. The cost would be minimal (compared to ER for poor, uninsured people) and this could prevent people's medical issues from getting more costly, i.e. someone getting meds for a sinus infection versus delaying care until they have to be admitted with pneumonia.

Not to mention that there are translation issues as well--for example, there are Chinese ranks that get translated as ""Duke"" or ""King"" despite them not working the same as you'd expect a European Duke or King to be.

But I'll try to define some of these. In an idealized system, titles have ranks that denote power/prestige, but in reality stuff like history, politics, and circumstances have made it possible for Counts to be more powerful than Dukes, for example.  Basically, anyone can call themselves anything and it'll be true if other people agree.

* A King is someone who rules a Kingdom. What defines a Kingdom? Nothing much, aside from that a ruler calls itself King, and their neighbors recognize that, which is the bigger deal. You can declare yourself King and your home your Kingdom, but if no one recognizes that, then it doesn't matter.

* Likewise, an Empire is ruled by an Emperor, and in theory is a collection of several Kingdoms. Again, in theory a Empire is different from a Kingdom in that an Empire is multi-cultural and rules over many different peoples, but there have been lots of tiny realms that called themselves Empires such as the successor states to the Byzantine Empire (like the Latin Empire, Empire of Nicaea, Empire of Trebizond shown in [this picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Byzantium1204.png).

* A Duke is a step down from a King and rules a Duchy. They can be independent or part of a Kingdom. Why a self-ruling Duke doesn't call themselves King or Emperor, like everything else, depends upon history and politics.

* A Margrave/Marquess is between a Duke and a Count. Originally, they controlled territories on the border of their respective Kingdom/Empire and were in charge of defending it, meaning that they'd have to have a stronger army that other territories, which makes them more important and powerful.

* Below that are Counts/Earls, which are the same thing, expect that Earls are English and Counts are everyone else.

* Ministers are (in the governmental sense) bureaucrats appointed by the ruler (or chosen in elections in modern governments) to help rule the country. It's not a title of nobility or heritable.

TitaniumDragon,,,"&gt; spree shootings are a very good reason in my opinion, it is as simple as that. But that's just another drop in the bucket right? The perpetrator would have just run them over or stabbed them.

Rampage killings where someone goes postal in some public/semi-public space are extremely rare. I understand that you are pretty uneducated about the world, being a typical European, but spree shootings only happen a few times a year. Last year, for instance, the US had three rampage killings. In a country of 320 million people. There were two in 2015. There's been one so far this year.

They're not a major problem and their contribution to the homicide rate is negligible. Freaking out over them is stupid.

&gt; you don't need

It isn't about needing, it is about wanting. Moreover, people use weapons for self defense which are appropriate for such, generally speaking.

&gt; Please also elaborate on the 'cultural reasons' for owning operational guns.

Uh, people own them because it is a part of their culture? That's what a cultural reason is. Guns are a traditional part of American culture.

As the saying goes, God made man, but Sam Colt made him equal.

&gt; Guns are, by their very nature harmful - they are explicitly made to kill things or else they might as well fire pieces of chocolate.

Guns are not ""by their very nature harmful"". They are tools and weapons, and highly useful ones at that.

You know the saying, guns don't kill people, people kill people?

It's true.

Firearm ""accidents"" are actually firearm negligence. When people murder each other, it isn't because guns send out mind control waves, it is because they are worthless human garbage who deal with their problems with violence.

Guns are inanimate objects. They don't *do* anything a human doesn't tell them to do.

&gt; how do you know this? You don't, nobody does. Just like nobody knows who's going to run someone over. The difference is cars are essential to many people, guns simply aren't.

Statistics. Most people with guns never commit a crime with them. In fact, the overwhelming majority of people who own guns never use them for unlawful purposes.

This is fact.

&gt; The fact that literally every other civilised country in the world gets along quite fine with hardline gun control laws, have lower homicide figures per capita

White people in the US have the same homicide rate as every other ""civilized country"" despite having vastly more guns. Moreover, gun ownership rates *do not correlate with homicide rates* within the United States.

You have repeatedly ignored this point. Willfully.

*There is no correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates on a state by state basis.*

Your hypothesis is that gun ownership is what drives the US's high homicide rate. And yet, when we actually *test* this hypothesis, with *actual data*, it doesn't hold up.

And you repeatedly refuse to acknowledge this huge defect in your argument.

You must either address this or admit that you are wrong.",True,0,1496339334,,1496339822,0,dibrnwm,t3_6ebrd9,t1_dibf4mw,1498981356,1,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,
ThorPL123,piaseczno,Super Saiyan Blue/Germanofil,"&gt;**70 proc. Polaków opowiada się przeciwko przyjmowaniu w Polsce uchodźców z krajów muzułmańskich; 45 proc. jest temu zdecydowanie przeciwnych. 5 proc. nie ma w tej kwestii zdania. Za przyjmowaniem jest 25 proc., z czego większość stanowią umiarkowani zwolennicy - wynika z sondażu CBOS.**

&gt;Sprzeciw wobec przyjęcia uchodźców zdecydowanie dominuje wśród potencjalnych elektoratów PiS(wraz z Solidarną Polską i Polską Razem - 91 proc., z czego 67 proc. jest zdecydowanie przeciwnych), Kukiz’15 (89 proc., z czego 67 proc. jest zdecydowanie przeciwnych) i partii Wolność Janusza Korwin-Mikke (dalej partia Wolność - 85 proc., z czego 62 proc. jest zdecydowanie przeciwnych).


&gt;Przeciwnikami, choć na ogół umiarkowanymi, przyjmowania w Polsce uchodźców z krajów muzułmańskich są też w większości badani zamierzający poprzeć PSL (62 proc.).

&gt;Sprzeciwiają się temu również w większości osoby, które zamierzają głosować, ale jeszcze nie wiedzą, którą partię poprą (61 proc.), niezdecydowani, czy pójść na wybory parlamentarne (79 proc.), oraz deklarujący absencję (80 proc.).

&gt;Zwolennikami przyjmowania w Polsce uchodźców z krajów muzułmańskich są natomiast w większości potencjalni wyborcy Nowoczesnej Ryszarda Petru (67 proc., z czego 30 proc. jest zdecydowanie za), SLD (64 proc., z czego 26 proc. jest zdecydowanie za) oraz PO (51 proc., z czego 19 proc. jest zdecydowanie za). Poparcie dla ich przyjmowania dominuje także wśród nielicznych zwolenników Partii Razem (59 proc.).

&gt;Stosunek do przyjmowania w Polsce uchodźców z krajów muzułmańskich najbardziej różnicuje poziom wykształcenia badanych. Choć sprzeciw wobec ich przyjmowania dominuje we wszystkich wyróżnionych grupach, maleje wraz ze wzrostem wykształcenia (od 82 proc. wśród osób z wykształceniem podstawowym lub gimnazjalnych do 57 proc. wśród osób z wykształceniem wyższym) i jednocześnie wzrasta przychylność dla przyjmowania takich uchodźców w naszym kraju (od 13 proc. wśród osób z wykształceniem podstawowym lub gimnazjalnych do 38 proc. wśród osób z wykształceniem wyższym).         

&gt;Sprzeciw wobec przyjmowania w Polsce uchodźców z krajów muzułmańskich dominuje nawet przy założeniu, że za ich nieprzyjmowanie groziłaby Polsce utrata pieniędzy z funduszy unijnych (65 proc.). Za ugięciem się pod taką presją i przyjęciem w Polsce tych uchodźców opowiada się 25 proc., a 10 proc. nie ma w tej kwestii zdania.

&gt;Obecny rząd wprost deklaruje, iż nie zamierza wywiązać się z podjętych przez poprzedników zobowiązań dotyczących relokacji do Polski uchodźców przybyłych do Grecji i Włoch.

&gt;56 proc. wyraża przekonanie, że politykę polskiego rządu w sprawie uchodźców powinny wspierać wszystkie siły parlamentarne. Przeciwnego zdania jest 35 proc. respondentów. 9 proc. nie ma zdania.

&gt;Przekonanie, że polscy politycy powinni wspierać polski rząd w kwestii przyjmowania uchodźców, jest tak silne, że 51 proc. badanych uważa również, iż Donald Tusk, jako przewodniczący Rady Europejskiej, powinien poprzeć sprzeciw polskiego rządu wobec przyjmowania islamskich uchodźców w Polsce. 39 proc. jest odmiennego zdania, a 11 proc. - nie ma opinii na ten temat.

&gt;Choć większość ankietowanych uważa, że wszystkie siły parlamentarne powinny wesprzeć politykę polskiego rządu ws. uchodźców, to jednocześnie 52 proc. twierdzi, że stanowisko poszczególnych partii w sprawie przyjmowania islamskich uchodźców nie wpływa na ich stosunek do tych partii. 39 proc. uznało, że ma to wpływ na ich stosunek do poszczególnych ugrupowań, a 8 proc. nie miało zdania.

&gt;56 proc. badanych jest zdania, że kwestia przyjmowania w Polsce uchodźców powinna być poddana pod ogólnonarodowe referendum. Przeciwnikami przeprowadzania referendum w tej sprawie jest 38 proc. ankietowanych. 5 proc. nie miało zdania.

Do you know why we call a democracy a *democracy*?

&gt;The movement you are citing was later crushed and partially reversed, Napoleon did that during his rule. And was totally lost during the French collapse at the end of his rule. So maybe the French pioneered the first real attempt at feminism, big deal, and for all we know there may have been earlier attempts at it as well. What the French had you are retroactively calling feminism and taking credit for, was not feminism, it was a universal equality movement. Feminism was founded later, and by virtue of it's spiritual kinship with the earlier French attempted to retroactively claim direct connection and credit for the French movement. This claim is tenuous at best.

Nice, presented with evidence you're delusional, and you move the goalposts and double down on your BS.

&gt;The feminism you belong to might have mingled a bit with remnants French feminism, but it of started in the 1880's in Russia, and migrated to Europe with Russian refugee's around the turn of the century. It is blatantly obvious where current feminism comes from, just compare early Marxist rhetoric with feminist rhetoric.

&gt; Jeff McIlwain has been producing his visceral, melodic strain of abstract electronic music as Lusine for over 10 years now. Originally a Texas native, McIlwain met Shad Scott while living in LA and put out his self titled debut on Scott's imprint, Isophlux. He relocated to Seattle in late 2002 and began steadily releasing his music on Ghostly International. McIlwain has also contributed tracks to various compilations and remix releases on Mute, !K7, Kompakt, Asthmatic Kitty, and Shitkatapult. In 2009, he released the album, ""A Certain Distance"", which featured the single, “Two Dots.” His newest, critically acclaimed album, ""The Waiting Room"", was just recently released in 2013.

&gt; McIlwain has performed throughout the US and abroad, including the SXSW, Mutek, DEMF, and Sonar festivals, and sets at London’s esteemed Fabric nightclub, Tokyo's Unit, and Berlin's Berghain and Watergate nightclubs. He has been involved in the scoring of various film and commercial projects: co-scoring (with David Wingo) the 2008 film ""Snow Angels"" (with Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell), and ""The Sitter"" (Jonah Hill) and scoring the 2009 film ""Linewatch"" (with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Omari Hardwick). McIlwain teamed up with David Wingo again this year to score the film ""Joe"" (Nicolas Cage) . He just recently wrapped up tours in Europe and Japan in 2013, and is prepping a new EP to be released sometime in 2014.

&gt; 
Texan Jeff McIlwain produces ambient/experimental techno that harks back to the era of classic early-'90s British techno (itself inspired by American sources in Detroit). Highly melodic though usually highly abrasive as well, his self-titled debut album was released in 1999 on the Isophlux label. He maintained a steady release schedule through 2003, with a full-length released each year -- in addition to an assortment of singles and EPs. Also performing under the name Lusine, in 2004 McIlwain signed to Ghostly for a series of releases including that year's Serial Hodgepodge, 2007's Podgelism, 2009's A Certain Distance, and 2013's Waiting Room. ~ John Bush, Rovi Read more on Last.fm.

davethecomposer,cage,,"We American composers have been looking with envious eyes toward Europe and Japan for a long time now. From what I can see from here new and modernist/postmodernist works are far better accepted in those places than here in the US.

This doesn't mean there aren't exceptions here, of course. Some big orchestras do a few things here and there (though it often feels like it's a token work that's not expected to actually excite the audience). There are a number of smaller ensembles who specialize in this kind of music and because they play in smaller venues to smaller audiences I think they are able to find better success.

&gt; So when musicians are allowed to work without too much commercial pressure, you can have good repertoire and audience will usually follow.

Sigh, you just keep rubbing it in. In the US we used to have this really cool government program called the National Endowment of the Arts whose purpose, in part, was to promote new American art in a variety of ways including individual grants. But the times they have a-changed and conservatives have gutted their efforts almmost entirely. Artists and arts organizations have to be able to pay for themselves or fight bloody wars for the few grants floating around.

I had a brief conversation with a composer from Canada who spends time applying for grants from the government in order to be able to make a living as a composer. We really have almost nothing like that in the US. In fact grants for contemporary composers in the classical tradition are almost non-existant (unless you've already made a name for yourself). The situation is so dire that I've spent the last two years living in a tent and a couple years before that on the street or in a shelter (shelters are literally the worst thing ever). I still work my ass off and am hopeful but I wish it weren't quite so hard. Just a little break would be nice.

&gt; I just read the 2017 - 18 repertoire of Helsinki Philharmonic and they have Berg, Webern, Schönberg, Bergman, Britten, Sallinen, Rautavaara, Hindemith and couple of premieres. Also some names I have never heard before, so they are probs contemporary also.

I would give anything to hear an orchestra preform Webern much less Cage and/or Feldman. What I really need to do is get my ass over to Finland!

It is a photo of three artisans, yes.

If you examine each artisan closely, you will note that it is a heavily caricatured sculpt of a gentleman with a monocle, mustache, jacket, vest and bowtie. These accoutrements have historically been used to characterize a person from the upper-class of society in late 19th to early 20th century western culture.

The monocle itself was often used as a comedic device worn by an upper-class gentleman who expresses shock at some event, ostensibly affecting his delicate sensibilities, which in turn results in the aforementioned eyepiece falling out, sometimes into a drink.

An Earl is a title of nobility in European countries with historically monarchical societies, often associated with a position of wealth and power. Therefore, one can assume that someone with the title of an Earl is often from the upper-class demographic of society. 

Artisans are often used in the Esc key position on a keyboard. While this may vary based on personal taste, and many fans of artisans employ them more liberally in other areas of the keyboard, one often finds photos of keyboards with a single artisan, typically color-matched to the keyset, on the Esc key location.

Putting these items together, gives you an explanation of the title, which is a play on words, typical of the humor many of us have come to love about /u/BingeCaps, the artisan that made this post....

""Each Earl"" &lt; each of the artisans, whose name begins with Earl, a title of nobility

""Esc""  &lt; part of the artisan name, and the traditional placement of the subject on a keyboard

""Exemplifies the Upper Echelon"" &lt;  the subject of the sculpt is wearing garb typically representative of an upper-class member of society in the late 19th century

Trump has waffled on his support for Ukraine and NATO, and Putin benefits from that. He also benefits from the US losing stature internationally, because US backed sanctions are hurting Russia. If the US starts to lose influence, it gets easier to convince individual countries to go against sanctions. It's the same reason he backed LePen in France, the weaker the EU is the stronger Russia can be. 

As far as borders go, again, it's down to waning US authority, moral authority in this case. When the US stops accepting Syrian refugees, Russia can point out what hypocrites we are, and it causes more unrest in refugee camps, and in countries hosting refugees. They can say they are backing stability in Syria, and that the US isn't helping anyone. This makes it easier for extremists to pitch their message to displaced Muslims. It doesn't matter that Russia isn't accepting refugees, or that they're working to destabilize the region, or supporting Syrian death camps. It still gets framed as the US/the West vs Islam. 

And his border policies don't actually make us safer. They just make us more stupid and reactionary. Banning all Muslims was his campaign speech, and then he gives out orders to ban Muslims. That gives another talking point in the Us vs Them rhetoric that extremists love. Most terrorist attacks carried out in America come from US citizens. Refugees have never carried out a terror attack.

And then there's the pants on head retardation that is the southern border wall. It costs more to put it up than the actual illegal Mexican immigrants cost to our services. Plus we're at the lowest numbers of illegal immigrants across the southern border we've had since the 90s. From Mexico particularly we have *negative* immigration. That means we'd be trapping people inside if we put up the fucking wall. It costs a stupid amount, it doesn't solve any problems, and it addresses an issue where the existing policies are actually working. 

Russia doesn't care whether our military is strong or not, they never plan to confront us militarily. We're both nuclear powers, so direct confrontation is way too risky. Plus our military was the strongest in the world by a long shot, there isn't any reason to strengthen it further. So long as we keep modernizing our ships and planes our military will stay the strongest. We don't need to push anything there, because we are already set up on a plan that keeps us on top. 

And for your final point, we absolutely should export more natural gas, especially to Europe to undercut Russian exports. Unfortunately there isn't anything in place to allow us to export anything on the scale where we can compete with Russian LNG in Europe, we don't have the tankers, and there aren't the port facilities to support them if we did have them. Russia needs to be starved until Putin is no longer in charge there. Direct military action is stupid, but we can and should keep up our economic warfare against them.
