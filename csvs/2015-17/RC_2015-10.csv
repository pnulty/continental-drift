-""Firsting and Lasting argues that local histories became a primary means by which European Americans asserted their own modernity while denying it to Indian peoples. Drawing on more than six hundred local histories from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, Jean M. O’Brien explores how these narratives inculcated the myth of Indian extinction, a myth that has stubbornly remained in the American consciousness.""


Ok so this is a fairly recent book about Native Americans that i picked up this summer for a project im working on at work.  If you actually read it I think it will give you a great new perspective on the native population.  You will also notice a stark difference between this and diamonds work.

A historical monograph is a serious thing to write.  You cant just pop in your opinions or carry along a chain of what ifs.  When you write from a position of expertise and authority on a historical issue you have to understand that your opinion will become a part of future research.  This pop history movement is something that is affecting the general populations perception of many historical events in a negative way.  I'm sure you know the television version of this is found on the History channel.  While most people know the alien shows are just for fun and not a serious theory, many viewers do not understand that most of the ""real"" history specials on the History channel are just as contrived.  Those super patriotic Americas beginning  shows are absolutely made to just draw an audience.  If they need to fudge some facts here or there it will be done.

Im sorry i dont have a copy of GGS anymore, i gave it one read and tossed it out.  I have a deeply personal connection to this field, and i cant stand it when people throw together these over the top end-all-be-all books that claim to answer huge questions that others have spent their lives researching small parts of.

From what I remember, a large part of the book is based on the success of agriculture and livestock in some areas.  His documentation of his research is weakest here even though it was a huge part of one of his many wild thesis's.  Theres also a ton of racist undertones when he refers to different populations.  

Its not up to me to disprove someones scholarly work.  Everyone should assume its crap if the author himself cant bother to fully document where he is getting his ideas.  ",0,t5_2sokd

&gt; I have demonstrated clearly that the EPL is more open and isnt dominated as heavily as the other top leagues.

Except Serie A had more goals scored last year. That, to me, seems more ""open."" If you like running up and down, losing the ball, running back, then the premier league is great. It's like a track meet-skill is 2nd to just being fast. Tactics are an after thought. And as a result, Prem teams are annihilated in Europe.

&gt; The idea that that is only because its an English league is a complete myth, how difficult is it to get a native speaking commentator to voice over the footage they are being sold the rights to? It is easy and many nations do this.

No it isn't. Britain spread its influence worldwide. To say it has no impact is absurd. You claim ""myth"" but offer no argument against it. The premier league is simply more popular because of Britain's influence, not that it is more entertaining. 

&gt; The EPL has 4/5 teams who are touted as having a realistic chance of winning it, name another top league where this is the case? Ergo, more entertaining yet again..

That's what people of lesser intelligence said last year until Chelsea ran away with it. Wow, so competitive. As I've shown, only 1 season was close. The rest were similar to La Liga at best, in recent (also known as, relevant) history.

&gt; I dont really care if you think the 3rd and 4th best la Liga teams would ""wipe the floor with anyone in the prem"" (LOL, they wouldnt). As that is nothing to do with competitivity and a completely baseless argument.

okay? I don't care if you care? Great argument. It doesn't? The only basis to compare leagues, a HEAD TO HEAD COMPETITION, doesn't show competitiveness? But then again, I don't expect much, considering your statements (I won't call them arguments, they're just random statements, every post a different, random, pointless statement.)

&gt;This isnt a point, its an opinion, and one that is not shared by the majority of people in the world, and i have literally demonstrated the ways in which it is more competitive, but hey ho better luck next time fella.

All you've done is downvote my posts, lol. Everything else is just stating different things, with no coherence. But okay, it's nbd to me. Won't be a big deal when Italy gets the 4th CL spot either.

To answer your question, in places where there is an elected sheriff the elected sheriff is a law enforcement official. They hire and fire sheriff's deputies who are the police officers who investigate crimes and arrest people. They can make arrests, but obviously this power doesn't continue when they leave office. This aspect isn't particularly unusual; there aren't too many governmental offices where the occupants get to keep their legal powers after leaving the job. If an elected sheriff decides to rejoin the sheriff's office as a uniformed officer there's nothing stopping them from doing that, but that's kind of like if the President of the United States decided to rejoin the government by applying for a job as a clerk at the post office.

Two more were estimated for September and look on track to arrive early October.  They have a good track record too.

Track record is a major thing.  Most of the projects I've backed have been for (mostly indie) publishers that have a good reputation.  I think I have a decent eye for spotting when a campaign is trustworthy.

As far as game quality, I thnk I'm pretty good at picking that out too.  There are still a few I have yet to play.  My current biggest success is The [**Ancient World**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/953146955/the-ancient-world), which was the second project I ever backed.  Fun and beautiful.  

But I have high hopes that [**Above and Below**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/953146955/above-and-below-storytelling-board-game), by the same designer and publisher, will smash it out of the park.  That project was estimated for December this year, but the manufacturing process went *so smoothly* that copies have already been shipped, received *and* played over in Europe, and the early reviews are very positive.  North American backers should be getting them in a few weeks.  I am stoked.

The worst I've done is with various small games.  For example, I went in on [**Pack O Game**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/713947418/pack-o-gametm-tiny-card-games-that-are-fun-to-play) because the prospect of having such tiny portable games was really exciting, and most of the games looked like they would pack a decent punch for their size and cost.  Now that I have the games I realize that I'm not all that enthusiastic about actually playing such tiny games.  That's not the only case either.  This is my own problem -- I am always intrigued by small, portable games, but in practice I almost always prefer medium and heavy weight offerings.  I'll need to watch myself in the future.  I still count those projects as successes because I am pretty sure that they have been generally well reviewed.  If I don't enjoy them as much, it's because I personally misjudged my preferences, rather than the product actually being shoddy. :P",0,t5_2qmjp

2. Shelters funded by EU mission. Strictly for women/kids
3. Several private shelters. Strictly for orphan teenagers (under 18)

When you hit rough patch for a few months there is no simply money left to pay rent. Add my parent's medical condition and I blew all my savings (roughly 5k) in four months and I am as clean as it gets (even not pot)

But I'll just say that I turned it so the Iberian Peninsula was in the top left. Morroco and southern Spain were one empire. The islands around Greece were a coastal empire. The area around Denmark became a minor state. The rest of Fennoscandia was one nation, and occupied a bit by Danzig. Most of northwestern Africa was one giant empire. Eastern Europe formed ""the Heartlands"". Ireland and England were inhabited by two nations that shared both islands, with many enclaves and exclaves. They were in constant war over France's land. The Caucasus region was a clusterfuck, as it always has been IRL. Southwestern Asia/Southeastern Europe is full of tiny states. They are being slowly consumed by two massive empires, one stretching north from the Arabian Peninsula, and one pushing south from Russia. The area of the Mamluks (I guess Egypt?

&gt;Not with Cubs fans of course, so peppy, optimistic and dry.

&gt;But Bears fans crowd in the wallows, rubbing elbows with White Sox fans. And Bulls fans might jump in, now that Derrick Rose (aging, oft-injured diva and orgy aficionado with the $93 million contract) has announced he's doesn't feel financially ""comfortable"" anymore.

&gt;So what of Chicago Fire fans?

&gt;The Chicago Fire was once a franchise that meant something, a team that prided itself on honor, tradition and passion.

&gt;But the Fire now are so pathetic that we Fire fans can't even get into the wallowing pits. Even if they allowed us in, no one would know why we were there.

&gt;Because after years of meddling, Chicago Fire owner Andrew Hauptman has finally achieved something amazing:

&gt;The Fire are completely irrelevant in Chicago sports.

&gt;It's so bad that the Fire are now cemented in last place, a laughingstock of Major League Soccer.

&gt;Only a few weeks ago, fans were angry. We talked of revolution. Now we just sit there, numb, taking it.

&gt;The coach, Frank Yallop, was fired after winning only 13 games in two years. They've already set records for losses and it will get worse.

&gt;Except for a brief in the papers, perhaps a 20-second mention on a broadcast update, there was little or nothing on Yallop's ouster.

&gt;So the coach was run off and there was nothing. That tells you.

&gt;The soccer bloggers covered it of course, and they do a fine job. But that's not enough for Fire supporters to gain entry to the Chicago sports fan wallowing pits. You need to register in the city's sports universe to get in. But the Fire does not. So we're lonely nomads in our misery.

&gt;And Fire management must like it this way: the Fire, irredeemably incognito.

&gt;Yes, I know there are more important subjects than Fire soccer fan anguish. And I'm sure a few of you will take thick red crayon to paper and remind me.

&gt;But sometimes you just need a break. Call it a mental health vacation, call it fishing. That's why sports fans are sports fans. It helps us keep away from the truly bad in the world for a few hours.

&gt;And who can afford to fly to Virgin Gorda on a whim? I don't own a sports team, do you?

&gt;But since I'm a glutton for punishment, I drove out to the heart of pain, to the sullen village of Bridgeview. Under a gray, spitting sky, it looked rather like the fictionally corrupt town of ""Vinci"" in season two of ""True Detective.""

&gt;And there, behind Toyota Park, was the practice field. So I stood watching the team train under interim coach Brian Bliss and his assistant, Fire legend Logan Pause.

&gt;I could have watched it all day, the skill of it, the players shouting for the ball, warning of onrushing defenders, that wondrous thud when they'd drive their laces through it, and the ball snicking into the net.

&gt;So I waited, for team officials to come out and presumably love bomb the columnist-season-ticket holder out there on the sideline.

&gt;There had been news, besides giving away games. After bouncing Yallop, Hauptman hired a general manager, Nelson Rodriguez, a respected soccer executive, who'll be tasked with finding a new coach and signing players.

&gt;Unfortunately, Rodriguez will have a phone. So Hauptman will be calling.

&gt;Hauptman did not hire a team president to run the club. And that's what the Fire need, a strong president, someone to tell Hauptman to become a fan again and just love the game and let the president run things.

&gt;I know of one such person in the Chicago area who is capable, familiar with the market and well-respected in the game, with contacts among agents all over the world, a man accomplished in finance and in soccer, who ran a famous club in Europe and another in the U.S.

&gt;I don't want to say his name, but he'd be perfect for it. But Hauptman hasn't hired him, because strong, accomplished team executives don't dance when owners snap their fingers. Instead, they run teams and wise owners listen. Just look at how the Cubs are doing.

&gt;Atul Khosla, the Fire's chief operating officer, had an answer for me.

&gt;""Andrew owns the team, and if he has questions about the budget or the cost of a player, it's his team,"" said Khosla. ""He has the right to ask. But he hired Nelson Rodriguez to be the GM and run the soccer side.""

&gt;Practice was over, but a few remained on the field. Among them were young Chicago-area players on the team: Chris Ritter, Harry Shipp, Patrick Doody and 18-year-old Collin Fernandez.

&gt;The great Logan Pause, who played 12 years for the Fire and endured much of the long, gruesome decline, worked with them. And aging veterans like defender Jeff Larentowicz and goalie Jon Busch stayed too, helping out.

&gt;""The young players want to work. They want to get better. They want to improve,"" said Pause, his steel gray hair wet in the rain.

&gt;I asked him how he was dealing with it.

&gt;""Of course it hurts,"" Pause said. ""The fans are hurting, players, no one is happy with this season. No one in the Fire organization thinks it's OK. So you work. You don't stop working.""

&gt;He'll never give up. But do Chicago Fire season ticket holders stop paying? As long as Fire management is mostly about meddling, I can't say.",0,t5_2se2b

I made it clear there was no pity for Russia, just stating what is the most obvious reason for this: Russia wants a sphere of influence that expands to Eastern Europe and Middle East while the USA wants a sphere of influence that extends to Russia's borders. 

It's not some crazy defensive statement to observe what a hegemonic power and a failing energy state are doing when they dance in Asia and Europe.

Of course neighbors are scared. Our neighbors in Latin America had that same fear for decades when we attacked them for fear of some Latin American bloc resisting our efforts to dominate the hemisphere. And what is happening now? They're slowly locking us out while creating their own platform to pursue interests and making connections with Asian and European powers.

Why are Latin American countries so eager to join China's development alternative to the IMF and WB?

I find myself in a rather unfamiliar position in this discussion. On the one hand, as a global citizen in the twenty-first century, I find it completely nonsensical to dismiss out of hand the notion of Turkish membership in the European Union. (That's not to say Turkey should automatically be allowed to join, either; I just mean to say that neither Turkey's geography nor its culture/religion/ethnic makeup/etc. should disqualify it.) Further, I make a point in my classes of including less commonly recognized groups of Europeans under the category of European (more specifically, in my course on modern Germany I start the semester by talking about who is German and discussing citizenship law, identity, the place of former Guest Workers and their descendants in German society, etc.)

On the other hand, in the case of the Ottoman Empire in the early 1600s, I do find myself inclined to view the empire itself as not European or at the very least not *only* European. I take pain to say ""the empire itself"" because I recognize that a large number of the people *within* the empire were European, that large swaths of Ottoman territory were obviously on what is generally agreed upon as the European continent, etc.

I guess it comes down to semantics. Or, perhaps, the intellectual utility of the word ""European"". I'm not sure that using the word ""European"" to only mean ""located on this specific portion of the Eurasian continent"" is particularly useful -- we can just say ""in Europe"" to accomplish that. I think that given the fact that ""European"" has meant something to people who think of themselves that way and people who don't is something we as historians should take seriously. We should of course think critically about it and not get caught up in reifying divisions that may be entirely imaginary, just as we shouldn't allow ourselves to be caught up in nationalism. But I think if the ""transnational turn"" in history has taught us anything, it's that we *can* talk about nations without being prisoner to them, and likewise we probably can talk about Europeans and non-Europeans without falling victim to that discourse.

I guess that leaves me at this point: yes, obviously the Ottoman Empire was a power *in* Europe and deserves its fair share of coverage in courses that cover the history *of* Europe. Yes, many of its peoples were European. From what I understand, its institutions and administration were not particularly *European* but rather more like models in Persia and other parts of the Middle East/Asia Minor. Of course, like other imports before it (Arabic numerals, coffee, etc.) who's to say it didn't *become* European? I suppose for me the nail in the coffin is whether or not the Empire understood itself to be European (it would appear the Turks at least did not) and whether other Europeans considered it to be European (it seems to me that in the 1600s the Ottomans were seen as outsiders who had come to stay, but still outsiders).",0,t5_2ssp3

Many governments reacted to the falling birth rate by offering increasingly generous benefits for families having children. But these policies have made a limited impact. Even in Sweden, where generous parental benefits did lead to modest improvements in fertility rates, childbirths have been below the replacement level for more than two decades. 

Immigration, however, can mitigate the process of demographic change. 

The logic is simple: If a country cannot produce enough workers domestically, it can always import them. In principle, new workers fill labor shortages and raise domestic demand, causing firms to expand and hire new workers. Highly skilled immigrants contribute to specializing the economy, while low-skilled immigrants often take jobs that the locals will not. 

In addition, more workers means a larger tax base, which improves the fiscal situation of receiving countries and helps governments cover the cost of supporting older locals. ",0,t5_2qh4j

I actually got married there and made my non-traveling relatives go there because I knew it'd be a great introduction to overseas traveling that would not be too difficult.  I consider Thailand the Florida of overseas destinations.  Beautiful, fantastic, easy, and has a great tourist system where you don't have to work too hard.  It's a great first step.

I would fly into Bangkok.  Then, I would head to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.  I would buy a Lonely Planet of SE Asia.

Get a general idea of the route you'd like to travel, but be open.  You will meet so many other travelers along the way..... listen to them and be flexible.

I traveled for several months in many Asian countries.  I made one 3 month trip to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  I also made an 8 month trip to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Borneo, the Philippines, and India.

Other than the initial countries I mentioned (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar), I would also consider Indonesia.  I loved both Bali and Sumatra.  But, to be honest, the first 5 countries I mentioned should probably fill all your time.

The dystopian, overpopulated vertical cities, aka ""citadels"" in the West, are inhabited mostly by Terran immigrants who came to the planet searching for a new American Dream, deceived by Real Estate salesmen.

These cities are isolated, not necessarily due to strict control, but out of necessity: The ground level is filled with crime, and the lower layers (these citadels are stratified) are not much better. Also, people have nowhere else to go, and in theory, they COULD vote for non-corrupt governors, but in practice... imagine Transmetropolitan, but in 3D, filled with crime, corruption and reality shows.

The utopian citadels in the East have basic income, but aren't perfect; capitalism is still present and have strict population control (as in number of children allowed, mostly due to the long lifespan of their inhabitants, up to 300 years old thanks to gengineering), and the new citadels under construction are aimed at the ground occupants, to curb overpopulation and prevent an Earthlike crisis. They're governed by ""elders"" mostly, and their local senators are all descendants of the first scientists. The contrast with the west is abysmal: While Eastern citadels were founded by scientists, the Westerns were founded by Terran politicians.

Another reason for the prosperity of Hong Kong II is transhumanism; applying the greatest genetic advancements of Chinese scientists at the time, HK embraced gengineering and allowed biomods to become mainstream (something the Catholic Church is fervently opposed to).

Meanwhile in the North, New China, specifically Beijing, is a megacity sprawl. All their inhabitants are short lived, even more than Terrans due to a bioterror attack done generations ago. Blame has been put on the UN, but it's all rumors (it all started with a UN decision to limit Terran migration). They don't have utopia, their citadels are for the rich and the upper class. Almost all the industry was controlled by these citadels, until overpopulation in the ground made the ground dwellers resilient and focused on short term profit. The rise of an immortal gangster, unaffected by the lifespan-shortening virus, turned him into a religious figure, and he rules over all the ground level, and most China, had it not been for Catholic missionaries, whose ""miracles"" and compassionate attitude seized control over nearly half of the country. Ground  Beijing, however, is still the Triads territory.

At least that's the Western hemisphere. In the East, crossing Hong Kong, we have Esperanza (a futuristic Evangelical U.S.) in the North, and past Esperanza, the Mexican continent (with their own Pope living in the capital) and the Atlantean Islands, thriving with  tourism. Passing the Atlantic Ocean is Nova Europa, a small but well placed continent where Europeans chose to live. Yeah, the colonists didn't have much imagination and decided o stick with an Earthlike political division.

Finally, south of Hong Kong, we have Nipon, a modern version of Edo Japan, with a Shogun as their ruler.

Not the focus of my novel, anyway, but one of the protagonists is a Japanese noble turned cyborg cop. Her mutilation at the hands of the Yakuza left her no choice, and now she combats crime as the most prominent member of an Elite international police: The Cyberpol.

My ideas for this world came from a softening of Cyberpunk: If cyberpunk is turning contrast to the max, my world has less contrast, but more saturation :)",0,t5_2vj04

By the sounds of it, TTIP is bad because it's less of a trade agreement and more of a tool of imperialism.

There's a fundamental misunderstanding of the ""mutual"" part of ""mutually beneficial"". 

It also betrays a lack of understanding of European politics. The EU is ridiculously pluralist. You have to haggle and trade-off and concede ground and actually negotiate until you get a result that both parties are about 65% happy with, rather than one side being 100% happy and the other 0%. This is also why The UK has trouble in the EU. If you go to the table expecting to get most of what you want, you'll be disappointed. France is gonna walk.

* Developing a better understanding of different cultures, religions, and philosophies.
* Ability to communicate with non-English speakers, whether traveling or when conducting business.
* Increased employability.
* Positive impact on brain function and overall academic performance.

For this reasons I would support increased Mandarin Chinese education in the United States. That said, the potential drawbacks of learning Mandarin include:

* 98% of the world's native Mandarin speakers live in mainland China. You are unlikely to encounter native (or even non-native speakers) outside of mainland China and a handful of other locales (i.e., Taiwan, Singapore, etc.) It's utility as a second language when traveling outside of mainland China is extremely limited.
* It is one of the hardest languages for native English speakers to learn. Obtaining even moderate proficiency takes a significant amount of effort for most people, more so than for other languages.
* As noted in the article, hundreds of millions of Mandarin speakers study English. When conducting business, your Chinese counterparts will most likely speak English far better than you speak Mandarin.
* China is on the rise and looks to be an increasingly dominant player in the world, but there's no guarantee it's role will be as prominent or impactful (see also: Japan in the 1980s).

Despite these potential drawbacks, I still think increased Mandarin education in the United States would be a great thing - if only to expose American students to a non-European language and culture. As [/Urbanscuba](https://www.reddit.com/user/Urbanscuba) noted:

&gt;The hard part isn't getting the million students to learn, it's getting the teachers and infrastructure to teach them and build some momentum.

This is a great point and building this infrastructure will not be easy. But it can be done. 

[/Zeebus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeebus) noted:

&gt;That is to say that they'll probably forget it all in two years because they never use it in their daily lives (even more so with Chinese than Spanish).

Again, another great point. Whether Chinese or another language, if it's not used it will be forgotten. In theory the opportunities to speak or at least be exposed to Spanish are greater within the United States than Chinese.

Above all, students should learn a language in which they have an interest (and by extension an interest in the country/culture(s) where it is spoken). If that basic interest is not there, then no amount of encouragement (or coercion) will produce large numbers of proficient Mandarin speakers able to interact with native speakers.

They just didn't have access to gunpowder, which is what made guns and cannons possible, and is the second major reason they lost the wars to European conquerors (the first major reason was disease decimating their population). The Europeans didn't invent gunpowder, they got it from the Chinese. But the Americas were cut off from the wondrous trade routes of Europe, Africa, and Asia, and so didn't have Chinese inventions like silk and gunpowder.

But many native American civilizations were technologically advanced, just not in ways the Europeans recognized. The capital of the Aztec Empire was built on a lake, and they developed the ability to grow crops on floating gardens. The Nazca Lines (a religious monument) in Peru were often described by historians as something that would be impossible to build without some form of flying machine.

Native Americans all over two continents independently invented the wheel, the calendar, agriculture, advanced mathematics, and metalworking. Many 
North American civilizations were in fact agricultural, but their form of agriculture was unrecognizable to Europeans because it wasn't based on large concentrated square plots of land, so many Europeans considered them to still be primitive hunter-gatherers. ",0,t5_2sokd

Click ""Routes"", and watch all the non-existent routes directly between points that the maker of this video so conveniently ignored. Direct flights between south America and Australia or New Zealand. Between South Africa and south America. From Australia to South Africa.

Once again, I ask _you_: why is this video, and the person who made it, credible? He is obviously ignoring all evidence that contradicts his beliefs, and presenting _only_ that which agrees with it.

Also, look at the curves of the flight paths. They're mapped on a flat map, so the _lines_ curve one way south of the equator, and the other way north of it. Those crossing the equator go almost straight, before switching curve direction after crossing. On a globe map, the paths would all look pretty much straight.

Also, the fact that you can't find _many_ paths flying directly between extreme ends of the earth is simply because _not many people want or need to fly that route_. Again, just look at the map, how a vast majority of flights go to or from Europe, north America and east Asia. _Of course_ lots of flights are going to have stop-overs near those areas, because that way they get more travelers to make the flight worth the cost.

I'm honestly asking: _how_ is this so hard to understand? Why the _hell_ would an airline waste tons of money flying a couple of people straight over the Antarctic when it makes much more sense to fly via Europe or north America where most people want to go anyway? Those who want to travel from one extreme end to the other can still do so, at reasonable costs, when accepting longer flight times.

That this does not happen anymore during our Pride Parades - which are far from the light-hearted and fun celebrations you have in Berlin - is only because nowadays the police locks down at least one block between the attendees and the neonazis.

&amp;nbsp;

Receiving hearts is more complicated, but its about 1/8~1/12 of your gauge, but fb stacks the hearts then labels it as 1 person. So when you check, it might fill your gauge by 1/2 (so 4-6 people probably sent you a heart) and messages you ""X"" sent you a heart, check again an hour later, and ""Y"" sent you a heart but only fills your gauge by 1/8. 

&amp;nbsp;

Facebook friends are a bit complicated because while 25 is the max, only people in your region can be eligible for sending/receiving hearts. The process is as follows 

1. Say you have 40 Pokemon shuffle facebook friends. 20 in your respective region (US / AsiaAustralia / EU) and 20 in other regions.

2. Shuffle randomly picks 25 of these friends, and puts them in your friendlist. This is repeated daily at check-in time. 

3. Only friends in your region will appear in your list. So say Shuffle picked 15 friends in your region, and 10 in other regions. You'd only have 15 people appear in your list, even though you have 40 friends, and 20 in your region. 

So it's in your best interest, and everyone else's to only have friends in your own region. 

*Note: There's a heart exploit that allows people to get as many lives as they want, so if you check your facebook list, you might get a message from the same people sending you hearts multiple times, and having your gauge fill 3 times (3 hearts) each time you check.     ",0,t5_36xfp

People come over as uncaring and aggressive. When people first arrive it can be overwhelming and intimidating if you're not used to it.

When I first got to Hong Kong I lived in a dense area in Kowloon. I was really very uncomfortable and miserable there. I didn't understand the people and the enviroment sucked. I was ready to leave.

But then after a few months I realised that if you don't want to live like that, you don't need to. 

A lot of expatriates feel they have to live near to the city centre in high rises in Kowloon or HK island, or up on the Mid-Levels where the rents are astronomical. This isn't the case. Hong Kong is not just a city. It's a large territory with mountains, parks and islands.

Because the public transport is so amazingly good, most people consider a commute of an hour to be the absolute limit. But if you're prepared to increase the time of commuting there are plenty of places you can live where the environment is sparser, cleaner, even beautiful. 

I used to commute more than 1 and a half hours each way, which sucked sometimes, but I got a lot of reading done and when I woke up at the weekend I was in a quiet village with hills, jungles and beaches.

Learn a bit of Cantonese and the culture will open up to you too. Most expatriates don't bother, they just stick to English, but if you can go to the fish market and chat about the weather with the old ladies, you end up discovering people aren't aggressive at all - the language sounds harsh and people are sometimes packed like sardines and reacting accordingly - but most people are incredibly friendly and helpful.

The expense - well yes rent is high but see the 'convenience' paragraph above: you can rent a good place for not a huge amount of money if you endure a bit of isolation. The cost of food and drink is not high. The cost of eating and drinking *western* food and drink in restaurants in bars is high, but if you eat and drink like a local, it really costs next to nothing to eat well.

Finally the advantages that Hong Kong has over and above every other place: 

It's so incredibly efficient. Of course bureaucracies are never perfect, and there's some incompetence and corruption, but despite the complaining most Hong Kong state institutions work in ways that put many European countries to shame.

The aforementioned public transport: I once read a complaint letter in the newspaper where a guy was saying he had to wait TEN MINUTES for a train. That says it all - there's everything imaginable, cheap and efficient and you can get (almost) anywhere in the territory and rarely have to wait that long to do it. 

There's so much going on all the time.

There's public healthcare.

There are so many beautiful girls around.

There's fantastic hillwalking.

China is just a train ride away.

There are great beaches.

The fucking skyline.

Macau is an hour on the ferry.

The rest of SEA is a couple of hours on a plane.

The food, my god the food. Char siu bao, BBQ duck, dim sum. Pork floss. And any other cuisine on earth, if you're prepared to pay.

Not because your explanation was wrong, but because it started with the assumption that the subject reading your posts has more knowledge of the law, than he actually does, thus making it harder to get your point across.

The problem is, that when it comes to law, the definitions of the words somewhat differ from what the common folk perceives it to mean. The reason for that is that in law it's not words that are used, but legal terms. For example in the law that you quoted, the terms ""hate speech"" ""threatens"" ""expresses disrespect"" and in some countries even ""race"" ""skin color"" ""nationality"" ""ethnicity"" ""religion"" ""ethnicity"" and ""sexual orientation"" have specific definitions that may (or may not) differ from what they suggest.

These definitions can be set by either the lawmakers themselves, when passing the laws or the courts through their practice, precedent or even a study (not sure if Sweden has those sessions where a jury of judges gather to judge whether or not something needs specific (re-)defining). 

Now when it comes to hate speech being a punishable act, there are requirements for the actions of what can be called hate speech^(legal term). [I've written a quite extensive post about how it is in Lithuania, our law banning hate speech sounds pretty much the same (at least the one in the constitution) as the one you quoted, so I'm fairly certain the base principles and even some of the definitions will apply to Sweden as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3leot9/the_freedom_of_speech/cv5q2bq).

Check us out at Folk ARPS, we have more than 4 years of experience in running missions for A2 and A3, in addition to that we also have our own mission making framework F3 and a large amount of user-made, quality missions. http://folkarps.com/

FA is an European based A3 community, that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session.

But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 21.20 GMT +2 time. And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

In the past 40 years:  South America, the Middle East, much of Africa, and Eastern Europe have done pretty poorly (that's roughly 3 billion people).  Asian economies have done well, more or less, but we'll see how well they do a few decades in the future when rising oceans and pollution clean-up is considered.

A lot of growth is due to population increases, (semi) democratic rule, (semi) capitalistic economies, technology, and (fairly) low tariffs.

That's why I said ""a majority Christian population) made the real world"". I'm talking about Europeans, in case you weren't aware. They very much *did* make the world as we know it. Americans in particular made the post-WWII world that the rest of the world has tried to adapt to for one reason or another.

&gt;Without other religion/cultures we wouldn't be where we are now (or without evolving past religious dogma).

Right, and now neo-liberals are seeking to ""blend"" all of those religions/cultures into one big pile of shit. It *obviously* a bad idea and very clearly not working out. 

&gt;I am not being narcissistic I am saying the way the country works isn't dictated by religion.

That has nothing to do with what I said. My point was that Muslims *cannot* integrate into European cultures and still be the Muslims they were in their home countries. It's just not possible. Cultures cannot mix when they're that different. Sure, you can give up parts of your culture and adopt parts of another, but that's not mixing the cultures themselves, that's just cherry-picking what you believe in or take part in (which is fine, it's just not the same as assimilation).

&gt;The last pope was a Nazi who covered up Pedophilia, disagreed with contraceptive, Abortion, homosexuality etc so arguably Catholicism isn't suitable for the 'British way of life', why should they be allowed to catch up instead of denigrated as a backwards religion?

You're being purposefully obtuse. A religious leader being a disreputable person, who resigned when it was found out, does not paint a whole culture. You don't look at the religious figures to see how a culture acts on their religion, you look at the average person. What do you see the average Muslim person doing? And what do you see the average European doing? What kinds of things do they actually believe? Then you will find out what they value. If Muslims don't value the same things that Europeans value (and they clearly do not), then they can never co-exist.

That Europe tried exterminating Non white people is terrible, this however is not Palestinian's fault or responsibility, outside of perhaps taking in a certain number of Jewish refugees along with all other countries in the World as a humanitarian gesture in time of crisis (which was actually offered by Arab countries btw) Palestinians are not obligated to accept Zionist colonialism on their lands.

If you feel so inclined to be generous, you evacuate your own home and property and give Jews a country there if you like, you can't be generous with other people's property and force everyone else there at gunpoint to do the same and without any compensation because the poor Jews have suffered so much.

A notable Jewish author called Arthur Koestler described at the time how fucked up this was when he described the British Balfour declaration which is often interpreted as Britain promising European Jews  a country in Palestine as 

&gt;one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third

But lets ignore Palestinian indigenous people, because we like Jews, not filthy Arabs who unlike everyone else in the world don't have any rights to have a say in what is to happens to their territories.",0,t5_2qh13

Since entire categories of crime did not exist, there was a far narrower range of activities requiring formal censure or punishment. This means that the enormous volume of sentencing law that exists in modern societies would be entirely foreign to these societies. The types of infringements, and appropriate punishments, were narrower in scope. Additionally, yes, interpersonal conflict seems to have been fairly minimal per most missionary accounts. Many include bewilderment at how expressions that would been insulting in Europe were treated as honest and acceptable criticism, or how ""infidelity"" was treated casually. Again, with the caveat that this changed substantially after significant contact and was also quite different in areas of scarcity or among plains peoples in which rivalries seem to have developed.

&gt; Eric Whitacre (born 2 January 1970 in Reno, NV) is an American composer of choral, wind band and electronic music. He has also served as a guest conductor for ensembles throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas.

&gt; An accomplished composer, conductor and lecturer, Eric Whitacre has quickly become one of the most popular and performed composers of his generation. The Los Angeles Times has praised his compositions as ""works of unearthly beauty and imagination, (with) electric, chilling harmonies""; while the BBC raves that ""what hits you straight between the eyes is the honesty, optimism and sheer belief that passes any pretension. This is music that can actually make you smile.”

&gt; Though he had received no formal training before the age of 18, his first experiences singing in college choir changed his life, and he completed his first concert work, Go, Lovely, Rose, at the age of 21. Eric went on to the Juilliard School, earning his Master of Music degree and studying with Pulitzer Prize- and Oscar-winning composer John Corigliano.

&gt; Many of Whitacre's works have entered the standard choral and symphonic repertories and have become the subject of several recent scholarly works and doctoral dissertations. His works Water Night, Cloudburst, Sleep, Lux Aurumque and A Boy and a Girl are among the most popular choral works of the last decade, and his Ghost Train, Godzilla Eats Las Vegas, and October have achieved equal success in the symphonic wind community. To date, Whitacre's published works have received thousands of performances and have sold well over 750,000 copies worldwide. He has received composition awards from the Barlow International Composition Competition, the American Choral Directors Association and the American Composers Forum. In 2001, Whitacre became the youngest recipient ever awarded the coveted Raymond C. Brock commission by the American Choral Directors Association. 

&gt; As a conductor, Whitacre has appeared with hundreds of professional and educational ensembles throughout the world. In the last ten years he has conducted concerts of his choral and symphonic music in Japan, Australia, China, Singapore, South America and much of Europe, as well as dozens of American universities and colleges where he regularly conducts seminars and lectures with young musicians. Over the past few years, these loyal fans and supporters have moved online, spreading Eric’s popularity to an ever-expanding worldwide audience. Upcoming commissions include works for The King’s Singers with the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and an oratorio - featuring full orchestra, choir, and soloists – celebrating the opening of the new Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, TX.

&gt; His music has been featured on dozens of commercial and independent recordings. His first recording, The Music of Eric Whitacre, was hailed by The American Record Guide as one of the top ten classical albums of 1997. In 2006, a full collection of his a cappella music, Cloudburst and Other Choral Works, was released on the renowned British classical label Hyperion Records. The album quickly became an international best seller, appearing in the top ten of both Billboard’s and iTune’s Top Classical Albums charts. Two years after its debut, the critically acclaimed release continues to be a top-seller. The collection earned a 2007 Grammy nomination for Best Choral Performance.

&gt; Most recently, Whitacre has received acclaim for Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings, a cutting edge musical combining trance, ambient and techno electronica with choral, cinematic, and operatic traditions. Winner of the ASCAP Harold Arlen award, this musical also gained Whitacre the prestigious Richard Rodgers Award for most promising musical theater composer. Following its sold-out run, the most recent production earned 10 nominations at the 2007 Los Angeles Stage Alliance Ovation Awards, including one for Best World Premiere Musical.

&gt; Mr. Whitacre lives in Los Angeles with his wife, celebrated soprano Hila Plitmann, and their son.

It does now seem that these teams along with Namibia challenge the European tier 2 nations. In fact there have been some big victories at home recently for African sides with Namibia recording big wins over Russia and Germany while Kenya have thrashed Spain and Portugal (though Kenya has a big advantage at the altitude they play at).

0.018014398509481984 Chance of 18 wins.
0.040532396646334464 Chance of 17 wins.

It's only just over twice as likely, this is a more fair comparison when you are the powerhouse of weaker region.

In a region or time period when it was more competitive the value of an 18-0 or 16-2 changes. There have been times when EU was more competitive, eg the days of Alliance's 2014 Summer going 21-7 and 6-2 in playoffs. A consistent 75% win rate over so many games!

75%~80%, so ignoring context of the win rate values, which is useful for comparing to how valuable seasons wins are on a global level, we can say that with ~80% win expectancy as a top team, both 17 and 18 wins are super unlikely and both super important accomplishments, the idea that people would've been like ""well Fnatic is 20times worse for not winning their last game of the season"" sounds a little ridiculous now doesn't it?",0,t5_2rfxx

We will simply not see indefinite amounts of cases. So far, we had 650 ISDS cases over 50 years. The number of ISDS cases has been stable during the last years. US companies are not going on a rampage against states that they hold BITs with (EU companies are much more 'active' in bringing ISDS cases. t

&gt; And you think that there's a risk of going back to this without the TTIP?

Not gunboat policy, but I think it is possible that it could damage state-state relations. 

&gt; So basically it comes down to: foreign corporations don't have enough leverage in domestic courts. We need more special courts where foreign corporations have more leverage.

It is more about fair treatment. They are less likely to be fairly treated than a domestic company or subject. And no, we do not need *more* special courts, the institutions are already there (unless we are talking about the european court suggestion here). 

&gt; No, the only argument that matters should be one for ISDS. An argument as to why we need it in the first place, and in this case why we need to expand it.

Have the prior ISDS cases proven that states are somewhat likely to discriminate against foreign companies? Yes. Has the past proven that the national courts are not completely neutral when dealing with foreign investments? Yes. Do we have indicators for a regulatory chill? No. Have the individual cases of ISDS been justified? Yes.

Not a singe Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn't bring it up, either.

One of them attaches importance to analogic reasoning as a source for sharia and something I, as a layman, translate as the necessity-exception in sharia. Another one will say there are no other sources then the hadiths and the u'ran.

Didn't know that, this is nice

&gt; A long time ago, before microscopes, the person who had discovered bacteria also had a tough time proving it. The non-falsifiable condition is too much. How do you falsify whether or not the Earth is round hundreds of years ago?

Then you must consider it as an hypothesis. The guy had only *hypothesized* the existence of bacteria, but it wasn't correct to assume they existed until we could observe it or prove their behavior in some *univocal* way. There are a lot of things that we suppose, but don't know if they are true, and we wait to see if what we imagined works or not, if it is true or not. It is the mechanics of the scientific method and it is the only thing that has helped us understand the world, ever. Nothing else had worked or helped us.

In comparison, how can we rule people with unfalsifiable things? With things that we just don't know if they are true, or that we can't prove their validity? We can try a new law to, say, reduce criminality, and if it doesn't work we can change it again. But with laws that have a religious origin? They are assumed to be right, even if they make no sense, even if they were made up by some man 3000 years ago, and somewhat today are believed to be from a ""god"". 

&gt; People do though. Muslims rejected the idea of a Trinity for example. They decided to go with strictly one god and his prophet. Also when it comes to haddith and sunna, scholars are needed to interpret it in light of new situations arising. Thus they are discussing what the sharia is, what the word of God would be.

I get this happens, but it still doesn't make sense to me. It is not different than discussing fairy tales or magic unicorns in my opinion (but we are deviating, a discussion on religion could be endless and wasn't the scope of my initial reply)

&gt; EU or ECHR? Because ECHR is competent for any breach of the European Convention (meaning: A LOT OF STUFF). Even if your parliament doesn't do anything about it because they feel it's not up to the ECHR, the ECHR can still fine Italy + the ECHR judgement (might even be setting a precedent) will have to be taken in account by Italian judges.

I think it was ECHR, here is a news about it http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33611955 I don't know how it will end, and if our prime minister will be able to do what he said he will. 

Organized religion (catholics) are still a big issue in Italy, they often try to bend our laws to their bible. We had crazy laws in the past years that are being adjusted only now (like artificial fecundation, we had a law that obliged women to have 3 embryos prepared, and all of them implanted (because they are all ""persons"" for christians), even if one of them could have been bad (with genetic problems) or even if it could be dangerous for the woman to have three babies inside of her).

The seemingly unlikely emergence of a Czechoslovakia is largely the byproduct of diligent Czech nationalist activism, Allied postwar imperatives, and the sudden nature of Austro-Hungarian collapse. Of the Dual Monarchy's national minorities, the Czechs were in an advantageous political position for the chaos of World War I. In the prewar period, the Czechs were able to develop a relatively detailed political program and assert some degree of national rights versus the German minority. The various prewar fights over the national question meant that the Czechs had a highly developed political discourse about national rights and the geographic contours of their homeland. Czech national activists were able to posit that the Czech nation had a long historical pedigree (Bohemia) and paint other nationalities as either benign or pernicious to a future Czech state. The various writings of Masaryk such as *Nová Evropa* and those of other Czech intellectuals convinced the Allies that the Czechs had a clearer understanding of the nationalities issues than other groups. The activities of the Czech Legion and Masaryk's contributions to Allied intelligence also added a greater gloss to the Czechs that placed them in higher esteem than other groups. In particular, Masaryk and the Czech exile community were able to paint the Magyars as co-conspirators with the Austro-Germans in repressing national minorities. This contributed to a perception among the Allies that the Slovaks would be better off in a union with the new Czech state. The Czech exiles argued they could integrate the Slovaks far better than either the Poles or the Hungarians. In light of Wilson's call for national self-determination, Czech nationalists contended that the mutually intelligible nature of Czech and Slovak made the two nationalities a natural fit together with the Czechs assuming the senior role as the most developed nationality. There was no real Slovak voice in these matters.

An enlarged Czech state was not an automatic given in the immediate postwar. Although the Allies favored an enlarged Czech state, the near total collapse of Austria-Hungary created conditions that could undo all the plans of the Czech exiles. Fortunately for the Czech movement, the political leaders were able to swiftly take over the intact administrative and military apparatus of the dissolving Austro-Hungarian state. This was where the chronic ineptitude and weak state of the Habsburgs played into the Czech hands; there was no supranational framework to resist this quiet Czech administrative revolution after the abdication of the last Habsburg emperor. The Allies welcomed this development as Czech state was relatively stable and would be a lynchpin of the ""little Entente"" France was seeking to construct within Eastern Europe. The Slovak nationalists had no practical alternative but to be a part of the new state. The Czechs promised a degree of national unity and stability after a tumultuous war which also added to their attractiveness of accepting Czechoslovakia. 

The Slovak nationalist activists had tended to make common cause with the Czech nationalists operating abroad during the war. In hindsight, they had very little choice in their ally. This was a function of the fact that the Magyars under the Dual Monarchy tended to try and push for the one-nation Hungarian state which entailed Magyarization. An alliance with the Czechs was for some Slovak nationalists was the least worst alternative. The disorder in Hungary following Béla Kun's declaration of a Soviet republic and the Romanian invasion made an accommodation with the Czechs more appealing. Although he had yet to become as he would become in the 1930s, Jozef Tiso, a rising star in the Slovak People's Party under the chairmanship of Andrej Hlinka, tacked towards a policy of pragmatic cooperation with the Czechs with the long term-goal of Slovak autonomy. Although Tiso cooperated with Prague, he always made sure to assert that autonomy was the ultimate goal of the Slovak national movement. Both Masaryk and Benes were pragmatic when facing Slovak demands for autonomy and granted modest concession in the 1920s in exchange for the Slovak People's Party joining the government.

Being all of the same white race, with the same Christian origins and the same way of life, linked to one another since time immemorial by countless ties of art, science, politics and trade, it was
natural that they should come to form a whole, with its own character and organization in relation
to the rest of the world. It was in pursuance of this destiny that the Roman emperors reigned over
it, that Charlemagne, Charles V and Napoleon attempted to unite, that Hitler sought to impose
upon it his crushing domination. But it is a fact of some significance that not one of these
federators succeeded in inducing the subject countries to surrender their individuality. On the
contrary, arbitrary centralization always provoked an upsurge of violent nationalism by way of
reaction. It was my belief that Europe could not today, any more than in previous times, be a
fusion of its peoples, but that it could and should result from a systematic rapprochement. […] My
policy therefore aimed at the setting up of a concert of European States which in developing all sorts
of ties between them would increase their interdependence and solidarity.

This seems somewhat disingenuous.  North Korea already knows that we're unlikely to use nuclear weapons, even if they nuked Seoul, because we don't want to do tit for tat retaliations killing large numbers of civilians.  If North Korea used a nuclear weapon the UK, France, America, the EU, Russia or any host of nations has the non-nuclear individual firepower to walk into their nation, remove the government and destroy all their weapons within weeks.

Edit: Forgot one!  I love that airports in Australia have a distinctive pre 9/11 feel to them.  You don't need a ticket to go to the gate, you can bring water through security, the security guards aren't assholes, etc.  It made me realize how much flying has changed in the US (and Europe) in the past 20 years.

I moved to Memphis in 1988 because of my job.  I've gotten married here, and raised a kid here.  I know it's not always to popular thing to say about Memphis, but I enjoy this town.  (EDIT: I'll add that my wife has lived here all her life, and while she enjoys getting out of town and seeing other sights, she doesn't really want to move out of Memphis!)

I live in [the ""Southwind"" section of Memphis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Southwind,+Memphis,+TN+38125/@35.0403959,-89.7734088,42884m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x887f9a12317b7d51:0xf567da78c71afa6a) (just outside the city limits, in the southwest part of town, not far from the FedEx world headquarters at the intersection of Winchester Blvd and Hacks Cross Road...directly west of me is the way to the airport, WNW of me is the city of Memphis proper, North of me is the (nice) suburb of Germantown, east of me is the (nice) suburb of Collierville, and south of me is the state border and the (nice) suburb of Olive Branch, Mississippi...everything to do in this city is no more than a 30 minute drive from where I'm at, most often less than that).  My son - a high school senior - has a schoolmate whose parents I recently met; they live in this area, and make only around $5500 a month, and seem to be doing okay (a bit tight, but okay).

The dad in that couple is like me: overweight and aging (I just turned 50; he's a little bit younger than me) and has Type II diabetes and has high blood pressure.  We seem to share a similar regimen for our medical care, and if he's paying similar to what I'm paying (I have no idea how good his health care insurance is; mine's okay but nothing to write home about) then the medical side of things can be pricey from time to time, but it's generally affordable.  

The schools for kids in this part of town are good, and there's [a community college campus](http://www.southwest.tn.edu/smith/) nearby that adults could attend (can't speak to the costs, but it's not free). Good shopping (groceries and otherwise) in this part of town, and lots of different food choices if you want to check out restaurants (national chains or locally owned). Yeah, there's crime in this part of town (in any part of any town, really), but if you're reasonably careful then you should probably be okay for a year.  I can't guarantee that, of course, but then again you can get hit with bad luck there in Sweden, too.  

I have no idea about vehicle lease costs, but I see (and ignore) TV ads all the time talking about great deals on leasing cars. So I'm sure you can get something with a year-long lease that's affordable if you just shop around a bit.  There are apartments, homes and condos for rent all around this area.   

I work at home these days, but I used to work as a Systems Analyst in a laptop repair center here in this part of Memphis, which did (well, and still does! but it's been 7 years since I left, though I still grab lunch with some of those folks from time to time) in-warranty repairs for notebook computers from IBM, Dell, Apple, Toshiba, Sony, HP, Alienware, and others. We had folks visit all the time from Europe (UK, Germany and Netherlands, mostly, but also others including Sweden), Japan, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, India, and more...they would stay for a year or more at a time, and some of them brought their families.  They seemed to do just fine. :)  

My wife, son and I enjoy lots of things to do in and around Memphis. There's parks and nature, there's sports, there are great museums, a terrific zoo, there's music history at Sun Studios and Stax and Beale Street. There are riverboat rides and horse-and-carriage rides, there's Graceland and the Pyramid.  There are concerts, there are street festivals, there are plenty of things.  There's the botanical gardens and separately the nature center.  Lots to do and to enjoy.  

EDIT: re: ""*im beginning to see a pattern here. Mostly pointing towards a different city than Memphis.*""  

Wow, I can't believe all the hate I'm seeing posted here for our city.  Haters gonna hate.  Maybe before you decide where to live for a year, you can come visit for 2-3 days and judge for yourself?  Pretty friendly folks around here, for the most part.  Offline, at least.  :/",0,t5_2qpqw

I'd argue that *every single game* had a (if not unique, although I'd only say Syndicate doesn't meet that criteria) interesting setting.

I mean, how many games can you show me that have:  
- Medieval Jerusalem/Acre/Damascus  
- Renaissance Italy (Florence, Venice, Rome + 2 ""minor"" cities)  
- ""Renaissance"" Constantinople  
- Colonial (is that the term?) New York and Boston  
- A scaled version of the ""whole"" carribbean  
- Paris during the French Revolution.  

I'd say Syndicate is the only game so far that has a setting that is more or less known in gaming (Victorian London).

I'm going to be honest, I don't much care if the gameplay changes a lot or not, all i ever cared about in AC was the story (as a *whole*, which includes Modern Day) and the historical setting.

Unity was the first game I was ever disappointed in, but only on the story part. AC4's Modern Day wasn't *as* interesting as what we had before, but Unity was a fucking joke, it can be summarised in a couple of sentences, and the whole French Revolution was merely a background for an underdeveloped love story between what were supposed to be 2 people of opposite factions. I'm still foaming at the mouth at how they not only fucking wasted Paris during the French Revolution, but WORSE, even THAT story (the love story and ""unity"" between assassins and templars) they didn't even go anywhere with it. Elise was only a Templar by title, and the ""Unity"" was just a truce which was broken in pretty much the next sequence anyway.

But when it comes to the setting itself, you'll have a hard time convincing me Unity wasn't just the *very best* of the series. Paris is goddamn gorgeous - the amount of detail, the 1:1 monuments.

I'm very biased of course, I'm a fan of the series, and an archaeologist. Tell me I can run around ancient/historical monuments and I'll give you 60€.

&gt;And now the franchise once again return to Europe, a continent that is thoroughly explored already in previous games.

Renaissance Italy and Revolutionary France are nothing alike... Neither is Constantinople, so I really don't get this argument. If they went BACK to Renaissance Italy after AC4 then yes...",0,t5_2qhwp

I decided to play a non-blobby game, and I thought I'd try to play Holland in a non-blobby manner. (Historic colonisation, trade etc.) So i relaxed, became friends with lots of the HRE members, and focused on being the rich man of Europe.

Meanwhile, only on the other side of the Mediterranean, the Ottomans were building up strength. I found out about this when I received a notification that congratulations! I was now the Emperor!


I found out that AI Ottomans had blobbed over Asia, eaten most of Eastern europe and southern Italy, and were currently working on Austria. In total, they had 450,000 troops. 

In a bid to DO SOMETHING, I passed the remaining reforms in the HRE, making everyone in the HRE vassals (What I like to call the Greater Dutch Republic) and rode to battle against the Ottoman behemoth.


What followed was probably expected. My personal troops of highly trained Dutch merchants were not a match for battle hardened, full quality ideas, Ottoman troops. Thankfully, all my german vassals will support me, right?

Wait, why are all my Germans sieging one fort in Hungary? GUYS, HELP ME! My Germans eventually got round to engaging the Ottomans, and in a close battle managed to defeat the Ottoman army.

People are going to flame me to hell and back, but the reason why Heroes failed so spectacularly is that Tim Kring is a hack. What he does is create a show based on the premise of a movie he thought was cool (Heroes=X Men, Touch=Knowing) without really understanding what made it cool or having the creative ability to expand on it. He then relies on a convenient writing crutch to keep the series afloat. 

People will say, ""How can you say that about Kring? Heroes started out so strong. Clearly he has some talent."" Of course it started out strongly, because the entire first season was just a pastiche of other comic book stories that he and the other writers were obviously cribbing off of. When they ran out of source material, the show floundered.

For example, if I remember correctly, there was a s/l where there was the threat of the cop's brother threatening to blow up NYC. That was the plot of Akira. There were other plot points throughout season one that were also cribbed. That was season one of Heroes, cobbled together plots and characters from other stories without any cohesive vision or game plan. Audiences thought, ""Oh, this is all clearly building up to something, going somewhere,"" but it never was.

With Touch, Kring relied on another crutch, and that was to make every single episode follow the ""serendipity"" gimmick of the pilot. Third Worlder character, American character, and European character each have a s/l that seems unrelated. Then their storylines intertwine at the end of the episode, with Jake uttering some pseudo-intellectual babble about how we're all connected and blah blah blah. Like Heroes, Touch started off strong, but Kring, being what he is, couldn't keep up the momentum so that by the end of the first season, the show was not only a parody of itself but contrived.",0,t5_2qh1i

Well yeah. If you're breaking up complete thoughts in the middle and wondering why you're not getting it, that's bad comprehension by you.

It is.  You are right.

&gt;
So why are you so scared of a Jewish response.

I'm not scared of Jews, but Jewz are kinda spooky.

&gt;You're spending more time attacking me

No attacks.  Only hugs.  Mind hugs.

&gt;for my response than responding to the relevant points thoughtfully. You could have at least said, ""I looked into these things but didn't understand them. Can you explain them better?"" Do you know how happy I'd be to assist you if that was your approach? The answer is very!

But I wasn't confused about Catholicism.  You were the one confused.  So I clarified.  

I gave you a mind hug.

&gt;
And maturity to boot!

You don't see the reference.  I get it.


&gt;
Aggressive how?

It was a rather untenable claim.


&gt;
Use your wikipedia abilities to learn. Or better yet, try looking beyond wikipedia since it's not as perfect as people think it is.

[I know.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=2m0s&amp;v=EW4h7kTZewg)


&gt;Or, you know, express a little humility and say, ""hey, I'm not understanding these things you're talking about."" I guess that's below you.

By not wasting time.


&gt;
Well, a good response would be, ""history has already run its course and we have the way things are today.

Dammit.

&gt;We can't go back and find out if secular people would be originators of such causes.""

I guess you can't compare today.

&gt;I guess it's no coincidence that the USA and interestingly, Myanmar, two countries with a more religious bend and less involved in social welfare programs give more in terms of charity than the secular paradises of Europe.

So there we go.

&gt;
Well, there were less non theists then. 


Come on.

&gt;However, the growth of atheism hasn't correlated to a growth in charitable organizations, rather an insistence on government services to the poor which doesn't improve their situation but just pacifies them. To put it simply, an attempt at emulating Western European socialism, which evidence shows are not nations of charitable people.

There we go.


&gt;
I didn't say that,

Fuck!

""**Right, because atheist leaders of the 20th century aren't responsible for the deaths of an estimated 80 to 200+ million people.**""

Goddamit.  I can't fucking ever get anything you say right.

&gt;but that certainly is a chapter of recent history in which my family, and many families I'm close to were victim of.

My bad.  I'm sorry.  I can see how that factors into the discussion.  I am an atheist.  And other atheists have attacked and killed your family.  Hence this should make me stop and think about my own morality.  If it's possible for these other atheists to kill Jewz...is it really impossible to say I won't be susceptible to the same?

I cannot say for sure.  My brother in law better watch the fuck out, because if I go Jewz killing he is first.


&gt;
I know you think you're so funny,

See, when I try to share my life all you see is the lulz.

&gt;but I have yet to see an atheist respond with a real answer to these assertions.

Assertions are powerful stuff.  They deserve evidence to combat them.

&gt;I mean, there's a flipping atheist movement called ""anti theism"" and usually when someone says they're ""anti"" something means they're opposed to it on all fronts. This creates an interesting predicament because if I have to find favor in an atheists eye, that means abandoning my beliefs and conforming to them. What happens when I don't conform and go back to worship?

You probably get killed.  Isn't that what has happened to the Jewz for the past 2,000 plus years?  You get persecuted and killed.  This isn't a new program, it's just your turn now.  

As far as I go, I would never kill anybody.  I just don't have the stomach for it.  I'm a bit of a pussy.  But, ya know, you would be killed.

Probably by atheists.


&gt;
Or at least connected to the moral virtue of such an action.

Makes my dad look right.  He said that if any major religion was disproven all the adherents would go crazy.  End of days shit, running throw the streets, raping and killing.



&gt;
Making often ineffective government programs aimed to help the needy,


What government programs are ever effective?

&gt;which don't help the needy does take away the charitable outlet away from religious organizations.

Because there can be too many charities?

&gt;I'd have more trust in whatever amount of tax I pay for peoples welfare to go to religious organizations and do something more grassroots to help people than top down.

You couldn't do that in my country, the united states, because that shit would only allow for extreme corruption.  Suddenly only certain churches get money and the rest of the organizations get boned.  Or atheists create their own ""church"" and start abusing money meant for the needy.  

I trust the ineffective government system more.



&gt;
Poor example and a straw man. 

It's an example of an atheist giving more money than any other single human in modern history.

And for it to be a strawman it would mean that I misrepresented your point in order to defeat your argument.  When did you ever mount an argument?  Look at the timeline. 

&gt;Right, people inspired by the word of God and inspired to positively change the world.

""So if they weren't inspired by god then they wouldn't do any of these things? You should really despise atheists then. Not only are they mass murderers on the prowl to kill theists but they also endeavor to ruin the state of the world by destroying charities.""

""**I frankley don't know how Bill Gates did what he did. Must be a fake atheist.**""





I offhandledly mentioned that Bill Gates is likely a fake atheist because he is doing good works instead of prowling around and killing theists.

When the hell did you formulate any argument about anything regarding this?

When did you argue that atheists don't necessarily prowl and kill?

&gt;I'm not claiming all atheists are anything. 

I didn't say you did.

&gt;I never said atheists cannot be charitable.

They are less charitable.

&gt;I'm only pointing out that charity amongst atheists is lacking compared to the religious.

Right.  

&gt;If anything, any poll regarding the amount of charity given on behalf of atheists is greatly skewed if he's tallied into that data.

I dunno.  Like I said.  *Fake Atheist.*

&gt;It'd be no different than tallying the average of every user of/r/debatereligion's annual salary and throwing Bill Gates into the data. We'd all have at least a 6 figure income and I'm pretty sure that's not the case for the majority of us.

It's reasonably homogenous, and do you know why we're successful? Because in the 1970s we struck oil, big time. Before then we were a third world country where everyone was deeply religious, it was common to beat kids and wives, virtually everyone was poor, deeply racist fundamentalists. And then we struck oil, big time.

We already had a lot of socialistic / communistic leaning people, and so we decided it was a good idea to nationalize the oil, instead of just giving it away to private industries.

And we also as a country thought: Hey, let's have someone who understands finance manage this wealth, so we can all benefit.

So it was put into an oil fund, where we skim the interest off the top, and invest it into our infrastructure and social welfare programs.

This has nothing to do with the fact that we are white. It was dumb luck, and a little bit of economic restraint.

As we got more and more money, standard of living went up. We had strong unions who could tell employers to go fuck themselves if they tried exploiting workers too badly, and as we got wealthier, we got better educated and less religious, and now we live in a fairly secular country with a pretty good system.

It's very little to do with being ethnically homogenous - though we are about 90% ethnic norwegians, with 5% of the population being nonwhite immigrants of some generation or other, and they have almost universally fit in extremely well.

There are some shitheads, sure. Famously the oslo rape stats are almost entirely made up of muslims. What many people don't know is the hard numbers. Firstly, it talks about violent assault rapes, and not date rape, incest rape, priests diddling children rape, or anything like that. Just the knife to the throat scream and we'll kill you kind of rape.  Well, around 90% of the rapists in those cases were muslims.

But that still only amounted to about 17 people, in a city of some 650000, where almost a third of the population are muslims.

Suddenly it's not that bad after all. Especially not when you remember that most rapes are not violent rapes, but rather date rapes or incest rapes, that go unreported for quite a long time.

Now if you look at Iran for example, they actually wanted to nationalize their oil too, but uncle Sam said: Nope, our oil company benefactors want you to privatize it - so they toppled the iranian government by helping the fanatical jihadists into power.

I wonder how Iran might be different without that dickmove. They would have been vastly wealthier, and had a fairly secular government for 40 years, instead of poverty and murderous theocracy.

A similar story applies to many countries.

Now, look at how European colonialists in past times were doing as they pleased in Africa. Enslaving people, stealing natural resources, oppressing, doing a lot of horrible stuff, and then just leaving the place and allowing warlords to establish themselves in the power vacuum left behind. Look at how Shell has been making deals with corrupt leaders in Nigeria so they could buy the rights to pump oil for nothing at all. The Nigerian people got nothing out of that except an oil spill that makes deepwater horizon look quaint. Nobodys' cleaning up that shit either.

So it's easy to say that white countries have done so well for themselves - partly because we've been lucky, and partly because we've been very efficient at fucking over other countries with a lot of resources, making sure they don't get any back.

Look at how we buy cheap coffee and cocoa beans from African farmers who don't even know what the beans are used for. Then it's refined in Europe and sold as chocolate and coffee for a markup that would make the pharmaceutical industry look at them in awe.

We're not better people, we're not worse either. I don't think they would do it differently if the shoe was on the other foot, but I don't think we can sit here and claim it's because we're white that we're doing so well.

There aren't a lot of clean counterpicks, and even if you're counterpicked, there are a lot of workarounds to it. In Dota2, it's much less forgiving. Let's try to break down the ways LoL is superior to Dota2, and vice versa (having played both games and followed both games in major tournaments and meta changes etc).


Why LoL &gt; Dota2:
1.) Keyboard mechanics. While Dota2 may have different cast animations, LoL doesn't have them. This might mean it's easier to cast spells in LoL (which is true), but cooldown is also quicker. This means you tend to cast more spells within a shorter period of time than in Dota2 (where you have to time spells accordingly). This all might point to Dota2 being superior, except there are quite a number of heroes in LoL where to be really effective, you have to cast maybe 6 or more spells (including flash) all within a 1sec duration (see zed/lee sin). There are a LOT of easier champs in LoL, but there are also a lot of champs with really high skill caps.

This is why when the koreans came, they dominated LoL so hard such that it's often Korea &gt; China &gt; Europe &gt; NA (despite NA being the most profitable region). That's why they have jokes that NA's diamond tier is Korea's bronze tier (bronze is like, 1-2k mmr)

2.) Skill Shots. This means positioning, aiming, and timing are all gonna be the difference between a kill or not (or surviving or dying). There's only, maybe a handful of heroes who have skill shots in Dota2 (WR comes to mind), but practically majority spells that ""shoot"" in LoL are skill shots.

3.) LoL is much more forgiving and more accessible to newbies than Dota2. Because there are less champs in LoL, and because each champ has their own job written down, it's easier for newbies to pick them up. This is why Riot is more profitable (in terms of overall revenue) than Dota2.

4.) Riot actually pays their athletes (only applies to NA I believe) with an actual regular salary. This results in a more stable career path for their players. This means you won't go paycheck to paycheck for tourneys. But of course, this means the slots are more limited.

5.) Riot handles the production of their tournaments very very well. From the direction, wardrobe choices, production, language used, you can see LoL tournaments becoming more and more like an actual sports event. You have instant replays, play-by-play analysis, pre- and post-game analysis. They even have, for a brief time, the one where they can doodle on the screens, make circles etc?  They have at least 2 guys just manning the camera for spectators so the casters don't have their attention divided. They show every action/kill as much as possible. This allows the viewers to see all the action happening at the map, even if there are two or three happening simultaneously (unlike in Dota2 where we sometimes see when two clashes happen, we're only privy to one match, and left to speculate how the other guy died).

Practically everything is handled very efficiently and professionally by Riot. 

6.) Some might flame me for this, but I actually like the limiting factor of hero pool by LoL. This allows me, a totally random noob, to be forced to play a few champs so I'll see how they can excel and be a bit better and have a more informed opinion of those champs. It also takes away the intimidation. And seriously, it's not that hard to unlock every single champ in LoL. You only also need a few runepages that you can use for various roles. 


Why Dota2 &gt; LoL:

1.) Variety and versatility. The hero pool of Dota2 is way more than in LoL (5 bans vs 3 bans). While there are traditional positions (1-5), and while those also exist in LoL, hero roles are more flexible. You can have a core Lina, or a support Lina. You can have a lane KotL, or a jungle KotL. In LoL, the roles are more rigid. You can't have a Leona or Nami carry. (in pubs yes, but not in pro). The only instance I saw a traditionally support hero go midlane is Zilean (time bomb guy, really fun to play). But everything is pretty set in LoL.

2.) Strategy and teamwork is more rewarding. By this I don't mean the warm fuzzy feeling, but better teamwork actually gets more done in Dota2 than in LoL. Because of the complex variety of heroes here, there are way more interactions that produce a more superior effect (i.e. the sum is greater than the parts). 

3.) Replays are a godsend. Also because of this, anyone can cast their own version of the game, and not rely on Valve. (Side note: It's like how Riot is the overprotective parent or the giving tree that just keeps on giving, and Valve is the guy who will teach you how to fish so you won't keep bugging him anymore when he's drowning in whiskey.)

4.) Much more tourneys. Individual groups can host their own tourneys. This means a lot more people can have an income off of dota2. Also more chances for teams to earn more.

5.) Because of the number of tourneys, and because of the internationality of them, we're more exposed to teams from other regions as well. We see more ""intermingling"" than in LoL. In LoL, Riot owns NA and EU streams. But if you wanna see the korean vids, you either have to donate in twitch (I think?) for MonteCristo to release the vods. Anyways, yea.


I think I've been fair to both games. Both games are similar, but also reward very different things. ",0,t5_2s580

“In January of 1997, Richard Glossip worked as the manager of
the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City, and he lived on the premises with his girlfriend D-Anna Wood. Justin Sneed, who admitted killing Barry Van Treese, was hired by Glossip to do maintenance work at the motel.

Barry Van Treese, the murder victim, owned this Best Budget
Inn in Oklahoma City and also one in Tulsa. He periodically drove from his home in Lawton, Oklahoma to both motels. The Van Treese family had a
series of tragedies during the last six months of 1996, so Mr. Van
Treese was only able to make overnight visits to the motel four times in that time span. His usual habit was to visit the motel every two weeks to pickup the receipts, inspect the motel, and make payroll.”

http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/10/10-6244.pdf

So Justin Sneed, the maintenance man, killed Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel, there is no doubt. The question is whether Sneed acted on his own, and merely implicated Richard Glossip, the live-in Manager, or did Richard Glossip pay Sneed to do the dirty deed?

The Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City

**(4) (pre-trial, trial, and post trial facts)**

Justin Sneed got Life in prison without parole. Richard Glossip got the Death Penalty, and he’s scheduled to be executed this year (2015). Actually in just 2 weeks. He would have been executed by the time of this writing if the Supreme Court did not hear the case of States experimenting with new drugs and dosages as the usual lethal injection drugs are no longer available from European pharmacies. This is because Europe, in general, stands in opposition to the Death Penalty.

It appears as though Richard Glossip was involved in a number of improprieties at the motel. Every motel has a maintenance budget. Justin Sneed, 19, came to the motel as part of a construction crew. When the crew moved on to the next job, Justin Sneed stayed behind and he didn’t want to continue the construction job. Richard Glossip, the Manager, hired him as a maintenance man and gave him a free room and board in exchange for maintenance work.

It appears that Richard Glossip was:

* Taking money from the vending machines.
* Selling equipment belonging to the Motel.
* Renting a room to Justin Sneed off the books in exchange for free maintenance work and then pocketing money budgeted for maintenance.
* Probably renting rooms to others for cash off the books and pocketing the cash.
* Doing some jobs, such as housekeeping, himself and then pocketing the money budgeted for these jobs.

**So who has a motive for murder?**

In addition to all this, he was blatantly stealing from the Motel, and the owner. Barry Van Treese and his wife, noticed at least a $6,000 shortfall by the time Van Treese went to investigate. Richard Glossip had gone too far and he couldn’t hide these funds. Now his money pool was about to dry up and he was about to lose his Manager job.

In comparison, what motive did Justin Sneed have to kill Barry Van Treese? If the owner of the Motel was killed, Sneed might lose his room and board and his job. But then again, he would probably lose these anyways, because the owner was about to find out all the strange things that were going on at the Motel.

If Van Treese is killed, maybe his wife would keep Richard Glossip on as Manager and he could continue doing what he was doing. Glossip perhaps thought Van Treese would find out. But Van Treese already knew of the shortfalls, and knew he was going to go to the Motel, find out what as going on, and possibly fire the Manager, Richard Glossip.

What is Justin Sneed’s motive for breaking into Barry Van Treese’s motel room, room 102, at 3:00 AM and beating him to death with a baseball bat? There is nothing to gain here.

Some sites on the internet are talking about a vast conspiracy with mob connections going right into the police department. They are ignoring the other evidence, the really bad facts about Glossip.

Justin Sneed murdered Barry Van Treese and implicated Richard Glossip as the one who hired him to do the murder

**Various sites around the internet allege that Richard Glossip is innocent because:**

* He was a law abiding citizen and this was his first criminal arrest.
* Justin Sneed implicated Glossip in order to avoid the Death Penalty.
* The police pressured Sneed into implicating Glossip. Prior to that, Sneed had not mentioned Glossip as a co-conspirator.
* Sneed has refused to testify against Glossip if there were to be a new trial.

Actually, why would Justin Sneed get the Death Penalty anyways for beating a man to death with a baseball bat?

There is this Death Penalty Aggravator in Oklahoma “1)The murder was especially heinous, atrocious, cruel or depraved (or involved torture)”. The murder might not qualify if the victim was killed quickly.

In Arizona, maybe he would face the death penalty, and there was evidence of a prolonged struggle, but chances are, Sneed would not face the Death Penalty for a beating death (10 to 15 blows with the bat). By implicating Glossip, Sneed made things worse for himself, because now he is admitting that he murdered for money, and that would definitely qulaify Sneed for the Death Penalty.

Well, Sneed didn’t mention Richard Glossip the first few go rounds with the police. Well, of course not. That’s what part of the deal was, not to tell, and Richard had promised him a lot more money. Of course Sneed, only 19 years-old at the time, was not going to tell about Richard Glossip until he knew he was not going to be let go.

If Sneed wanted to avoid the Death Penalty, it doesn’t help him to say he murdered for money. He could just say he got into an argument with Van Treese earlier in the evening, he didn’t really know who Van Treese was. He got drunk / drugged and broke in and attacked Van Treese. This would be enough for him to avoid the Death Penalty and possibly get a capital murder case downgraded to a 2nd degree murder charge. Really, Sneed got a really awful deal: life in prison, for testifying against Richard Glossip. So no wonder he is refusing to testify against Glossip in a possible re-trial.

Sneed did not have an altercation or any run in with with motel owner Barry Van Treese. The only way he would even know who Van Treese was, or have the key to his room, is if Glossip told Sneed who Van Treese was. Glossip had to tell Sneed what room he was staying in, and Glossip had to give Sneed the key to his room.

They are going head-to-head with Icelandic for service on the KEF to YUL/YYZ route. The YYZ-Europe segment is heavily populated with competition from the likes of Air Canada to Austian and Swiss and everyone in between. Those airlines can run aircraft at less capacity due to cargo in the stowage that is a significant revenue generator and can fly at 60-70% capacity without impacting the operation vitality of that route. 

For small, low-cost airlines like Wow, they need low cost centers to run effectively and Canada isn't one of those places. With high costs, it means they'll have razor thin financial viability and the service will probably be discontinued in favour of US routes with better operating potential, such as Boston and New York.

I'd imagine it's pretty fucking huge... I feel like the money would be there in crowd funding, but the problem however, is that the risk falls on the consumer and turns the entire fucking system into pre-ordering with as little info as possible. When you pre-order now, you're mostly guaranteed to get A game, but in this world games wouldn't be made at all without high risk from thousands of consumers. Devs could fund their own games beyond the first if they made enough to pay themselves and cover costs for the last game and the same for another, but that still involves investing all your earnings into a huge risk. I feel like that works for devs with cheap games that just get lucky one time, but for everyone just doing ""okay"", it wouldn't.

I feel the more important aspect is consumer education and some basic protection laws (which we actually just got a bit of with the 30 day policy in EU). Consumers have money to spend, but where they put it makes all the difference. Games can be profitable without being incredibly scummy, but when greedy/lazy practices are rewarded, why would they be consumer friendly? Imagine how many amazing games could be funded if hundreds of millions of dollars weren't pouring into the pockets of literally the worst developers and publishers in the industry.

I agree to some extent. Peace for Israel is also achievable through other less peaceful means too although this this kind of peace should only be taken as a last resort and will only benefit Israel.

Unfortunately the Palestinians refuse to negotiate with Israel and instead go to the UN to have a peace imposed on Israel by force. You can probably understand why this will never work and only serves to prolong the conflict.

To be completely honest with you I think that the status quo while not ideal is the best thing for now and the foreseeable future. Palestinian society by any metric is violent, anti-semitic and extremist. The only way Israelis and Palestinians can have real peace and not just peace that's on paper is for the Palestinians to change their society fundamentally.

Just giving the Palestinians a country isn't going to solve anything. Palestinians will still have a closed minded, extremist and violent society only now they will also have a country that they can turn into an oppressive conservative dictatorship. Does the ME really needs another country like that?

And any such change will have to come from within their own society and not Israel/US/EU.

&gt;Palestinian Authority getting recognition on being an independent state will only have one result, cementation of the two state solution.

The only thing that getting recognition will do in effect is feed into the Palestinian leaderships delusion that they can get a country for themselves without Israel being on board.

But what in the sam hell are you talking about?? You have got to be under 18, its the only rational reason I can figure. Other than the off chance (and unlikely that you have had an abortion in the past and are fight to justify your decision). But here goes. 

""Murder isn't always bad"" ?? Yes it is!!! ALWAYS!!! PERIOD! 
 
Putting down an animal is NOT murder. Animals are not humans and they don't have rights no matter how much you love your pets.  Choosing to end life support of a brain dead person in a coma is NOT murder. Killing in the name of war is perhaps murder, based on what side you are on. Throughout history war has been a necessity but that does not make it right. War is one country physically stopping another from doing something. For example, the Allies physically stopping Hitler from conquering Europe enslaving millions and murdering 6 million Jewish people int he process. This was a cause worth stopping and many people gave their lives to do so. This is also NOT murder. Its a use of force to stop a people from murder! However WAR IS WRONG! MURDER IS WRONG. I am definitely against both of those!!

Now lets address the rest of your callowness.  
""for either their sake or the child's- just like putting down a pet"" WTF!! How can you claim that putting down a child is in its best interest?! There is NO excuse for killing a child?! Its never the ""human"" thing to do. 

""you are not pro life; you are pro birth."" You have no idea what I care about! ""I don't care about the quality of life"" So, lets think about your statement. If a child is going to have a hard life ... we should just kill it first?? If its going to be a burden on the mother ... we should just kill it?? I am honestly appalled that there are people like you out there think this way. Since I cant post a link why don't you go to youtube and watch Ron Archer video Trick Baby.  

You my friend are evil, pure plain and simple. Most people consider Hitler to be an evil person this is res ipsa loquitur. His mind set was that, people of jewish faith we not fit to live because they were lesser humans, thus since they will never be teachable, or are incapable of learning, we should just kill them all. To him it was humanitarian just like putting an animal down. Notice any similarities in your thought process?? You are of the same mind set my friend and need to take a hard look in the mirror if you think for a second killing a baby is the ""right thing to do"". 

You say its a tough situation. What else is a tough situation? Divorce is also a tough situation to go through but its never the right thing to do just to kill your spouse because she'll be worse off without you. Or kill your kids because living with two parents will be hard and will cause a burden on the mother. 

You say I am selfish because I think all humans have a right to live, no matter what??? Yet its not selfish to kill another human so that your life wont be burdened?? How can you not see that is completely bass-ackwards.  

There is NO excuse for Abortion!!! It is Murder!!! and it is NEVER right!!! If you think otherwise you need to take a hard look in the mirror and question why you would support such a practice. I doubt you think you are evil, I doubt you think you are a bad person. But if you have to choose a side of this argument to be on, if I have to choose a side of this argument to be on. The only way to possibly go it to be on the side that fights for life!!! Anything less is truculent. 

There are other people on this thread that are making snide remarks because I am from Fort Worth. Like that fact is in anyway germane to the discussion. But yes I am a Christian and I am from Fort Worth. I do not consider myself better than anyone. I am a sinner, I have committed tremendous sins that would certainly be reason enough for me to burn in hell. However, the difference is that I know that and I've put my faith in a higher power and through that I've been forgiven of those sins and given a heart of compassion. A heart to love others. If you my friend have ever been down on your luck, or just in a tight spot and someone lifted you out of it. Would you not try and repay the favor or pay it forward? I hope and I pray that one day God steps into your heart as well and you see the light. When that happens you too will have a change of heart and one day you'll be pleading with someone to have compassion and do the same. May God Bless you my friend. ",0,t5_2r2jt

Basically, there are some countries whose citizens are most likely not ""unfree enough"" or endangered enough to justify asylum. For example Serbia isn't really the best country ever and has a lot of problems, but its citizens are most likely safe.

The rule now says, if a country is considered ""safe"", then it's very unlikely that a person from this country will be granted asylum, thus, the whole granting/denial-process can be much faster.

This doesn't affect war refugees, like from Syria, but rather people from Albania, Serbia and the like.

Actually yes there damn well is.

&gt;I'm just pointing out your attempt to conflate indeterminable factors like 'the unreported date rapes' as an apology for Muslim rapists that specifically target native women.

It's not an apology. It's pointing out that our ""brother europeans"" commit rapes to, and people like you don't seem to give a fuck. It's only a problem when DE BAD MOOSLEMS do it apparently, which I think is a scummy attitude.

&gt;Even if that were the case for Norway, it doesn't explain the phenomenon of racially targeted rapes across the rest of Europe. 

Fine.

&gt;Your argument fails to hold up to logic, and further fails to apply to the rest of Europe.

What argument? That 17 people out of over 200000 isn't a lot, and that we shouldn't forget about the 'brother european' rapists out there?

&gt;It is my belief that these women have a right not to be raped by immigrants

Okay. It's my belief that everybody has a right not to be raped by anyone.

&gt;no matter how good it feels to pat yourself on the back for being one of the 'good white people' for reciting the 'good think', it does not out-measure a young woman's right not to be forcibly penetrated.

No matter how good it makes *you* feel to think you're a good person by 'standing up to the big bad immigrants', you need to keep reality in mind too. Quite right, it doesn't outmeasure a young woman's right not to be raped. I didn't suggest it did, and your insinuation that I think it does, is what makes me think you're nothing but a troll after all.

&gt;I understand that you are angry, but I believe that not pointing out Social Justice Warriors and the mental gymnastics they do to apologize for all of the violence their brother Europeans are suffering at the hands of angry Muslim immigrants is an opinion that commonly serves as a detriment to Europeans everywhere. Social Marxism leads to decay. Whites deserve justice too.

I didn't say that. I said they're all trying to adopt the globalist culture that was created by European peoples. Part of the reason for that is their link to Europe via colonial imperialism, and European culture was forced onto some of them. Some just saw it as attractive, some saw money in it, some felt it was superior, etc. But they certainly had their own cultures that were developed in totally different ways. Some of those cultures were stunted, however, due to colonial imperialism and the introduction of foreign cultures. It's hard to say how they would have developed if left alone, but it's clear that whatever they would have become, it would have been something that those people could naturally fit in with, obviously.

&gt;""Americans in particular made the post-WWII world"" not sure how they change British people drastically from the way we would have been without them.

In the late 40's and 50's, the US economy was completely dominant and the US had direct influence in most of the world. British people were already very similar to Americans, for obvious reasons, so the change was not as stark. 

&gt;I was explaining what I said, which you didn't seem to understand.

No, I understood it. What about ""That has nothing to do with what I said."" don't you get?

&gt;Various things but I don't know anyone who I would judge differently if I found out they were muslim.

You're missing the point entirely. I'm not talking about your average Muslim in *western* countries. They are *far* from the average. I'm talking about the average Muslim in *Muslim* countries, in particular the Middle East and Magreb. They live in a way that is quite foreign to European culture, and you would probably know that they're a Muslim before you even talk to them.

&gt;You know about Paganism and Norse Gods?

Yes, and I know that that has nothing to do with this discussion. Stop trying to make false equivalencies. This is not about religion, it's about culture. It just happens that one of these cultures is centered on religion (Muslim culture). There's nothing inherently wrong with that, just that you cannot separate that religion from the culture.

&gt; Islam is an Abrahamic religion it's not a million miles away from Christianity

Just because they're related doesn't mean they're at all the same, or even similar. Again, this is not a matter of religion, it's a matter of how religion affects culture. Obviously Christianity mixed with European cultures produces a vastly different thing than Islam mixed with Arab (and other) cultures. We are talking about *that* difference.",0,t5_2qhlh

It is not socialism that forces people under the label of worker, it is capitalism. In capitalism you either own the means of production or you do not. There is no middle ground. To simplify it down A LOT, if you own the means of production you are a member of the bourgeoisie, if you do not own the means of production and are forced to be exploited by the bourgeoisie you are a worker, or proletariat. The designation of ""worker"" or ""proletariat"" is not an insult, but a very fixed definition used to describe a particular group of people. It isn't designed to address anything other than who owns what so why would it? This whole circlejerk about socialism ignoring everything that makes someone an individual is predicated on nothing more than just ignorance of what socialism even is. Socialism is most definitely not about ""uniformity"" in all things. That sounds like a definition pulled straight out of some 1950s US propaganda and shows a fundamental lack of understanding on Marxist philosophy. 

Also this idea that it's a failed system is almost so much of a joke I almost don't want to address it. A majority of capitalist nations have collapsed and failed, and about 90% of the people living in the surviving ones live in poverty. So if you want to have the ""the countries collapsed"" argument capitalism will always lose.

Centuries ago people (europeans) questioned if africans were a different species.  At the time this was a legitimate question, as we could also ask if pygmies are a closely related, but different human species.  It also had widespread legal consequences; but science (At it's best) shouldn't consider them and instead search for truth.

Scientifically a human being is as I described.  It is human from the instant it is fertilized, just as you or I are human.  It's just a stage of development, embryo, fetus, infant, toddler, child, adolescent, adult, middle-aged, elderly, etc.  Accordingly rights can be associated with a stage of development, i.e. voting when a certain age is reached.  However, scientifically humanity is continuous with respect to development.  Using a stage of development to grant ""personhood status"" seems to me to be problematic, because it's always going to be an arbitrary stage.

I'll also note the definition I gave accounts for why an embryo (single cell) is a human being and my stomach cell (also a single cell) is not.

Some notable overseas countries where German is spoken include (note that all of these numbers refer to native speakers): 

• Argentina: 600,000 speakers (400,000 Standard German and 200,000 Yiddish)

• Bolivia: 220,000 speakers (160,000 Standard German and 60,000 Low German)

• Brazil: 4.5 million speakers (1.5 million speak Standard German and 3 million speak Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, a unique Brazilian German dialect)

• Canada: 548,200 speakers (430,000 Standard German; 80,000 Low German; 15,000 Pennsylvania Dutch; 23,200 Hutterite German). In the Canadian province of Manitoba, German is the mother tongue for 6% of the population; this outnumbers French, which is the mother tongue for 4% (English is the native language for 75%). Also, as an aside, I find Manitoba interesting because the Aboriginal population makes up 17% of the population, which is pretty large as far as things go. 

• Israel: 415,000 speakers (200,000 Standard German and 215,000 Yiddish)

• Kazakhstan: 228,000 speakers (178,000 Standard German and 50,000 Low German)

• Paraguay: 206,000 speakers (166,000 Standard German and 40,000 Low German)

• Russia: 394,138 speakers of Standard German

• United States: 1,295,154 speakers (1,104,154 Standard German; 150,000 Yiddish; 12,000 Low German; 133,000 Pennsylvania Dutch; 10,800 Hutterite German). Of note, “Pennsylvania ‘Dutch’” is not Dutch, but rather a corruption on “Pennsylvania Deutsch”. It is, by far, the most famous German dialect in the United States. It is spoken by the Amish people. 

• Others: German is also spoken in lower in numbers in Australia (79,000), Belize (6,900), Chile (35,000), Mexico (40,000), Namibia (22,500), New Zealand (36,000), South Africa (12,000), and Uruguay (30,000).

People of German descent are the largest ethnic group in the US and for a long time German was a prominent second language in the US after English. Also, in Canada we used to have a city called Berlin where Germans predominated but they changed the name to Kitchener when WWI broke out. WWI and WWII ruined German in North America (though Kitchener still celebrates Oktoberfest). 

Dutch has a smaller presence worldwide than German despite the Dutch having a larger colonial empire. The Dutch didn’t push the Dutch language nearly as much as other colonizers; thus, in place like Indonesia very few people can speak Dutch (though fair number of Indonesian words are taken from Dutch). Outside Europe, there are 200,000 Dutch speakers in Suriname, 20,900 in the Caribbean Netherlands, 11,400 in Curacao, 5,290 in Aruba, and 2,000 in Sint Maarten. 

The biggest legacy of the Dutch language worldwide is undoubtedly the daughter language Afrikaans. It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers (~13.5%) of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites. In 1996, 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication. It is the lingua franca in Namibia, where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households. In total, Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide, compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively, for Dutch.

It's true that political parties rarely achieve what they promise. I don't have any articles, they haven't really had much time to do anything yet, we'll see what they get done. The second biggest party[1] is the one that supports a lot of the libertarian ideas. It's not exactly libertarian, but it's the closest thing to it and it's where the libertarians reside I think.

Well, they're not libertarian. They strongly believe in the EU and NATO. They love western democracy. They're conservative, while libertarians are generally at least implicitly socially liberal, in the sense that consistency demands that you don't legislate against things you might not like. 

That being said, the wikipedia article doesn't mention anything more specific than what they advocate in the abstract, which is often different from what politicians actually do. 

&gt;Well, I don't think it's because of taxes and regulations. ^ I guess it's mostly because of the financial crisis combined with the fall of Nokia, decline of the paper industry due to a falling demand for paper, and the sanctions against Russia. Those were a big part of our economy.

Why is you economy not diversified to the point where one company doesn't matter much? We have the same problem in Norway. We're already struggling with the state of the oil industry. The government has poured immense amounts of resources into it, so we're very dependent on it. Sanctions are another government problem though. 

&gt;I wouldn't say it's how they became prosperous. It's that and then using the money they got from the sweatshops to educate the masses. You don't really get prosperous without natural resources or an educated population. Or do you think they'd be as prosperous as they are now without education?

It is how they became prosperous. Look at the chain of events. They did not have natural resources. They did not have an education system. Yet they prospered. This reminds me of [this](http://i.imgur.com/mF6NAMw.png) political cartoon. It's pretty on point.

&gt;I do understand that without the policies of the US government, there probably wouldn't be so many helium balloons. But still I think it demonstrates how the free market can be manipulated by a large enough player.

Well, no one is saying that the market can't be manipulated. If you have political authority and a government with the ability to manipulate and warp the market, stuff like this will happen. 

&gt;I think what could to some degree help fix the problem is make the system more interesting, simple and rewarding. Make people feel a connection to the results of the system, that's something that doesn't happen very well in a representative democracy. How to make those things happen I don't know the answer to, yet. I guess things like introducing rewards for winning debates, refuting wrong arguments, etc could help. Also more local decision-making could make people feel their voice matters more. Obviously the big questions about resource allocation need to be debated by the whole population, but after that I think local decision-making could be emphasized.

How are you going to avoid making that system appear like the comment section on /r/politics though? You're kind of assuming that we have all of the right answers. I mean, even our discussion here in many ways mirrors the discussions Bastiat and Proudhon had two centuries ago. How do you win arguments we don't have clear answers to? Most of the shit we're talking about I don't have clear, concrete, sure answers to. I can make reasonable assumptions given economic theory, but that's about it. Plus, debates are rewarding in themselves for the people who engage in them. I think this is interesting. It's fun. It's a great way to keep myself engaged to the point where I don't notice that I'm procrastinating. 

I'm also not sure how a world government is going to foster more local agency, especially when you have this centralized resource allocation system. 

&gt;The scientific method could also be applied to democratic decision-making. People propose things (formulate a question/hypothesis) and then debate the validity and effects of that proposition (prediction). If the proposition makes sense to people, then it would be tested on a small scale and the results would be analyzed. If the results are good, scale it up. If not, not much harm done and we now know what doesn't work. People learn. That way it doesn't matter if people don't understand every little detail about something. In other words, make the democratic system minimize the effects of bad decisions and maximize the effects of good ones.

You can't test policy and economics in any scientific sense. We can't run controlled experiments. We can't repeat experiments to see if we can repeat the results, which is a very important part of the scientific method. There's too many factors to control for. That's why economists assume ceteris paribus when they're talking about the effect of this or that on the economy. 

&gt;That's the only way to make something new work. Make it, test it, fix it. I don't pretend to have all the answers for all the problems such a system might have, but I'm not ignoring the complexity of the problem. I've already said that I don't think my system is possible yet. It's not impossible, however. Here's[2] another view on the economic calculation problem.

You don't have to design anything. You could just let markets work.

What you provided isn't another view on the economic calculation debate. It's a response to the Cantor's Diagonal Argument as used by another economist to prove the infeasibility of the calculations. This leads his assumption to be that all we need is more computational power, which is not the case. 

 
&gt; The thing about that problem is that if it's possible for humans to allocate resources efficiently through the free market, it's also possible for a computer to allocate resources efficiently. Humans can be thought of as just a distributed network of little computers. If resources can be allocated efficiently by such a thing, they can be allocated efficiently by a data center of the future. In fact, as soon as the computational power of the data center becomes greater that the computational power of human beings, the data center will become more efficient at allocating resources than the free market.

At best you're conflating here, though it's more like a false equivalence. Humans are not just little computers. Why are you calling humans little computers? The fruit fly has a meager 100,000 neurons in its nervous system. A computer can trivially solve calculus problems, search 100 billion web-pages, and calculate pi to thousands of decimal places. A fly brain can't do this.

However a fly brain can fly around in unknown terrain, avoid bumping into things, and is miraculously able to find flies of the opposite sex ""out in the wild"", dock, and mate with them. Flies can adapt to changing conditions, find hidden food, walk around on uneven surfaces, and land upside down on ceilings. Computers can't do any of these things reliably. And the fly brain is the size of a grain of sand.

Humans and computers are not similar. Humans have wishes, preferences, dreams and so on. And you're still assuming that we can make interpersonal utility comparisons. And even if you managed to get a computer as smart as one human, which would be an amazing accomplishment, you're still far away from billions of humans. And even if you had a computer with the intelligence of billions of humans, it wouldn't have preferences like people have. It wouldn't value the thing it purchased more than the thing it had to give up for that thing. 


&gt;A central computer can keep track of information much more efficiently than human beings can. It can have reliable information about every resource mined and every product produced. In a free market an actor has to navigate a maze of other actors each doing things only for their own benefit, each having their own information that may or may not be accurate. There's information asymmetry in free markets, that's huge inefficiency. Many have incentives to either hide or distort information. A central computer keeping track of resources and working for the benefit of everyone has no such problems. And I already gave you one solution to how information about the values of different people could be given to the system.

We don't have access to the information of all of the resources in the world. The accumulated resource measurements would also be much slower than the market at responding to changes in supply, and a computer can't even know real demand. 

In the free market, people specialize. Again, look at I, Pencil. Incredibly complex, yet simple for the individual parts of the long chain of events that leads to a the pencil you or I purchase. Also, the solution you gave doesn't fix the problem you're outlining. The cost of the 5% giving inaccurate information would be socialized. The incentives would be similar to the voting incentives in democracy. They would have more incentives to overestimate demand, leading to more free shit, than they would have for self-imposed austerity.

Just because you can use it to describe the race of a person, doesn't mean it's inapplicable to their origin.

But German is a nationality and has no bearing on the race of a person. German American is analogous to Zimbabwean American in that regard--it specifically indicates a country that the person is/was a citizen of--but not to African American. 

African/Caucasian/Asian are used to designate the race of a person. You are technically right that someone could use these words to identify their place of habitation but that's rare. How many people in the US seriously identify themselves as North American? The exception I suppose would be Europe as I've seen lots of people on Reddit refer to the whole continent as their home, probably a function of how easy it is to travel amongst its different countries. But to say that African American is intended to designate someone's country of origin is just patently false. The only time you hear anyone doing that is specifically in discussions like the one we're having where pedants love to bring up white South Africans moving to America and calling themselves African American while conveniently ignoring that 99.99% of people identifying as African American are not in that circumstance.

Both he and the horse were injured at Waterloo, but survived. 

That's not the end of the story, though: after the battle, the horse stayed in what is now Belgium, and so it fell into the hands of revolutionaries when the Belgian revolt broke out in 1830. The new government went on to sell the horse along with the rest of the former royals' possessions. 

The revolutionaries planned to have the horse pull the garbage cart, but it was saved by Orangist Belgians who bought the horse and eventually returned it to the Netherlands, where it lived to the ripe old age of 38 years.

After Wexy's death, King William II had its body stuffed and preserved and displayed at various of his residences, including his beloved Gothic Hall in the Hague. 

This process of stuffing and mounting well-loved horses wasn't unknown among European aristocracy, though obviously it was too expensive for common people to practice. 

Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the relations between the average cavalryman and his horse, and I would be very interested to see someone offer a more general account, but I thought this anecdote would be interesting and entertaining anyway.

Once you take your citizenship oath you are Canadian, basically no one will question that.  I think that is partially due to the fact that Canada is a very young country without a lot of regional history as a unified group.  However, I think that is also part of the problem with groups not integrated. If you can stay exactly the way you were before except now you have a piece of paper that says you are Canadian, what is the point?  Are you really an integrated part of society?

Spain on the other hand has a very long history and a much deeper regional culture.  The idea of culture being tied to nationality is a much stronger concept in Europe.  If I were to come to Spain, never learn spanish, never participate in any spanish cultural events, only hang out with people from Canada, etc. would you really consider me to be Spanish even if I had citizenship?  I probably wouldn't.  That doesn't mean abandoning everything about me that is tied to Canada, but I would expect myself to learn Spanish, make Spanish friends, integrate and participate in my community, celebrate at least some Spanish traditions and learn Spanish history, integrate Spanish food into my diet, etc. - if this is not the case all you are doing is creating ethnic enclaves and ghettos with different cultures side by side.  That's not healthy for the long-term stability of a country.

Why is it when we find new groups of cultures in the Amazon rainforest or an isolated island, we say that we have to protect their culture, prevent outside influence, let them evolve on their own, but when it comes to Europe, and North America, multiculturalism is the way to go and we have to be tolerant of the immigrants and their different ways of doing things with no expectations for some level of assimilation to the local culture which has existed and evolved for hundreds of years?

If my family was Spanish, and had been Spanish for 20 generations, and my life and history is deeply embedded with the local culture, my family has fought in Spanish wars for hundreds of years, built up the community and culture around me etc... and then someone comes, gets citizenship, doesn't participate in the community, lives separately, has a completely different culture, and calls themselves Spanish?  That doesn't make sense to me.

To me there is a difference between being a citizen, which is a legal concept, and being an active and engaged, and integrated member of the local society and culture.  It has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with culture.",0,t5_2qh4j

The anti-semitism of later Europe (say, 19th and 20th century) reflects the role Jews played from that marginalized position. They often took on positions they could succeed in themselves, without need to ""fit in"" to the existing institutions from which they were excluded. For example, they were often merchants, and in the early 20th century, they perfected retail in the form of the department store, which people saw as a threat to mom-and-pop stores (sound familiar)?

Also, the Mongols sent envoys to the Pope seeking a more organised and larger alliance but the Pope distrusted the Mongols over the fact that too many innocent people were butchered by their forces.

While this is true, it is also true that the Christian residents residing in Muslim lands were usually spared in the Mongol onslaught, though this was not the case when they set their sights for Europe.

Since the Christians within the Mongol ranks were of the Eastern Nestorian branch of Christianity, they allied more with the Eastern Christians rather than the Western ones, though they were in favour of opening contact with the West as well.

Had the Pope and the Mongols agreed on a deal, their combined forces would have routed the Muslims at the Battle of Ain Jalut, which was the battle that turned the tide against the Mongols in their advancements into the lands of Islam.",0,t5_2qqjc

Technically the flood wouldn't even need to cover the entire Earth. It would just have to cover enough to seem like it did. The people in the old testement were from the middle east and those were the ones God wanted to punish, not neccessarily those in NA, Europe, or Africa, or Asia. Have Noah preserve the local fauna, flood the area, de-flood the area. Changing perspective to something like that makes a lot more sense because the entire world they know would have flooded. While there is plenty of water in the crust (possibly more than in the oceans if I recall) it still wouldn't be enough to cover mountains like Everest. 

The thing about ancestry is people generally share the ancestry of their ancestors. It's genetics. You have 2 parents, they have four parents which then have eight parents, then have 16 parents, so on and so forth. Then you get into recessive and dominant genes and stuff. It's possible for two white parents to have a black kid if one of them has relatively recent black ancestry or the opposite is true. Also, something something ancedotal evidence.

So it's a piece of shit reward system because it doesn't fly to one destination you want to go to?

I think Air Canada's reward system (it's called Aeroplan btw, altitude is a class you fly on their planes) is actually very good. I've taken many free flights as a result of their rewards system. I went to Vancouver round trip twice last year on my airline points. The total cost of each round trip was just the taxes $161.

As for flying cheaply to Scandanavia, if you can get yourself to England on a low fare carrier like Air Transat (I'd never but if you were on a budget) you can take one of those super cheap european airlines over to scandanavian destinations.

There are so many hidden fees on this WOW airline, if you want to book go ahead, it looks like a complete nightmare of an airline based on me going through their booking system.

Nevertheless, I still do them (because I'm like that). I'm a night person, for example, so I ride my bike at night (I figure men on the street can't get on me on my bike, and men in cars, short of actually hitting me on the road, can't either, not without stopping and getting out of their cars, at which point I could just ride away; that doesn't take into account guns, but I think that's kind of extreme, like running someone over in order to rape them; most men look for easy pickings, which I try not to be anymore). One thing I used to love which I have completely given up is going to bars and clubs, and *definitely* drinking around men (including ""friends""), because I'm bad at controlling my drinking and too many bad things have happened. Bad things have happened when I didn't drink much (twice I was drugged at a bar; once my friends saw and made me exchange the drink for another; the other time I left my one and only drink on the bar while I texted a friend--I'd gone to a concert not looking for male attention, no make-up, a hoodie and jeans, stupidly thinking that me not looking for male attention would mean they wouldn't be looking at or paying attention to me; I blacked out for 45 minutes after that and showed up absolutely insane out of my mind--clearly under the influence of a drug other than alcohol--and my best friend, who said I disappeared during those 45 minutes--I still don't know what happened--had to take care of me). 

So I don't go to bars or clubs anymore (certainly not ""dressed to kill"") even though if men were respectful it would be fun, because of that subset of men who just don't know how to control themselves or who deliberately set out to prey on women. Bars and parties are like an invitation to sexual assault (and indeed are seen that way by other people who blame women for their assaults, if they were drinking), even though they can be so much fun otherwise, so it sucks for all involved (do good men realize how much they suffer for other men's behavior? That women don't trust them, have trouble dating and emotional problems, that they are less likely to want to go to bars and parties, etc...) I still travel but am nervous as hell about going on a trip alone. I will still someday do a cross-country solo bike trip (that is my dream) but I will be super extra-careful the whole time, and nervous about it, and probably try to limit camping. Maybe it's the very fact I did all these things--went out, traveled alone (in the US, Europe, Asia, and now Mexico), went out after dark--that made me such a target, which is so sad that women have to curtail their lives out of fear...although shit happened plenty of times in broad daylight and with lots of other people around. I suppose all the gross forms of abuse and harassment I've suffered have made me feel like an object not worthy of respect but for the most part (with a few exceptions) they weren't violent, just violating. I am really scared of being violently attacked and that's why I limit my traveling alone and am super-extra careful when I do it...but I am tired of being used (or taken advantage of when drinking, even when I say no) so I don't go out anymore and that's sad too...it's awful we have to feel this way!",0,t5_2qh1i

The author's whole contention seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong?) that if the US went from number 1 economy in the world to number 2 then the US would have to go to war with whoever became number 1, in this case, China. That strikes me as insane, because it answers only one of the three questions that have to be answered in predicting whether or not there will be a war:

1. Is there something that means that both sides cannot get what they need to survive or thrive?

2. Is there any way that military force could be used to decide the question of who gets their way?

3. Two part question: do both sides think they can win? or if not, does the side that knows that they're going to lose have nothing to lose if they fight, do they have to fight anyway?

Sure there are ways in which an even stronger China could get its way over the US on things that the US wants. Global trade policy. Global communications rules. Law of the sea. Intellectual property law. Extradition rules. Support for anti-US parties to various conflicts around the world. Sure, lots of those things could make the US feel like it wanted to fight, and China feel like it wanted those things more than it wanted to avoid a fight.

So what? Is there any way the US could get its way on those things by directly attacking China? Any *imaginable* way? Many governments have tried sending soldiers to China to change the government there; nobody has managed it in centuries, not for very long. And that was when China was a lot farther behind, technologically, than they are.

A longish while ago I repeated the old Neil Gaiman line about how Europe has history, but America has geography. Somebody piped up with, ""And China has math.""

So we're left trying to imagine a US so diplomatically isolated and so economically choked off that we would ... do what exactly? Try to land ten million troops on the Chinese mainland, only to get swallowed up by China's even more millions of troops plus home field advantage? Or worse, trigger a nuclear exchange with China? I can imagine a hypothetical future American president being desperate enough to threaten that, the way that Reagan used to joke about nuking Russia, but my imagination doesn't stretch far enough to imagine it actually happening.

There's a great old art film out there called *Insignificance* and in the last line, the female lead explains why there's never going to be a nuclear war: ""Don't you see?

Es scheint zumindest so, als würde DuckyLuck (Glücksspiel, ohne staatliche Lizenz) ganz klar mit eurer Aktion in Verbindung stehen. Denn es ist ihr Slogan ... und sie sind direkt nebenan die einzigen mit einer Aktion auf der Seite.

Das Projekt itsallabouthappiness.com sitzt auch auf Malta, betrieben von der Briefkastenfirma ""BWM Gruppe"". **AUCH AUF MALTA!** /u/DerHauge stellt es so dar, als wären die Jungs nicht auf Malta. Ich hoffe übrigens nicht, dass du denkst dass BMW dort mit am Start wäre, weil die Briefkastenfirma BWM Gruppe heißt? Ansonsten kann man ja mal schnell bei Interone nachfragen, ob die bei dieser Kampagne mit am Start sind. Haben aber die Tage erst was eigenes großes neues gestartet.

Da ihr wahrsch. mit deutschem Datenschutzrecht schon Probleme habt, bin ich mir sicher, dass ihr Maltas Recht nicht kennt. **Aber eigentlich auch egal, denn nach wie vor nimmt sich der Anbieter von Itsallabouthappiness das Recht raus, euch mit Werbung zu bombadieren als auch die Teilnahmebedingungen jederzeit anzupassen.**

Und... mal im übrigen... auch wenn das Projekt an eine Agentur geoutsourced ist... (wieso auch immer die das aus Malta betreibt - wieso eigentlich /u/derhauge ?) ist das ja noch viel schlimmer, denn selbst wenn die Daten nicht an Dritte weitergegeben werden, eine Agentur hat halt eine Menge Kunden für die SIE Werbung machen können - sogar nach deutschem Recht. Aber achso... sitzt ja in Malta. Und ich wette... dass die BMW dort keine autorisierte Aktion auf einer Landingpage mit einer Briefkastenfirma im Impressum und dem Slogan eines (illegalen?)

Are you absolutely certain you want to bring Godwin in this, because if you do, you might not like where this conversation moves next. Actually this conversation will end, since after that there is no civil way to continue this conversation.

&gt; no need for crystal balls; all you need is ears. the syrians think the whole area belongs to them, so do egypt, jordan &amp; saudi arabia.

And this was the mess of an area Jews just had to, absolutely had to start a country in. not much foresight used was there. WW2 gives them the sympathy to start a country anywhere they want and they pick the worst, most hostile area for them on the whole earth. Not exactly geniuses were they. They could have gotten the island paradise of Madagascar from the French and instead chose the desert in the middle of ancient enemies. 

I personally in that situation would have hopped on the first plane to Madagascar. Nice sized tropical island, no border problems with nasty Muslims, actually no trouble some land borders with anyone, plentiful food supply. Kick back and relax. But no instead they just have to go and try to settle a desert in the powder keg of Middle East.

&gt; sure, offer them a marshall-plan style incentive package, build them some infrastructure etc - i doubt it'll achieve much.

While you are supporting a country getting yearly support of 3 billion dollars from USA. So clearly even Israel can't make it on the area on their own either. 

&gt; israel 'wins' simply means israel gets peace and remains a jewish state. what is a jewish state? instead of sunday/friday as day off, they get Saturday; instead of Christmas or Eid-el-Fiter, they get Passover as public holiday; instead of English or Arabic, official language is hebrew.
&gt; this is self determination, israelis are not going to give that up.. and they have a lot of firepower to backup their stance.

All right and good, don't just go around claiming that Muslims would get equal opportunity and treatment in Israel, because clearly it is not an equal democracy even by your own admission. Some of it's members are more equal than others. Which leads to the fact that Palestinians have a valid gripe about being displaced and discriminated against in the area where they have lived for centuries. Again sounds like a real familiar gripe....

&gt; if you consider a 50 year old nation which was never sovereign over any territory and which never had any independence gaining both sovereignty and independence as 'giving up'.. then yes.

This applies just as well to Israel, which is not significantly older. Unless you call in the, but our ancient Judea card, at which point this conversation is over since that justification is so pointless. That claim expired as valid about 1000 years ago due to no maintenance fees being paid to the Global National Land Claim Registry, located in the moon Europa by little green men.

The rates of homosexuality is pretty stable across the decades its about 2% in men and hasn't gone up. If anything the estimate of the frequency has gone down with time.

I'd say it's a bit more nuanced than that because human sexuality fickle and does indeed vary from person to person. There is very much a 'plasticity' to human sexuality. Some sexual cues are innate (nature) and some are learned or augmented (nurture). Societal norms significantly shapes sexual tastes. People will always have feelings and urges, but the way they are expressed varies from culture to culture. Cultures that are permissive of all kinds of sexual expression can enable a person to experiment and try things that he/she would not have considered in a society that is sexually conservative. This is where people come along and say ""what's the big with being permissive, it's just sex"". This statement would have validity if there were no negative consequences associated with promiscuity. But there are. Permissive views on sexual promiscuity results in increased STD infection rates, lower birth rate (aka fertility negative outcome), and reduced respect for the institution of marriage.

This isn't ideal in my eyes because children should be raised by their biological mother and father, and not by strangers at a day care.

First of all, I was thinking primarily about homework. Homework isn't part of your grade here in Germany because it's cheaper: students are encouraged to work in groups, which means less work for TAs (and you don't have to be police academic misconduct), but also means that you can't really use it for individual assessment. When you grade homework, it's really more of an assessment of a student's ability to put in the effort, since you don't have hard time constraints.

Second, we do a midterm in some of the more critical courses here. The experience is that having two exams instead of one reduces failure rates. Again, it's more expensive (additional TA hours) and additional work for the professor, but it generally means that fewer students fail.

&gt; I did actually, and here's an example. That test is for getting your degree in engineering, and it's no harder than any test I ever took in a fluid dynamics/thermodynamics class.

I was specifically talking about introductory math courses, not college-exclusive material. Here's the issue I am trying to describe: an undergraduate degree in continental Europe typically takes three years as opposed to four years in America. A major reason is that in the typical European educational system, calculus is something that every student does in 11th grade, while in America it's an AP course. This means that if you graduated from the German and French school system and then went to the US to do a degree there, you would have an additional year to essentially learn the same things and the first 1-2 years would have more transitional classes than at home. You could also generally get college credit for classes you took in the *lycée* or *gymnasiale oberstufe*.

But that's why I was talking specifically about calculus, which is part of this transitional period where American students are still being eased into college (relatively speaking). Obviously, once you graduate, things start to be better aligned (modulo the quality of your university). For example, there's precious little difference between the abstract algebra classes that I took as part of my Ph.D. and the ones they offer here.

&gt; I agree that high school education here has to be reformed. But higher education is something different altogether, and I don't see evidence that higher education in Europe is vastly superior to that in the U.S.

First, to repeat myself, I am not talking about higher education in Europe being superior; if I had the choice between a free ride at MIT and pretty much any German university, I'd almost certainly pick MIT (if I had to pay for it, maybe not, but that's more a question of whether the additional value is worth the price, not whether there is additional value). The German experience is much more of a no frills thing, and while that creates additional challenges for students, that is *not* a positive thing. Simply put: Student numbers in Germany have risen by more than 30% over the past 7-8 years, but funding hasn't increased to match that. This funding shortage means worse faculty/student and TA/student ratios, no money for that middle tier of bureaucracy that exists to make an American university run smoothly (which makes even simple things such as signing up for courses more of a challenge), or shorter library hours.

Second, my reason for harping about high school education is that it affects college education. When a good chunk of early American college education involves doing stuff that French and German students do in high school, that affects college, too.

&gt; I don't see how having an office hour once a week (which is usually the case) means they're ""holding our hands"".

I think you're getting too hung up on a word here. Look, as an American faculty member at a German university, I have to deal with a fair amount of inquiries by potential American students about whether tuition-free education in Germany is an option for them. And I've learned to be honest and a bit blunt here (because they tend to be overly optimistic), so this is how I generally phrase that they have to do more things themselves (because of a worse staff/student ratio and fewer university resources). But realistically, that's how it is. If you don't believe me, you can find plenty of experience reports by American students in Germany to confirm my assessment.",0,t5_2qh4j

* England have Liverpool (CL), Man Utd (CL), Chelsea (CL and EL), Arsenal (CL), Middlesbrough (EL) and Fulham (EL) (6)


* Spain have Barca (CL), Real Madrid (CL), Atletico Madrid (CL and EL) , Sevilla (EL), Athletico Bilbao (EL) and Espanyol (EL) (6)


Where's the seventh Spanish team to have made it to a European final in the last 10 years?


There's no arguing the volume of wins (Spain trounces England) but I think the numbers overstate things slightly. The likes of Liverpool/Spurs and Everton have not really taken the Europa league seriously when they've qualified, fielding largely second-string teams and prioritising the pursuit of the top 4 above second tier European glory (rightly or wrongly).

But now I've had a look into it, I would say that the Russians were certainly aware of that. I was aware that the Americans and the UK were arguing over the course of action, with the UK favouring supporting the current Syrian government but under a different regime (so we get rid of al-Assad, who David Cameron - our Prime Minister - wants tried for War Crimes, and we support and use the Syrian resources), whereas the US wants to arm and support smaller military factions with the intent of creating a better Syria. The reason the UK and the EU was against that was because it is almost exactly the same situation as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, just substitute the groups the US wants to arm and train with the Taliban, and we all know how that ended. 

Russia are pro al-Assad, but like many things with the Russians, they aren't too open with their intentions. They might sort everything out for al-Assad, who then finds out that being in debt to the Russians is a very bad thing, or he could outlive his usefulness. It's a tough life being an RF puppet.

It might seem coincidental, but the Syria situation is advancing at an alarming rate. IS aren't the Taliban - they aren't goatherds with AKs who bury petrol cans and fertiliser bombs by roads. Islamic State are very highly equipped and trained soldiers. They have uniforms, they are fully armed, they have tanks, they have helicopters, and its only a matter of time before they have jets. They are capable of so much more than the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. 

If they conquer Syria, they could strike Israel, Turkey, Cypress, Greece, Egypt... I don't know about America, but practically all goods from China, India, Japan, and Australia come to Europe through the Suez Canal. More crude oil goes through that canal in a day than I will ever use in my life. Imagine if IS controlled it; all goods would have to go all the way around Africa. Prices would jump, the value of money would plummet: it would be an unparalleled economic recession.

This is Islamic States goal: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/30/article-2674736-1F46221200000578-100_634x381.jpg Now the map is quite different from the one in my lecture hall; that one goes a bit farther North and a tad more to the East, and not so much of West Africa, but that is the Old Caliphate. After Rome and before the Renaissance, this was what the world looked like. When Europe launched its later Crusades, this was what we were fighting. This is what Islamic State wants back.

Are you still continuing in this fruitless vein? More than half the German population opposed Hitler for as long as they could. Your statement was that most Germans supported Hitler, and that this somehow has something to do with you thinking that Pegida is right and everybody else is wrong.

&gt; My God, you really know your German history!

Better than you do, that's for sure.

&gt; Many Syrian Sunnis are escaping their Alawite oppressor (Assad) precisely because he is OPPOSED to Sharia-law and a strict Islamic state.

Also, your grasp of contemporary history is shaky. Assad is a corrupt dictator who runs a de facto one-party state, did nothing to help millions of people suffering from years of drought, and then, when they protested, wheeled out the army to deal with them. Those Syrians who want to see a strict Islamic state and the imposition of Sharia are not running away, they are staying to fight with ISIS.

You *have* heard of ISIS, haven't you?

&gt; Many more from around the Middle East/North Africa come to Europe NOT for the permissive cultural atmosphere (how naive can you possibly be???) but for the economic opportunity.

Economic migrants are sent back home. ISIS is a real threat in North Africa, and, for example, controls some territory in Libya.

Besides, the numbers of refugees from North Africa are tiny. In the first 6th months of this year, the top ten countries of origin for asylum seekers in Germany were, in order: Syria, Kosovo, Albania, Serbia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Macedonia, Eritrea, Nigeria and Pakistan. Those from Kosovo, Albania, Serbia and Macedonia have very nearly zero chance of their applications being successful and there is now a fast-track system for them so that they can be sent home within days. The number of applicants from Pakistan was a little over 2,800; that's less than one tenth of the number of applications from Syria (about 35,000). I don't know how many applications there were from, say, Libya, but it's much less than Pakistan's rate.

&gt; first, you acknowledge the problematic implications of an aging populace and the necessity for new blood, and in the next breath, you insist that the demographic projections are all ""hogwash"".

I don't quite know how to respond to this. What's hogwash is the idea that soon immigrants will outnumber natives within a few years. They won't, because those predictions are based on false assumptions, such as that immigrants' birth rates remain stubbornly high -- they don't, they quickly come into line with local birth rates -- and the time when, theoretically, this will happen (if ever) is so far in the future that they'll be as indistinguishable from ""us"" as Anglo-Saxons are from the Norman French are in England. But as a medium-term shot in the arm for the German economy they may be exactly what we need. Already the numbers of refugee children in my area have saved at least some schools from certain closure in the near future, but they're still a *tiny* minority.

&gt; with the arrival of millions of new Muslim refugees in Europe

The numbers of refugees in Europe is measured in hundreds of thousands, not ""millions"". Germany reckons it can absorb half a million per year for the next few years. It's true that in recent weeks they've been arriving somewhat faster than that, but there's no evidence that it's going to keep going indefinitely.

&gt; We can either watch every city in Western Europe slowly become another Malmo, with its growing lawlessness and disaffection, or we can bring in East Asians, Latin Americans, and sub-Saharan Africans, those who are not likely to transform our societies into something unrecognizable.

This is a false dichotomy: it assumes that the problems in places like Malmö are entirely the fault of the immigrant populations and not, for example, mismanaged immigration. Specifically in the case of Malmö, the problem is the decline in its industry over many decades, most dramatically in the early 1990s, resulting in massive job losses and high unemployment. Recent redevelopment has benefitted the middle and upper classes but done nothing for the working classes, making it a city of big social divisions and a huge wealth gap. That will always lead to conflict, civil disobedience and the like, with or without immigration. Malmö is basically Sweden's Detroit.

Also, having earlier claimed that race is not an issue for you, you're now arguing that only certain ethnic groups should be allowed to immigrate on the grounds that somehow, they're less likely to ""transform"" society.

Gas tax is the equivalent of about $3.75/gallon, the roads get repaved regularly, and IStanbul, a city of 15 million, has about as many highway miles as Seattle, with a lot fewer miles of city streets. The country has a decent network of primary highways linking cities, and interstate quality roads only exist between Ankara and Istanbul, Near Bursa, Between Izmir and Aydin, and some around Adana. 

But roads here aren't crumbling like they are in the U.S. Also, at least in Istanbul, only 20% of people drive (which is still, about as many people as drive in Seattle area). 

So, what I'm seeing based on this experience is that if the Seattle area wanted nice roads, that are well maintained the gas tax should be somewhere around 3.75/gallon. 
Though to be fair, I can't find what Turkey spends all of that money on, so its possible they don't spend all of it on roads. The lowest gas tax in Europe is half of that (which is still like 4 or 5 times higher than the U.S.) ",0,t5_2qhad

1.  Client is outside his hotel with his Ferrari waiting for our rep to come pick up the car.  Random guy walks past and says ""Nice car.""  Our client says ""Are you here to pick up the car?""  Random guy says ""Uh...Why, yes.  Yes, I am."" and drives off with our Ferrari.

2.  We require special insurance and paperwork before we let you take our expensive cars into Eastern Europe (because they tend to vanish over there)  Guy renting an S-class Benz never tells anybody he is going to Eastern Europe and at the border gets turned around because the paperwork he has doesn't allow the car in there.  He totally losses his shit and proceeds to ram through the border crossing and lead the cops on a car chase until he gets arrested.  Then he called our 1-800 number to blame us for his incarceration.

Why? His proposed programs fulfills the proposed rules for cultural genocide from the UN draft (google it if you don't believe me.)

&gt; And in the end how was culture developed? By people starting doing things together. And the easier the transport, the larger the area of cultural heritage. Greece in 3000BC had different tribes that occupied cities and each had different culture.. Then as time passed and Roman Empire grew, Southern Greece shared the same culture.. And as time evolved, the whole Greece shared same cultural values..

I don't care what people choose to do. I'm opposed to **forced** cultural exchange.

Your example of assimilation can be countered by 196 examples of isolation.

I should have been more precise there. My point is that they won't be very succesful unless they can prove that one of their rights has been violated.  
&gt; Since big companies typically have better lawyers and more money, the thread of suing alone can influence politics.  

You are talking about ""regulatory chill"", the idea that lawmakers won't pass certain laws because they fear the country being sued. There are several things you should consider:  

* That is not necessarily a bad thing. It is in the nature of international law to curtail the sovereignty of individual states. If you grant that the threat of being sued prevents lawmakers from passing bona fide laws, that would also mean that they are prevented from passing discriminatory and protectionist laws.  

* Most ISDS cases are not about specific laws but about administrative acts like contracts, permits and certain guarantees. Only [9%\(14 cases\)](http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:173530/CONTENT/No_120_-_Caddel_and_Jensen_-_FINAL_-_WEBSITE_version.pdf) of disputes before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) are about acts of the legislature.  

* Regulatory chill isn't a problem inherent in the ISDS system. Companies can also threaten to sue using regular courts.  

* Most, if not all, European countries are able to bear the costs of legal proceedings without any problems. So while regualtory chill might be problem in dealings with poorer countries, it is less so in the case of TTIP.  

A lot of the common concerns about ISDS are also addressed in [this](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAAahUKEwjtsMaqmaLIAhXHaxQKHeTkCqE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksoverheid.nl%2Fbinaries%2Frijksoverheid%2Fdocumenten%2Frapporten%2F2014%2F06%2F24%2Fthe-impact-of-investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-in-the-ttip%2Fthe-impact-of-investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-in-the-ttip.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0jYzxDIJLKPdNUDfBk46YDdFZWw) extensive report for the dutch government.  

&gt; Furthermore, I feel extremely uneasy if a private justice system is erected.  

I don't think you can call ISDS tribunals a ""private justice system"". They are part of a legal system designed with the intention of dealing with very specific legal issues that aren't really of use for the ordinary citizen: enforcing and protecting international treaties and the rights of foreign investors. Just because it's simply not relevant to a large group of people, doesn't mean it's private.  
These tribunals are also not some big business kangaroo-court. They usually consist of three judges: one appointed by each party, and a third agreed upon by both parties. Most of them are respected legal experts in the field of international law. So a certain impartiality is guaranteed.  
&gt; One of the major achievements of democracies was having a (more or less) impartial justice system that is open to everyone on the same footing. I am not completely against TTIP or CETA, but ISDS stinks and needs to go.

The point of ISDS is to provide an institution that is free from the biases of national court systems, that might be biased in favour of their own country.  

I am certainly not saying ISDS is a perfect system. There are many legitimete criticisms, like the inability to appeal a decision. But they are not good arguments against the system as such but rather arguments in favour of reforming the system.  
A lot of these criticsm are also addressed by the [reform proposal](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5651_en.htm) from the European commission.",0,t5_39twl

Well, here goes again. 


I do indeed agree that there is a positive correlation between immigration and crime. That is pretty much indisputable. However, I would have like to have seen Belgium-specific data on that, but I understand it can be hard to find. Also, according to your data the majority of refugees are not criminals. I repeat. The majority are not criminals.

On the other hand, migrants and refugees can actually help the economy. 

https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730383-800-why-welcoming-more-refugees-makes-economic-sense-for-europe/

But of course that one source isn't going to be convincing enough for you, so here's another few, about the situation in Jordan an Turkey 

http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/08/24/090224b083091fbc/1_0/Rendered/PDF/The0impact0of00Turkish0labor0market.pdf

http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/future-development/posts/2015/02/25-syrian-refugees-jordan-karasapan

Here we see cases of much larger per capita numbers having a net positive effect on the economy in certain cases. 

However, there are indeed limits, and taking in too much is bad http://www.nber.org/papers/w9755

It's all interesting and I don't think there's a clear cut answer to all this. It seems to me like Belgium needs to do the following: 

-Speed up the processing of asylum applications


-seperate the refugees from the economic migrants


-grant actual refugees (temporary) asylum in Belgium, make it permanent for people who are highly skilled/ have managed to hold on to a job


-give economic support to UN camps in Jordan and Turkey

-Put more emphasis on tackling human traffickers.

&gt;In addition to providing a window into the past, the authors hope that these analyses will contribute to the design of studies aimed at identifying genes for diseases with different frequency in Native Americans and Europeans. Researchers have so far focused on populations from areas settled mainly by Native Americans and Europeans. The genomic diversity of populations across regions in the Americas with large African immigration is still mostly unexplored.

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU CONCLUDE THIS IF THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE GENES AND ARE LOOKING FOR THEM. 

You just assume it was diseases, and indeed they played a big role. But only in support of the Genocide. Unless you are going to claim the the Nazi also did not commit a genocide, since most Jews died of starvation and disease in the concentration camps. How could this germans have done anything about this ?

Please explain, what is wrong with any of the primary sources I gave you ? Please point me to any of the settlers, conquistadores, governors etc. That suggest all these indians were dying of disease. You can recognize the small pox, and they saw them. Please explain how it was possible that Cortes's allies (and there were thousands, perhaps a 100.000 of them) did not start dying of these ""diseases"", while his enemies were. And when he betrayed them, they started dying of ""diseases"" too. Point me to a pathogen that exhibits this behavior.

I don't know wether to laugh or lecture you for comparing the Nazi-Soviet pact to the close economic co-operation Russia and China are actually running...

&gt;&gt;China is its own player and they are just using each other as it is convenient. And Russia is paying a higher and higher price each time to attract China's attention.The recent big touted gas-deal was basically China ripping off Russia, though now it has been temporarily put on ice.

Yeah, cause oil prices, construction of pipelines and new wells has been slowed all over the world. This is not a symptom of distrust or failing co-operation.

&gt;&gt;The country with an economy on the size of an average major European economy is a factor here? Let's not kid ourselves. Until just recently, Russia could barely keep their nuclear forces modern. And their modernization effort is ongoing and won't be realized this decade.

By ""modern"" you mean precision battlefield deployment of nuclear weapons? This is another non-argument. When you're talking about nuclear war it doesn't matter, dude, a 40-year old Typhoon class could by itself wipe out any country of its choosing, Russia has dozens of these.

&gt;&gt;Do you know the 3 countries who can actually project their power anywhere in the world? The US, France, and the United Kingdom. China will not be able to fight an effective offensive war something something china sucks

Huh. They're able to [sneak their subs into position where they can land torpedoes in the Chernobylian heart of a U.S. carrier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-492804/The-uninvited-guest-Chinese-sub-pops-middle-U-S-Navy-exercise-leaving-military-chiefs-red-faced.html) during exercises... They also have a growing surface fleet, including aircraft carriers. And stealth jets. It's also the fastest growing economy in the world, in addition to being a leading creditor nation. If that's not ""power projection"" I don't know what is. As for nuclear warheads... With ICBMs with MIRVs, that is an irrelevant point. Fuck with China, and every city with more than a million inhabitants becomes a nuclear crater regardless.

&gt;&gt;Wishful thinking. China desires stability to fully establish their Middle Kingdom through trade. Russia seeks military adventures and confrontations with the west to maintain his influence and curtail any Nato activity. China benefits from the Pax Americana.

uhh... Since when does Russia ""seek"" risky military adventures...? It sounds like you're just in cognitive dissonance over their supposed inability to project power, so when they *actually project power* (Georgia, Ukraine, Syria, Iran) you are in such disbelief you have to ascribe them motives. The truth is that Russia has long-term goals, just as china - Establish their own economic bloc, maintain economc growth, and become a net exporter of raw materials.

&gt;&gt;There's not gonna be a nuclear exchange.

You did say something about me having wishful thinking earlier... but since you linked to a YouTube video I am going to assume you are joking... Just read into how many near-misses there have been throughout history that we *know of*. Little bugs or accidents can set off the doomsday machine known as MAD. As well as dumb political decisions, as has happened before. Misunderstandings, such as in 1983 and 1995 were a hair's edge away.

They told me that they thought I should try an anti-depressant!

I guess it's one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't type of situations.  If you stand up for yourself to prove that ADHD is real by being proactive, it demonstrates to them that you must not have ADHD since clearly an ADHD person is completely helpless according to them.  And, if you don't stand up for yourself, then they will go on continuing to believe that ADHD is a fake disorder.

I'm sorry that Australians and basically the rest of the world outside of the U.S. is so backwards when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.  The U.S. has the widest range of drug options and the easiest path to diagnosis and treatment.  

Europeans and other developed nations like to look down on America as backwards rednecks who love their religion and guns but when it comes to the range of medical treatment options, I think we are clearly the best country in the world.  Our healthcare system is expensive, which is the downside, but at least we can get treated here.  

Some countries, like Japan for instance, ban all forms of ADHD medications, so even someone with a legitimate prescription from the United States can't bring their medications into Japan or they face getting arrested.  But, at the same time Japan is building playstations, robots and intelligent toilets.  Weird contradiction, but I guess it just comes down to the stigma attached around ADHD.  

People just assume that you're either mentally retarded or you're just fine; there's no inbetween when it comes to mental health.  Many people even doubt that depression is a legitimate medical condition.  They just tell those people to cheer up and stop being so gloomy, even though the reason they're depressed is biological in nature, such as in the case of postpartum depression.",0,t5_2qnwb

There are a lot of terms in this resolution that seem just a half-step out of place. But I think the actual meaning of the resolution is easy to understand and debate if you parse it out from the weird verbiage. So to that end, here is my interpretation of what the resolution means. 
***
***Resolved: In response to the current crisis, a government should prioritize the humanitarian needs of refugees over its national interests.***

The Vague Terms:

- *The current crisis*: 

I think everyone knows that this term refers to the ongoing refugee crisis, as opposed to any other distinct crisis (the Euro crisis, China's stock bubble, climate change, etc.). This can be proven by appealing to the reference to refugees in the second half of the resolution, and the fact the the NSDA topic area for this month is ""Refugee and Migrant Crises.""

The trouble comes when trying to pinpoint exactly what the current refugee crisis is. It is not only events that happened since that Syrian boy was photographed dead on a Turkish beach. Not all the refugees are from Syria, they are not all (or even mostly) going to Europe.

But with all that said, there are some aspects that unify an idea of the ""current crisis."" Events like the ones happening now have been documented heavily since the very beginning of the Arab Spring. (See: Branko Milanovic: ""Who are the Harrage?"" 
(2010); stories like [this one](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/571455/700-feared-dead-as-boat-carrying-refugees-from-Libya-to-Italy-capsizes) in 2014; etc.) And they generally share the following attributes:

(1) The refugees come from the Middle East and North Africa (mainly Syria, Iraq, and Libya). While the Syrians and Iraqis have gone mainly to neighboring countries, the Libyans and others have gone mainly to Southern Europe. (3) The influx has been outside of the normal purview of the host counties' refugee structure (exorbitant waits, illegal entry, massive camps, etc.)

So the term ""current crisis"" can be understood to be **""the post-Arab-Spring refugee crisis""**&gt;

- *A government*

It has been suggested that the resolution allows people to pick ""a country"" to focus arguments on. (e.g. ""Brazil should...). I believe that this is a misunderstanding of the resolution.

If you were to debate what ""a person"" should do, you would not focus all of your arguments on the actions' of Michael Phelps, Liz down the street, or any other solitary human. You would debate what people in general should do. 

Just like when we say ""One should not do this..."" we do not literally mean that ""one"" specific example person; we mean people generally.

So the term ""a government"" can be understood as **""governments""** in general.

- *humanitarian needs*

It can be easily established through international refugee law that the ""humanitarian needs"" of refugees necessarily entail full asylum. For instance, the [UN UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) states that:

&gt; Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

So for the purposes of this debate, ""humanitarian needs"" can be understood as *""asylum""*.

- *prioritize...over national interests*

A confusion that arises from this point is what should happen if national interests and humanitarian needs overlap. To me, it seems obvious that such situations are irrelevant to the debate. If national interests *include* humanitarian needs, then governments do not need to do any prioritizing.

Logically, there are two possible relationships between national interests and humanitarian needs. Either the humanitarian needs further national interests, or they do not. 

If the former is true, there is no debate to be had; the government has no priorities to decide. If the latter, the question becomes ""Should the government still grant asylum?"" (*Remember: humanitarian needs entail asylum.*)

So, the position of pro in this debate is that Governments should grant asylum even if if it contradicts their national interests. Con would say that they should not grant asylum under such circumstances.

***

Thus, the resolution can be properly understood to mean:

# Resolved: In response to the post-Arab-Spring refugee crisis, governments should grant asylum to refugees, even if doing so contradicts their national interests.

I believe that resolution to be more easily understood and debated.",0,t5_2qja8

It will be less stressful for you, and also gives your team advance notice. (Find a steam group that caters to finding scrims in your div, and make posts in the LFS topic on the UGC forums.) Try to have scrims at the same times each week so that your team knows when they need to be around. Also have a discussion topic in your team's Steam Group where people can post their upcoming ""absences"". It will help you find subs/ringers early and keep track of where your people are.

That is how it is traditionally thought of from the time of Enlightenment when these ideas were forming. It is right in the most famous line from the Declaration of Independence:

""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their *Creator* with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""

Now were both arriving at the same point that these inalienable rights cannot be taken away and are always apart of us, but were getting there differently. While I say its from God, you say it just is. Now this difference can be attributed to ones faith in the Divine or lack there of and the adherence to Western thought. And this Western thought came out of Europe during the Enlightenment and is a mix of Classical Greek logic and reason, and Christian Theology/morals. Now today we accept them as just the way it is, but that is because we were born and raised in Western culture. If we were born and raised in some society that is not Western and does not hold these ideas grounded in reason, logic, and Christian morality, we would have a completely different outlook. So even though you might discount the Divine reasoning behind our rights, its how this whole thing started and without it our form of government, Western thought, and just about everything else about our lives would be different because our whole culture would be completely different. And this is why our Constitution and form of government needs to have a divine being, or for us Christians God. Without it the reasoning behind the Constitution and our form of government wouldn't stand up. I think John Adams said it a lot more eloquently then I have: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people”. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

Thank you for the amazing revelation, Sherlock.

&gt; We're in debt primarily because we refused to pay for the wars we started.

Wrong. We're in debt because the government cannot balance the checkbooks, we do not produce things anymore (China does now) and the US prints money out of thin air from the Federal Reserve, a quasi-private central bank that lends money to the US government at interest (a massive fraud, BTW). This money has no backing whatsoever. 

This is called a fiat currency and weakens the entire economies of nations, which in turns weakens the national treasuries. This, combined with incompetent politicians, contributes to their demise.  [Every fiat currency in history has failed, and the nations along with it.](http://dailyreckoning.com/fiat-currency/). 

&gt;We're not even close to a banana republic, if you want to get technical we're also not even close.

We are absolutely a Banana Republic. A Banana Republic means a country run by a central power, or a dictator. We are run by a dictator - or to be more accurate, an Oligarchy/Plutocracy - a small group of very powerful people. This is not even a debate, [Princeton did a study and even admitted that the US is no longer a Democracy](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/princeton-experts-say-us-no-longer-democracy).

&gt;25% of the population is not unemployed, maybe underemployed but what you said isn't even close to true. 

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' numbers only take into account peoples who have dropped out of the labor force within a certain time period. Therefore, we have to go to another reliable source - Shadowstats. 

[22% of the population is unemployed. I mentally rounded it out to 25...22, close enough.](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts). 

However, technically the number is much higher because we've lost so many full time jobs to part time. Part time work has hit an [all time record high](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LNS12600000), while the full time numbers are still below [2007 numbers](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/LNS12500000.txt)

&gt;The economy on wall street is clearly getting better, someone is enjoying the shit out of this economy. 

Wall Street is in no way an indicator of the economic health of the nation. None. Zero. Zilch. I suggest you learn about economics and the stock market - and how it is easily manipulated.

Also, I can provide you with more evidence that shows how poorly the American economy is doing under Obama. **Much more**.

&gt; More people are not on welfare and food stamps than ever, that's propaganda.

No, [that is a fact.](http://www.foodworldnews.com/articles/8002/20141103/food-stamps-in-america.htm)

&gt;Our boarders aren't even close to being wide open, illegal immigrants are hardly ""rampant"" they're vital and necessary to industries like farming which Americans refuse to participate in, on average. 

First of all, its ""borders"" not ""boarders"".

So many factual inaccuracies here. 

Yes, they are wide open. In fact, we have [video evidence](http://www.infowars.com/stand-down-u-s-border-gate-left-wide-open-unguarded/) of illegals coming in, with wide swaths of the border unguarded. Hell, the DHS is even paying for these illegals to be escorted in here. Obama sent out flyers that told immigrants they wont check for food stamps. The Obama Administration has [sued Arizona](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/07/us-obama-immigration-lawsuit-idUSTRE6653Q320100707) for trying to enforce border law. This is similar to how the governments have gone absolutely insane in Europe letting an untold number of ""refugees"" come in, if you've been living under a rock.

The ""industries that Americans refuse to participate in"" is some of the most pompous, arrogant bullshit I've ever heard in my entire life (and I've heard quite a bit of nonsense). We have people out of work that would take those jobs. Period. End of story. There is no fundamental difference from the illegal immigrant workers than Americans. The only difference is that the companies that hire them get an advantage by paying them under the table. And the government looks the other way.

&gt;How the hell is the president a fraud that should be in jail? First time I've ever heard someone say that in any serious context.

That's the first time you've heard someone say that? Then you should get out more. I'm surprised you're on here. The fact that you even question this really makes me question any credibility you have and any response you will give to my post.

Obama has done many things - again, you should probably do your research. But, since you're even asking that question, I will go over 2 reasons why. 

1) Obama signed the NDAA, which allows the indefinite detention, imprisonment and arrest of Americans without trial. This alone is a treasonous act against the American People. If you are ""excited"" about politics, you should already know this. In fact, the NDAA has been enhanced in 2014. Not only does it have the previous powers, but it also now grants the Federal Government authority to [further gather and analyze records and data captured during any national security or ""terrorist"" related investigation, not just combat operations.](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/17070-indefinite-surveillance-say-hello-to-the-national-defense-authorization-act-of-2014). 

By the way, the usual counter-argument I have been given is - Feinstein's amendment. However, Feinstein's Amendment has been removed. Obama signed after its removal. 

This is a totally treasonous act and should land Obama in Jail.

2) Obama's birth certificate has been proven, with modern forensic analysis, to be fraudulent. In other words, it's a forgery. 

Sources: 

[Complete Forensic Analysis](https://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/2008/07/atlas-exclusive.html)

 Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County in Arizona led an investigation and using modern forensic tools available to the Sheriff's office, [proved it is a forgery.](http://www.worldtribune.com/forensic-findings-on-obamas-birth-certificate-a-100-percent-forgery-no-doubt-about-it/)

It comes to no surprised that Joe Arpaio and his office has been under attack, getting death threats/harassed for coming out with this kind of analysis. It comes to no surprise considering the amount of control and propaganda we have been under.

However, there are many many more things. [Here is a list of 100 reasons why Obama should be impeached](http://mrconservative.com/2013/05/14971-100-reasons-obama-could-be-impeached/2/). Please read through this.

The campsite, which has posh beach huts to hire, is mostly families and ""normal"" naturists, and, what we call, the French quarter, is just a fun French pub with vanilla French entertainment. At the other end of the scale, you have the BDSM club that is very hardcore (and that's on beginner/intro night). Then in the middle is Melrose bar where patrons (ladies only) get to pole dance.  
Personally, we do recommend SDC, the clubs and parties that we have been to have always been classy. Many only choose to wander about and dip their toes in, no pressure to take part; although it's always good to have an exit strategy. Ours is, well we are just going to have a cigarette (wife smokes), or baby did you want to have a quick smoke now?  
A bit of research pays dividends in our experiences. SDC often take over swinger venues, so it's easy to find descriptions of the places.  
The SDC takeovers are pretty epic (in our experiences) although not everyone is a fan. The do have a lot of groups/ clique, and often people complain they can't find partners who want to swap (although our view is that mostly people are fairly picky). Some people also complain that it's a bit of a fashion show - which we would plea guilty to, we have discover we just love to dress to impress (it makes us feel very sexy).  
Naturally, while you get to meet some of the most fantastic people on the planet, there are some complete dickheads at these events. Fortunately they are easy to spot and avoid, just spend a little time talking to them.  
As for SDC holidays, Depending where you are, American, then Cancun is good, European, then Crete is good, if you are looking for some SDC holiday recommendation. Other companies, I can't speak for, but I'm sure they are equally as good.   
As far as experiencing the Lifestyle is concerned, the general consensus is that ladies have two reactions. The first us to bolt at the first available opportunity, the second is that they have to be dragged out at closing time. My wife is the second sort, and nobody would have ever predicted that she would be like that.   
So, like everything, the lifestyle comes with risks. Do you believe, it doesn't matter what amazing thing happens, you will always end up going Home together? When the other person is having a good time, you will just be so happy that they are enjoying themselves? Do you talk a lot, and are able to relive and discuss whatever happens?

One of the reasons that the US economy became the world leader was cheap energy. We can use more energy because we can afford to do so. But another reason that played no small part in American success is efficient transportation. Can we, starting in 2008,  think of major infrastructure projects which will lower energy costs and make transportation more efficient?

Little tip on counseling is that you don't have to be stuck with the first counselor you go to. Its really important that you trust your counselor, so if they aren't doing it for you, make sure to find a new one. I know many people who got themselves in the door, but couldn't manage to keep it up and switch counselors once they were unhappy with the first. Also, many depressed people are picky and possessive about their feelings anyways, so many counselors stand little chance lol. So many quit counseling because they couldn't convinced themselves it would ever be helpful, but you have to buy in on your end to see any progress. Counselors are not miracle workers, and like with anything else, you have to be willing to fight for what's best for you to ever get unstuck.

I am 23 years old, so its probably helpful that I'm just a few footsteps ahead of you. I've had a rapid acceleration of getting myself together coming out of college. I've been out for two years now and this has helped me to strengthen my identity in the ""real world"" which is really key to things.

Well, I can't give you a full picture in this little space, but one of my bigger trials centered around romance and dating. I had gotten into a situation where I was in long term relationships from the age of 14. I had two girlfriends in high school and then one in college. That was my last relationship and I have been single ever since- the longest in my adult life. Anyways, much of the problem centered around trying to make romance fulfill most of my psychological needs. Not consciously, mind you, but in a passive way where my feelings and insecurities led me from romance to romance. In my relationships, things would get heavy really fast. Everything was super deep and intense. It was amazing in the moment, certainly, but it hid large weaknesses in my psyche. I was under a lot of stress in college and struggled to find success as I went to an over-competitive top school where every class was harder than it had to be. I absolutely loved science coming out of high school, but going to my college, I felt like I was no good at it anymore due to the excess difficulty. This led to a long term existential crisis. I selected philosophy as major, eventually ceasing my premed route after burning out sophomore year. I did hardcore liberal arts after that. Not to get sidetracked, this existential crisis fed my dependency on the relationship to make everything right in the world. It was my certainty and confirmation of my value when it felt like my other efforts just would not pay off. This pushed me to keep heightening the relationship more and more. Eventually, I proposed- there was no where to go but up, up, and up...

Until it all came crashing down. I don't know if you have been through this in some way, but to wake up as an INFP and to no longer feel. Wow, its bad and it hit me like a ton of bricks. The stock market crash of my psyche signaling the beginning of a prolonged depression. I didn't connect emotionally to the relationship anymore. I was emotionally castrated and a little voice in my head told me independence was the way out. I broke up with her after all the good things and all the promises. One of the biggest let downs of another person I have ever orchestrated in my life. Have you ever really let someone who cares about you down? It was a really big red flag for me once the dust cleared. I shut down and shut out other friends who were dependent on me. I realized later that I was textbook depressed. I started seeing pain and negativity everywhere. I despised my environment and had a lot of emptiness. Because I had used romance as a panacea for so long I got involved with another girl shortly thereafter, who ""fortunately"" had more problems than I did, as it helped me hit rock bottom. It was a terrible situation. Me in la la land trying make love out of nothing with a girl who was in no way psycho-emotionally healthy enough to reciprocate. I gave up my authority to her. She would give attention, then disappear for weeks. I was like a drug addict...addicted to the next hit, to the possibility of something working. There was no stability or thought about taking care of myself for the future.    

It finally got so absurd after a few months that I hit rock bottom. I got righteously fed up with myself, and finally made the conscious realization that no matter what the pains and emotional mess, this was not who I wanted to be. 

From that moment, I signed up form counseling through my college. I swore to being single for an extended period for once. I begin religiously attending a local Buddhist temple to reign in my thoughts and emotions. 

That was the end of my Junior year. I spent my Senior year more stable, but mostly reclusive, at least having my RA job to keep me social and responsible to others. I pursued careers in finance at this point, teaching myself the intricacies of financial markets. 

After graduating, I took a year off to travel. I've been all over the US now, and to Europe a couple times. My favorite trip was to New Zealand. I think every INFP should go there. Wow! The land speaks to you.

Long story, short, I've left out a lot of details, but hopefully this is helpful trial to hear about. I've been single for 2.5 years now, and I really believe its helped to reset my self-esteem along with the change in context of being graduated from college. Funnily enough, I'm back on the healthcare track, going for Physical Therapy. I've used my self knowledge and INFP identity to help me decide on a career path. And, I really am good at science, after all...

I think most of my strength today comes from going after areas that used to give me the most anxiety. I studied finance to handle money (I almost became a financial advisor I learned so much). I completed a five class improv course to work on social anxiety. I have a personal training certification, I'm a body builder, and marathon runner to cover physical needs. I am comfortable exploring psychology, have counselling experience from being an RA, and having done counseling myself. Specializing in Existentialist Philosophy, especially Nietzsche, and becoming initiated in the Korean Buddhist Zen philosophy has given me a strong internal compass for addressing life and meaningful living without organized religion.  All the relationship experience has given me a unique perspective on romance and constructive versus destructive relationships. Before I addressed these things though, all of them gave me some kind of stress or another. I will always have stressors and unknowns, and I have plenty to learn in life, but what's great is we get so much time to minimize risks and unknowns if we just give the effort to do so. As long as I have memory, I will never forget these skills and experiences, so they will always be foundations for me going forward. 

I feel like so many people arrest their development too early. Humans are such natural learners and really we should always be looking to improve and expand our abilities. There is so much rich nuance in life to go after and explore! So many people just stop at the superficial stuff and live life on the surface. Down deep, though, you get stronger foundations. You can start to redeem the dichotomies and paradoxes, and weather the uncertainties, you start to accept that you have little control over your external circumstances, you stop obsessing over power and possessions. It is very freeing. You can do so much, realizing deep down that you only need compete with yourself in this world. Trying to play other's games will always be a losing battle in the end.

You finally start to find some semblance of peace because you begin to stop seeing threats in everything else. That's all insecurity is after all, seeing enemies and ghosts and attacks where they do not intrinsically exist. Its a state-of-mind, a perspective on life to be vulnerable. We are always extremely physically and emotionally vulnerable, but we have the choice of what attitude to take towards this. The last great human freedom after all my be to choose one's attitude in any given situation (from Viktor Frankl, a holocaust survivor and Nietzsche reader).

Hopefully, some of this was helpful! Continue asking questions if there is more to talk about. Its good you will reach out to your trusted ones, and people like me are online to be a semi-anonymous input as well. I tend to ramble when talking about myself, but I practice responding to other's ideas and feelings a lot due to reddit's format, so just send any reflections my way that you'd like feedback on. Feel free to PM me as well if that is a better way of doing it. Take care in the time being!",0,t5_2qn2o

No one can. I am *trying* to explain that as a society, we should be concerned about that when young kids do have sex, they don't get pregnant. It will hinder the child if born into a family not ready to take care of them, it could harm the young mother if not kill her, not to mention the young fathers who are certainly not old enough of ready for a job (if they're even able to get one at say 15 yrs old)

I have had people misunderstand my stance on sex and age of consent before in another thread, sex education is *very* important and am glad to see it has worked out outstandingly well in Europe, however in the US we are still fighting for abortion and birth control rights for women.

Perhaps something that could be simply implanted in males and females that makes them infertile for a while such as [this](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon) that my mother got herself and it actually lasted about 5 years untill she had it removed and went on to have three other kids.

&gt;Besides, you already worry about economic survivability of teen mothers. Is that, too, a sole fact of evolution? When humanity's DNA strains were wrought over millennia, did it incorporate a set of genes that determined that so-and-so an age is 'too young' to be economically viable mothers?

Not sure what you meant by this. Richer teams (I guess you mean the more successful teams) don't play each other because of the seeding of the draws.

&gt;It's not a league of champions, but a league of the richest teams. As such it doesn't mean anything.

It's a cycle. Rich teams bring in the best talent and usually the best talent wins the league. Winning the league brings you money and money brings you the best talent.

No, the reason why teams don't play each other is because of the draw. If you are first in your league respective of strength of your domestic league, you get put in Pot A.

No fan wants to see the group stage of domestic teams playing each other (irrespective of derby and rivalry matches).

I promise I am not being argumentative for the sake of being argumentative. I mean, if we drop the whole subject of age of consent for a moment, I *do* just agree with you.

He say's he does it too when encountering other black men. Jessie Jackson CONSCIOUSLY said he is relieved when it is a white person coming up behind him when walking in an alley. Why is this? Are Jessie Jackson and Malcom Gladwell anti-black racists?
I'll admit on a conscious level of that sort of bias. If I amsifting through 100 resumes for a job and someone has a name like Sharkiesha, that's a negative as opposed to a name Mary. I personally know or have seen in the media, dozens's of successful women named Mary that I would like to employ. I've never met, nor have I ever seen, a successful captain of industry, scientist, prominent business person, or even respectable member of society with a name like Sharkeisha. I'm sure you haven't either. So in a crunch, when forced to widdle down 100 applicants by any means necessary, without meeting them all, I'm going with Mary. 

A comprehensive study correlating IQ to GDP has already been done so it’s not “simple or repugnant” as you put it. Check out the IQ and the Wealth of Nations study.  A populations IQ is directly &amp; correlated to national GDP and quality of life indexes and there isn't ONE country on the african continent with a high score. NOT ONE! The emotional and creative intelligence you speak of is just not correlated to success and quality of life in the modern era. The world can only support so many ballerinas and rappers.

Completely different figures. Here's the relevant quotes from unchrs [press release](http://www.unhcr.org/560d34c26.html)

&gt;This year, over half a million people, the majority of them refugees, have crossed the *Mediterranean Sea* in search of safety in Europe.

&gt;UNHCR is planning for up to 700,000 people seeking safety and international protection in Europe in 2015. While it is difficult to estimate at this point, it is possible that there could be even greater numbers of arrivals in 2016. Planning is based for the moment on similar figures to 2015.

Nationalism is a sentiment of hatred that has led to many of the saddest moments in modern history, WW2, holocaust, ethnic purge in Zimbabwe, Imperial Japan, if these are the type of nations that China wants to be then yes, the free nations will destroy China once more, just like they destroyed those. Up to you guys, we all wish for an open China. If what you want is no Foreigners in China, maybe Western nations should stop welcoming Chinese then, like those 60% wealthy Chinese whose dream is to get an Aussie or US passport.  
2. This is the funny thing with China, it expects the rest of the world to embrace Chinese culture but will not allow itself to even remotely consider adopting aspects of other cultures. One reason why the US have so much soft power is because they also embrace other cultures. China despite the size of its economy has zero soft power, even traditional Chinese culture is not associated with modern China in most people's minds. Make a choice, open with soft power of closed off with no soft power, you can't have both.  
3. Bitch please, there is this strong belief in China that other countries need Chinese tourists and Chinese investment or they are doomed, we did fine before China, we will do fine after China, please you or not.  
4. China has a ""us VS all"" mentality, this is why all non-Chinese are thrown in the same ""Foreigners"" bag, no distinction between White and Black, Spanish or German, we are all just laowei who speak English and other languages don't exist, and we all sing the ABC at Happy Giraffe because all Foreigners are English teachers, well, at least this belief comfort the average Zhou in his miserable existence.  
5. No, these are partners of interest, business partners, they will let China down the moment they can't earn anything from it. The only true ally of China is North Korea.

Secular groups have been warning about it for years. You can read about it here, here, here, and here.

Obviously the OIC want to pass laws which prevent speech that could convert people from Islam. These laws will never pass however, so the OIC poses little threat to you or I. 

&gt; considering that Saudi Arabia is one of the most powerful members of the OIC who recently classified atheism as terrorism. So they effectively classified criticism of religion as terrorism and also classified non-belief as terrorism. I'm really glad they hold so much power in the UN.

Saudi Arabia did not classify atheism as terrorism. Instead, they classified *calling for* atheism as terrorism. Seeing as Saudi Arabia is a Muslim (non-secular) state, they can argue that calling for others to leave Islam is a direct threat to the existence of their state. As such, it seems logical for theme to want to prevent people calling for atheism. Note that citizens of SA can still practice Atheism - they simply cannot publicly advocate it. I personally disagree with these laws - but they are not breaching anyone's human rights, that's for sure. 

&gt; The Arab gulf/the OIC holds a lot of power in the UN according to Claudia Rossett. One example is the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights who is Jordanian Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Hussein. He's a member of the Hashemite Dynasty who claim to be direct descendants of Mohammad.

You're wrong. The office of the high commissioner for human rights is a strictly administrative / managerial role. Al-Hussein's role is to follow the instructions of the sec-gen of the UN and the passed resolutions of the UNHCR. He is responsible for appropriately delegating the resources of the UNHCR to meet the resolutions that the member states have passed. As such, he cannot actually make decisions about what the UNHCR can or cannot do - and himself does not hold much power. 

&gt; Claudia Rossett, again, exposed the UN's oil for food scandal/bribes. Here's her wiki.

Corruption is an issue in many places of power, and the UN is no exception. Take peace in knowing that the corruption was found out, independent investigated and punished. The actions of one worker do not represent the actions of the entire UN. 

&gt; They have a revolving door with bankers (Peter Sutherland is the Chairman of Goldman Sachs and also and adviser/special representative to the UN, among others),

You're being downright deceitful by committing who Sutherland really is. Besides being the European commissioner for competition and the head of the world trade organization, Sutherland was also the secretary general of Ireland, the president of the British Federal Trust for Education and Research, a member of the advisory council of Business for New Europe, a member of the Commission on Human Security (reporting to the UN, 2003), Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (2005), and Chair of London School of Economics Council (2008). He is highly qualified for the position he holds with the UN, and besides what you may think, there is no ""revolving door"" activity occurring with his employment. I will continue to believe that until you provide a source that shows otherwise.

&gt; Here, here, here, and here are articles about how the UN (mis)treats whistle blowers who report on officials taking bribes, sexual abuse, child rape, and so on.

I concede that the actions undertaken by employees involved in what happened with James Wassterstrom acted disingenuously, and misrepresented the UN. I don't have much else to say about that other that it's currently under investigation. I guess time will tell what happens there. 

&gt; And finally here, here and here are articles about corruption at the UN's intellectual property arm WIPO and articles about how they illegally take DNA samples from their own employees.

I hadn't heard of this before. This is truly bizarre.

I'll give you a quick rundown on the actual reason why NA is so far behind the other regions. 

* Korea inherited much of the infrastructure from Starcraft so their gaming organisations have access to better coaches and are run more effectively. People also play the game way more seriously outside of competitive, resulting in a much stronger pool of talent.  

* China at first was on par with the other regions but a lot of money was pumped into the scene by a few very wealthy Chinese who desired to own their own LoL teams. As a result a lot of the raw talent and the infrastructure was brought across Korea to China.
* Before Asia got their shit together Europe was the strongest region simply because they tried the hardest. The scene in particular isn't very strong but they have some very strong teams because as well as taking a few of the powerful Koreans, they have a lot of experienced veterans who were world class players and can still go toe to toe with today's elite. 
* Finally, NA was never competitive because they only cared about popularity. Back in 2011 NA teams focused primarily on streaming and interacting with fans rather than focusing on getting better. The change in culture to try being competitive changed around 2014 but by then it was too late. The majority of the teams despite importing players don't have coaching staff anywhere close to the prowess of the other regions. Their in game environment is also not as 'tryhard' as, say, Korea. 

TL;DR EU, China and Korea have a more competitive environment, as well as veteran coaches and managers who know their shit.

This might not seem important, but that sense of guilt can REALLY bend you over. It can influence your judgment and intuition, so you could make bad bets.

Consider looking into the background of matches to see how your bet will turn out.

Recently, the Cloud9 v. WinterFox game was a good match to All-In on because 3/5 players of WinterFox were still in Europe from Dreamhack Stockholm, so they were gonna play on TERRIBLE ping.

Another example: Recently, NiP played HR on Dust 2, and 16-2'd them.

THEN, NiP had to play HR again, but on Cache. Now, because of that past match, everyone was betting on NiP and all-inning on NiP. Little do they know, Cache is not one of NiP's best maps, and HR have good history on Cache against NiP, and it's one of their better maps.

The game ended with HR beating NiP, 16-11.

Another example: Penta v. SK - Penta have a really solid team lineup, kRYSTAL and tabseN are both KEY fraggers on the team. SK has swapped up their line-up so many times in the past few months, so they have a low chance of winning... AND, it's a BO3, and Penta have had REALLY good match history against SK, beating them VERY badly on several maps. And that's when SK had their GOOD team lineup.

Penta ended up 2-0'ing them on Mirage, and Cobblestone, 16-9 and 16-12 respectively.

That's the type of insight you need when making educated bets when you REALLY wanna profit.

Following a group isn't 'bad', but most spreadsheets have a 'premium' group, so they're mostly money whores.

Shameless plug: I make these types of bets :) - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15KgMuhsn24QhuWU_YE4eD8S1_OKRBfq3jQXtEmVdjWA/edit?usp=sharing

But yes, as what Luefox said, you don't have to follow my spreadsheet. You can use ANYONE's spreadsheet to make bets off of. Just make sure the spreadsheet has good information behind the bets and what not.

Safe betting to you!",0,t5_2zume
