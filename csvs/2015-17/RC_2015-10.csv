""Codenamed Operation Satanic,[4] the Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior took place in New Zealand's Auckland Harbour on 10 July 1985. It was an attack carried out by French DGSE Agents aimed at sinking the flagship craft of the Greenpeace Organization to stop her from interfering in a nuclear test by the French Government at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. Greenpeace was opposed to testing and had planned to lead a flotilla of yachts to the atoll to protest against the test, including an illegal incursion into French military zones. The incident occurred late at night when two agents Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart attached two Limpet mines to the hull of the ship and detonated them 10 minutes apart. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira and lead to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand Sovereignty. The act sparked one of the most intense police investigations in New Zealand history and eventually led to the capture of both Mafart and Prieur passing themselves off as ""Sophie and Alain Turenge."" Both pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on 22 November 1985.

France threatened an economic embargo of New Zealand's exports to the European Economic Community if the pair were not immediately released. Such an action would have been crippling to the New Zealand economy which at that time was heavily dependent on agricultural exports to Britain. Operation Satanic was a public relations disaster. New Zealand was an ally of France. France initially denied any involvement, and even joined in condemnation of it as a terrorist act.

This act of state-sponsored terrorism badly strained bilateral relations and in July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of Hao, to serve three years instead, as well as an apology and a NZD 13 million payment from France to New Zealand.""",worldnews,False,,t3_3mztyl,Thosefuckingfuckwit,1443658665,0,t1_cvjy49v,,4,,4,1446697363

What would be strictly a Brazilian affair would be ""Qualquer contato me vai matar"", this would likely be considered a grammatical error by some more strict professors here.

Note that all of this is ultimately a matter of style, we are talking about something which clearly means the same but since it has a lot of flexibility gives birth to regional preferences in a way that other constructs aren't able (since they would be eliminated due to being considered mistakes). Nothing to be really bothered about, but the more vociferous defenders of language tradition over here are always on the lookout for this, to the extent that they tend to fall over to hyper-correction and make mistakes such as ""Não batas-me"" (should be ""Não me batas"", the negative attracts it) and ""Aqui construiu-se"" (should be ""Aqui se construi..."", the adverb of location also attracts it).

The word ""contato"" would however be a dead giveaway: it's one of the (relatively few) words where there is an actual difference in the way it is spoken and not just as it is written (this being the ones who were eliminated in the latest reform): they say ""contato"" in Brazil, in Portugal we say ""contacto"" (as in, we say it as ""contact"" in English, with a hard ""c"").

0,t5_2qh13,cvjz9ie,"&gt; Figure 8 shows the calculated effects. As in the simulations already discussed, this is an “all
&gt; other things being equal” effect, i.e., it includes only those effects that can be traced back to the
&gt; transatlantic agreement. In the case of non-tariff barriers, however, it is very likely that many
&gt; countries, especially the traditional trading partners of the EU and the USA, will adopt the same
&gt; standards and regulations. Under certain circumstances, it is even realistic for countries that
&gt; already have free-trade agreements with the EU or USA to indirectly participate in negotiations
&gt; between the EU and USA, so that their concerns are taken into account. This does not show up in
&gt; the calculations, so the negative welfare effects may be exaggerated. They do clearly reflect the
&gt; trend, however, and indicate where there is a need to act.

You have to remember that there is still much room for negotiations between countries that will more than likely change some of the large losses seen in figure 8, especially in this case seeing that the study is from 2013.

Referring to the 3.27% avg real income rise ,
&gt; For the world in general, deep liberalization between the EU and USA means a rise in average
&gt; real income of 3.27%. That puts enough money on the table to compensate the losers. It can be
&gt; hoped that the agreement increases the willingness of developing and emerging countries to enter
&gt; into compromises in the Doha Development Agenda. At the same time, the industrial countries
&gt; should also be ready to make compromises, because a substantial intensification of the economic
&gt; relationships between the USA and EU would make the necessary resources available.
&gt; 

The job losses are mostly initial and are negligible in the long run. Here is the [change in employment,unemployment rate and real wages, via deep liberalization](http://imgur.com/F1D4n8z)

 As you can see the gains are quite substantial in all areas with deep liberalization. Even though there are some losers in the OECD with this scenario, it is those who are not part of the TTIP agreement. 

&gt; However, even in their case, on average, the real GDP-weighted wage increase is 2.34%,
&gt; so that there are sufficient profits available for the third countries that don’t participate to be able
&gt; to be compensated for their real wage losses. 

-

&gt; (Compared to change in employment,unemployment rate and real wages, via tariff scenario^[\[1\]](http://i.imgur.com/aQeooau.png)) Even with consideration of the quantitative (or employment) effects, the impact on prices, here
&gt; real wages, and thus on consumer welfare, is substantially larger: In Germany real wages are 2.19%
&gt; higher and in the countries severely affected by the crisis just mentioned, at least 3% higher. It
&gt; is thus apparent that deep liberalization, besides providing higher positive employment effects,
&gt; offers substantially higher welfare effects than does just eliminating tariffs. However, there are
&gt; also losers in this scenario within the OECD: It is those countries that are not part of the TTIP
&gt; agreement. However, even in their case, on average, the real GDP-weighted wage increase is 2.34%,
&gt; so that there are sufficient profits available for the third countries that don’t participate to be able

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Statistics

You can see during the years of 1882-1918, only 62,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.  In fact, the majority of those Jews ended up going back to Europe.

&gt; The Jewish Virtual Library says of the First Aliyah that nearly half the settlers did not stay in Palestine.[14]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah

Between 1918 and 1948 482,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine.  Something like 8x as many Jews immigrated during the British mandate as they did during the previous 36 years.  The reason so many Jews immigrated to Palestine is because the British made it possible. They gave them visas and helped protect them establish communities.  If the British had not been there to stop the Arabs, the Arabs would have deported or driven out the Jews who were trying to settle in Palestine.

The first British governor of Palestine, was a Jewish Zionist.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Samuel,_1st_Viscount_Samuel

Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel, was the President of the British Zionist Federation.  That turned into the Zionist Commission which then turned into the Jewish Agency of Palestine which established Jewish governing institutions, created militias and has been responsible for organizing the immigration of more than 3 million Jews to Israel.  So a British guy became the first president of Israel and his British group is responsible for half the Jewish population of Israel.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Commission

The British directly stated they were going to support the establish of a Jewish home in Palestine.  They then enabled the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Jews to Palestine and help them establish governing institutions and protecting them from being removed.  If the British had just left Palestine a part of Syria, where it had been ruled for centuries and allowed the Palestinians their independence then there would have been no Jewish immigrants and no Israel.

&gt; Saddam wasn't put in power by the British.

Saddams rise to power is directly traced to the British occupation of Iraq and its puppet ownership of the Kingdom of Iraq.  But, as I pointed out in the beginning, there was no hope for an Iraqi state because the British had cobbled it together from differing tribal, ethnic and religious communities.  They intentionally designed the state and its institutions to require British support to stay in power over the populace.  By governing Iraq, and the rest of the Arabs lands, with such a heavy hand the British (and French) created the Arab nationalists like Saddam and Assad who are popular because of their ""resistance to the imperials.""  

&gt; Is Britain now responsible for all historical despots?

You mean is Britain responsible for designing colonial governments that have no legitimacy or governing ability except to exploit the local populace for the benefit of the British empire?  If British intervention in a country causes a dictator to take over the country to oppose the British then yea, I blame the British.

Europe in 1900 was overflowing with Yang masculinity and it was this **excess** of masculine growth that caused WWI and WWII.  Today it's all beta orbitors and feminists.

0,t5_2rxqu,cvk4gtk,"I don't build violins (I build other stuff), but I have done a fair bit of research.  A few points of insight to add to what has already been said:

1 - Spruce has fantastic strength:weight and stiffness:weight ratios.  It's better in that regard than most other easily obtainable woods.  That means you can build a top with the necessary structural properties without excess weight, and this improves the instrument's efficiency at turning string vibrations into sound.  Maple is beautiful, straightforward to carve, bend, and finish, and it is plentiful.  It is one of the few European hardwoods that possesses all those virtues, and so it was popular with early violin makers.

Other woods have been tried by modern luthiers, but the string instrument community is pretty conservative and traditional when it comes to instruments, so the other woods haven't made much progress in terms of gaining popularity.

6 - The internet has made it a lot easier to buy small quantities of instrument-grade wood.  It also helps to make friends with the guys who own higher end lumber yards so that if something special comes into their store, you're going to get a phone call.

8 - This was popular for a while, but the acoustic design of the instrument peaked during an era when such practices were considered ugly - thus, it is the more conservative looking instruments that tend to get copied even today.  Google image search ""baroque violin.""  Most inlay materials wear down at different rates than the fingerboard, which isn't desirable for an instrument where the strings touch the fingerboard rather than frets.

9 - Violin, Viola, and Violoncello (or Cello) are all members of the same family.  They're a bit different, yes, but they're all essentially just bigger or smaller variations on the same core design.  (My friend started cello lessons when she was four years old.  her first instrument was a viola held like a cello.)  The double bass, on the other hand, may have evolved from a different instrument family: the viol.  It's a slightly different beast.

10 - A structural brace that affects the resonant behavior of the instrument's soundboard.  As mentioned below, it's on the bass side of the instrument.

13 - Lots of builders find a particular aesthetic that they personally like, and they stick to that look for most of their career.  A signature blend of colors can help make an instrument identifiable (i.e. branding).

14 - A chin and shoulder brace mean that less of the soundboard and back are in contact with something that could dampen it (such as your chin and shoulder).

15 - I think gut strings are usually paired with baroque violins, which are a bit different from classical violins.  So yes.

17 - F-holes are partly shaped to look nice, and partly shaped to control a) how the top resonates and b) the resonant frequency of the air inside the instrument.  [The shape has been more or less optimized over centuries of experimentation.](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/471/2175/20140905/F1.large.jpg)

0,t5_2qh8e,cvk65y0,"These sorts of 'bubble will never burst' articles are arguably part of the 'new normal' 'new paradigm' phase of a bubble ([see here for asset bubble anatomy](http://imgur.com/AeusuBb)), which occurs right at the peak - the stage where the bubble has become widely accepted by the public, central banks, economists - even most of the real estate/banking/insurance industry - and a minority of economists seek attention and go against the grain by claiming a crash cannot or will not happen, usually for reasons they define poorly if at all (they should be distinguished from other callers who cried bubble way too early e.g. Steve Keen. These early callers are usually wrong because house price bubbles burst not just when they're way out of step with economic fundamentals, but also when public panic sets in on a downturn - and this doesn't happen unless the public know it's a bubble).

The thing with this assumption China will save us is, firstly, China isn't as filthy rich as we think: much of China's wealth was raised on the back of its own whopping property bubble. Around 25% of Chinese property is unoccupied and many economists believe China is growing much, much more slowly than official stats indicate - and in fact may be heading into its own recession more rapidly than anyone ever imagined. There's a strong argument China's 'triple bubble' has already burst and may destroy a lot of wealth. China's government also needs to protect its legitimacy - and one recent measure it has taken is enacting and enforcing laws to prevent capital flight. So they're making it harder for rich Chinese investors to shift their money overseas. 

Second, rich Chinese investors who do successfully shift their money overseas are not going to want to put it into shitty assets. There's a tendency lately to confuse wanting to invest in offshore property and wanting Australian property *specifically*. Chinese investors were putting their money into property here *because* our economy was booming and property boomed with it. They invested *because* prices skyrocketed - not the other way around (though all investors - foreign and domestic alike - have exacerbated the problem, i.e. prices have gone up because of investment, and investment has gone up because of prices - bit of a cycle, but the point is, prices were in a fucking huge bubble well before Chinese investment ballooned). If Australia's property bubble is already in a process of bursting as a *lot* of solid evidence suggests, and our economy is moving into recession, prices could come down fast. Chinese investors here were jumping on the bubble bandwagon - but they don't actually *want* our houses, they want somewhere to park their money and see it not lose its value. That somewhere does not have to be Australia. Why the fuck we think it does is beyond me - we're not special, our houses aren't special. 

If capital returns start to look sketchy, what then? What will happen if the growing number of cities and towns in which property prices are falling increases? What will happen if auction clearance rates continue to fall? What will happen if rental yields fall or remain at already record lows?

0,t5_2uayg,cvk6foh,"I think you're underestimating the economical aspect. I often hear that Catalonia is the richest region of Spain, and Flanders is currently richer than Wallonia. 

An example that agrees with my point could be Friesland (or Fryslân) in the Netherlands. Just like Catalonia, they have their own language but everyone speaks the national language. Frisian is an official language in Friesland but not in e.g. Holland or Zeeland and it's not used in the national parliament. There are some cultural differences too, a few sports that are only popular there for example. It's nothing major and I don't know how that compares to Catalonia. 

However, Friesland is definitely not the richest region of the country. They have enough agriculture to ""feed the world"" (the province's slogan) so they might even be able to survive as a separate country, but most money of the Netherlands is earned in Groningen (largest natural gas field of European mainland) and Holland (ports, airports, business, tourism). I think that plays a part in why there isn't a real secession movement (none of the political parties, not even the ""Frisian national party"", support secession).

And I know at least in Belgium, the secession movement is trying to portray the Walloons as people living off of welfare paid by the Flemish, more than they're saying that the Walloons are so different.

0,t5_2qh13,cvk6ssg,"they've lost almost 30 billion in market valuation. Reading is nice. 

""Some 10.8 million diesel-powered cars were implicated in the emissions-test cheating scandal that came to light on Sept. 18. Of those, 2.1 million were Audis, which on average generated 3,200 euros of operating profit per vehicle during the six years in question, based on data from company reports. The rest came from lower-priced volume brands and other vehicles, whose operating profit per car averaged 576 euros - ranging from almost 1,000 euros for VW commercial vehicles to a loss at SEAT. Add those up, and the total operating profit involved hits 12.1 billion euros, or 30 percent of all VW’s non-truck automotive operating profit over the six years.

Getting those cars fit for U.S. emissions tests would have come at a cost. Most carmakers rely on one of two main technologies for stripping out nitrogen oxides, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. Meeting tough American standards probably means using both, as BMW does in America. That typically adds around 400 euros per car for the more sophisticated technology, according to ICCT data.

Apply that cost to all of the 10.8 million cars that VW says were implicated in its emissions-dodging scandal, and it suggests that the carmaker saved no more than 4.3 billion euros over six years by neglecting to make its diesels clean. If only the 482,000 cars actually sold in the United States legally required this extra technological boost – since permitted nitrogen oxide levels in Europe are higher, tests less stringent and fines lower – the saving is less than 200 million euros.

Since VW’s misdeeds were uncovered, the company’s shares have plunged, wiping almost 29 billion euros off the company’s market capitalisation. Simply put, shareholders have lost more than 140 euros in market value for every single euro that VW saved by cutting corners on its diesel engines in the United States. It’s hard to think of a better reminder that cheating doesn’t pay.

0,t5_2qyz1,cvk8k5p,"I have mixed feelings about this. The benefits of learning a foreign language include:

* Developing a better understanding of different cultures, religions, and philosophies.
* Ability to communicate with non-English speakers, whether traveling or when conducting business.
* Increased employability.
* Positive impact on brain function and overall academic performance.

For this reasons I would support increased Mandarin Chinese education in the United States. That said, the potential drawbacks of learning Mandarin include:

* 98% of the world's native Mandarin speakers live in mainland China. You are unlikely to encounter native (or even non-native speakers) outside of mainland China and a handful of other locales (i.e., Taiwan, Singapore, etc.) It's utility as a second language when traveling outside of mainland China is extremely limited.
* It is one of the hardest languages for native English speakers to learn. Obtaining even moderate proficiency takes a significant amount of effort for most people, more so than for other languages.
* As noted in the article, hundreds of millions of Mandarin speakers study English. When conducting business, your Chinese counterparts will most likely speak English far better than you speak Mandarin.
* China is on the rise and looks to be an increasingly dominant player in the world, but there's no guarantee it's role will be as prominent or impactful (see also: Japan in the 1980s).

Despite these potential drawbacks, I still think increased Mandarin education in the United States would be a great thing - if only to expose American students to a non-European language and culture. As [/Urbanscuba](https://www.reddit.com/user/Urbanscuba) noted:

&gt;The hard part isn't getting the million students to learn, it's getting the teachers and infrastructure to teach them and build some momentum.

This is a great point and building this infrastructure will not be easy. But it can be done. 

[/Zeebus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeebus) noted:

&gt;That is to say that they'll probably forget it all in two years because they never use it in their daily lives (even more so with Chinese than Spanish).

Again, another great point. Whether Chinese or another language, if it's not used it will be forgotten. In theory the opportunities to speak or at least be exposed to Spanish are greater within the United States than Chinese.

Above all, students should learn a language in which they have an interest (and by extension an interest in the country/culture(s) where it is spoken). If that basic interest is not there, then no amount of encouragement (or coercion) will produce large numbers of proficient Mandarin speakers able to interact with native speakers.

No, I'm not American. I prac on the same DM server that skyred pracs on, and I follow the EU scene meta more than any other.  

Let's start with the smaller problem with your mentality: understanding trade-off.  

In CS, the fundamental trade-off is being in motion, and being stationary. Let's take a look at some of your quotes:  

""The tradeoff is in the pistols doing less damage"" - tradeoff between what and what?  

""The tradeoff is and should be in less ROF, less damage, less penetration, smaller clips"" - tradeoff between what and what?  

""make them 100% accurate"" (in the context of moving inaccuracy) - so, zero tradeoff between moving accuracy and being stationary?  

Ok, now that that silly bit is out of the way, on to the next:  
You want CS to be quake/tribes-style high speed flying around yet with 100% acc. Because you know CS better than almost everybody else. OK, sure.  

You also think that ""game would be better if all recoil was removed completely"".  

With those views, you then go on to claim that ""the pro players and former proplayers I know and play with [share my pov on the game]""  

So, in summary, you believe that:  

* Pistols should be 100% accurate while moving  
* TTK should be raised and damage output should be lowered (this is fine)  
* The tradeoff between moving and shooting should be removed  
* Recoil should be removed (lmao)  
* The ""pro players"" and ""former pro players"" you play with agree with you.

Click ""Routes"", and watch all the non-existent routes directly between points that the maker of this video so conveniently ignored. Direct flights between south America and Australia or New Zealand. Between South Africa and south America. From Australia to South Africa.

Once again, I ask _you_: why is this video, and the person who made it, credible? He is obviously ignoring all evidence that contradicts his beliefs, and presenting _only_ that which agrees with it.

Also, look at the curves of the flight paths. They're mapped on a flat map, so the _lines_ curve one way south of the equator, and the other way north of it. Those crossing the equator go almost straight, before switching curve direction after crossing. On a globe map, the paths would all look pretty much straight.

Also, the fact that you can't find _many_ paths flying directly between extreme ends of the earth is simply because _not many people want or need to fly that route_. Again, just look at the map, how a vast majority of flights go to or from Europe, north America and east Asia. _Of course_ lots of flights are going to have stop-overs near those areas, because that way they get more travelers to make the flight worth the cost.

I'm honestly asking: _how_ is this so hard to understand? Why the _hell_ would an airline waste tons of money flying a couple of people straight over the Antarctic when it makes much more sense to fly via Europe or north America where most people want to go anyway? Those who want to travel from one extreme end to the other can still do so, at reasonable costs, when accepting longer flight times.

0,t5_2sokd,cvka0j8,"This question comes up a lot, so I'll be reposting my standard reply here.

First, I'd recommend checking out the relevant section of the /r/AskHistorians [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/nativeamerican#wiki_civilizations_of_the_americas), especially [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1aggse/the_native_americans_and_several_other_cultures/c8x977d).

The main thrust of many of the posts in this section of the FAQs, is that the differences between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia are more superficial than they might first appear. 

One of the main differences between European societies and those in the Americas is that Europeans heavily employed iron and steel (which is made from iron) for tools, weapons, and armor. The Americas had their own metallurgy, especially in Mesoamerica and the Andes, but these were largely focused on precious metals like gold and silver rather than iron. This also include metals like platinum that were unheard of in Europe. They produced some quantities of bronze, but it was mainly as subset of the precious metals production (playing around with the ratios of metals in the bronze alloy to make faux-gold and faux-silver, for example) and not focused on making tools. This isn't to say that people in the Americas never made tools and weapons from metals. Between 6000 and 3000 years ago, there was a thriving group of societies in the western Great Lakes known as the Old Copper Complex. This cultures, like their name suggests, utilized the vast reserves of copper in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to fashion spearheads, knives, fishhooks, and other tools and weapons from copper. Around 3000 years ago, the Old Copper Complex switched to using stone tools and weapons. Why? Because the stone tools and weapons were *better*. Copper is a relatively soft metal, which makes it easy to work, but less than ideal for something that needs going to be under a lot of stress from regular like a tool. Once long-distance trade became the norm in eastern North America, the Old Copper Complex began important high-quality stone to make better tools and began exporting their copper in the form of jewelry and other ornamental objects. A few copper tools and weapons would continue to be made up to European contact, but these were in the minority.

But why didn't the Old Copper Complex develop bronze like Europeans did? Bronze requires two things. The first is copper, which the Old Copper Complex quite literally had *tons* of. But it also needs another metal to be added to the alloy, usually tin. Compared to Europe, there's very little accessible tin in the Americas, and the nearest decent source is all the way in northwest Mexico ([map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Tin-ancient-sources.svg)). It's not something that was being passed along the trade routes with any regularity to develop a thriving bronze-producing industry. 

Additionally, the Old Copper Complex's copper is what's known as ""native copper,"" meaning that is copper in its purest form. It's not an ore, so smelting wasn't necessary to acquire it. How exactly smelting original developed is still an open question, but the best leads we have currently ties it to accidental discoveries related to the production of pottery (people built kilns out of ore-bearing rocks, and the environment in the kilns got hot enough to smelt the metal from the ore). Copper in particular can be smelted pretty easily at comparatively low temperatures, like you make occasionally get while firing pottery. Iron on the other hand requires much hotter temperatures to smelt, and so far as we know today, there's only one area of the world that *might* have figured out iron smelting before copper smelting (West Africa). Without smelters already producing copper, it's unlikely that you'd accidentally produce the temperatures necessary in the necessary environment to produce iron. Unlike copper, iron is exceptionally rare in its native form. The only real source of native iron comes from meteors, which provided the iron used in the Arctic iron trade (where it was made into knives), and the occasional bits of iron we find in eastern North America which were made into beads and chisels. But meteors don't provide enough iron to build a reliable iron-working industry upon.

All that said, the stone weapons and tools used by Native people shouldn't be regarded as primitive. They'd been developing for thousands of years just like Europe's metal weapons. The Aztecs are rather famous for their macahuitl, a stone-edged sword capable of decapitating a horse. The Apalachee of northeastern Florida harried the Spanish out of their territory with bows that fired faster and more accurately than contemporary firearms (which were notoriously slow anyhow), firing arrows that could puncture multiple layers of Spanish chainmail. 

Of course, while stone has its advantages compared to copper, it also has its disadvantages compared to iron and steel. You could get a sharper edge out of something like obsidian, but its fragile and would need to be replaced regularly. Iron might not be as sharp, but it gets the job done just as well and is more durable. Once Europeans arrive and can provide a reliable supply of iron, stone tools and weapons are largely phased out during the colonial era.

Going back to firearms for a moment, this is another aspect of European technology that is often pointed to when people say that American technology was ""behind."" It's important to remember the unique history of firearm development. By the time Europeans arrived in the Americas to stay (so ignoring the Norse for the moment), they had only had firearms for about 200 years at most. The technology had been brought west relatively recently, likely by the spread of the Mongols across Asia and into Europe. The development of firearms is predicated on the invention of gunpowder, which Chinese alchemists invented in the 9th Century while researching an entirely unrelated field. It was a fortunate accident for them, that had huge potential for military application.  It's not at all surprising that societies far removed from China had not heard of gunpowder yet, nor had they (or Europeans for that matter) chanced upon the right combination of ingredients to make it themselves without first being instructed by others. Soon after the English arrived in New England however, the Narragansett of what's now Rhode Island began establishing their own forges for maintaining their firearms and supplying themselves with ammunition. They still relied on the English for gunpowder (though they had sought to learn the secrets of its production), but *no one* in New England could make it at the time - all the gunpowder was being imported from England until after King Philip's War in 1675, during which the Narragansett gun forges were a primary target by colonists. In general, though, until the mid-1600s Native American societies ignored the gun, and regarded their own weapons as superior (as the Apalachee demonstrated against the Spanish). It wasn't until the development of flintlock rifles that firearms became popular among Native societies in eastern North America; during the aforementioned King Philip's War, most of the Wampanoag and Narrangansett warriors were armed with flintlocks while their colonial counterparts largely were using older matchlocks, flipping the usual narrative of which side possessed the more advanced weaponry.

They're not expanding anywhere no matter how much they want to.

A lot of Syrians really *hate* Assad. Once he's gone (the writing is on the wall) the next government will likely quickly kiss up to the West to get what they need to stabilize themselves.  Putin is just being an asshole and prolonging everything by interfering instead of using his influence to get rid of Assad. 

If the new Syrian government instead acts like their neighbor Jordan, they'll get pumped full of money, weapons and NATO support.   But it's going to take a *long time* to dig out ISIS and stabilize the whole of Syria. Good luck trying to get all the 20yo who ran to come home and fight after they had a few years of German welfare.

I'm not too sure you can fault Obama.  I get the feeling that the whole Arab Spring took our intelligence agencies by surprise, spreading virus-like as it did via Twitter, and they had to do some serious on-the-fly gear shifting.  It will be another 10 years before the consequences of all that shakes out and It wouldn't surprise me if there's another wave of instability through the region.

It all makes Iran look more and more appealing to me. Iran could be a very well-off country if they would stop acting like assholes and play nice with the West like Turkey.  The cold war is over.  They cant profit by playing the West against the USSR, no matter how much Russia pretends they can.  But they have their own conservative theocrat hardliners in power with gigantic sticks up their asses. 

The (non British) EU policy is to publically criticise the US for the voters back home while waiting in line with their hands out to collect their share of the treasure and move in their business interests.  The Germans were in Iran the *very next day* after the deal was struck. 

But how well they ignored Ukraine, and the bungling mess they made of the refugee problem...all pointing fingers at each other, bickering over quotas, and suddendly acting like individual nation-states instead of a Federation is telling.

0,t5_2ssp3,cvkap0p,"The vast majority of scholarly history work is done in archives. There are archives that cover just about everything you could imagine. Government archives for official records, institutional archives (like of a company) that cover the history of the insitution, church archives for various religions or individual churches, private archives that cover an individual who may or may not be famous to the average person, and archives which cover any range of topics. For your purposes, there are diary archives. I don't study American or British history, so I'm not familiar with English language archives as much, but in my specialty of Northwest Europe, there is the [Nederlandse Dagboekarchief](http://www.dagboekarchief.nl/) and the [Deutsches Tagebucharchiv](http://www.tagebucharchiv.de/).

You're likely to find two severe limitations in searching for what you're looking for. 

1) You're looking for stuff that's been digitized. Don't get me wrong, a lot of stuff has been digitized, but even more has not. Generally speaking, archives do not get the best funding in the world, and when it comes to preserving documents versus digitizing them, they will work with preserving the original every time. 

2) You're looking for stuff in English. That is, for the most part, going to limit you to stuff that has been translated or stuff that was originally written in English. Translation costs money, so it's rarely done unless its for publication. Publication costs money as well, so that means you generally have to pay for access (usually through buying a book or subscribing to a database). 

That all being said, there are some online repositories that contain ego-documents of the type you're looking for. 

* The [Internet History Sourcebooks Project](http://legacy.fordham.edu/Halsall/index.asp) has a large collection of primary sources available for free. Most of it has been translated into English.  
* [California State University San Marcos](https://biblio.csusm.edu/content/history-databases-primary-sources) has a list of online archives covering various topics. 
* The [Liberty, Equality, Fraternity](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/) archive at GMU has put a lot of translated stuff from the French Revolution online. 
* [Yale University's Avalon Project](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/) contains primary documents relating to law and diplomacy. 
* The [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](http://www.ushmm.org/research/research-in-collections) has a good chunk of stuff available online, although it's only a fraction of their total collection. 
* The [National Archives and Records Administration](http://www.archives.gov) has some stuff online, as does the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov). I've never looked, but I'd imagine you can get some stuff from the British Library as well. 

This is just scratching the surface really. If you narrow down your search criteria (i.e. more narrow than ""journal style"" from the ""distant past""), I'd bet someone here can point you in the right direction.

0,t5_37k90,cvkasf3,"8 weeks for the NHL playoffs isn't too bad. I wouldn't mind if they got rid of one round and made it 6 teams instead of 8 making the playoffs. But then you have people argue for teams like the Kings in 2012 being the 8th seed and winning the cup.

Lots of MLS fans are also upset about 6 teams entering the playoffs this year instead of the previous 5. But then you have teams like Real Salt Lake winning MLS Cup in 2009 with a *losing* record.

But that just goes back to your point of making the regular season meaningful.  It's hard with American sports because of playoffs. There are a lot of teams that can just coast along and then kick it in gear and make a push for the playoffs, make a run of a few games during a couple weeks and win the championship. It's like the entire year was meaningless because one team got hot just at the right time.

It almost makes you think if Europe does it right with soccer where there are no playoffs and it's just the regular season. Whoever has the best record wins the championship. It makes every single game count.

But the playoffs are just too exciting to do that. It's tough to find the right balance and it makes people hesitant to change it around too much, even if it means finding the right formula. ",CHICubs,False,,t3_3n03hq,0piat3,1443686704,0,t1_cvk7s1w,,2,,2,1446703382

Die Sache mit den USA ist folgende: Du kannst die USA nicht mit einem Land wie etwa Österreich vergleichen, sondern mit einem Gebiet wie der EU. Soll heißen; es gibt große Unterschiede. Die Zuseher von John Oliver, einem europäischen Komiker, der sich auf internationale Themen spezialisiert hat, wird bestimmt nicht vom Durchschnittsamerikaner geschaut. Aber die USA sind hier ja eh nicht wirklich das Thema.

&gt; Die Reporterin haette das nicht machen sollen, da stimm ich dir zu. Laut kurdisch-syrischen Behoerden war/ist der man mit Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaeda in Syrien) verbunden. Davor haben viele Regierungen und Menschen angst.

Was dieser Mann, schon oder nicht ist, ist völlig unerheblich für die Flüchtlingspolitik der Ungarn. Er hätte genau so gut Friedensnobelpreisträger sein können.

&gt; Natuerlich geht das nur muss man vorbereitet sein extreme Massnahmen zu nehmen. Am Tag nach dem Ungarn die serbische Grenze schloss, haben es nur 300 geschafft und sie wurden dann verhaftet. Haette Ungarn die Grenze mit Kroatien auch dicht gemacht waeren da auch nur ein paar Hundert durchgekommen. Man muss halt dieses Prinzip an den EU Aussengrenzen und im Ausland einsetzen (siehe Australien).

Als erstes: Australien ist eine Insel. Eine gewaltige Insel. Das sind 35.876 Kilometer Küste. Wenn Australien nicht zufällig gerade Superman dort abgestellt hat zum Patroulieren seh ich da also auch eher schwarz.

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australien#Geographie

Und was hat es gebracht, dass die Ungarn dicht gemacht haben? Die Leute gehen einfach wo anders über die Grenze. Und die gehen dann auch einfach um den nächsten Zaun herum. Und wenn der letzte Zaun fertig ist, dann ist der erste unbewacht. Die EU hat eine Außengrenze mit einer Länge von 13.026 Kilometer. Das müssen dann aber schon extreme Maßnahmen sein. Eiserner Vorhang? Hört sich wirklich super an! (ACHTUNG: Sarkasmus!)

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C3%9Fengrenzen_der_Europ%C3%A4ischen_Union

&gt; Welche Sozialleistungen bietet die Turkei den Fluechtlingen an? Von Integration ist gar nicht die Rede. 12,3 Milliarden werden es jetzt schon fuer die naechsten vier Jahre sein und die Zahl ist sicher zu klein weil Millionen noch nachkommen.

Zuerst kurz Türkei: Da hast du recht. Die Türkei hat nicht annähernd die Finanzen die wir haben und kann den Menschen dort deshalb auch nicht so viel Unterstützung zukommen lassen. Wir können uns das aber leisten UND haben außerdem weniger Flüchtlinge. Weil sogar wenn alle die jetzt in der Türkei sind zu uns kommen können wir sie trotzdem aufteilen auf einige der reichsten Länder der Welt.

Zu den 12,3 Milliarden. Das ist ne Menge Geld. Keine Frage. Wir ignorieren jetzt mal, dass das keine offizielle Meldung ist, vom Finanzamt abgestritten wird und deshalb keine Rede sein kann davon, dass das stimmt.
Gehen wir aber mal davon aus, dass es schon stimmt, was ich auch nicht für unmöglich halte.

Hierfür möchte ich folgenden Artikel empfehlen:

https://nzz.at/s/13Lb9w-3jwE4/

Kurz gesagt wird da folgendes diskutiert: 12,3 Milliarden sind ohne Frage viel Geld. Aber wir haben für den Bereich ""Alter"" in Österreich im Jahr 43,5 Milliarden ausgegeben. 22,65 Milliarden für Verwaltung. Österreich ist eine ausgesprochen Reiche Volkswirtschaft. Wir können so etwas verkraften. Wir haben eventuell auch schon mal bessere Zeiten gesehen, aber schlechte Zeiten haben wir schon lange nicht mehr gesehen.

Den Nazismus, gerade in Österreich, als abgeschafft zu beschreiben halte ich leider für einen Irrglauben. Gerade jetzt kann man die schwelende Gefahr förmlich spüren. Man muss den Leuten nur genug Angst machen, dann hören sie auf jeden der/die ihnen Rettung verspricht.

Find ich aber gut, dass du dich so um die Schiiten sorgst. Die Schiiten haben auch nicht besonders viel für Sunniten übrig. Und Katholiken und Protestanten haben sich Jahrhunderte die Schädel eingeschlagen. Religion hat das Potential dafür, für so einige Dummheiten ausgneutzt zu werden. Schade eigentlich.

Das beste, und meiner Meinung einzige Mittel, gegen Fanatismus jeglicher Art ist ganz einfach: Wohlstand und Akzeptanz.

Wenn alle Leute was zum Mampfen haben, glauben, dass sie wo sind wo sie hingehören und es ihren Kindern gut geht, dann können die Salafisten so viel reden wie sie wollen.

Wenn wir also diesen Menschen die zu uns(Europa) fliehen weil sie glauben, dass bei uns alles besser ist als bei ihnen, mit Ablehnung, Hass und Furcht begegnen, brauchen wir uns nicht darüber wundern, wenn sie sich dann nicht mit uns identifizieren können.

I know they have their local club competition, but the level is very low, can it really produce quality players for a top-tier international team?

Google-fu is your friend. 

""Journal archives"", ""journal collections,"" and ""diary archives"" turned up a bunch of academic journals and modern blogs. But a search for ""diary collections"" was quite fruitful. ""Historical diaries"" suggested (you know, the ""Searches related to"" at the bottom of each Google page) I try ""historical diaries online"" which also worked well.

Google Books is finnicky, but it can be very helpful. In your case, I'd go to GB, search for ""diary"", and then narrow down the search options to ""Free Google eBooks."" Why? Because that limits your search results to (a) what you can read online and (b) ""historical"" diaries (thanks, copyright). You can also narrow it down further by year of publication. I definitely recommended putting on the ""Free ebooks"" filter, though, to avoid frustration.

Does that sound too frustrating and hit-or-miss? Unfortunately it can be, especially at the beginning. But that's, well, historical research. And as you can imagine from /u/Jan_van_Bergen's post, Google is much more efficient than archival research! (Especially when your archives are across an ocean, hehe.) You get used to it--you learn the rhythms of what to search for (like how I had success with diary and not journal), what kinds of titles university digital archives give to their websites, how to tango with Google Books and archive.org.

Also, if you have a specific time period or geographic area in mind, it never hurts to ask someone who knows the source body for that area. Like, ""diaries"" as you're envisioning weren't really a genre in medieval Europe, but a medievalist could direct you to some sets of sources--more likely in print, but possibly online--that would let you access at least some of what you're looking for in that type of source.

Finally, if you'd be interested in eavesdropping on a letter collection rich in daily life and emotions details instead of requiring a journal specifically, might I direct you to my new obsession: Elisabeth-Charlotte von der Pfalz, Duchesse d'Orleans at the court of Louis XIV.

There are designated family areas which you're unlikely to hear most of the usual 'banter' and chanting. I mean this in no bad way but some of the crowd are tourists, might not know the chants, sat next to random regulars.

Depends on how the team are playing. like the last 15 minutes last night was dead because understandably the crowd were on edge about how we were playing. It also depends *Who* the team are playing. you'll get a better turnout for Liverpool than you will for Yeovil Town. In turn this affects what is sung and by who.

There's been suggestions for a couple of years now about introducing a standing area back to OT however this is not currently possible due to FA guidelines.

0,t5_2qh4j,cvkdru6,"&gt; In islam there are multiple schools of thought. One of them attaches importance to analogic reasoning as a source for sharia and something I, as a layman, translate as the necessity-exception in sharia. Another one will say there are no other sources then the hadiths and the u'ran.

Didn't know that, this is nice

&gt; A long time ago, before microscopes, the person who had discovered bacteria also had a tough time proving it. The non-falsifiable condition is too much. How do you falsify whether or not the Earth is round hundreds of years ago?

Then you must consider it as an hypothesis. The guy had only *hypothesized* the existence of bacteria, but it wasn't correct to assume they existed until we could observe it or prove their behavior in some *univocal* way. There are a lot of things that we suppose, but don't know if they are true, and we wait to see if what we imagined works or not, if it is true or not. It is the mechanics of the scientific method and it is the only thing that has helped us understand the world, ever. Nothing else had worked or helped us.

In comparison, how can we rule people with unfalsifiable things? With things that we just don't know if they are true, or that we can't prove their validity? We can try a new law to, say, reduce criminality, and if it doesn't work we can change it again. But with laws that have a religious origin? They are assumed to be right, even if they make no sense, even if they were made up by some man 3000 years ago, and somewhat today are believed to be from a ""god"". 

&gt; People do though. Muslims rejected the idea of a Trinity for example. They decided to go with strictly one god and his prophet. Also when it comes to haddith and sunna, scholars are needed to interpret it in light of new situations arising. Thus they are discussing what the sharia is, what the word of God would be.

I get this happens, but it still doesn't make sense to me. It is not different than discussing fairy tales or magic unicorns in my opinion (but we are deviating, a discussion on religion could be endless and wasn't the scope of my initial reply)

&gt; EU or ECHR? Because ECHR is competent for any breach of the European Convention (meaning: A LOT OF STUFF). Even if your parliament doesn't do anything about it because they feel it's not up to the ECHR, the ECHR can still fine Italy + the ECHR judgement (might even be setting a precedent) will have to be taken in account by Italian judges.

I think it was ECHR, here is a news about it http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33611955 I don't know how it will end, and if our prime minister will be able to do what he said he will. 

Organized religion (catholics) are still a big issue in Italy, they often try to bend our laws to their bible. We had crazy laws in the past years that are being adjusted only now (like artificial fecundation, we had a law that obliged women to have 3 embryos prepared, and all of them implanted (because they are all ""persons"" for christians), even if one of them could have been bad (with genetic problems) or even if it could be dangerous for the woman to have three babies inside of her).

Manifest Destiny was invoked, and trumpeted, and promoted to give Northeners some sense of benefit to it.

You see, without scientific agriculture, cotton wore out the land. It was perceived that cotton planters needed new lands to move to (buying new and selling old) that were below the Mason-Dixon Line and could become new slave territories and states. That was why so many moved to Texas and rebeled when their national gov't - Mexico - outlawed slavery. That was why many elements of the USA had been reluctant to admit the Republic of Texas to the Union.

So the Abolitionists, and the Free Soil Party, and others, were happy to minimize the amount of Mexico taken. They tried to keep it to areas with a strong white and European presence rather than taking on large swaths only inhabited by mostly native people. (The Free Soil Party wanted free *white* soil and one reason to keep out slavery was to keep out freedmen.)

0,t5_2ssp3,cvkfoob,"&gt; Also, why is there a desire to map ""Middle Ages"" onto other societies?

Medievalists have been growing more and more interested in the reality of the medieval *world*: we're exploring connections among societies that show you really can't understand the prototypical ""medieval Western Europe"" in isolation. First we shifted to a Mediterranean focus, looking at Europe-Islamic world. But very quickly, connections down to the empires of West Africa and east to India from there down to the Swahili coast are all very much in play. On the flip side, if we can't understand western Europe without understanding its connections, that should logically apply to other societies as well. Additionally, we have a rather firm endpoint of European *global* exploration/colonization, which drastically affects many world civilizations.

So if all this is ""medieval"", how do we talk about ""medieval Africa""? *Can* we talk about the medieval Americas (and Oceania, although that doesn't come up so often)?

&gt;  Doesn't this risk applying the historical construct of ""the Middle Ages"" that may be valid in a European context to other places where the generalizations of ""Middle Ages"" might not be applicable?

Well, yes. A lot of attempts to paint a ""medieval world"" have focused on political and religious history. It would be one thing to start from each individual society and then compare. The problem is, we're mostly coming from training as Europeanists, with even our *language* of scholarship and thus patterns of thought and recognition rooted in the European base. So these attempts at a broad global medieval narrative like KINGSHIP! can be seen as shaky and, I suppose, ""colonizing."" You can see why this is a problem.

But we're still left with the fact that civilizations rise, fluctuate and fall apparently in patterns--look to recent work on the impact of the Black Death across Eurasia for a hot area of scholarship on this right now. Scholars have been paying a lot more attention to the role of climate in those ebbs and flows. North America isn't really my specialty, but since I visited Mesa Verde as a kid, at least the popular narrative on the Anasazi has completely shifted from ""Why'd they disintegrate"" (actually, at the time it was ""vanish"", eeks) to looking at environmental patterns. We reconstruct *global* climate changes like the medieval warm period and subsequent little ice age--patterns that did affect every society, by their nature as global. It's providing a framework less rooted in our Europe-centric vocabularies and ways of conceiving the past.

Bei meinem vierten Besuch werde ich in eine Menschenkette gestellt, die Kartons mit Herrenoberbekleidung quer durch die Halle reicht, 30 Leute, die sich Karton für Karton in die Hände geben.

An diesem Tag, es ist ein Sonntag, fahren die Autos mit Spenden im Minutentakt vor, am Abend kapitulieren die Helfer glücklich: Die Annahme von neuen Spenden wird für vier Tage geschlossen, es ist wie eine Woche später an der österreichischen Grenze.

Einige der Leute um mich herum kommen nicht nur zum Sortieren, sie organisieren Ausflüge für Familien, fahren mit ihnen zum Grillen an die Elbe oder zum Fußball aufs Heiligengeistfeld, gründen Nähgruppen, machen mit den Flüchtlingen Behördengänge und helfen beim Übertritt in die evangelische Kirche.

Die Facebook-Gruppe der Helfer ist inzwischen auf über 18 000 gewachsen, bis zu tausend Freiwillige sind an manchen Tagen in der Halle. In München, in Dortmund, in Quakenbrück und anderswo ist es nicht anders. Die Helfer finden es lustig, dass ihnen unterstellt wird, im Willkommensrausch die Integrationsprobleme der Flüchtlinge zu ignorieren. Einige von ihnen arbeiten schon länger in Flüchtlingsgruppen. Ihre Hilfe, so glauben sie, ist die beste Voraussetzung dafür, dass sich die Fehler der bisherigen Integration nicht wiederholen, ""echte Patrioten geben Deutschkurse"".

Wenn sich die Fehler der Vergangenheit nicht wiederholen sollen, dann sollte man die Probleme, die 800 000 neue Asylbewerber aus anderen Kulturkreisen in die neue Heimat mitbringen, nicht den Besorgnisträgern des rechten Mainstreams überlassen. Das Wohnen, die Kindergärten, die Schulen, die Arbeit, die Justiz, die Verwaltung, die Krankenkassen, die öffentlichen Haushalte – überall werden die neuen Mitbürger Fragen aufwerfen, ohne dass die Antworten die Deutschen überfordern müssen. Es wird davon abhängen, wie offen die Probleme benannt werden und wie bereitwillig sich die Neubürger in unser Sozialmodell einfügen.

Den moralischen Kredit, den sich Angela Merkel und die Bundesregierung erarbeitet hatten, können sie nutzen, um all das zu tun, was nötig ist, um den weiteren Zustrom von Flüchtlingen so zu begrenzen, dass er die Gesellschaft, den Staat und die Freiwilligen nicht überfordert. Also zusammen mit dem UNHCR und den USA die Versorgungssituation in den Lagern rund um Syrien verbessern; mit der EU am südlichen Rand Europas Aufnahmelager einrichten, in denen die Asylberechtigung geprüft wird; den 28 Staaten der EU Aufnahmequoten abringen, die dem moralischen Anspruch Europas entsprechen; im Inneren dafür sorgen, dass abgelehnte Asylbewerber schneller in ihre Heimatländer zurückgeschickt werden; das Asylrecht so verändern, dass es die Verfolgten nicht in die Hände von Schleppern treibt; und endlich ein Einwanderungsgesetz beschließen, das die Interessen der Bundesrepublik mit den Wünschen der Zuwanderer in Einklang bringt.

""Zwischen den Kräften des Hergebrachten und denen des ständigen Fortbringens"", hatte der Dichter prophezeit, ""wird es Krieg geben"" – im Moment sieht es so aus, als tobe der vor allem in der CDU und CSU. Wie der ausgeht, davon hängt ab, ob auch Merkel sich in Deutschland noch heimisch fühlen wird.

In der Nähe der Messehallen versuchen die Helfer, die Flüchtlinge mit einem Fest aus der Routine des Wartens herauszuholen, es kommen vor allem jüngere Syrer und Afrikaner. Es wird ein Nachmittag der Erschöpften, die Flucht aus der Heimat ist keine Party, auch wenn manche Bahnhofsjubelbilder das vortäuschen. Vor den Flüchtlingen, die es nach Deutschland geschafft haben, liegen Monate, vielleicht Jahre der Eingewöhnung; vor den Helfern eine lange Strecke zäher Hilfe. Nach der Schließung der Grenze werden die Stimmen lauter, die beides für unrealistisch halten und das Land nicht nur ein paar Tage, sondern auf Dauer abschotten möchten.

""Ohne Zweifel leben wir mitten in einem historischen Wandlungsprozess"", schreibt Georg E. Moeller, einer der Wortführer der Helfer, auf Facebook, ""dessen Verlauf wir mitbestimmen, ob wir wollen oder nicht."" Es geht um das Menschenbild, dem jeder entsprechen will: Schaue ich nur zu, ""oder zeige ich einer hoffnungslos überforderten Obrigkeit, wie man der Würde, dem ersten Hauptwort im ersten Artikel unserer Verfassung, mit einfachsten Mitteln Geltung verschaffen kann"".

Mancher wird solche Leute für komische Romantiker halten, besonders jene denken so, an denen das gesellschaftliche Leben gleichgültig vorüberzieht; und ganz besonders jene, für die jede gesellschaftliche Veränderung nur im Schlimmsten enden kann und man sie deshalb warnend verhindern muss; und ganz besonders jene, für die jede Form von Altruismus nur die pathologische Sehnsucht nach Selbstbestätigung beweist.

In den Gesprächen mit den Helfern spürt man, dass es ihnen nicht nur darum geht, ein guter Mensch zu sein, es geht ihnen auch darum, was für ein Volk wir sein wollen. Nur ein weinerliches Volk, das sich ängstlich zusammenschließt vor den Zumutungen herumziehender Heimatloser? Nur ein fleißiges Volk, das sich – wie unsere Eltern und Großeltern – berauscht an Wirtschaftskraft und Exportrekorden? Nur ein ökologisches Volk, das den Müll trennt, die Natur schont und die Atomkraft verdammt?

Oder vielleicht ein sympathisches Völkchen, das aus der Vergangenheit gelernt hat, das fleißig ist, den Reichtum teilen kann und begriffen hat, dass der richtige Umgang mit Menschen noch wichtiger ist als der vernünftige Umgang mit der Natur.

Her sole objective is to stay in power, so she just reacts to a crisis in ways that hurt her power the least, thereby not caring one bit about the interests of Germany, Europe or even her own party. In the Greek crisis the German electorate at large was against handing Greece more loans so she tried to keep those down as much as she could and let her finance minister be even more radical than her, to in the end ""give in"" without losing her face before the electorate. 

Before that she was always a great defender of nuclear energy, but when the Fukushima melt-down happened and she was in danger of losing an election because of German attitudes against nuclear power, she made a 180 degree turn phasing out Germany's nuclear reactors. 

In the refugee and migration crisis it was the break-down of the Greek borders which was the challenge from the outside. The opening up of the Balkan route made it impossible to control the migrant stream, the more of them came she had to make a decision of how to approach this crisis. Because of PEGIDA as well as the Greek crisis her and Germany's image in the world was bad and because there was a movement emerging that was helping refugees she decided to declare the ""friendly German face"", this further allows her to stay in the political center and to keep the second biggest party, her coalition partner the Social Democrats down because this would have become their topic. 

So no, her policy isn't about compassion. It's calculated. But it's not calculated like you think to exploit third-worlders (as I wrote that would be much more profitable if they stayed in the third world) she is merely exploiting the provincial absurdities of German public discourse as well as the German state budget to stay afloat as a political leader.

0,t5_2su3h,cvkgch0,"Revolutionary mechanics could be terrifically fun. For ten years after a revolution the normal Estates are replaced by the various Jacobin Club branches and offshoots - or generic equivalents for other countries.

Certain modifiers and events only activate depending on which party has the highest influence. When a party gets the most influence it automatically rises to 20+ above other parties, to prevent continuous swapping. War exhaustion and low manpower increase influence gains for other parties.

* Feuillants as moderate revolutionaries - automatically gain loyalty in a constitutional monarchy. Nice tax and trade bonuses, relatively low revolt risk. Downside is a bunch of events forcing you to choose variously between losing legitimacy or stability, or gain influence for other parties. Feuillants can play it quiet and cling to power for 10 years, but they'll be weakened by it. If these guys have low loyalty (are out of power) you get a big risk of pro-monarch and religious uprisings.

* Girondists as the moderate branch of the radical Jacobin Club. Free CBs to spread the revolution to other countries, but instability and revolt risk if you don't use them. Reduced Papal influence. Events that see what sacrifices, if any, you are willing to make to preserve the monarchy - at this stage you're choosing between a constitutional monarchy and a revolutionary republic. More events giving Montagnards influence, especially if war exhaustion or instability are high.

    No negatives for low loyalty - but keep them happy and they can counteract revolt risk for low loyalty Montagnards. Creates an incentive to keep them happy all the time - but be careful not to accidentally give them power with the influence boosts that accompany loyalty gains.

* Montagnards basically have the country exploding underneath them. Putting them in power will create a Revolutionary Republic automatically, so you can expect massive rebellions from low-loyalty Feuillants. Big religious unrest - 'dechristianisation' isn't terribly popular. To gain influence with Montagnards you can reduce development in the countryside, to represent the raids and requisitioning that was going on.

    So what's the upside? You get *enormous* manpower, land maintainence, and production boosts, to represent the levee en masse, requisitioning of supplies and the advent of total war. You still have the revolutionary CBs you get under the Girondists. You will have an enormously powerful military, but your country will be literally collapsing under the weight of stability losses and revolt risk around you.

The idea is to create a much more dynamic and interesting version of the Mandate of Heaven - without being crippling or dependent on MP. 

* Feuillants can survive the 10 year revolutionary period by clinging to power, accepting rising revolt risk and falling legitimacy. They can mitigate some of the revolt risks by raising Girondist loyalty, but play it too close and you could accidentally give the Girondists power too. If you end up on the receiving end of a bad war, internal pressure will most likely give power to Girondists.

* Girondists have to maintain a balancing act between Feuillants and the radical Montagnards. Execute or keep the king? Go to war with other states, preventing stability hits by growing AE, but don't overstretch.

* Under the Montagnards - the radicals - the country will be exploding under you from the get-go - but you will also be absurdly powerful. Fight large coalitions and spread the revolution across Europe.

0,t5_2qh1e,cvkhd27,"Wow after actually watching this video. I realize it's not the commentators on the show that are stupid. It's the redditors and other idiots lambasting them, they're doing brilliant okay not brilliant but objectively good satire, so good they convinced the idiots currently fuming they were serious. They're playing a caricature of the average american mindset perfectly, take note at 3:03 the caitlyn jenner comment which describes perfectly the mentality of mainstream america. She is right we do not and i repeat do not give a single fuck about mars, that's a fact, caitlyn jenner, the kardashians are bigger news than any discovery we will find on mars because that's who we pay attention to, that's who we spend days of our lives watching them on tv, even if it's not the kardashians i'm sure theirs something idiotic you do or watch. 

You don't believe me? go walk up to anyone, right now, find someone on the street a random passerby and ask them what do they think about the european space agency landing on a comet a few months back, tell me how many have any idea what you're referring, tell me how many even knew that Europe had their own space agency and tell me how many who did know only because they were pissed off about the ""infamous"" shirt?

This is not just Americans but any culture that worships social media, reality tv and all the garbage in popular culture. More Americans can give you a detailed breakdown of why khloe and lamar broke up than they could of anything related to the mars mission, isis or any current political events. Do you know how many times i have gone unto fb, yahoo or any number of sites and seen people bitching about why head to mars? using that bullshit belief we should ""fix"" earth first, like somehow staying on a planet with a constant tendency to fire missiles and bullets at each other is going to be magically fixed if we stay the course. Who consider nasa and science in general a bad investment but don't question the money their churches spend on a new building, private cars or some pointless b.s charity that does not even go to the actual people they claim to help, don't question the money the government waste on the military it's unbelievable yet it happens every single day, we want to know more about our politicians sex lives than about trade deals, we want to know if hillary can do the nae nae not how she can effectively deal with Russian involvement in the middle-east or her views concerning if the iran deal in the long term is beneficial.

0,t5_2qh1i,cvkhfvt,"&gt; Heroes. I know it's a knockoff of Xmen

People are going to flame me to hell and back, but the reason why Heroes failed so spectacularly is that Tim Kring is a hack. What he does is create a show based on the premise of a movie he thought was cool (Heroes=X Men, Touch=Knowing) without really understanding what made it cool or having the creative ability to expand on it. He then relies on a convenient writing crutch to keep the series afloat. 

People will say, ""How can you say that about Kring? Heroes started out so strong. Clearly he has some talent."" Of course it started out strongly, because the entire first season was just a pastiche of other comic book stories that he and the other writers were obviously cribbing off of. When they ran out of source material, the show floundered.

For example, if I remember correctly, there was a s/l where there was the threat of the cop's brother threatening to blow up NYC. That was the plot of Akira. There were other plot points throughout season one that were also cribbed. That was season one of Heroes, cobbled together plots and characters from other stories without any cohesive vision or game plan. Audiences thought, ""Oh, this is all clearly building up to something, going somewhere,"" but it never was.

With Touch, Kring relied on another crutch, and that was to make every single episode follow the ""serendipity"" gimmick of the pilot. Third Worlder character, American character, and European character each have a s/l that seems unrelated. Then their storylines intertwine at the end of the episode, with Jake uttering some pseudo-intellectual babble about how we're all connected and blah blah blah. Like Heroes, Touch started off strong, but Kring, being what he is, couldn't keep up the momentum so that by the end of the first season, the show was not only a parody of itself but contrived.",AskReddit,1443709165,,t3_3n35j8,hipechik,1443708560,0,t1_cvkgn8b,,4,,4,1446706523

Really? I find most of them are quite hard working people. Sure some are on benefits, but can you think of a group for whom that isn't true? Pretty sure there's a lot of people voting UKIP that are on the dole as well.

&gt;according to this video, chasing ethnic groups they don't agree with

The video says that the people who are responsible for making jews feel unwelcome in Malmø, and to some extent Sweden, are muslim. It doesn't say that ""the muslims"" are driving out ""the jews"" or anything like that. You can be angry with these fuckheads all you want, in fact I am too. But I'm smart enough to not say: Well this is a problem that we can blame all the muslims for as a group. Shia, Sunni, Wahhabi, whatever. Iraqi, Persian, Syrian, Kurdish, Somalian, whatever.  Highly educated professors, store owners, low life street thugs - doesn't matter. All guilty. They're all responsible for what you see in this video. Nuance is for pussies!

&gt;The crime rate in Germany and Sweden has SOARED since migrants were admitted into the country. 

A feature of population growth of any kind. Especially when there are few jobs around, as is the case in many places in Europe. I definitely think the levels of immigration are untenable as they are, but I'd be wary of blaming it on the specific ethnic groups in question. If you want to blame someone, how about you look to the people who crashed the world economy, and destabilized third world countries, creating these problems and radicalizing people in the first place. Most of these migrants just want a better life, but the problem is that we don't have enough resources to handle all of them.

Historically, taking in immigrants has been a great economic sucess. Not immediately, but given some time to stabilize itself, it's actually been great for economies to get more people.

To see them collectively as shiftless, lazy, and lacking in resource and moral fiber is just plain stupid. It's not based in fact. If someone can make their way from some shitty third world country and get all the way up to scandinavia, then I'd argue they're very resourceful, and I don't think they're going to risk life and limb just to go on the dole. They want to work, and almost everyone does.

Now, you're right that unemployment numbers are higher for them, but that's because integration tends to take a little bit of time. Being processed by the systems, finding a place to live, learning the language and getting to grips with things. It doesn't normally take very long though. It's also very common for people around the world to have a home life where a husband works and brings home money, and the wife tends the home and cooks and cleans and raises the kids. A fairly traditional, old fashioned model of doing things, compared to what's become the new normal in the past four or five decades in Europe, where both the husband and wife work full time jobs.

It doesn't mean they're receiving unemployment benefits necessarily. It might just mean they can manage on one income, instead of two, like most people do.

As for crime rates soaring, that's a function of population density. But is exarcerbated when someone doesn't know the language or feel they don't fit in, or somehow think being a crook is cool.

Of course, white collar crimes and war crimes tend not to be listed on the crime stats, ditto for incest rape and date rape, so the crimes that make it onto the statistics of course look favorably for the wolf of wall street type criminals, or the overly friendly touchy uncle that intimidate a toddler not to talk. Statistics can give an indicator of problems, but they tend not to show the entire picture.

racist: That's because Asians are smart and African Americans are just dumb and violence prone trash

non-racist: any intelligent discussion that breaks down the reasons behind the difference using anything but prejudice/hate/anger. You may indeed end up finding out that one group is smarter than other and it's O.K. as long as your findings are based on solid evidence, not bigotry.

The Entire Himalayan belt from Ladakh to Arunachal is fragile and ecologically sensitive.  


And the Govt doesn't really restrict access to majority of places (barring Military zones).  Uttarakhand floods shows tourism advisories are not followed in reality.


Desolate Areas are not by default Non-Fragile. 
Journey route to Mansarovar in Tibet is mostly desolate region, yet the damage is still being done by the travelers even when they are sent in such few numbers.  

India can send like 10 million+ people to these places comfortably and given the rise in disposable income in rest of country this is very real future situation and its very dangerous.  

Himalayas is not Europe. Tourism is NOT the primary objective for this region.  

I have always felt the tourist rates should be hiked by 10-50 times the current for people from plains wanting to enter these Himalayan states. 


Kill multiple birds with 1 stone. Get revenue, control flow of people, prevent unnecessary damage to region and low numbers are also easily manageable for things like proper high quality services for all(locals as well since tourist hot beds often end up catering to tourist needs more than locals). 

Low tourist numbers are also easier to educate on Tourist etiquette. China has a policy where they can black list people from traveling abroad if they are found to indulge in bad tourist practices(there are clear guidelines setup, like the Do's and Don't expected of Travelers). 

Indians need to be prepared from an early age in this regard, its really hard to educate a populace on this when the numbers will be 100 Million travelers in 2 decades or so as China is finding out now.  

Just because one has a few days off from office(or free time) shouldn't mean they can hire a taxi and reach Spiti. This is how Mt Everest got its mess as well. Westerners paying Lakhs, Crores to Sherpas to haul their asses to the top(One Chinese women even hired a Helicopter to land her around top base camps or top). This is a modern malaise in the tourism industry. It might work in other places but Himalayas are not like other places, not even close. Impact on it affects Billions of lives 1000's of Km's away.

I disagree - it will take a few decades but they will care eventually.  And Europeans do not currently have anything to do with overpopulation, but we need to keep it that way and not incentivize them having kids like this video suggests.  

&gt;""Jeez, I better not contribute to the problem!"". No other people think this way. 

I know people in the US that think like that, though you might say many in the US are kind of Europeans since most are from there historically. 

Overall I agree with what you say, but what is to be done?  Clearly we want the people who are having lots of kids to stop doing so, but how can we achieve that?  If we help them with food, medicine, etc. we are (at least in the short term) enabling them to have even more kids, which is bad.  But if we don't help, they will likely stay poor and uneducated for a long time, which is bad because those are the main reasons people have lots of kids.

We are a country so heavily divided on every issue that there will never be a consensus on a federal level to abolish the death penalty. Therefore, IMO, it will always be a state issue and we'll always have states that will have it because a certain portion of the US population see it as a viable means for punishment for certain violations of the law.

So, since you think that we should just incarcerate people for the remainder of their lives leaving them to die behind bars of old age, health issues, etc. Then would you be in favor of the death penalty if it were cheaper and the legal costs were comparable to that of a non-death penalty case? The cost of an actual execution is about $100K where incarceration takes $40-45K annually. So, for the price of two years behind bars we can execute someone that we will let live until they die of old age that may be 30+ years off. Extrapolating that out, an execution would be ~$100K if done without the endless appeals and if we incarcerate them for 30 years it would be ~$1.2 million. If there were essentially a 'fast lane' to carry out an execution (say we have the trial with the potential for one appeal as with most criminal cases in the US), would you be in favor of it since you keep pointing to cost as a reason to not execute?

Operating an Airbus 321 on transatlantic flights is not a common (albeit not dangerous) practice due to razor thin margins required with operating those aircraft with the proper ETOPS certification and additional fuel which will mean that they will be significantly weight restricted, even at the best of times (i.e. ideal temperatures, etc). They are going head-to-head with Icelandic for service on the KEF to YUL/YYZ route. The YYZ-Europe segment is heavily populated with competition from the likes of Air Canada to Austian and Swiss and everyone in between. Those airlines can run aircraft at less capacity due to cargo in the stowage that is a significant revenue generator and can fly at 60-70% capacity without impacting the operation vitality of that route. 

For small, low-cost airlines like Wow, they need low cost centers to run effectively and Canada isn't one of those places. With high costs, it means they'll have razor thin financial viability and the service will probably be discontinued in favour of US routes with better operating potential, such as Boston and New York.

I want at this point make it clear that I am not making a case for ephobioali-whatever here, but...

I find it a *little* off-colour to describe lower European age of consent as 'legally raping' kids. Many EU countries have different sentiments about what is the legal age of consent, drinking and what-not and though you may disagree I would find it at least *considerate* if you did not describe our norms as 'rape'. I imagine you would not say drinking at age 18 in many EU countries is 'legal youth alcoholism'.

I've often seen reactionary arguments claim that colonialism worked out for native populations. These arguments typically cite Africa, the middle east, or city states like Singapore and Hong Kong as examples, but never have I seen an argument that discusses India.

Tharoor specifically claims that colonialism ruined India, where right before colonization, the region's GDP was ~23% of the world's share, but was a meager ~4% at the end of it. If the claims I've seen are to be believed, Akbar's Moghul empire had a GDP greater than that of Europe, but this was around the time of the Renaissance, before European exploration and before the industrial revolution.

Tharoor however claims that India powered Britain's industrial revolution. That it was specifically through policy, rather than laissez faire that the Indian textile industry was destroyed (including some gory incidents), that British goods were dumped in the Indian market while Indian manufactured goods were taxed, that it was specifically through things like taxation that the economy was depleted, etc. 

He also claims in one of the videos, (paraphrasing) that the existing socio-economic structure of India was undermined, that it's traditional legal system was systemically destroyed and replaced, again through policy, etc.

These aspects specifically counter the generalized argument that colonialism aided the colonized more than it did harm. If there were any counters to Tharoor, I'd be glad to see those. That's my only intention of posting here.

European top players:

Has to do with the percentage of players playing CS and not other games. Same as with Basketball, it's bigger than COD and similar (USA) in Europe and bigger than Starcraft/Fighting games (Asia). So first you have more population and therefore more high potential players, also more competition and bigger competition also leads to a higher skill level.

If there's an objective difference I could put 2 reasons up: 1) Internet video streams aren't as steady as the real thing and different elements (encoder, streaming platform, decoding process) might be guilty of speeding things up/down depending on (broadly said) bandwidth of the channel.

0,t5_2qhlh,cvko4a7,"&gt;So the Egyptians, Chinese, and Islamic people did nothing?

I didn't say that. I said they're all trying to adopt the globalist culture that was created by European peoples. Part of the reason for that is their link to Europe via colonial imperialism, and European culture was forced onto some of them. Some just saw it as attractive, some saw money in it, some felt it was superior, etc. But they certainly had their own cultures that were developed in totally different ways. Some of those cultures were stunted, however, due to colonial imperialism and the introduction of foreign cultures. It's hard to say how they would have developed if left alone, but it's clear that whatever they would have become, it would have been something that those people could naturally fit in with, obviously.

&gt;""Americans in particular made the post-WWII world"" not sure how they change British people drastically from the way we would have been without them.

In the late 40's and 50's, the US economy was completely dominant and the US had direct influence in most of the world. British people were already very similar to Americans, for obvious reasons, so the change was not as stark. 

&gt;I was explaining what I said, which you didn't seem to understand.

No, I understood it. What about ""That has nothing to do with what I said."" don't you get?

&gt;Various things but I don't know anyone who I would judge differently if I found out they were muslim.

You're missing the point entirely. I'm not talking about your average Muslim in *western* countries. They are *far* from the average. I'm talking about the average Muslim in *Muslim* countries, in particular the Middle East and Magreb. They live in a way that is quite foreign to European culture, and you would probably know that they're a Muslim before you even talk to them.

&gt;You know about Paganism and Norse Gods?

Yes, and I know that that has nothing to do with this discussion. Stop trying to make false equivalencies. This is not about religion, it's about culture. It just happens that one of these cultures is centered on religion (Muslim culture). There's nothing inherently wrong with that, just that you cannot separate that religion from the culture.

&gt; Islam is an Abrahamic religion it's not a million miles away from Christianity

Just because they're related doesn't mean they're at all the same, or even similar. Again, this is not a matter of religion, it's a matter of how religion affects culture.

0,t5_2si92,cvkptv2,"In addition to the approximately 100 million speakers in Europe, German is spoken overseas as a first language by 8-9 million people. Some notable overseas countries where German is spoken include (note that all of these numbers refer to native speakers): 

• Argentina: 600,000 speakers (400,000 Standard German and 200,000 Yiddish)

• Bolivia: 220,000 speakers (160,000 Standard German and 60,000 Low German)

• Brazil: 4.5 million speakers (1.5 million speak Standard German and 3 million speak Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, a unique Brazilian German dialect)

• Canada: 548,200 speakers (430,000 Standard German; 80,000 Low German; 15,000 Pennsylvania Dutch; 23,200 Hutterite German). In the Canadian province of Manitoba, German is the mother tongue for 6% of the population; this outnumbers French, which is the mother tongue for 4% (English is the native language for 75%). Also, as an aside, I find Manitoba interesting because the Aboriginal population makes up 17% of the population, which is pretty large as far as things go. 

• Israel: 415,000 speakers (200,000 Standard German and 215,000 Yiddish)

• Kazakhstan: 228,000 speakers (178,000 Standard German and 50,000 Low German)

• Paraguay: 206,000 speakers (166,000 Standard German and 40,000 Low German)

• Russia: 394,138 speakers of Standard German

• United States: 1,295,154 speakers (1,104,154 Standard German; 150,000 Yiddish; 12,000 Low German; 133,000 Pennsylvania Dutch; 10,800 Hutterite German). Of note, “Pennsylvania ‘Dutch’” is not Dutch, but rather a corruption on “Pennsylvania Deutsch”. It is, by far, the most famous German dialect in the United States. It is spoken by the Amish people. 

• Others: German is also spoken in lower in numbers in Australia (79,000), Belize (6,900), Chile (35,000), Mexico (40,000), Namibia (22,500), New Zealand (36,000), South Africa (12,000), and Uruguay (30,000). 

German used to have a much bigger presence in North America than it does now. People of German descent are the largest ethnic group in the US and for a long time German was a prominent second language in the US after English. Also, in Canada we used to have a city called Berlin where Germans predominated but they changed the name to Kitchener when WWI broke out. WWI and WWII ruined German in North America (though Kitchener still celebrates Oktoberfest). 

Dutch has a smaller presence worldwide than German despite the Dutch having a larger colonial empire. The Dutch didn’t push the Dutch language nearly as much as other colonizers; thus, in place like Indonesia very few people can speak Dutch (though fair number of Indonesian words are taken from Dutch). Outside Europe, there are 200,000 Dutch speakers in Suriname, 20,900 in the Caribbean Netherlands, 11,400 in Curacao, 5,290 in Aruba, and 2,000 in Sint Maarten. 

The biggest legacy of the Dutch language worldwide is undoubtedly the daughter language Afrikaans. It is the third language of South Africa in terms of native speakers (~13.5%) of whom 53 percent are Coloureds and 42.4 percent Whites. In 1996, 40 percent of South Africans reported to know Afrikaans at least at a very basic level of communication. It is the lingua franca in Namibia, where it is spoken natively in 11 percent of households. In total, Afrikaans is the first language in South Africa alone of about 6.8 million people and is estimated to be a second language for at least 10 million people worldwide, compared to over 23 million and 5 million respectively, for Dutch.

0,t5_2w5yw,cvkpypo,"&gt; [You know well enough that we are exploiters. You know too that we have laid hands on first the gold and metals, then the petroleum of the ‘new continents’, and that we have brought them back to the old countries. This was not without excellent results, as witness our palaces, our cathedrals and our great industrial cities; and then when there was the threat of a slump, the colonial markets were there to soften the blow or to divert it. Crammed with riches, Europe accorded the human status de jure to its inhabitants. With us, to be a man is to be an accomplice of colonialism, since all of us without exception have profited by colonial exploitation. This fat, pale continent ends by falling into what Fanon rightly calls narcissism. Cocteau became irritated with Paris — ‘that city which talks about itself the whole time’. Is Europe any different? And that super-European monstrosity, North America? Chatter, chatter: liberty, equality, fraternity, love, honour, patriotism and what have you. All this did not prevent us from making anti-racial speeches about dirty niggers, dirty Jews and dirty Arabs. High-minded people, liberal or just soft-hearted, protest that they were shocked by such inconsistency; but they were either mistaken or dishonest, for with us there is nothing more consistent than a racist humanism since the European has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters. While there was a native population somewhere this imposture was not shown up; in the notion of the human race we found an abstract assumption of universality which served as cover for the most realistic practices. On the other side of the ocean there was a race of less-than-humans who, thanks to us, might reach our status a thousand years hence, perhaps; in short, we mistook the elite for the genus. Today, the native populations reveal their true nature, and at the same time our exclusive ‘club’ reveals its weakness — that it’s neither more nor less than a minority. Worse than that: since the others become men in name against us, it seems that we are the enemies of mankind; the élite shows itself in its true colours — it is nothing more than a gang. Our precious sets of values begin to moult; on closer scrutiny you won’t see one that isn’t stained with blood. If you are looking for an example, remember these fine words: ‘How generous France is!’ Us, generous? What about Sétif, then? And those eight years of ferocious war which have cost the lives of over a million Algerians? And the tortures?](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1961/preface.htm)

&gt; [But let it be understood that nobody reproaches us with having been false to such-and-such a mission — for the very good reason that we had no mission at all. It is generosity itself that’s in question; this fine melodious word has only one meaning: the granting of a statutory charter. For the folk across the water, new men, freed men, no one has the power nor the right to give anything to anybody; for each of them has every right, and the right to everything. And when one day our human kind becomes full-grown, it will not define itself as the sum total of the whole world’s inhabitants, but as the infinite unity of their mutual needs. Here I stop; you will have no trouble in finishing the job; all you have to do is to look our aristocratic virtues straight in the face, for the first and last time. They are cracking up; how could they survive the aristocracy of underlings who brought them into being? A few years ago, a bourgeois colonialist commentator found only this to say in defence of the West: ‘We aren’t angels. But we, at least, feel some remorse.’ What a confession! Formerly our continent was buoyed up by other means: the Parthenon, Chartres, the Rights of Man or the swastika. Now we know what these are worth; and the only chance of our being saved from, shipwreck is the very Christian sentiment of guilt. You can see it’s the end; Europe is springing leaks everywhere. What then has happened? It simply is that in the past we made history and now it is being made of us. The ratio of forces has been inverted; decolonization has begun; all that our hired soldiers can do is to delay its completion.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1961/preface.htm)",FULLCOMMUNISM,False,lenin,t3_3n3avm,jufnitz,1443721267,0,t1_cvke82x,,8,A Disorderly Infant,8,1446710604

But German is a nationality and has no bearing on the race of a person. German American is analogous to Zimbabwean American in that regard--it specifically indicates a country that the person is/was a citizen of--but not to African American. 

African/Caucasian/Asian are used to designate the race of a person. You are technically right that someone could use these words to identify their place of habitation but that's rare. How many people in the US seriously identify themselves as North American? The exception I suppose would be Europe as I've seen lots of people on Reddit refer to the whole continent as their home, probably a function of how easy it is to travel amongst its different countries. But to say that African American is intended to designate someone's country of origin is just patently false. The only time you hear anyone doing that is specifically in discussions like the one we're having where pedants love to bring up white South Africans moving to America and calling themselves African American while conveniently ignoring that 99.99% of people identifying as African American are not in that circumstance.

Both he and the horse were injured at Waterloo, but survived. 

That's not the end of the story, though: after the battle, the horse stayed in what is now Belgium, and so it fell into the hands of revolutionaries when the Belgian revolt broke out in 1830. The new government went on to sell the horse along with the rest of the former royals' possessions. 

The revolutionaries planned to have the horse pull the garbage cart, but it was saved by Orangist Belgians who bought the horse and eventually returned it to the Netherlands, where it lived to the ripe old age of 38 years.

After Wexy's death, King William II had its body stuffed and preserved and displayed at various of his residences, including his beloved Gothic Hall in the Hague. 

This process of stuffing and mounting well-loved horses wasn't unknown among European aristocracy, though obviously it was too expensive for common people to practice. 

Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the relations between the average cavalryman and his horse, and I would be very interested to see someone offer a more general account, but I thought this anecdote would be interesting and entertaining anyway.

That is not a fact, that is a viewpoint. There is no objective 'reason' for anything, there are only processes and descriptions thereof. You can personally have the ideology that sex is for procreation but I do not. Even if you want to misinterpret evolutionary principles to state that procreation is a species' purpose, then there is nothing that forces humanity to adhere to these principles.

Besides, you already worry about economic survivability of teen mothers. Is that, too, a sole fact of evolution? When humanity's DNA strains were wrought over millennia, did it incorporate a set of genes that determined that so-and-so an age is 'too young' to be economically viable mothers? You want to tamper with human life so that women do not have children young, I want to tamper with human life so that the joys of sex are open in an as safe way as possible to younger people.

And I agree with your worries. But the age of consent in my view is a tool to remove abusive power relationships between adults and minors. It does not, and cannot, serve as a tool to prevent minors from having sex. Which they do, at great length. And, in many European countries, thanks to the standards of sex education, far safer than some USA states which have higher ages of consent.

Peace...after ending my parents' [15 year post-divorce war](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1qs5s2/narcissism_plus_divorce_time_for_a_15_year_war/) by becoming financially independent I finally got it (then almost simultaneously got hit with the PTSD symptoms but hey I lost 60lbs in 9 months). I worked full time for that, bullshitting papers and mastering the art of turning things in late. After fall of 2011 in which I'd been staying in my own apartment, paying all the bills, and made president's list, it was over.

I wasn't taking their money so there was nothing they could say to me and thus I more or less fell off on N-mom's map, settling into a status ""GC in absentia"" while our half-sister became the object of mother's attention (softball...ugh). The pressure to become something big was intense in high school, but once I made it clear that it wasn't going to happen the prodding stopped (N-maternal grandmother, on the other hand, never ceases to nag me about it.). As it happened, N-stepfather's period of financial success came to an end, they lost pretty much everything, and are now all but certainly in the process of getting a divorce (sucks to be my 16 year old half-sister...N-mom's insane and stepfather is a lying sleazeball, very N himself). Kind of hard to criticize my choices when they owe me money.

Our dad never had much in the way of expectations of my sister and I other than wanting us to earn honest livings, stay out of jail/prison, and preferably avoid addiction to hard drugs (In his family, this is success.). He's not an N even if he was a fairly neglectful alcoholic and as time has gone on (i.e. in his late/mid 40s) the FLEAS from his own RBN experiences and the awful divorce have began to dissipate. We have difficulties and differences but we're human and try to get over what we can and accept what we can't. 

Funny enough, stepmother and I were talking a bit while I was in CA and she was lamenting her own difficulties in finding good employment in spite of an impressive if less than conventional resume (small business ownership alongside a bunch of spiritual hippy stuff) and mentioned some things she wished she'd done for me while I was a student. Dad's a believer in self reliance and I share that, harboring no complaints in that regard, but she replied that as the only parental figure who'd actually been to college and had some understanding of the business world that she should've done more. 

I made it to and got through university (state school, full scholarship) with a mix of being intelligent and RBN life being bad enough that I read a lot to escape whenever possible. I wound up with a history degree because I'd grown up living vicariously through the experiences of people who'd been through worse things, specializing in European/American military history and the history of the former Soviet Union. Abe Lincoln's son (Robert Todd Lincoln) would've claimed to have an N-mom, while some famous RBNs in Russian history did not survive, thinking of the sons of Peter the Great (executed on father's orders), Ivan the Terrible (beaten to death by Ivan), and Joseph Stalin (Stalin is said to have remarked upon a failed suicide attempt by his son Jakov that he couldn't even shoot straight. Jakov died in a German POW camp during WWII, a Jr. Lieutenant in the Red Army.).

I double majored in economics because it was mostly easy and I had the extra credit hours, but didn't do any internships, societies, networking or the like because I was busy working full time. This was not conducive to quick post-grad success as one might imagine, but on the bright side I came out debt free so I'm more or less able to do whatever I want and can take this point in time to try and figure things out. Delivering pizza has it's downsides (dead end and dangerous), but it's more than adequate to pay my bills and I have absolute job security so it'll work for now.

0,t5_2qh4j,cvkrssn,"On the whole, that is one of the parts of the Canadian system I like.  Once you take your citizenship oath you are Canadian, basically no one will question that.  I think that is partially due to the fact that Canada is a very young country without a lot of regional history as a unified group.  However, I think that is also part of the problem with groups not integrated. If you can stay exactly the way you were before except now you have a piece of paper that says you are Canadian, what is the point?  Are you really an integrated part of society?

Spain on the other hand has a very long history and a much deeper regional culture.  The idea of culture being tied to nationality is a much stronger concept in Europe.  If I were to come to Spain, never learn spanish, never participate in any spanish cultural events, only hang out with people from Canada, etc. would you really consider me to be Spanish even if I had citizenship?  I probably wouldn't.  That doesn't mean abandoning everything about me that is tied to Canada, but I would expect myself to learn Spanish, make Spanish friends, integrate and participate in my community, celebrate at least some Spanish traditions and learn Spanish history, integrate Spanish food into my diet, etc. - if this is not the case all you are doing is creating ethnic enclaves and ghettos with different cultures side by side.  That's not healthy for the long-term stability of a country.

Why is it when we find new groups of cultures in the Amazon rainforest or an isolated island, we say that we have to protect their culture, prevent outside influence, let them evolve on their own, but when it comes to Europe, and North America, multiculturalism is the way to go and we have to be tolerant of the immigrants and their different ways of doing things with no expectations for some level of assimilation to the local culture which has existed and evolved for hundreds of years?

If my family was Spanish, and had been Spanish for 20 generations, and my life and history is deeply embedded with the local culture, my family has fought in Spanish wars for hundreds of years, built up the community and culture around me etc... and then someone comes, gets citizenship, doesn't participate in the community, lives separately, has a completely different culture, and calls themselves Spanish?  That doesn't make sense to me.

To me there is a difference between being a citizen, which is a legal concept, and being an active and engaged, and integrated member of the local society and culture.

In Spain this is an active topic of discussion. I'll hazard to guess in most of Europe it is. Its only in North America where 'preserving culture' is only spoken about from the extreme right. We have institutions to preserve language (4 in Spain alone), to promote culture (a ministry of culture) and so forth. And we argue about what aspects of our history we want to keep, which to honor as legacy and which to ignore, particularity involving the dictatorship and the church.

I will say   NASA is not the only space going concern and  both parties suffer from the same malaise. In some respects the cultural shifts are much worse in Europe.

Also a Mars mission is so expensive  , probably 450-500  billion  € with low corruption I don't think anyone in the EU  has that kind of money lying around. 

Getting a coalition to nations to do this big a project would be difficult, Its hard to keep member nations from reliving old antipathies or say solving refugees problems by pushing them on another country. Big projects require big cooperation or a single unified polity

Money wise between  welfare state costs, the massive refugee influx and other expenses, possibly including the need for some member states to rearm vs Russian expansion (because of US decline) the money really isn't there

Also the ROI is terrible in the short to medium term,  and has a very low return on  € invested. Very low in terms of gains, 

Long term we could get amazing results fro all humanity  but getting society shifted to that is not that simple, 

as an example the US that put a man on the moon is very different to the modern US , economy, education, culture, demography. Everything. 

I'm not saying you have magically roll back to 1969, you can't  do that anyway but the peculiar mix of surplus wealth and risk taking are not going to be easy to create. It was a younger, richer (in terms of GINI coefficient by far) better educated, smarter country that did the moon landing

if you can get those qualities , we can do Mars but until we are rich enough to pay for a civilization costs (something at least Europe is doing or trying to) with a big surplus  and adventurous  and driven enough its impossible.

La fel cum în al doilea și al treilea episod depresiv, au funcționat alte metode. Fiecare om e diferit și fiecare depresie e diferită. Caută un psihoterapeut bun (îți propun să începi pe cognitiv-temperamentală, dacă ai nevoie de altceva, îți va spune terapeutul), du-te la terapeut și lucrează la tine.

Since Christians were not allowed to lend money to Christians, and Jews were not allowed to have other jobs it fell on them. Not because jews are inherently greedy.

Your poor reading comprehension is astounding.  I didn't say that Jews are greedy.  I said that it was the perception.  The person I responded to asked why people dislike Jews. I stated the perceptions that people have.  Many people dislike Jews because they perceive them as greedy for many reasons.  It obviously doesn't represent them as a people, but it's one of the reasons, true or not.

The close friendship between the two is strongly emphasized in their hagiographies and traditions, making them one of the most famous examples of paired saints; scholar John Boswell considers them to be the most influential set of such an archetype, more so than even Saints Peter and Paul. In his Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe, Boswell further argues that Sergius and Bacchus's relationship can be understood as having a romantic dimension, noting that the oldest text of their martyrology describes them as *erastai*, which can be translated as ""lovers"".

Next, you know what's funny? The vast majority of Western capitalism defenders consider China a capitalist, market economy when referring to its growth, but call it a socialistic-communistic-stalinist regime of terror when its economy does bad in some way. The truth is that it's a mixed market economy with a LOT of regulation by the state; around one third of business is made by state-owned companies ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise#China.2C_People.27s_Republic_of ), and the vast majority of the banking system is controlled by the state ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China#Financial_and_banking_system ).

As for your country, the USA, you *should* know that the biggest economic growth *for middle and working classes* was made during the Cold War, when the taxes on the banking system, the big companies and millionaires' income was large - and they didn't complain because not doing so may mean to lose the Cold War. During that period, USA had a regulated market system, leaning towards social democracy. It also got ahead of Europe because of the massive destruction of resources and loss of lives caused by two World Wars. All that ended during the Reagan's and Clinton's eras, when the Cold War seemed secure and they progressively dismantled several regulations on banks and corporations.

And, when you get in the EU, you enter a dangerous territory of debating, since you have apparently only read propaganda and I happen to live there. The construction and expansion of the EU started when Germany, France and Italy had thriving social democracies, with increasing guarantees of right to education, healthcare, pensions and other stuff. The peripheral, southern countries benefited at first, since they could afford the same rights through bubbles and German loans, while they didn't invest in high added value companies (whether they were state or individual owned) since the German state, in defense of their own corporations, pressured them to not to, under the risk of not joining the EU and receiving higher funding. The problems the EU is facing come from making a common currency among countries with vastly different economies: different capital, different efficiency, different fiscal policies, and no serious planning to develop the peripheral countries' economies, which has resulted in these ones having a terribly negative balance with Germany, whose international companies have benefited the most from all of this.

0,t5_2qh1i,cvkvee1,"I know, it's really sad, isn't it? I am genuinely scared of these things too. Nevertheless, I still do them (because I'm like that). I'm a night person, for example, so I ride my bike at night (I figure men on the street can't get on me on my bike, and men in cars, short of actually hitting me on the road, can't either, not without stopping and getting out of their cars, at which point I could just ride away; that doesn't take into account guns, but I think that's kind of extreme, like running someone over in order to rape them; most men look for easy pickings, which I try not to be anymore). One thing I used to love which I have completely given up is going to bars and clubs, and *definitely* drinking around men (including ""friends""), because I'm bad at controlling my drinking and too many bad things have happened. Bad things have happened when I didn't drink much (twice I was drugged at a bar; once my friends saw and made me exchange the drink for another; the other time I left my one and only drink on the bar while I texted a friend--I'd gone to a concert not looking for male attention, no make-up, a hoodie and jeans, stupidly thinking that me not looking for male attention would mean they wouldn't be looking at or paying attention to me; I blacked out for 45 minutes after that and showed up absolutely insane out of my mind--clearly under the influence of a drug other than alcohol--and my best friend, who said I disappeared during those 45 minutes--I still don't know what happened--had to take care of me). 

So I don't go to bars or clubs anymore (certainly not ""dressed to kill"") even though if men were respectful it would be fun, because of that subset of men who just don't know how to control themselves or who deliberately set out to prey on women. Bars and parties are like an invitation to sexual assault (and indeed are seen that way by other people who blame women for their assaults, if they were drinking), even though they can be so much fun otherwise, so it sucks for all involved (do good men realize how much they suffer for other men's behavior? That women don't trust them, have trouble dating and emotional problems, that they are less likely to want to go to bars and parties, etc...) I still travel but am nervous as hell about going on a trip alone. I will still someday do a cross-country solo bike trip (that is my dream) but I will be super extra-careful the whole time, and nervous about it, and probably try to limit camping. Maybe it's the very fact I did all these things--went out, traveled alone (in the US, Europe, Asia, and now Mexico), went out after dark--that made me such a target, which is so sad that women have to curtail their lives out of fear...although shit happened plenty of times in broad daylight and with lots of other people around. I suppose all the gross forms of abuse and harassment I've suffered have made me feel like an object not worthy of respect but for the most part (with a few exceptions) they weren't violent, just violating. I am really scared of being violently attacked and that's why I limit my traveling alone and am super-extra careful when I do it...but I am tired of being used (or taken advantage of when drinking, even when I say no) so I don't go out anymore and that's sad too...it's awful we have to feel this way!",AskReddit,1443729215,,t3_3n4jbv,Unabashed_Calabash,1443729019,0,t1_cvktty4,,2,,2,1446713165

The author's whole contention seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong?) that if the US went from number 1 economy in the world to number 2 then the US would have to go to war with whoever became number 1, in this case, China. That strikes me as insane, because it answers only one of the three questions that have to be answered in predicting whether or not there will be a war:

1. Is there something that means that both sides cannot get what they need to survive or thrive?

2. Is there any way that military force could be used to decide the question of who gets their way?

3. Two part question: do both sides think they can win? or if not, does the side that knows that they're going to lose have nothing to lose if they fight, do they have to fight anyway?

Sure there are ways in which an even stronger China could get its way over the US on things that the US wants. Global trade policy. Global communications rules. Law of the sea. Intellectual property law. Extradition rules. Support for anti-US parties to various conflicts around the world. Sure, lots of those things could make the US feel like it wanted to fight, and China feel like it wanted those things more than it wanted to avoid a fight.

So what? Is there any way the US could get its way on those things by directly attacking China? Any *imaginable* way? Many governments have tried sending soldiers to China to change the government there; nobody has managed it in centuries, not for very long. And that was when China was a lot farther behind, technologically, than they are.

A longish while ago I repeated the old Neil Gaiman line about how Europe has history, but America has geography. Somebody piped up with, ""And China has math.""

So we're left trying to imagine a US so diplomatically isolated and so economically choked off that we would ... do what exactly? Try to land ten million troops on the Chinese mainland, only to get swallowed up by China's even more millions of troops plus home field advantage? Or worse, trigger a nuclear exchange with China? I can imagine a hypothetical future American president being desperate enough to threaten that, the way that Reagan used to joke about nuking Russia, but my imagination doesn't stretch far enough to imagine it actually happening.

There's a great old art film out there called *Insignificance* and in the last line, the female lead explains why there's never going to be a nuclear war: ""Don't you see?

Jeder hat Geld zu verschenken ;)
DuckyLuck ist auch nur zufällig Hauptsponsor der einzigen und zweiten Hauptaktion auf itsallabouthappiness.com.
Es scheint zumindest so, als würde DuckyLuck (Glücksspiel, ohne staatliche Lizenz) ganz klar mit eurer Aktion in Verbindung stehen. Denn es ist ihr Slogan ... und sie sind direkt nebenan die einzigen mit einer Aktion auf der Seite.

Das Projekt itsallabouthappiness.com sitzt auch auf Malta, betrieben von der Briefkastenfirma ""BWM Gruppe"". **AUCH AUF MALTA!** /u/DerHauge stellt es so dar, als wären die Jungs nicht auf Malta. Ich hoffe übrigens nicht, dass du denkst dass BMW dort mit am Start wäre, weil die Briefkastenfirma BWM Gruppe heißt? Ansonsten kann man ja mal schnell bei Interone nachfragen, ob die bei dieser Kampagne mit am Start sind. Haben aber die Tage erst was eigenes großes neues gestartet.

Da ihr wahrsch. mit deutschem Datenschutzrecht schon Probleme habt, bin ich mir sicher, dass ihr Maltas Recht nicht kennt. **Aber eigentlich auch egal, denn nach wie vor nimmt sich der Anbieter von Itsallabouthappiness das Recht raus, euch mit Werbung zu bombadieren als auch die Teilnahmebedingungen jederzeit anzupassen.**

Und... mal im übrigen... auch wenn das Projekt an eine Agentur geoutsourced ist... (wieso auch immer die das aus Malta betreibt - wieso eigentlich /u/derhauge ?) ist das ja noch viel schlimmer, denn selbst wenn die Daten nicht an Dritte weitergegeben werden, eine Agentur hat halt eine Menge Kunden für die SIE Werbung machen können - sogar nach deutschem Recht. Aber achso... sitzt ja in Malta. Und ich wette... dass die BMW dort keine autorisierte Aktion auf einer Landingpage mit einer Briefkastenfirma im Impressum und dem Slogan eines (illegalen?)

In my opinion, since I have bought many cars in 25+ years of driving, I would buy a Honda or a Toyota.  You want something halfway fun to drive?  Get a stick shift.  It may save you a bit of money, since many people do not want or know how to drive them.  Honda Civic, Prelude, Accord.  Get a coupe if you want to stand out.  Acura Integra/RSX is another great option.  Older Lexus is a good idea, Infiniti/Nissan not quite as reliable but still worth considering.  I don't know if I'd consider a Mazda at that price point.  Maybe the Protoge5.

Seriously?! We don't know how long the terminator has been disguised as a cop. How is he meant to maintain his cover without a firing gun?! 

&lt;It wasn't JC Terminator who was in this scene. Go rewatch the movie if you must.&gt;

Ok that's true. But your comment about Terminator 2 is still wrong. It is mentioned that the liquid metal is useless without the cpu to control it. Thus, while it can repair/ reawaken a terminator it cannot control its actions. Thus the T1000 couldn't do it to Arnie in Terminator 2 because he was programmed to protect John Connor. In the new one, the young Arnie already has the right programming, and the CPU has not been destroyed because they need it to make the time machine work.

&lt;There has never been a terminator skin that ages. They shoehorned that idea in to make sense to have old Arnold be in the movie. If you don't think this is bad then you just don't have standards.&gt;

How do you know? None of the other films had a terminator hanging around for many years as part of the story. If they wanted a long-term infiltration capability it would be logical for the human parts to age.

&lt;Again, something they clearly could have avoided writing if they gave two shits about the viewer and people like you go ""I don't care if i paid full price for the toy and it's broken, i'm still happy to pay.""&gt; 

Well maybe it made sense for them to be young- if they went the long way they would be old and considerably less athletic. Plus it's a lot easier for Arnie to live off the grid what with not needing to eat etc The closer to 2017 the harder it gets to live off-grid. There- I've given you a reason that works for me.

Presumably you concede the point about Genisys.

&lt;It's easy to enjoy movies when you don't care how bad they are.
&gt;
That's a bit of an assumption. For the record I hate the Star Wars prequels overall, I walked out of the cinema for Jurassic Park: The Lost World (yes that old one) I didn't like Stargate and I didn't think the Terminator films *without* Arnie were all that great. But I enjoyed this one. I would like them to make the next one so I can see it.

&lt;Just let uptight nerds like me bug the studios into making better movies with tighter plots and internal consistency instead of arguing with us.&gt;

The ""uptight nerds"" bugged people into not going to see the film and it being a flop in Europe and US. If there is a sequel it will only be because it was popular in China and so on, and so they will be more likely to tailor it to that market, than to give a shit about the people that don't want more. So I don't think that it works the way you say at all. It is a fantasy franchise that at the basis makes no sense at all because the time-travel stuff was totally circular even in the beginning (skynet is always created by skynet travelling back in time and modifying something else, or people finding left over parts that were sent back in time). Expecting it to make complete sense is like expecting a stage magician to do actual magic. I was quite impressed that they were able to actually think up a genuinely new type of Terminator.

In fact French ownership of the predominately ethnic German Rhineland was one of the catalysing causes of World War Two. Of course the Russian Federation shares your perspective: as far as they are concerned, it's being stolen from them by the EU. 

&gt; 3) Crimea (and a large part of eastern Ukraine for that matter) have been Russian soil since 1784. The people there are native Russian speakers.

That's Russia's official reason for the annexation, protecting ethnic Russians. But nobody goes to that much trouble just to save some people. Russia's failing industry is in a horrific state, the recession is hitting hard, and this was a method of securing both public support and the necessary deep-water ports for trade and military use. The conditions are very similar to those that caused the Falklands conflict: terrible economic conditions in the aggressor state (Russia and Argentina), despotic and controversial leader (Putin and Galtiere), and an area that is seen by the majority of the population  as historically ""theirs"" (Crimea and Falklands). The only real differences is that Putin didn't seize power via military junta, and Crimea doesn't have any oil (but Ukraine does).

&gt; 4) During the 2008 NATO Summit, Putin openly warned that it was unacceptable for Ukraine to join NATO. (think Cuban missile crisis).
5) Russia had no intention of annexing anything as long as it was under their sphere of influence. It was simply a reasonable retaliation tactic given the circumstances.

Yes and yes. Russia do not want more EU and NATO forces on their borders. There are already too many US bases in Europe for *our* comfort, no wonder the Russians are getting angsty. The Crimea Annexation was a contingency plan, their one failure was relying too heavily on the pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians. When they failed, Russian military action was certain. Once those politicians failed, Ukraine was no longer in Russia's sphere of influence. 

&gt; 6) Are you saying that Russia plotted to violently overthrow their own man in order to replace him with an US puppet regime, with US citizens as part of the cabinet and put Biden's son in charge of Ukraine's largest gas producing company?

No, the invasion of Ukraine was a contingency plan devised by the RF, and was very well orchestrated. When the pro-Russian politicians failed, military action was inevitable. The Russians had infiltrated the region long before, indicated by the immediate defection of several high ranking officials of the Ukrainian Army and Navy, and fully half of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stationed in Crimea and on its borders.

But now I've had a look into it, I would say that the Russians were certainly aware of that. I was aware that the Americans and the UK were arguing over the course of action, with the UK favouring supporting the current Syrian government but under a different regime (so we get rid of al-Assad, who David Cameron - our Prime Minister - wants tried for War Crimes, and we support and use the Syrian resources), whereas the US wants to arm and support smaller military factions with the intent of creating a better Syria. The reason the UK and the EU was against that was because it is almost exactly the same situation as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, just substitute the groups the US wants to arm and train with the Taliban, and we all know how that ended. 

Russia are pro al-Assad, but like many things with the Russians, they aren't too open with their intentions. They might sort everything out for al-Assad, who then finds out that being in debt to the Russians is a very bad thing, or he could outlive his usefulness. It's a tough life being an RF puppet.

It might seem coincidental, but the Syria situation is advancing at an alarming rate. IS aren't the Taliban - they aren't goatherds with AKs who bury petrol cans and fertiliser bombs by roads. Islamic State are very highly equipped and trained soldiers. They have uniforms, they are fully armed, they have tanks, they have helicopters, and its only a matter of time before they have jets. They are capable of so much more than the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. 

If they conquer Syria, they could strike Israel, Turkey, Cypress, Greece, Egypt... I don't know about America, but practically all goods from China, India, Japan, and Australia come to Europe through the Suez Canal. More crude oil goes through that canal in a day than I will ever use in my life. Imagine if IS controlled it; all goods would have to go all the way around Africa. Prices would jump, the value of money would plummet: it would be an unparalleled economic recession.

What laws? And it's much easier to brake those laws in the US then in other countries. US gun laws are so weak in the US that no only are nearly 100% of guns used in crimes in the US originate in the US, but 70% of crime guns in Canada are from the US and most guns used in crimes in Mexico are traced to the US. 


So it's not just ""it's illegal to do sell guns to a criminal"" that is needed, you need a lot of other laws that prevent that process from occurring. 

&gt;And those stats are very wrong btw. If you adjust for demographics its essentially the same, or statistically within the mean. 

Where's your source? [White people in the US have a homicide rate of about 2.5 per 100k](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/silver-datalab-unhomicide-2.png?w=773&amp;h=1638). That is about 3x the homicide rate of most of western and northern Europe which includes ALL races. London's total homicide rate is 1.0 per 100k and they have 13% black population. The US has about homicide rate of 4.7 per 100k and a population of approximately 13% black.  Clearly it's more than just demographics. 

&gt;Homicide has been trending down since the 90's while gun ownership has been increasing. Blaming guns for something like this is every bit as idiotic as blaming it on violent video games (which I'm sure will be happening too). 


It's dropped from 9.5 in 1993 to 4.7 in 2013. Of that, it dropped from 9.5 in 1993 to 5.5 in 2000.  In 1993 the Brady Bill was passed an in 1994 the Assault Weapons Ban was passed.

During s2 worlds, Froggen was on CLG.eu, which reached semi-finals against WE, that game was insanely close, not only nothing really happened since everyone was playing safe, but it was boring and long (that's where the ward kill cheers come from), so they were at really late in the game then they started suddenly having connection problems, they had to keep reconnecting and stuff, until the game actually goes down and they had to remake the game all over again.

Here's the game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaXVlyr0df8

Then the same thing happened in the LCS against lemondogs, but Evil Geniuses(CLG.eu changed the teams name) lost anyways since they had lost the team fight and were going to lose even if there weren't any connection problems.

Also IIRC an Ex-famous streamer called Ocelot, which owns G2 currently (I think?) got ddos'd on stream and started accusing Froggen.


About Incarnation, well it was for real, he did ddos many games before until Riot ""permabanned"" him, then he regretted what he did and ended up stopping and came back to pro play after showing Riot that he learned his lesson.

Gas tax is the equivalent of about $3.75/gallon, the roads get repaved regularly, and IStanbul, a city of 15 million, has about as many highway miles as Seattle, with a lot fewer miles of city streets. The country has a decent network of primary highways linking cities, and interstate quality roads only exist between Ankara and Istanbul, Near Bursa, Between Izmir and Aydin, and some around Adana. 

But roads here aren't crumbling like they are in the U.S. Also, at least in Istanbul, only 20% of people drive (which is still, about as many people as drive in Seattle area). 

So, what I'm seeing based on this experience is that if the Seattle area wanted nice roads, that are well maintained the gas tax should be somewhere around 3.75/gallon.

Another example: We don't know very much about non-New England colonies. New Englanders, being the bureaucracy loving zealots we were back then, wrote everything down. The other colonies didn't write much down, and thus we don't know what life was like for them outside of a handful of examples, and that was only a few hundred years ago.

History should be a patchwork thing, rife with misinformation, myth, half-truths, cultural and personal biases, and lots of examples of being ""written by the victor"".

There are a few factors at play. First, the majority of gun ownership comes from the fact that all males are conscripted into the Switzerland army, and trained to use guns. They can then bring their guns, *without* ammunition, home if they so wish. If they want ammunition for the military issued guns, they can't just buy it in the store. They have to go through a bureaucratic process. 

So, I would say that it's a combination of A). Less guns total per capita, B). the statistics being skewed because although many households may own firearms a decent chunk of them can't actually use them, and C). Many more firearm owners are actually rigorously trained to use their guns, which logically reduces the number of gun-related accidents and thus firearm death statistics.

The Group Stage for the video game League of Legends (LoL) 2015 Worlds Championship will take place in Paris, from the 1st to the 4th October and from the 8th to 11th Octobre at Dock Pullman (Saint-Denis (note : Paris suburbs)).

In its most popular game mode, League of Legends is a game where two teams of five players fight in an arena. Each player assumes control of a character with unique abilities, which grow stronger by gaining experience in fights. Each team owns a building called « the Nexus » which the opponent seeks to destroy. Turrets defend the Nexus, and both camps generate weak minions that attack the enemy automatically.

League of Legends was inspired by a mod from the game Warcraft III (Blizzard Entertainment, 2002) called *Defense of the Ancients*, whose some developers were hired by Riot Games. LoL was certainly successful, with a revenue of 624 millions dollars (559 millions euros) for the sole year 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. 67 millions players play League of Legends, according to Riot Games. Yet the game is free - revenue is generated by the sales of paid additional contents.

Starting this week, the sixteen best teams in the world will fight for the ultimate title, watched by fans and cosplayers (people who disguise themselves as the game characters). The show will also be broadcasted live online. [French Stream]

Matches start at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday 1st October - the whole calendar/schedule (thx /u/Zurghtapre) is available [here](http://worlds.lolesports.com/fr_FR/worlds). Group Stage winners will go to London for quarter finales, 15-18th October ; to Bruxelles for semi finales, 24-25 October ; and to Berlin for the grand finale, 31st October.

With nine teams, Asia is well embodied ; North America and Europe present three teams each, and two additional international teams complete the picture. The prize pool for the tournament is of 2 millions dollars (1.8 millions euros), 900.000 euros of which will go to the winner.

Vocal melody in lots of forms of metal isn't very important, and as I've said the texture of the vocals blends into the background. They are meant to be incomprehensible, since the guitar riffing and overall atmosphere is the focus of the composition, so dismissing them **for** being incomprehensible makes no sense. Anyways, all but the most extreme brutal death metal vocal styles, like Wormed's slurring fry vocalizations and inhales, ultimately have the vocalist still forming the vowels of consonants and words, but they're obscured by the growling timbre. After reading lyrics along while listening to a death metal album, I can generally remember and hear the lyrics on my own after one or two focused listening sessions. 

There's many folk traditions which are primarily or entirely instrumental. Hindu *ragas*, Indonesian *gamelan*, Japanese *sōkyoku*, Chinese *yayue*, European harpsichord/organ music, concertos, symphonies, etc. So it's not innate to human musical enjoyment that understanding lyrics is a primary factor in getting substance out of the music, that's just a recent mindset of people who mostly listen to pop and/or rock driven by vocal melody.

&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:268}} Azir -  azir was picked or banned 100% in the summer playoffs in korea the regional finals in korea and china north america only europe picked or banned it 82%, azir has since been nerfed he is still played by pro players he is more valuable to ganks following the nerf so he may fall out of favor for a few teams i can see him still being picked in a high % and banned his big range lets him farm safely his e also lets him escape very easily also his ability to create a turret and siege well is still there i think he will still be highly contested.

&gt;{{champion:41}} gangplank - one of the strongest champions coming in to worlds the ability to flex him makes him really good his ult gives him global pressure and lets him farm till he reaches his core items a big counter coming in to worlds is riven but with gp seeing play in the midlane few mids will try to go riven mid vs him,    
&gt;his waveclear is really good he can block paths with his kegs has a heal also cleanses cc he can set up traps and his kegs give him a good objective control (blocking the path in) his dmg with q+e with crit is insane he can almost 1 shot carries with 3 items his scaling will keep on and he will become terrifying late game and will be able to 1 shot a carry, he will be key for pick ban phases in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:64}} lee sin - lee sin has seen play this year but nothing like last year where he was by far the most played jungler, following the recent buff and nerfs to most other junglers in worlds he will see(ha ha) play,their are  junglers that would rate him very highly like TBQ,Kakao,hojin and many more his early pressure is his key strength and many of the junglers in this high level know how to abuse it expect him to see play and maybe a banned vs the truly best at the champions.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:201}} braum - might be the best support coming in to worlds, his ability to block skillshots for adc and peel for it is his best trait his q slows and lets adc follow on it easily he is the best support vs poke comps and will be one of the most contested supports.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:122}} daruis - daruis is just really strong right now his q heals him up to 36% miss hp or 12% if he hits one vs the enemy laner, he w restes his aa animation and slows for 90% for 1 second, his e is an aoe pull that applies 90% slow and in a addition to it he gets at max level on e 25% armor pen almost an entire LW worth of armor pen and with his bleed with black cleaver he shreds armor so fast.   
&gt;with his heal, low cd and execute make him a big threat in a team fight and split pushing if he gets the right team fight he can clean up an entire team with his execute together with his strong laning and going tank he is one of the strongest top laners atm and would be highly contested in worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:429}} kalista - kalista will keep being 100% banned or picked imo she is very strong atm she kites so well and has a burst ability that slows scouts for ganks ult to save support and also extra cc   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**almost god tier**  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:245}} ekko - ekko got some ap ratio buffs with tp on mid laners, he has a lot of damage on his passive, his ult damage is crazy and underrated and his shield ap ratio is really good also the zone control from him is great he also hasa good stun and can be flexed to jungle or top lane i think we will see him as a highly contested pick this worlds.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:22}} ashe - ashe is in a good state right her ability to offer cc and a main engage tool in a meta that will most likely be focused on carry top lanres make her a good pick for this meta she is also a safe laner with a large range and slow on aa and w witch is really good for kiting juggernauts (untill they get dead man's plate or support gets coin for them)  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:60}} elise - one of the best early junglers in the game atm even with the nerfs she is still very strong and will be a top pick and highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:4}} twisted fate - twisted fate before coming in was already quite strong and was going to be picked but now many play him with tp this makes tf in some ways super global he can ult bot lane and tp top and double gank he can also ult to bot and come back to mid before he loses a wave to turret he will be quite contested after knowing his lane match up he will have a double global pressure and will let him be very strong and crate a lot of pressure he might also be able to split push might become very contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:28}} evelynn  - evelynn is very strong currently she can go ap or ad then tanky and provide a lot of damage her key strength is stealth teams who do not have strong vision play will be at a bad spot vs her you need to ward her camps to see her or pink at spots where you will see her coming to your lane for some teams this will be hard to execute due to poor communication. you will also need to be careful of her flanking your team, her ability to crate pressure even if she is not at that spot (for example bot lane playing more careful for gank they cannot see or a team not engaging because it may be a trap) makes her top tier.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:114}} fiora -  [shot summary of fiora](http://esports.inquirer.net/11204/totally-called-it) she also has a chance getting picked mid she can be a flex pick to those teams.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:67}} vayne - a lot of adcs have been practicing vayne while her range is very shot and she cant siege her ability to kite in this meta is really big   
&gt;she will most likely be highly contested.  
&gt;  
&gt;**A tier**   
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:82}} mordekiaser - morde will most likely be one of the most contested picks in this worlds he is so strong that the moment he is picked he changes priority for the entire team dragon is worth so much more for both teams the junglers will be forced to camp bot ( the one that will face morde will want to abuse the fact that he is pushing while the jungler that is with morde will want to get dragon asap and counter gank so that morde). the biggest problem i see or can think of is lane swap on morde because we have not seen him played in competitive before this i wonder if it fucks him over too much for example taking drake before he turns 6 will make him get 1 less drake that game that he can use to push a turret or force someone out of lane his power is also in the fact that he levels the fastest in the duo lane while in lane swap the support will roam that will make morde very vulnerable to ganks i have no seen it played by pros in a highly competitive environment so this is a lot of speculation i feel like we will see him just because of his burst and ability to get a free tank who does dmg with drake while still keeping the ultimate.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:18}} tristana - highly contested pick tristana's ability to take turrets very fast in the mid game make her a strong pick with great scaling to the late game as well tristana will be one of the most contested pick in adc when kalista is banned.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:421}} rek'sai - rek'sai semi contested pick that is second tier she is a comfort pick for many junglers so she will likely see play.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:12}} alistar - alistar has a very strong team fighting ability if he hit his combo on more then 3 people he can turn fights aswell as the fact he becomes a tank just by using his ult, with his heal you can do krugs/gromp fairly easily without losing too much hp,other then that he is a very good engage/follow up and is one of the best supports in providing cc doing a team fights and giving an easy engage of someone to follow up or follow up himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:131}} diana - she can assassinate split push and also take tp to the midlane you can flex her top in some cases with tp she can tp to bot and snowball quite hard.  
&gt;  
&gt;{{champion:103}} ahri assassin great for pick comps overall one of the best assassins in the game coming into worlds her ability to kill carry with 1 combo makes her really good as well as sustain in lane and a great way to pick off someone.

I do indeed agree that there is a positive correlation between immigration and crime. That is pretty much indisputable. However, I would have like to have seen Belgium-specific data on that, but I understand it can be hard to find. Also, according to your data the majority of refugees are not criminals. I repeat. The majority are not criminals.

On the other hand, migrants and refugees can actually help the economy. 

https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730383-800-why-welcoming-more-refugees-makes-economic-sense-for-europe/

But of course that one source isn't going to be convincing enough for you, so here's another few, about the situation in Jordan an Turkey

http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/future-development/posts/2015/02/25-syrian-refugees-jordan-karasapan

Here we see cases of much larger per capita numbers having a net positive effect on the economy in certain cases. 

However, there are indeed limits, and taking in too much is bad http://www.nber.org/papers/w9755

It's all interesting and I don't think there's a clear cut answer to all this. It seems to me like Belgium needs to do the following: 

-Speed up the processing of asylum applications


-seperate the refugees from the economic migrants


-grant actual refugees (temporary) asylum in Belgium, make it permanent for people who are highly skilled/ have managed to hold on to a job


-give economic support to UN camps in Jordan and Turkey

-Put more emphasis on tackling human traffickers.

&gt; Every weekend watching a so called Top of the table premier league game like United Arsenal; the quality of football is just appalling compared to a Valencia Sevilla or Gladbach Augsburg.

Again, subjective.

&gt; The coefficient table is there to show which leagues are the best and it says Spain. And it has been screaming Spain for a long time.

The coefficient isn't the worst way of trying to see which league is best, but it's ultimately inconclusive, as a league of 20 teams can't be judged on 6-7 teams performances in Europe. It absolutely shows which leagues have the best elite teams, and I 100% agree that Spain and Germany's best teams are much better than England's best, but that is far from the entire story.

And non of the primary sources agree with you. On top of that AGAIN you come with zero proper sources for this small pox myth. And you're source again does not support your claim.

&gt;In addition to providing a window into the past, the authors hope that these analyses will contribute to the design of studies aimed at identifying genes for diseases with different frequency in Native Americans and Europeans. Researchers have so far focused on populations from areas settled mainly by Native Americans and Europeans. The genomic diversity of populations across regions in the Americas with large African immigration is still mostly unexplored.

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU CONCLUDE THIS IF THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE GENES AND ARE LOOKING FOR THEM. 

You just assume it was diseases, and indeed they played a big role. But only in support of the Genocide. Unless you are going to claim the the Nazi also did not commit a genocide, since most Jews died of starvation and disease in the concentration camps. How could this germans have done anything about this ?

Please explain, what is wrong with any of the primary sources I gave you ? Please point me to any of the settlers, conquistadores, governors etc. That suggest all these indians were dying of disease. You can recognize the small pox, and they saw them. Please explain how it was possible that Cortes's allies (and there were thousands, perhaps a 100.000 of them) did not start dying of these ""diseases"", while his enemies were. And when he betrayed them, they started dying of ""diseases"" too. Point me to a pathogen that exhibits this behavior.

Theres also the problem with logistics and how 15% of the american population is going to find a way to organize themselves in a country thats bigger than all of europe and also the views of the other 85% of the population.

0,t5_2r0gj,cvl1jzf,"Is PEW *always* correct in their outcomes? They may be the premier demographic science/statistics organization, but that does not mean that they're infallible or that there are not going to be future variables which are currently unaccounted for. This isn't to imply that they lack professionalism, merely that they can't foresee everything in the future. I have tremendous respect for their work and cite them periodically as well. I maintain that technology and cultural shifts may be a huge influence on future cultural development as has seemingly always been the case in humanity.^[1](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/developing-economies/), ^[2](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/03/pdf/devfocus.pdf) 

I wonder if the internet itself may also be instrumental in continued global secularization - as more people who are quiet disbelievers have a means to disaffect, they may be more inclined to eventually be open about it. I don't think that the cultural influences which have driven secularization in the western world are something which Islam is immune to, the changes may be too nascent yet to see yet, but I suspect that the same variables which led to a pretty secular Europe and which is causing secularization in the US will eventually affect Islam as well. Christianity used to be a war-faring religion which killed its heretics and I see no reason to think that some feature of Islam renders it immune to the same changes the majority of Christianity has gone through or the pressures which cause people to disaffect. 

Most of the Muslim majority nations if not all are still developing nations, and while that confers global growth potential in the immediate term since most developing nations regardless of religious majority have higher than global average birth rates, nearly all developing nations are gradually becoming more developed. Issues like falling infant mortality rates may actually influence family sizes to be smaller as less children will be expected to die in childhood - this trend was seen in the 19th century in the US. The statistics conferred by PEW are until 2050, and they may well be accurate for that time period, but I think it's hasty to presume that the same variables which led to secularization of Europe and presumably are changing the religious demographics in North America are not going to eventually have an effect on Islamic nations, even if it's decades from now and outside of the time frame of the study you cited by PEW. 

Perhaps I am erroneously optimistic about the demographic of secularists to which I belong. I may well be wrong, and I accept that possibility. ",exmormon,1443738530,,t3_3n4dbu,ohokyeah,1443738301,0,t1_cvl0ieg,,5,Fear finds an excuse while truth finds a way.,5,1446716131

Then there's Polish drivers, who almost always speed on all non-city roads (and often in cities too if the road is empty.)  I can't blame them entirely, the speed limits are extremely low (except the motorway which is 140km/h) but what's worse than all of this is the judgement.  The attitude to driving is: it's a race.  Overtaking on roads that are entirely unsuitable to safe overtaking in cars that are too slow and crappy to safely overtake, driving at high speed on wet or snowy roads.  It's terrifying.  

And it shows in the statistics, Poland is one of the safest countries in terms of homicide in Europe, and yet one of the absolute worst for road deaths.  3-4x more deaths than countries like the U.K., despite often having lower speed limits.

Electricity can kill you and has killed many people.  Transgenic food has never harmed anyone.

&gt; And homosexuality was considered a mental illness until 1972, which goes to show how scientific consensus can be solidified around concepts that are more cultural than scientific, much like the corporate funded science around GMOs.

Yeah, that's right, use that to dismiss scientific consensus you don't like.  Vaccines?  Scientific consensus for vaccines?  Nope, Big Pharma paid for all that.  Never mind the many government, organizational, and independent studies in favor of them too.

[GMOs are well-known to be safe](http://i.imgur.com/Dj0MLX1.jpg):

&gt; There is a widespread perception that eating food from genetically modified crops is more risky than eating food from conventionally farmed crops. However, there is broad scientific consensus that food on the market derived from such crops poses no greater risk than conventional food.[1][2][3][4][83][84][74][85] No reports of ill effects have been documented in the human population from genetically modified food.[4][5][6] In 2012, the American Association for the Advancement of Science stated ""Foods containing ingredients from genetically modified (GM) crops pose no greater risk than the same foods made from crops modified by conventional plant breeding techniques.""[1] The American Medical Association, the National Academies of Sciences and the Royal Society of Medicine have stated that no adverse health effects on the human population related to genetically modified food have been reported and/or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date.[4][5][6] A 2004 report by Working Group 1 of the ENTRANSFOOD project, a group of scientists funded by the European Commission to identify prerequisites for introducing agricultural biotechnology products in a way that is largely acceptable to European society,[86] concluded that ""the combination of existing test methods provides a sound test-regime to assess the safety of GM crops.""[87] In 2010, the European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation reported that ""The main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are not per se more risky than e.g. conventional plant breeding technologies.""[2]:16

If Poland broke the alliance early in the game then that could be scary for you. However, as long as you have powerful allies you will be fine.

For almost every single one of my Prussian games France was my BFF and carried me through most of the wars until I became more powerful then them. I'd try to cozy up to them. Also Austria is a great early - mid game ally. If Bohemia is friendly you can use them to take down Poland and turn on them later. 

Make sure when you ally Muscovy you don't let them get too strong because a strong Muscovy/Russia is very annoying/dangerous.

Agreed.  But it's doubtful we could afford to remove income tax completely as the government needs so much tax income.

-Investment in education, degrees that lead to jobs prioritised, education that leads to life skills, job skills and personal well being prioritised in early years.  Scientific basis for education, for example schools and universities rated on how well their students did in life after they left.  

-Leaving the EU, replacing it with a free trade deal

-Higher wages for higher ups in the public sector to attract more talent (comparable to the private sector.)

-NHS, much more money spent on preventative health.  Taxes on fat people, taxes on people who don't exercise.  

-Testing, testing, testing.  Everything gets tested, measured and evaluated.  From how a police man should act when stopping and searching a suspect (pally or polite?) to what the affects of devolution to a local council is.

&gt; * NEW DELHI: India is likely to back Sri Lanka on the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution over alleged war crimes if it is put to vote in Geneva on Thursday, officials said, attributing the decision to measures taken by the new government in Colombo to empower Tamil minorities.

&gt; * The resolution, co-sponsored by the USA and Sri Lanka and supported by a few European nations including the UK, Macedonia and Montenegro, was tabled last week.

&gt; * India is backing Sri Lanka in its opposition to the inclusion of foreign judges, as envisioned in the draft resolution, to probe the war crimes committed during the conflict with the LTTE.

&gt; * Officials said although India would prefer consensus to emerge on the resolution, the government is likely to support Sri Lanka if the resolution is put to vote on any contentious issue.

0,t5_2rfxx,cvl6hl5,Sorry that was bad phrasing. By win early and snowball i meant you have to win early game hard enough where koo cannot perform their high level of macro play. Pain won in the first 10 min but failed to capitalize on their lead and were choked out by koos impressive rotational play. The difference here is that some teams are strong early game teams (ex: clg) that capitalize on their strong laners like double and zion and use that gold advantage to try to close. In this case the key to beating them is to either outperform them at what they are best at or be a highly defensive team that can turtle well (ex: clg eu in season 2) Ofc any team can win if they win so hard that they snowball out of control but the key here is that its to take advantage of koo's weakness in that its much easier to snowball against their poor early game unless gorilla and smeb hard carry. I think the strongest team at worlds is lgd because they have the strongest laners in acorn godv and imp/pyl and have the best wave control in the game. So even if they fall behind they use wave control to make sure the enemy team cant secure objectives safely. So koo would be completely nullified vs lgd in my opinion. I hope that gives more detail as to why winning the early game very hard is more important vs koo that any other team. ,leagueoflegends,False,ahri,t3_3n58ar,tast3ofk0lea,1443747083,0,t1_cvl5r2j,,3,,3,1446718521

0,t5_2qh6p,cvl6nb4,"Yes these inalienable rights that are so apart of Western thought are endowed to us by our creator, God. That is how it is traditionally thought of from the time of Enlightenment when these ideas were forming. It is right in the most famous line from the Declaration of Independence:

""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their *Creator* with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""

Now were both arriving at the same point that these inalienable rights cannot be taken away and are always apart of us, but were getting there differently. While I say its from God, you say it just is. Now this difference can be attributed to ones faith in the Divine or lack there of and the adherence to Western thought. And this Western thought came out of Europe during the Enlightenment and is a mix of Classical Greek logic and reason, and Christian Theology/morals. Now today we accept them as just the way it is, but that is because we were born and raised in Western culture. If we were born and raised in some society that is not Western and does not hold these ideas grounded in reason, logic, and Christian morality, we would have a completely different outlook. So even though you might discount the Divine reasoning behind our rights, its how this whole thing started and without it our form of government, Western thought, and just about everything else about our lives would be different because our whole culture would be completely different. And this is why our Constitution and form of government needs to have a divine being, or for us Christians God. Without it the reasoning behind the Constitution and our form of government wouldn't stand up. I think John Adams said it a lot more eloquently then I have: “Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people”. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.”

I know people say necessity is the mother of invention, but that's not entirely true. A more accurate statement would be: The widespread adaption of invention is subject to popular demand. Which in and of itself is kind of obvious when you think about it. My examples for this, are a few. For one, concrete. We've known about concrete for ages. But we never used it widespread until Roman times, when we started building our first million-population cities. Rome had 7 story high apartment buildings. [A reconstruction for example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Reconstruction._Casa_dei_Dipinti.JPG), and ruins. Reason I bring this up, is that Concrete would continue to exist, and be used, by savages in the Norwegian and African countryside, yet ""civilization"" forgot the craft, and wouldn't reuse it again until it needed it. Yet, simpler people were using it to build small structures for 2000 years in the meantime. Other examples include Steel, and gears.

Actually, evolution is documented to occur at more rapid paces with fewer people. Some small levels of inbreeding greatly accelerates evolution, because recessive traits are forced into natural selection, and so the gene pool is streamlined.

I know you say that you don't equate people living in third world nations with people from hundreds of thousands of years ago, but my point is that those same primitive people, hundreds of thousands of years ago, invented things that we currently use, yet the people who benefit from them today, wouldn't have a clue how to replicate them if they, in those ancient populations, disappeared. Again, this is proof that those primitive people hundreds of thousands of years ago, were as smart as we are, if not possibly smarter due to higher natural selection pressures.

Progress simply doesn't happen that fast dude. In order for the species to ""progress"", any traits which are produced that are beneficial, have to spread sexually to all populations. That generally takes tends of thousands of years to occur. Look around at all the different skin colors and eye colors that humanity currently has. That didn't happen over night. People in Europe didn't teleport the gene for blue eyes to China over night. The gene began in Europe several 10k years ago, and over the course of thousands of years, spread to China. The simple fact is, progress does not happen within our individual life times, nor even a few life times. It's a very slow, gradual shift that occurs at randomly, and once ""proven"", then takes tens of thousands of years to disseminate throughout the human gene pool.

For example, did you know that traits we gained from neanderthals 20k years ago, are STILL currently disseminating throughout the human gene pool? Currently, populations in East and West Africa STILL haven't progressed to receiving those genes. Those genes include immunities to diseases, and other things. It will not fully integrate into the human species, for at least another five thousand years! ",InternetIsBeautiful,False,,t3_3lxly2,ASSHAT91,1443751208,0,t1_cvjnh74,,1,,1,1446719652

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/f8e82284bcaf4612bd5518eea81b0f5d.png)  

&gt; La Sera is an indie rock band from Los Angeles, California, featuring Katy Goodman - of Vivian Girls.  The first album was recorded in spring 2009 by Katy and good friend, filmaker and music producer Brady Hall.  They were both inspired by charming, ethereal vocals and '50s/'60s pop influences.

&gt; After finishing the first album, the outfit signed to Hardly Art Records in 2010 and subsequently released the 7"" ""Never Come Around"" in November 2010. The songs touch on an array of emotions, with heartbreak, love, and death all covered in each song with three minutes of dreamy guitar and reverb-washed harmonies. A second 7"" was released in January 2011, ""Devils Hearts Grow Gold,"" with a B-side cover of ""Dedicated to the One I Love,"" originally by the 5 Royales. Released in 2011, the band's self-titled debut is a collection of beautifully constructed tunes with a softer feel than the Vivian Girls had, one where Goodman revels in her dreamy pop creations. A video was created by Hall in his home studio for the single ""Never Come Around,"" which is as gruesome as the song is thick with winding vocals and sweet melodies. The album's intricate cover art was designed by Vivian Girls bandmate Cassie Ramone.

&gt; For her second album under the La Sera name, Goodman enlisted Rob Barbato (of Darker My Love) to play guitar and produce and Dan Allaire (of the Brian Jonestown Massacre) to drum, while she played bass. Tim Presley (of White Fence and Darker My Love) and Tony Bevilaqua (of Spinarette) also helped out. The album shows the band coming out from behind the reverb and cathedral harmonies and focusing more on song writing and Katy's voice.  Sees the Light was released by Hardly Art in the spring of 2012.

&gt; La Sera toured extensively in 2012, with east and west coast tours, a month in Europe, and a full US tour opening for Father John Misty. Read more on Last.fm.

As an example, in Europe, theory and ethnomusicology are included as core parts of musicology.  In America, they're separate disciplines.  Some institutions equate music history and musicology (as in, a university either grants graduate degrees in Music History {or Music History / Literature} or Musicology.  Others would all but kick you out for equating the two.  Some schools offer undergraduate degrees in music history and graduate degrees in musicology.

It's all a bit silly.

The personal definition I currently use is that musicology is the relation of various historiological methodologies with historical facts having to do with music.  The definition of ""historical facts"" is its own debate, but for my purposes I'm defining it as falsifiable claims that seem verified based on current historical research.  This differs from scientific facts and general opinions in important ways, but that's its own debate.

So yes.  This is all an ongoing, evolving conversation in my life.  I'm not sure if I'll settle on this definition or what will happen with it.

But the short version is that it's the academic study of music.  This has problems, but it's a good base.

As far as favourite things go, that's a really tough question.  As far as academic stuff goes, I'm super interested in the development of song styles, especially French song styles.  More near and dear to my heart is barbershop harmony, which is what I've written the most on (for applications to things, mostly).

Over the passage of time we have 10 European titles to the Netherlands (3 in the past 25 years) and 1 European title to France (1 in the past 25 years).

In America, Russia has alternatingly been enemy and joke. If you have an American filmmaker who has an emotional connection to Russian culture and how it relates to Shostakovich's story, then OK, but you're not going to get major studios to back that because they are shooting for the lowest common denominator. Smaller film industries are therefore more likely to present the story in an interesting and provocative way. If that's an independent American filmmaker or European or Japanese or whatever, fine. I just don't think there are a glut of American filmmakers who haven't been indoctrinated with the weird propaganda about Russia and its people and who wouldn't feel the need to bring that dialogue to the forefront in a story that should ultimately be about one man's rebellion against a system that tried to suppress him.

Ideally, you'd think that theme should be very American, but it's not anymore. America no longer views themselves as rebels, but as policy-setters, so rebellion has fallen out of fashion in favor of jerking off to US military supremacy.

 I do support better gun control. There is clearly a problem with the U.S. in that our mentally ill are both helped less *and* armed better than the mentally ill in other countries (who are possibly, shockingly, not armed at all). We are making our mass shootings both more likely and more deadly. This can be remedied in both of those directions, but I argue below that some factors make better help for the mentally ill a more effective measure than increasing the difficulty for an average citizen to purchase a firearm. (Not to stigmatize mental problems in general -- most types of mental illness aren't associated with increased propensity for violence.)

Now that I've angered the right wing, I will anger the left wing by saying that I think that it is telling that almost every single mass shooting in the past 60 years, in the U.S., has been committed in a place [where guns are not allowed.](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/335739/facts-about-mass-shootings-john-fund) I don't know the updated statistic, but fifteen years ago there was only a single exception to this rule. (I believe I read that there are now three exceptions, in an updated version of the above article, but don't trust me on that.) There have also been cases where would-be mass murderers have been stopped by an armed citizen -- e.g., the New Life Church shooting. It seems that they purposefully target places where they know that no one will have a chance to fight back, which isn't exactly surprising. Mass shootings aren't more likely in states with more firearms, in a related statistic.

Europeans don't realize just how difficult it would be to disarm America completely. Tighter gun control in the future is possible, but there are so many guns in the U.S., and so many ways for them to be acquired illegally, that the old adage ""if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns"" a lot more true here than it would have been in, say, Sweden -- a smaller country with fewer guns and less border.

So, knowing this, I don't support a blanket ban on firearms. I also don't think throwing up our hands and saying ""oh well"" is a good idea, either; it seems to me that the best intervention would be more ease in getting help for the mentally ill (and less ease for them in acquiring guns).",politics,1443811547,,t3_3n5rz0,CrossFeet,1443755671,0,t1_cvl9402,,15,,15,1446720865

**Losses**

- Possible loss of dairy system, forcing dairy farmers to compete more on volume, creating a slippery slope towards allowing growth hormones in milk
- Longer copyright terms meaning less enters the public domain every year (as much as I recognize this loss I have yet to put my finger on actual losses)
- Longer patent terms on drugs, possibly increasing public health care costs

Now getting to your questions, the first thing you have to remember **is to start with the 50 feet view** before getting into the details. The important fact of the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one that is the most important point that is often overlooked is as follows.

**The Zionists who founded Israel and instigated the conflict were settler-colonialists from Europe.** No different than the European colonialists who came and conquered North America and wiped out the Indians or the Boers who raped and pillaged South Africa.

 The area that became Palestine had a Christian-Muslim majority for at least 2,000 years. The people who founded Israel and created the ideology of Zionism were Europeans. 

Here, is a prominent early leader of Zionism.

https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/ironwall.html

&gt;To imagine, as our Arabophiles do, that they will voluntarily consent to the realisation of Zionism, in return for the moral and material conveniences which the **Jewish colonist** brings with him, is a childish notion, which has at bottom a kind of contempt for the Arab people; it means that they despise the Arab race, which they regard as a corrupt mob that can be bought and sold, and are willing to give up their fatherland for a good railway system. 



&gt; There is no justification for such a belief. It may be that some individual Arabs take bribes. But that does not mean that the Arab people of Palestine as a whole will sell that fervent patriotism that they guard so jealously, and which even the Papuans will never sell. **Every native population in the world resists colonists as long as it has the slightest hope of being able to rid itself of the danger of being colonised.**

The early Zionists groups even called themselves colonial organizations. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Jewish_Colonization_Association

&gt;I've been exposed to viewpoints that hold that the 1948 war was motivated by anti-antisemitism and that the Arab countries that participated wanted to ""kill all the Jewish people"".

So what I explained above answers your first question. The Palestinians and Arab countries who later got involved were not motivated by anti-Semitism, which is absurd. Palestine and most Arab countries had native Jewish populations that were treated relatively well , much better than Jews in Europe, even before the Holocaust.  Would you say that the Native Americans who fought the European coloninists anti-white or anti-Christian? Of course not. Like the Palestinians, they were fighting to defend their homeland from invaders.

&gt;Would you have any sources that tell me what the motives of the invading Arab nations were and how Palestinians were caught in the middle of this mess?

So, by 1947, the British who were the colonial power in charge of the area of Palestine asked the UN to figure out what to do. Keep in mind that at the time, 65 percent of the population was still Arab, and the third that was Jewish were recent immigrants , many of whom came illegally. There was a proposal to split it 50/50 despite the fact that Zionist colonists only owned 6 percent of the land. That proposal never became official. Jewish militia decided to use that unrealized proposal to create a state. They first conquered territory that was not part of the area designed for the state of Israel. Then they started to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their home, wiping out 700,000 eventually.  By the time Arab countries intervened in May of 1948, the Jewish militias were already conquering land and ethnically cleansing Palestinians. It was basically a humanitarian intervention.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg#Career

&gt;Julius Rosenberg joined the Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1940, where he worked as an engineer-inspector until 1945. He was fired when the U.S. Army discovered his previous membership in the Communist Party. Important research on electronics, communications, radar and guided missile controls was undertaken at Fort Monmouth during World War II.[12]

&gt;According to a 2001 book by his former handler Alexander Feklisov, Rosenberg was originally recruited by the NKVD on Labor Day 1942 by former spymaster Semyon Semyonov.[13] He had been introduced to Semyonov by Bernard Schuster, a high-ranking member of the Communist Party USA as well as Earl Browder's personal NKVD liaison. In fact, Feklisov, a lifelong Communist, was covering the role of Jacob Golos, who in 1942 passed the Communist ""information"" cell of young engineers headed by Julius Rosenberg into direct contact with the Soviet operatives in New York. After Semyonov was recalled to Moscow in 1944, his duties were taken over by Feklisov.[13]

&gt;According to Feklisov, Rosenberg provided thousands of classified (top secret) reports from Emerson Radio, including a complete proximity fuse, an upgraded model of which was used to shoot down Gary Powers' U-2 in 1960. Under Feklisov's administration, Rosenberg is said to have recruited sympathetic individuals into NKVD service, including Joel Barr, Alfred Sarant, William Perl and Morton Sobell.[14] The Venona intercept shows that Julius Rosenberg (code name **LIBERAL**) was the head of this particular spy ring.

&gt;According to Feklisov, he was supplied by Perl, under Julius Rosenberg’s direction, with thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, including a complete set of design and production drawings for Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star. Feklisov says he learned through Rosenberg that his brother-in-law David Greenglass was working on the top-secret Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; he used Julius to recruit him.[13]

&gt;The USSR and the U.S. were allies during the war, but the Americans did not share information or seek assistance from the Soviet Union for the Manhattan Project. The Soviets were aware of the project as a result of espionage penetration of the U.S. government and made a number of attempts to infiltrate its operations at the University of California, Berkeley. After the war, the U.S. continued to protect its nuclear secrets, but the Soviet Union was able to produce its own atomic weapons by 1949. The West was shocked by the speed with which the Soviets were able to stage their first nuclear test, ""Joe 1"", on August 29, 1949.[15] In January 1950 the U.S. discovered that Klaus Fuchs, a German refugee theoretical physicist working for the British mission in the Manhattan Project, had given key documents to the Soviets throughout the war. Fuchs identified his courier as Harry Gold, who was arrested on May 23, 1950.[16] Gold confessed and identified Sergeant David Greenglass, a former machinist at Los Alamos, as an additional source.

&gt;Greenglass confessed to having passed secret information on to the USSR through Gold. Though he initially denied any involvement by his sister, Ethel Rosenberg, eventually he claimed that she knew of her husband's dealings and typed some documents for him.[17] In a 2001 interview he said, ""I told them the story and left her out of it, right? But my wife put her in it. So what am I gonna do, call my wife a liar? My wife is more important to me than my sister. And she was the mother of my children.""[7] He also claimed that his sister's husband, Julius, had convinced his wife Ruth Greenglass to recruit David while on a visit to him in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1944. He said Julius had passed secrets, and linked him and Ethel to the Soviet contact agent Anatoli Yakovlev. This connection would be necessary as evidence if there was to be a conviction for espionage.

&gt;Another accused conspirator, Morton Sobell, was on vacation in Mexico City when both Rosenbergs were arrested. According to his memoir, On Doing Time, he tried to figure out a way to reach Europe without a passport. Abandoning that effort, he returned to Mexico City, where he claimed to have been kidnapped by members of the Mexican secret police and driven to the U.S. border, where he was arrested by U.S. forces.[19] The government claimed Sobell was arrested by the Mexican police for bank robbery on August 16, 1950, and extradited the next day to the United States in Laredo, Texas.[19] He was charged and tried with the Rosenbergs on one count of conspiracy to commit espionage.

What we brits view as odd behaviour (the desire to own a gun) is something we arnt exposed to or the vicious circle of fear they are caught in which promotes gun ownership.  The cycle of violence will continue and only perpetuate through economic up/downturns, especially as populations grow and we see increasing malthusian checks as a result of population pressures.

In essence, its easy for european countries to disarm, to have prosecution free gun hand ins eg after dunblane was all it took for UK to tighten our laws further because only a fraction of us have guns or any desire to own one (most I ever had was a .22 locked up at an indoor range).  Further restrictions to guns would pass uncontested in the UK as a result.

I wouldnt even know how to solve such a deeply rooted issue like this, clearly these shootings are mostly young males, often at school who flip and wish to inflict harm on others and the access to guns increases the victim counts. Age is one factor where they could restrict ownership.  The other is cost, it is really cheap to buy a weapon capable of killing many people so easily and impersonally.  Prohibitive tax rise on gun purchase might help reduce gun crime in some way.

Even if we go to the most draconian route, a forced hand in of all weapons, screening checkpoints and home searches etc, it would take a long time to reduce gun count to levels where the typical teenager who gets mad at their school would have a hard time getting hold of one and need to seek alternates (ie: to UK gun ownership levels) or the ammo at least like in switzerland.  Of course no political party would go this route given the current support for guns.

400CE-1500CE: Post classical (Most of the time this is divided into early-post-classical and and late-post classical with the dividing line at ~1000CE since that's roughly the end of the Viking era in Europe, the collapse of the Abbasid Dynasty for the Muslim world and end of the Chinese 10 Kingdoms Period).

1500-1750: Early Modern (sometimes the end date 1789 is used because of the French Revolution, sometimes they also use the start dates 1453 which was both the fall of Constantinople and around the end of the last Mongol kingdoms, sometimes 1492 for Columbus)

1750-1914: Goes by many names including Mid-modern, Industrial era, Age of Revolutions, or my personal favorite ""The long 19th century.""

1914+: modern. Not enough time has passed to say if there is an end to this era but many have argued 1991 as a possible end putting us in a new era but there is not even an attempt at consensus on that point.

0,t5_33726,cvldfjf,"See this is very Interesting as Australia has had similar laws since 2011.
Our laws replacing the out Trade Practices act with Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act (The Australian Consumer Law - ACL) gives specific references to fitness for purpose and a statutory 12 month warranty that cannot be revoked. In fact all products in Australia have to provide a statement as such under the ACL even if it sold from overseas with a restricted warranty, for example my computer parts arrived with a note stating my rights compared under the ACL with the standard form warranty card one would get in the U.S.

Basically the short version is: you get a replacement or your money back by law.

Now here comes the interesting part, I don't believe that Steam refunds and their methodology would fall under the ACL as legal nor would some of the underhanded tactics like Rockstar did in the sale with the Shark Cards instantly redeeming preventing refund, but the big problem is I doubt Steam would listen to the ACCC or care or even worse they'd simply embargo the entire country. With 22 Million people and not all of them gamers I doubt our loss would be a big dent in revenue. We'd just maintain our crown as the torrent capital of the world.

The other problem is that we would need someone to actually challenge the refund policy under our law and to win in order to obtain that right and force the hand of companies to give refunds, I think under our law the ACCC is soley responsible for this action, but I did my course on this 3 years ago so I may be rusty

The UK of course now putting in laws that on the face look very similar will be interesting and hopefully add a new dynamic that forces companies like Steam and EA to look at the UK market, their laws and the laws in Australia and realise they will now have to comply.

To respond to your intention: I completely disagree. I think people who ""breed"" as much as I do, in an American context, especially actually *contribute* to a better overall society. 

There have been an abundance of studies showing that people who have 4 or more kids are happier, they have stronger knit families, and their children are more well-adjusted and contribute more to society. Granted, I'm sure there's a ceiling on that: 19 kids, for example, is simply insane. 

But while India and China rapidly increase the overall global population, countries in the west are actually on a path to losing their identities and their cultural heritage. Studies say that 2.1 children per family is the minimum needed to sustain a culture. No country in Europe is currently above that, with the average number being 1.6 children per family.

So, overall, I'm actually doing my part to sustain the culture. It causes problems when your culture is under the birth rate. Take Taiwan, for example, which has had to *incentivize* having children with direct stipends and huge tax breaks since they were running on around .9 per family there for a while. Their culture was significantly at risk of losing enough citizens to eventually be overtaken by immigrants and their children.

If I lived in China or India, sure, I'd be irresponsible to have 4 kids. But as an American, I think 4 is a great number. My wife and I are good parents and we provide for our kids and will go our best to give them the social skills and education to contribute to society as adults.

The ""refugees"" already killed all the Christians and Jews. 3/4 of the ""refugees"" are military aged males, less than half claim to be from Syria, and according to Germany, a third of those are lying. I'm so very sorry that the Muslim countries in the area don't like the version of Islam the ""refugees"" practice. Neither do we.

&amp;nbsp;

This makes you sound educated...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;You mean the one who had been living in Turkey for three years, whose father had been living and working in Turkey for that time, who lied about what happened, was going to Europe to get dental work, and who was himself one of the human smugglers and was piloting the boat and panicked, which caused it to capsize - which is why the little boy drowned? That little boy? His family wasn't fleeing from ISIS. Like most of the stories of the ""refugees"", that was a lie.

&amp;nbsp;

Provide proof with source

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I'm a little disturbed myself - but as to the little faith, we had full background checks on the Tsarnaev brothers and their family, and the Russians even warned us about them - yet they were still able to commit a terrorist attack and set off bombs in Boston that killed and wounded almost 200 people.

&amp;nbsp;

Do you have any idea how easy it is to buy the materials needed for what they did? You don't.  This entire statement shows me that you don't.  Law enforcement can't just arrest you because a host nation (Which is scared of gays and HIV positive people) said you were bad, and up to no good.  Also which of the Tsarnaev brothers ever had a back ground check conducted, and when?  You're just trying to make facts that support your argument which are are made up facts.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;There was lots of evidence and documentation of what Major Hasan was planning before he murdered two dozen people at a medical center in Fort Hood in the terrorist attack there. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is a fact.  Why was it so grossly mishandled?  I don't know.
&gt; We have 250 Americans right now fighting with ISIS (and I can pretty much guarantee you that almost none were born in the US), and more who were involved in the Al Shabab mall massacre in Kenya.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Made up fact

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;These are people who went through the vetting process, and lived in the US while the NSA was cavalierly violating the 4th Amendment rights of Americans at will - so obviously it isn't working very well.

&amp;nbsp;

Just because you're aware of the program, doesn't mean you understand the program.  Also, really take a look at those Terms of Service statements that many so easily just click I agree.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Maybe if we didn't have 20 million illegals in the country they would have a better chance of doing that. Maybe if we weren't importing a million more legal aliens per year, they would have a better chance of doing that.

&amp;nbsp;

Nice hypotho-theory.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Our current President has certainly been doing everything in his power to reduce US power and influence, I will give you that.

&amp;nbsp;

Does President Obama need to demonstrate to the world that the US is the best?  If having more influence means having to invade Iraq a third time to fix the problem, sorry no thank you.  I honestly applaud President Obama for not pushing congress for me to spend more time away from my family with the risk for death.  I also don't know what you mean by power.  Power is an abstract idea, and if you really understood government, you'd understand the power is in congress, you know the bickering clowns that have squandered the past couple of years?

The problem with ""a government"" isn't that it allows a team to affirm or negate by cherry-picking one particular government. The problem is that it's too difficult to make a conclusion regarding governments in general. Consider (a) some of the European governments are more capable of helping with humanitarian needs, (b) some of the European governments had a much larger role in creating the crisis, and (c) all of the countries are receiving a vastly different number of refugees. 

""Humanitarian needs"" means way more than just ayslum - it also means access to food, water, shelter, sanitation, etc. Not really a big deal, however, since it's still pretty clear what you're advocating for.

You are hugely oversimplifying the problems regarding ""prioritize."" The resolution doesn't include the phrase ""when in conflict,"" which means you aren't only debating about situations where humanitarian needs and national interests are contradictory. 

Also, you completely misunderstand what con has to do in round. They don't need to prove the inverse of the resolution, they just need to negate it. If con proves that governments don't need to prioritize humanitarian needs because they overlap with national interests, then they're still negating the resolution. Lots of teams ran a similar argument at the 2014 TOC, and on the 2014 January topic. 

I see very little ground for aff on this resolution, but I see literally no ground on your simplified version. You force them to argue that governments should act directly against their own interests. Why the hell else would a government do something? Your interpretation eliminates all econ arguments, all foreign relations arguments, all moral obligation arguments, all national security arguments, all xenophobia solvency arguments, all isis related arguments, etc. - because the government has a national interest in all of those things.

Also, the fact that it took a pretty long reddit post to explain all of this only shows that novices are going to have a hard time understanding their own advocacy. ",Debate,False,,t3_3n63z6,randomdebateaccount,1443763291,0,t3_3n63z6,,13,,13,1446722573

Here's another independent research report. This one is pretty obvious.

http://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/

&gt;After the ban, clearly homicide rates bounce around over time, but there is only one year (2010) where the homicide rate is lower than it was in 1996.  The immediate effect was about a 50 percent increase in homicide rates.   The homicide rate only began falling when there was a large increase in the number of police officers during 2003 and 2004.   Despite the huge increase in the number of police, the murder rate still remained slightly higher than the immediate pre-ban rate.

Well ?

IDK, what am I the euro-police ?

Let's start with the least disputed assertion and furthest back in time: all modern human beings evolved in Africa and spread from there.  As a result, exactly 0 human beings are 100% indigenous to Europe, if you are willing to go back far enough, and I see nothing in the definition of indigeneity that requires you don't.

But if that's too far in the past, then before, during, and after glaciation, you have multiple migrations of people into Europe, with newer groups displacing or admixing with prior inhabitants.  They fall in three groups: hunter-gatherers; farmers from the Middle East; and northern Eurasians.  My understanding is that the Northern Eurasians were not the bringers of Indo European languages and that came later, but I am not sure about this.

&gt;Or are you a gun control American who thinks everywhere else does everything better?

Having travelled a lot and lived in other countries, I think there's a lot of things that other places do better than America.  Health care, education and corrections are a few examples.

&gt;Guns have been a part of American culture since the founding of the nation. They're part of a national identity here, our first military was pretty much militia. I'm not saying this is unique to America, but it certainly is not shared by most other developed nations. Different cultures, guys.

This is such complete horseshit, and it amuses me whenever Americans bring it up as serious point.  Do you think Australia was settled and effectively conquered using sticks and harsh language?  Did the British have an empire over a quarter of the Earth using pitchforks?  What the hell was Napolean telling his troops to use?

It makes it all the more amusing to me when people get the second amendment tattooed on their foreheads.  It was written at a time when the US was under very real threat from various sources (the British, Indians, other European Powers), and needed a method of quickly raising some sort of armed force.

There's two parts to it, and the second is what all the gun ~~nuts~~ responsible owners and enthusiasts know by heart - the right of the people to bear and keep arms shall not be infringed.

People seem to forget the first part - a *well regulated militia*.  A militia is exactly what it sounds like, and well regulated typically means:

- Consistent types of weapons, ammunition and interchangeable parts for effective logistics during battle (which was a major problem back then because of varying manufacture quality and technology).

- Training and discipline on the part of those who were to be part of that militia.  Regulation also extends to when and where it is appropriate to be armed, and under what conditions those weapons can be fired.

As a typical thing - why is it so many people are aware of their *rights*, but apparently nothing about their *responsibilities*?",AskReddit,False,,t3_3n689g,MexicanSpaceProgram,1443773138,0,t1_cvlfsma,,2,,2,1446723495

If you actually look at the replays, the entire game he tried to make plays on faker. Every time they panned mid, he was jumping in to do damage and harass his azir, which he actually did a pretty good job of while still farming well. The whole point of the match up is that LeBlanc is immensely stronger than azir early game but as azir gets levels/items, he can avoid getting bursted and deal enough return damage that he can win. Neither of them roamed very much at all, faker trying to just farm and get items, Ryu trying to get a kill and snowball his way out of the lane. It didn't work as well as he wanted cause he never got the blow up he wanted, but if you think about it, if he roamed and didn't get a kill, which given how skt is one of the best teams in the world, it's not like you can just go bot and dive for nothing, azir would be up farm and levels, and then he'd be behind as an assassin, pretty much guaranteeing lack of any kill pressure.

La esencia y el origen de Podemos está en la calle, en las plazas, en las redes sociales, tan sólo explicando la dramática realidad de millones de trabajadores y desempleados.

He llegado a pensar que los mítines multitudinarios no son necesarios para Podemos y suponen un desgaste enorme y una pérdida de frescura para los compañeros que nos representan que debieran estar a otra cosa.

He llegado a pensar que hay que aliviar el peso sobre las espaldas de Pablo Iglesias que debe continuar dando su excelente batalla en el Parlamento Europeo.

Y no sólo eso, hay que dar la batalla en el mercado mundial globalizado.

No es de recibo que estemos en competencia con economías como la de Korea del Sur cuyo estado subvenciona, por poner un ejemplo los astilleros, y aquí la Unión Europea multe al estado español por ayudar a los astilleros de Cádiz.

They're class indicators.  Though I'm aware black people think that's their word.  A black guy I worked with from Georgia was very amused to hear me use that word about Florida and I don't think he'd ever heard it used that way.


White trash is self explanatory, but my understanding of the etymology of the word is that Europeans used it to describe the early settlers of Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia, who in turn used it to describe people from Florida.  The term originated from the use of whips to move livestock.  Black America adopted it for the same reason as a reference to abuses under slavery.

In 1978, Jorge Dominguez, a Cuban born professor at Harvard University said: “Cuba is a small country, but it has a big country’s foreign policy. It has tried to carry out such a policy since the beginning of the revolution, but only in the second half of the 1970s did it have conditions to become a visible and important factor actually shaping the course of events.”

In the same year Henry Kissinger, a United States politician, said: “It is time to overcome the ridiculous myth of the invincible Cubans. Whoever heard of Cubans conducting a global foreign policy?”

So let’s be clear, Cuban medical programmes alone have reached more people around the world than all of the G8, World Health Organisation and Médecins Sans Frontieres programmes combined, and have been doing so since the early 1970s. This is well documented in Studies of the Americas - Cuban Medical Internationalism by John M. Kirk and H. Michael Erisman and is known throughout the world. However, it is not necessarily reported by Western media. Despite the consequences of the blockade, the free and universal healthcare in Cuba is ranked with the best in the world. Healthcare in Cuba is defined as a human right, unlike in other countries. 
Nice try but Cuba kicks ass in terms of medical research, technology, and applications. Globally recommended actually.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/salim-lamrani/cubas-health-care-system-_b_5649968.html 

This is also the case when it comes to education. Not only have the Cuban people benefited from achievements in education, but they have exported literacy programmes across Latin American. In 1961, the Literacy Campaign resulted in eradicating illiteracy in less than a year.

Dublin 2 is effectively dead. If Germany is willing to take refugees, then they should be able to apply for asylum to Germany in Greece.

That said we should do better. We should formally end Dublin 2, and make it so that requests for asylum are performed at a EU level (or Schengen). In this manner it wouldn't matter where you apply, as you could apply in Greece and end up in Austria, or apply in Germany and end up in Romania. 

This would kill two birds with one stone. End the current pilgrimage towards richer countries, and drastically reduce the number of economic migrants.

As for the method of assignment of refugees to each country, that would then be an internal matter, which we would discuss and try to solve in different ways. But the removing that control from the hands of migrants I'd of utter most importance and we could do it now. It would help us all.

Brevik, August 2012, was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism. While mentally ill, he was politically motivated and his actions were intended further his beliefs.  

Per wikipedia ""On the day of the attacks, Breivik electronically distributed a compendium of texts entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, describing his far-right militant ideology. In them, he lays out a worldview encompassing Islamophobia and opposition to feminism.The texts call Islam and Cultural Marxism the enemy, argue for the violent annihilation of Eurabia and multiculturalism and advocate deportation of all Muslims from Europe based on the model of the Beneš decrees.Breivik wrote that his main motive for the atrocities was to market his manifesto.Breivik has later identified himself as a fascist, stating that he previously exploited counterjihadist rhetoric in order to protect ethno-nationalists.""

0,t5_2qorf,cvliuz8,"&gt; Has US foreign policy always been as literally Orwellian as it was with Syria? 

Yes.  It's never been about 'peace and democracy'. It's all about increasing the sphere of influence for American business interests and political power. 

A few examples:

Iran.  Iran, or Persia, was a political football between Russia and British interests prior the beginning of the 20th century. British government continuously interfered with political processes in that country, helping Raza Shah maintain monarchical rule of the country and prevent democracy from being established. In return the Shah helped maintain the 'concession' for Iranian oil with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which is now called BP.  After WW2 the Iranian people managed to kick out Shah and hold democratic elections.  The new government ended the AIOC relationship, which prompted the British government to come to USA and complain about the potential for communism in Iran.  The then-new CIA hired a Iranian general, which was a ex-Nazi sympathizer and was imprisoned by the British by the end of WW2, to lead a military coup against the constitutional government. This failed. The CIA then took a much more active role, went to the country, and helped the general hire enough people to attempt a second coup. The second attempt succeeded. The elected president was imprisoned, many people in government were also arrested or executed. They then brought the Shah's son and put him in charge of the country.  

The condition the USA put on the return of the Shah and AIOCP (BP) was that the monopoly had to released.  As a result AIOCP (BP) had to share Iran with Gulf Oil (mostly Chevron), Royal Dutch Shell, Standard oil of California (Chevron),  Standard Oil of New Jersey (Exxon) and Texaco (Chevron).


Another fun CIA one was the Iran-Contra affair in the 1980's. 

USA had a policy for many years, since at least the Panama Canal, to interfer with the politics of Central and South America. The cumulated in the 1970's and 80's with the military support and training of the Contra counter-revolutionaries.  When it became widely known that Contras were using their USA-supplied weapons and training to carry out their somewhat genocidal tendencies against the populations of Honduras, Nicaragua and surrounding countries then it became unpopular to support them in the USA.  As a result Congress passed a bill that effectively required the executive branch to get approval before funding any more activities in the region. 

To work around this Reagan and friends hatched a scheme were they would use Israel to sell weapons to Iran to help fuel the Iran-Iraq war. This was after the people turned to the Muslims as a way to kick the USA out of the country in 1970's.  During this time the USA was secretly supplying weapons and support to both sides of the conflict in the hope that 'Seven Sisters' oil companies could maintain domination over the oil supply in the region. 

They then used the money they received from the Isreal-Iran arm sales to then fund the support of the Contras. 

Once the Reagan administration got busted doing this they set Oliver North up as the fall guy.

After losing their monetary support from Iran arms deals the CIA turned to drug sales to fund their international scheming. 

One of the more well documented examples of this is how they helped smuggle cocaine into USA intercities and used gangs there to sell it. This contributed significantly to the crack epidemic in the late 80's and early 90's. This caused massive influx of money into the gangs which resulted in peak of gun violence and a massive increase in black male youth mortality around 1995 or so.


The Syrian 'revolution', which spawned ISIS, itself is probably related to the two things... the discovery of the Leviathan gas fields off the cost of Syria and Isreal in the 2000's; and then the Iranian pipeline that was planed to go through northern Iraq and into Syrian. 

This, I believe is part of a concerted effort that included the USA-sponsored political coup in Ukraine, which overthrew Viktor Yanukovych's administration in 2014.  Massive pipelines run through Ukraine between Russia and the rest of Europe.

In the wake of Fukushima disaster countries like Germany and France significantly curtailed their nuclear power programs. This combined with the 'Global Warming' scares and 'Green Initiatives' means that they are now going to be massively dependent on Natural gas to meet the energy needs of Europe. 

ISIS/Syria/Ukraine/etc is probably being done to limit Russia's growing political power in the region.  The economic dependence between Germany and Russia has been significantly troublesome for American ambitions in the region for the past couple decades.  

The idea that Europe would be even more dependent on Gazprom for all of it's energy needs is probably something that USA Federal government considers completely unacceptable. 


Another fun and more modern example is how the USA military is used to guard the production of opium in Afghanistan. The claim is made that this is necessary because this is the source of income of many Afghanistan farmers and that the USA is dependent on their support to help fight the Taliban. USA policy is supposed to be one of stopping the drug trade through interdiction, after the opium gets sold to the smugglers. For whatever reason this isn't working out so well...

Although I agree about defensive issues we don't really concede more than other top teams in Europe and we score fair amount of goals. We dominate in the games even if we don't win them. 

When it comes to club recognition (if that is what we want to consider which is something completely different from performance even though both things depend on each other) [Forbes puts Borussia at 11th of most valuable clubs at the moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes'_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs) and almost on par with Milan whose value drops from year to year as opposed to growing (faster than De Bruyne's salary) BVB value. 

Also on another note, integration of youth prospects into the first team is actually something top clubs rarely do. They need performance right away from established players therefore won't take time to introduce youngsters. Now it looks like even Bayern decided to go this direction as well. Apart from Alaba I can't think of any other youngsters they integrated in recent years. 

Also being even in the top 20 clubs is already big deal. Think of how many clubs are there... If we don't spent like Real it doesn't mean we are not a big club. Bayern doesn't spend as much as Real either.

0,t5_2qkli,cvlj9jh,"Jeremy Corbyn has shelved a proposal to scrap university tuition fees, while he consults the rest of the Labour party — a process that risks diluting the radical programme he set out in the summer leadership race.

The new leader of the opposition said only weeks ago that he would raise £10bn through higher taxes in order to remove fees and restore student grants.

It was his first major policy statement and helped build support among young left-wingers. It would have been funded by either a 2.5 per cent rise in corporation tax or a 7 per cent increase in national insurance for those earning more than £50,000 a year.
But one member of the shadow cabinet said that the policy would now be consulted on more widely: “It’s like everything else from Jeremy’s leadership campaign, it doesn’t automatically become policy.”
That means that Labour’s formal policy on tuition fees has not changed since the run-up to the general election in May. Ed Miliband, the party’s previous leader, promised to cut the maximum fees in England from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, at the cost of £2.7bn — funded by charging the highest earning graduates more for student loans.
Mr Corbyn said during the summer that he wanted to apologise on behalf of Labour to the last generation of students who had to pay fees.
Now, the issue of university debt will have to take its chances in the party’s long and complicated policymaking process, regardless of the new leader’s views.

“All policy is up for discussion and there is a review of how we will set policy in the future,” said Mr Corbyn’s spokesman.
Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the Labour leader’s commitment to abolish tuition fees had been particularly welcome because of worries that fees would leave students with a “lifetime of debt”.
“What students, parents and university staff really need is for politicians to set out a clear long-term plan for the stable funding of higher education in England,” Ms Hunt said. “We will contribute positively on that basis to any review by Labour or the other parties”.

The government said this summer that it would allow some universities to raise fees in line with inflation if they could demonstrate excellence in teaching and be more transparent about how the money is spent. Universities, worried about cuts to higher education funding in this autumn’s review of government spending, welcomed the move.

More video
Labour’s back and forth approach to fees highlights the gulf between Mr Corbyn’s rhetoric during the leadership campaign and the reality of life as leader of the opposition.
Mr Corbyn has already been forced into declaring his full support for Britain staying in the EU.

He has abandoned plans to nationalise the “big six” energy companies, another cornerstone of his summer campaign.
He is also fighting overt hostility from his own MPs to his anti-Trident stance, with several shadow cabinet members criticising him for saying that he would never use Britain’s nuclear weapons if he were prime minister.
But Mr Corbyn has promised to abide by the decisions made by Labour: “Our party as a whole will decide,” he said this week.
Without compromises there would be “constant internal strife”, one ally admitted.

The only issue where he appears to brook no dissent is on his stance against the government’s austerity programme: Labour is likely to oppose almost all the cuts in the spending review.
But John McDonnell, the new shadow chancellor, has promised that he will cut the deficit — even if his methods would be different to those of the current government.

However, I do have some friends who have studied Chinese in China and have written HSK6/HSK5 and they didn't really agree with what was in the article. (Some of my points are shaped by what they've said). *Especially* the nouns bit.

&gt;  u know that i strongly believe this is the case

The answer to this is simple : You yourself on this very thread have mentioned that you want to get to a native like level. That's a really high bar you've set, so it's going to be hard. On /r/languagelearning there are people doing the same with Arabic, Persian, Japanese, etc for years, looking to get to a native level. On the other hand there are plenty of people who are content with being competent, proficient or fluent. There are *0* scientific studies to suggest that Mandarin is objectively harder.

&gt;  i still think that arabic would be easier for me to take to a translator level than chinese.

You'd actually have to learn at least *two* varieties of Arabic to be a translator, IIRC - 'Dialect' and Standard. And the Standard version is based on Classical Arabic, which is over 1000 years old. It's like having to learn Old English *and* modern English to be a translator in English. Or knowing Classical Chinese and having to translate Hokkien while learning Mandarin. Anyway, I don't agree with you for the same reasons I consistently state.

&gt;  also finish, hungarian, polish. turkish is pretty ez as far as i know/heard. 

Conversational level? Native level? Translator level? More info needed to make an accurate comparison, because you've specified learning Chinese to a native level. Whereas you might've heard this from people who are content with being conversational. (Also, Polish is Indo European.)

Uiteraard is er in Nederland oorlogsschade geleden, hebben we de Hongerwinter gehad en is een groot deel van de Joodse bevolking niet teruggekeerd. Dat wil ik ook niet bagatelliseren, maar er zijn landen die veel meer te verduren hebben gehad dan Nederland. Duitsland zelf is een goed voorbeeld, maar hetzelfde geldt voor Polen en de Baltische Staten.

Met name tijdens het begin van de Duitse bezetting was het dagelijks leven voor de meeste Nederlanders vrij normaal. Nadat de strijd in mei 1940 hier was gestreden keerde het dagelijks leven redelijk snel terug. Nederland werd niet beschouwd als *Lebensraum*, omdat we een ""Germaans broedervolk"" waren en in eerste instantie viel het met de onderdrukking dus erg mee. Het is helemaal niet zo dat er dagelijks mensen werden opgepakt en op straat werden gefusilleerd of dat de Duitsers hier een waar schrikbewind voerden tegen de normale bevolking. Dat was hun doel niet.

(Ik ga voorbij aan het verbieden van bepaalde organisaties, het oppakken van verzetsmensen en wegvoeren van Joden en dergelijke, maar ik heb het nu over wat de normale Nederlander er van merkte.)

Pas nadat de Amerikanen zich actief met de strijd gingen bemoeien kreeg Nederland weer te maken met de oorlog: eerst vanuit de lucht, en eind 1944 ook op de grond. De ergste oorlogsschade werd in de jaren 1943-1945 veroorzaakt, ironisch genoeg door de geallieerden. Rotterdam, Nijmegen, Arnhem en Enschede zijn gebombardeerd door de Amerikaanse 8e Luchtmacht, Den Haag door de RAF, Arnhem kreeg Market Garden over zich heen en het centrum van Groningen is door Canadese tanks aan puin geschoten om de Duitse troepen daar weg te krijgen.

&gt;Promote tax breaks for marriage.

You'll have to reimplement them first, they were ended in the budget.

&gt;Raise the threshold for inheritance tax.

Not sure this is relevant after zoto+ajubbajub's bill. I could be wrong.

&gt;Support the introduction of public work’s schemes for the long term unemployed.

&gt;End the funding of political parties by trade unions and business.

These are fine. I would prefer 'all money taken out of politics' - i.e no private donations of any kind.

&gt;Overhaul the trade union system, and create a National Labour Service to better ensure the representation of the working people at the national level.

Is... is this really necessary? I mean, I seem to remember Corbyn talking about some sort of Labour organisation being formed, but this seems a bit more drastic.

&gt;Nationalise the railways

literally b001

&gt;Promote fracking as a measure to move us away from foreign sources of energy.

This is daft.

&gt;Nationalise nuclear energy, taking it out of the hands of EDF, which is owned by the French Government.

I've already [addressed this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/3mtx6l/b179_national_nuclear_bill/cviaje2) on the bill itself. I don't disagree with the measure but your justification is dumb.

I actually like the rest of your energy + environment section, even if it isn't the most radical thing i've ever seen. Nice one.

&gt;Invest in our own arms industry.

for what purpose

&gt;The Vanguard will improve the gratitude of the country to ex-servicemen. Military service deserves greater recognition, and rather than focus on integrating ex-convicts into society, for example, we will focus on ensuring good pensions for ex-servicemen (not that the two are mutually exclusive) and promote schemes that will help find them jobs once they have left the army.

I mean, you said it yourself - 'not that the two are mutually exclusive'. I don't have any objection to better military reintegration into society, including a better range of mental health provisions. Not fussed about the patriotic aspect though.

&gt;Bring back National Service.

Meh.

&gt;We will commission a new Royal Yacht for Her Majesty, following the theft of the previous one by Tony Blair.

...Is this a meme?

&gt;Take a tougher stance against NATO adventurism across the world. British policy will come from London, not Washington or Brussels.

Good to see at least _one_ right wing party is consistent on this.

&gt;Strengthen our ties with the Commonwealth.

Pointless.

&gt;We will also increase pay for nurses.

Done in the budget.

&gt;Introduce fines on those who are in Accident and Emergency due to drinking related incidents.

I mean, i'm not saying it's the worst thing in the world, but it's not exactly fair - you could just be tipsy and fall down the stairs. If people are actually causing damage, they'll be done for being drunk and disorderly.

&gt;Ban gender reassignment surgery in both public and private practises.

Vindictive, counter-productive, and against the common consensus of medical opinion. I'm calling you fucking stupid right now.

&gt;Ban IVF treatment for homosexual couples, couples past the normal age for having babies, and reduced availability for everyone else. There are plenty of children that need adopting.

This is also vindictive and stupid. Beyond that, adoption isn't really a good solution - it's a very psychologically traumatic experience for both child (if old enough to remember), biological parent, and adoptive parent.

&gt;Significantly limit the so-called ‘right’ to abortion, except in cases where it threatens the mother’s life, and in cases of rape.

I don't even know what this is, you're not even a Christian party. Pretty embarrassing and archaic opinion to have.

&gt;Stand against attempts to promote suicide as a legitimate option in our health care.

Eh. If we're talking euthanasia for the terminally ill with the backing of multiple doctors, I don't see what the problem is. Otherwise, sure, but nobody is _promoting_ suicide.

&gt;We will introduce a points based system, as well as a cap on how many migrants we take in.

We already have this for non-EU migration.

&gt;Remove any traces of the concept of jus soli into Britain.

This is illegal under international law.

&gt;Make it more difficult for asylum seekers to find permanent residence here.

Vindictive and unnecessary.

&gt;Introduce voluntary repatriation schemes.

WE FULL BNP NOW!

&gt;Promote more police on the beat, to utilise close relationships with the community. We wish to see less on desk jobs, making police work more ‘common sense’ and less focused on quotas.

This is good, i think.

&gt;Take a tougher stance on drug dealers, as it is a great social evil that primarily affects the poor.

It's not really one which affects the UK after the drug reform bill.

&gt;Support the reintroduction of the death penalty.

Embarrassing and illegal under international law.

&gt;Never support private ownership of prisons.

Fine.

&gt;Support the use of penal labour.

The way you mentioned it sounds too much like slave labour. No thanks.

&gt;Never support giving prisoners the ability to vote.

Right wing populism - i.e, stupid.

&gt;Get rid of the Supreme Court and re-establish the judicial functions of the House of Lords.

I don't really see the point.

Your education slide is completely lacking in content.

&gt;Strengthen the House of Lords

Lol.

&gt;Replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights.

More right wing populism. Completely pointless.

&gt;End civil marriage

...didn't you advocate marriage tax breaks earlier?

&gt;Work to revive the Church of England as a central pillar in the national community, and reject secularisation

Bit late for that.

&gt;Take a tougher stance on drugs, including alcohol.

Vague.

&gt;Champion days of celebration for our national heritage, including great military parades.

Pointless.

Overall, a resounding 'meh'. There are some good policies, there are some bad policies, there are some stupid policies. You've somehow managed to make yourself look sane in comparison to UKIP's manifesto this year, although, and you're not going to like this, but your manifesto now has _significant_ overlap with the BNP, which (considering the amount you go on about not being the BNP), you probably didn't want to happen. 5/10, losing points for basically just editing the manifesto you already had, as well as some policies already implemented etc.

0,t5_2rfxx,cvllevw,"I kind of agree with your point, although I don't think FIFA are the best example. I would say, although it's pretty subjective, that the 'rules' of football have changed lots of times over the last 80 years.

For example watch Brazil's games in the 1966 World Cup - Europe essentially played a near-full-contact version of football that south america had never played, and nobody told the regining champions. That got absolutely battered and the referees did nothing. Then in 1970 Brazil turned up with a team that not only outclassed the europeans technically but could also match them physically - and they cruised to victory once again.

Same with the champs league in the late 2000s and early 2010s I'd say - the 'meta' revolved around parking the bus and trying to nick a goal in 2-legged ties (watch Celtic vs AC Milan in the last 16, for example, or Chelsea vs Barcelona in the 2009 semi final, or barca vs man utd in the 2008 semi final, or countless other games) and imo the 'rules' were changed (as in the referees were encouraged to give more fouls/cards for 'professional' fouls and contact) and suddenly parking the bus was no longer effective.

It's exactly the same thing, there are just different ways of achieving it. Football has RULES that never change, but interpretation that can change drastically, while LoL can change the rules but those rules are absolute once they're in place - since there's no referee.

So imo it's comparable - when football goes through a prolonged period of low-score games at the highest level, changes are made. They make the ball lighter and less predictable in the air, they make defending harder by punishing aggression, they adjust the leniency with regards to the 10-yards rule for free kicks, or what constitutes a foul when jostling for a corner, or the extent to which the attacker is given the 'benefit of the doubt' in offside decisions, or countless other little factors.

Like it or not, ""idiotic garbage spectators"" are a big part of most modern sports, and so making the game exciting viewing and easy to watch (whether it be rugby, tennis, LoL, etc) is a priority.

Tignes has a few parts Val Claret, le Lac and way further down the mountain Les Brevieres.

Food can be mixed especially if going half board, favourite spot for food would be Hotel l'Arbina in Tignes le Lac,

Overall - great skiing, large spread out resort. Very popular for New Years. Can be colder/windier than other resorts.

Haven't stayed in El Tarter but was in neighbouring Soldeu. Loved the skiing there, stayed in the Soldeu Maistre food wasn't great, so ate across the road alot in a lovely small hotel Bruxelles or the European famous tapas bar La Catela.

Went to ski school for the first time in about 15 years and would highly recommend it. Also package deals to Andorra can work out quite well, we got ski+ for €900 - flights, transfers, half board, lift pass, ski hire and ski school for the 1st week in Jan.

2nd week of Jan seemed to be the best value of the season but if it's just the two of you then you could pick when you want to go and just keep an eye on the weather/conditions/prices and decide based on that as last year was a late start to the season there was very little snow until mid/late Jan.",skiing,False,,t3_3n7dfl,bunsen72,1443790353,0,t3_3n7dfl,,2,,2,1446725728

There are two major schools of Islam, Sunni and Shia, but within these there's a lot of wiggle room for interpretation of scripture by scholars and prayer leaders. Scholars go through a long university-like process of study to become scholars (in fact the Western European model of university was drawn from the model set by the Caliphate's academies for law and religious study, originating in 910 AD century with Cairo's Al-Azhar), while Imams (prayer leaders) are usually lay persons who are elevated from the congregation by their ability to lead their peers. 

Consequently Islam functions like the structure of academia. Just as we don't have a world chief sociologist, there's no world chief of Islam; issues are debated by different groups of scholars who often have competing agendas and interpretations of Islamic scripture. 

&gt; I see plenty of talk about European imperialism and empire, but not so much about Islam as a force for the same, when I feel it's kind of obvious it was at numerous points in history

Excuse? Are you dim? I said that we in the fucking west are the reason that there is so much fucking violence in Africa. Also I never excused the violence but said that it stems from different things, that does not make the violence in any shape or form better.

&gt; Violence is violence no matter your bias.

Right, so why can't you accept there is proof that countries with stricter gun lawys have less violent crimes with guns involved?

&gt;  You're also biased against guns or scared of guns so it's not like anybody can have a serious conversation with you about them.

Nope I couldn't actually care less abot guns. I don't see many reasons to own one sure. But I'm not scared of a thing, if at all I would be scared of the person wielding the gun.

&gt; You're 100% wrong about guns being used only to kill. I bet your politicians are protected by people with guns. Their children. Your queen.

A gun when used has the purpose to kill. A bodyguard having a gun is only protecting because of the inherit threat that he will use the gun against you if you dare to threaten the person he protects. Still the usage of a gun is to kill.

Same goes for all pure weapons that ever existed. They are tools to kill, not to protect. For example a sword is only a good sword if it can kill, it's a tool for killing. Same goes for a gun, no matter how many times you try to deny it.

Why not ask over phone. I don't have a good answer to that one. I just get extremely anxious thinking that. I was considering it couple times.

The question you have to ask yourself is, wether you want to have anything to do with Colonial Empires or Trade.   
Playing as a north american or mesoamerican native is worse without Conquest of Paradise and/or El Dorado respectively.   
  
If you don't want to play in the Americas as European or especially as a native you can skip CoP and El Dorado. Though El Dorado also adds the nation designer, (but I don't necessarily recommend starting to play the game with custom nations.)  
  
If you don't want to play a merchant republic such as The Hansa, Venice or Genoa you can skip Res Publica without feeling bad (since more important features of that expansion are also in either Art of War or Common Sense.)

0,t5_2qh53,cvlp2mr,"Well, we still going to include all victims of the genocide as victims HaShoah (I won't be disincluding them), but you make a good point about understanding the different underpinnings of the violence of each group. Gypsies and Jews were targeted differently and for different reasons, but share some similarities when compared to gays and the 'mentally defective.' It certainly was a lot easier for the Nazi regime to identify specific cultures than specific individuals.

My takeaway from all of this is twofold. The first is just how organized and planned out this genocide was. No other genocides were so specifically and deliberately outlined, prepared, and implemented. This took years of work. That's pretty horrifying.

The other takeaway for me is the willful blindness of the rest of the world. My grandparents told me that, despite not even living in Europe (we're Baltimoreans), they knew what was going on even before war broke out, but no one in the government would listen to them. All across Europe, closeted antisemites became sympathizers (many in prominent places in society and government), and everyone else just pretended it was Germany's problem or refused to see what was happening. They most certainly refused to see what this was all leading up to. It seems that what people cared most about was Germanic expansionism and aggression, and they're threat to continental Europe. What the government did to their own citizens, well everyone took a 'not my circus, not my monkeys' approach (this is a metaphor, not an implication that Jews were believed to be monkeys by all Europeans.

And we turn our backs again and again. Civil wars in Africa? Not our problem. That continent is unsalvageable (assuming it is not believed to be a single country, which it sometimes is, blatantly or unconsciously). The Middle East? Whatever, just don't try to seek shelter here in our country. Civil wars in South America? Well, as long as the winning team isn't communist.

And baaaam! Next big issue! I really should get a superpac or build a Wall at some borders.. ;))))))

And your violence culture. Here in Europe, buying sex at brothels is open for everyone if you are at least 18 years old. The health system is basically free in most of the European unions states and We do have a lot of guns, but mostly with strict laws. Just look at Switzerland. Everybody owns a gun. By law. And no mass shootings or killings. (Ok, the gun suicide rate is among the highest)

We also have a lot of guns here in austria. Believe me. (Btw: We started BOTH WW) - but without the Drama and violence. 

At least i can say: i own a gun. I can carry it wherever and whenever i want to. I go to university for free. I go to the ER for free. Meds are also basically for free. We do get mental help in our health system for free... (Ok, it is shit, but there is a base service.) - ok - you are crazy - no gun. You have been crazy - you are healthy - maybe gun, just for home defense. Depends on your problems.

I think the main difference is that We DO live in another system.  It is called socio-economic-system. Not pure capitalism. And capitalism honors the most brutal one who achieves the most. And then this is the outcome for a society.

Dont get me wrong. I study economics. In my mind setup i am a pure super capitalist. But it is my setup. It shouldnt be for everyone. Because, down to the bottom, it is AS you said very brutal. But i love the game, i love the hunt of the next deal. Its ideal for me. But i am sure it isnt for everyone.

And then without a proper mental health system, a culture that supports violence and getting a gun around the corner without background checks (trade shows) - this is a proper outcome.

I love america. I love the people, i love the capitalism. I love the beautiful scenery of your various states....

But i dont love the overwhelming violence.

0,t5_2ssp3,cvlpm42,"This question is beyond the very general statement that the Holocaust (as in the expropriation, murder, imprisonment, and forced labor of European Jewry and Europe's Roma and Sinti) paid for itself and generate excess capital, unfortunately not really possible to answer.


There is several problems associated with it:


The first is sources. Despite the stereotype of the efficient, record-keeping Nazi, sources concerning many topics still remain incomplete.


The second is what might be called the Byzantine structure of Nazi agencies. The SS for example, although fused with the police from 1936 on, still got part of its budget from the coffers of the NSDAP party, which in turn financed itself partly from governmental resources, partly from private resources. Additionally, the SS did create companies that profited from concentration camps and in return used that money to invest in new projects, including camps. The Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke GmbH (DEST) would be such an example.


The third is, what to include in that question. The whole story of expropriation is still under research and new questions concerning the history of art pieces, property etc. still arise to this day. Economist Syndey Zabludoff writes that ""(I)n late-1930s prices, the value of Jewish assets amounted to $10-$15 billion. This estimate is based on a 1998 paper by this author; its methodology draws on the pioneering efforts of Nehemiah Robinson in the 1940s and 1950s and other material. This includes estimates of the Jewish share of wealth for each country in Nazi-occupied Europe, tax records, country estimates published at the time, and the asset declarations that the Nazis forced the Jews to file. (...) In today’s prices (2005) the value of these Jewish assets would be some $143-$215 billion."" [Source](http://jcpa.org/article/restitution-of-holocaust-era-assets-promises-and-reality/)


The fourth is corruption and the camp system. The camp administrations used the property of dead Jews to make money, up to selling gold teeth of dead Jews to the company Degussa. However, a lot of that also went into the pockets of the people involved. So much so, that the SS themselves tried a couple of them for corruption.


If we however narrow the scope of inquiry a bit, there might be a limited and approximate answer to your question. Oswald Pohl of the SS's Economic and Adminsitration Main Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt, WVHA) estimated in 1941 that a Concentration Camp inmate would bring in a profit of 1629 RM when doing forced labor in a camp for nine months. This included not only the income from renting them to companies but also ""assets"" such as his gold teeth etc. (Document printes in: Eugen Kogon, Der SS-Staat, München 2002, p.361) Of that 1629 RM, 0,30 went to Reich ministry of Finance from 1.4.1940 on.


The next thing is slightly problematic because the number given by Pohl certainly changed over the course of the next two years but just to give an approximate answer to your question, let's apply these numbers to the number of prisoners in the Concentration Camps. In  August 1944 the official number for CC inmates is given as 524.286 (Source: Michael Grüttner: Das Dritte Reich. 1933–1939, Stuttgart 2014, p. 162). That would make the total earnings of the SS 854.061.894 RM and those of the Reich Finance Ministry 256.218.568 RM. In comparison, the spending on armaments in previous year, 1943, was according to Wolfram Fischer (Deutsche Wirtschaftspolitik 1918-1945, Opladen 1968, p. 102) about 117 billion RM. 


However, the numbers above are certainly not entirely correct since not every CC inmate was working and Pohl's estimate from 1941 probably isn't applicable to 1944.

Also, it doesn't take into account a lot more stuff such as how much money the SS spend on maintaining the camps, paying guards, the sale of Jewish property and so on. Still, I hope this will give you an approximate impression of the German earnings from the Holocaust.

To learn how a dead language sounded, linguists study its living descendants. They compare how corresponding words sound in the different languages and establish specific rules describing how the different sounds have changed over time. These rules also serve to reconstruct an idea of how the language formerly sounded.

And in the case of languages with surviving literature, the text helps to an extent, but it isn't enough on its own. For example, Latin writing didn't distinguish long and short vowels.

US: Want the region stable enough not to collapse Iraq/Jordan/Lebanon, but not stable enough to see a clear leader. They want a permanent no man's lands, so most regional terror is contained in a country they have no interests in.

Assad: Long term ruler (edit: from) a minority Islamic sect. Pretty bad guy, but very similar to Hussein - bad in power, but worse when removed. 

ISIS: Batshit insane Sunni rebels. Their breed of vitriolic religious fanaticism is highly appealing to anti west Muslims, which is why they can lure foreign fighters there and entrap them. No chance in hell of ever legitimately governing, but it is very hard to quash a resistance movement with popular support without engaging them.

'Pro West rebels': Not pro west at all, just not anti west. Being centrist moderates for the most part, they don't have much popular dedicated support, much like our own political support (politics is emotional, not rational). Funded and supported by the West, but with limited local backing.

Kurds: Old regional enemies of Assad (and everyone). Supported by the West and very supported by the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Iraq, they have suffered a lot with the loss of Mosul and the pershwaga are at the forefront of resisting ISIS. No regional support means that any resolution is unlikely to be in their favour.

Turkey: Syria's neighbor and rival. Doesn't like the instability on its border and the resulting refugee crisis they must endure, but is too busy settling old scores with the Kurds to make any serious attempt at helping. Will be a key broker in any talks.

Hezbollah: Iran's paid bunch of soldiers from Lebanon. Both being Shi'ites, the rapid spread of ISIS terrifies them as they are fundamentally opposed (think crusades style conflict). Well trained and experienced, their brigades are in support of Assad, but probably not fully so

Saudi (and rest of gulf) The Saudi government is very opposed to ISIS and has joined attacks against them, mainly as they are really destabilising the region. However, being mostly Sunni, there are a few very wealthy backers of ISIS from here (and other miscellaneous rebels).

Al Nusra front: what remains of Al-Queda in Syria. Very extremist Sunni group, but opposed to ISIS. No one's ally, with very limited support/territory - ISIS success had eclipsed them!

Israel:The devil of the middle east. Actually a beneficiary of this conflict (sorta), as Hezbollah are distracted in Syria and everyone else is too! Still, they worry about possible ISIS success and what happens to all those battle hardened brigade strength Hezbollah soldiers after the war.

Iran: Long term enemy of the West, kinda brought in from the cold as a de facto ally against ISIS. Any peace process is going to have to involve Turkey, Iran, Saudi and Assad (and therefore by proxy, Russia),  and America and Europe of course!

Europe: Lastly, Europe all together. They haven't been that active so far, but getting more drawn in as the extent of the refugee crisis hits them. Very wary to actually put troops on the ground after Iraq, but desperately want this crisis over (unlike US)

Some other smaller players (Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, China) all have an input to this as well, but a very minor one

Tl;Dr This crisis has gotten very messy, with all the regional actors having very opposed views as to how to solve it. Don't expect a solution in the next few years!

Edit: missed Russia out as I'm a ditz. Russia is playing the usual geopolitics. Freed of need for public or international opinion, Russia can go balls deep into the conflict on the side of their ally, Assad. They are going to bomb the crap out of ISIS and the pro west rebels, as both oppose Assad. The Kurds will probably get a pass as they are vaguely an ally of Assad at the moment (ie they both have bigger fights to worry about). Russia is a game changer - they will probably provoke the West into having a stronger response, just to compete with Russia's 'humanitarian' response.",worldnews,1443831929,,t3_3n7hj7,vulcanstrike,1443799149,0,t3_3n7hj7,,192,,192,1446728090

Clinton is leading comfortably over Sanders and imo Sanders most attractive thing is his student loan policy. If he comes out and say he is gonna raise taxes Clinton's lead will go higher.

Oh the same republican party that has stopped Obama on his heels in the Congress since 2008 is now weak? There's a bigger chance of Trump bulding a wall between the US and Mexico than Sanders being president.

Não há médicos e enfermeiros? Isso é simples de resolver, apenas temos de ter em conta o sistema idiota da média de 18 valores na faculdade de medicina e tentar licenciar mais médicos capazes e habilidosos, bem como investir no sistema de saúde. Tudo isso é possível sem aumentar muito a natalidade.

Eu estou ciente do que se passa tanto no Japão como na Europa e mesmo assim não vejo porque não haveríamos de resolver os problemas que temos - Eu não acho que imigração em massa vá resolver o problema - Como disse mais acima em resposta a outro membro, em primeiro lugar nem todos os imigrantes vem para ficar, e em segundo lugar nós assistimos de momento à segregação prática na Europa dos imigrantes e estilos de vida diferentes com culturas diferentes - A maioria das pessoas casam com pessoas da mesma etnia e cultura, e como quem cuida dos idosos normalmente são os filhos da mesma família acho pouco provável que muitos imigrantes consigam de facto resolver o problema que temos com o envelhecimento, já para não falar que dado que os imigrantes procriam em média mais que os nativos temos a hipótese de daqui a muitas décadas ter população a mais como aconteceu com a China.

As medidas são possíveis e óbvias, só é preciso coragem para as tomar. É muito bonito dizer que a reforma pertence por direito às pessoas, mas se for preciso cortar nas mais altas para assegurar às pessoas com menos rendimento alguma dignidade, eu não dúvido que essa seja a melhor medida económica, social e moral.

Um problema que noto na tua análise e de outros membros é que estão essencialmente a usar como único critério o bem-estar dos idosos Europeus - Não que isso não seja importante, nada disso, mas é preciso pensar com os horizontes alargados e a longo prazo - Se considerarmos que, como já disse, o mundo ocidental está em crise e a Europa poderá ter conflitos e crises políticas nas próximas décadas por causa de muita coisa (vejamos o que está a acontecer na Grécia com a Golden Dawn e na França com a Mrs. Marine Le Penn), é muito imoral e até irracional trazer muitas crianças para o continente quando o mundo em si está sobrepopulado.",portugal,False,,t3_3n87hk,Riddle0219,1443799548,0,t1_cvlq3ck,,1,,1,1446728221

After America shot down an Iranian passenger jet in The Gulf, Iran commissioned Syria to return the favour. The Lockerbie bombing was the result.

Syria was always the main suspect for this until the second Gulf War came around. Suddenly America needed Syria not to intervene and provide support. Suddenly the focus of the Lockerbie investigation switches to Libya, newly discovered evidence linking Libya to the bombing appears out of nowhere, Syria is off the hook and supporting the Invasion of Iraq.

Iran continues to channel huge amounts of money through Syria to Palestinian causes, such as Hamas and to terrorist groups. 

As the West has done nothing in Syria, Putin is stepping into the vacuum to bolster Assad. He stated aim was to tackle ISIS, but he is also bombing the American-backed anti-Assad rebels. Iranian troops are on the way to the country. Western inaction has allowed a mighty clusterfuck to commence. Western countries were reluctant to do anything in the wake of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Syria was the war we should have got involved with, supporting anti-Assad forces when they first surfaced.

So in reality the principle goes like 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 14 great-great-grandparents, 29 great-great-great-grandparents so that there is some distant inbreeding.

So in practice we have much less individual ancestors than the mathematical doubling of individual ancestors per generation, and the likelihood of some of our ancestor being someone famous is actually pretty high.

EDIT: For example if one generation is 30 years, 30 generations is 900 years ago. If each of our ancestors were unrelated to each other, a European person would have 1 073 741 824 individual ancestors 900 years ago. That's over a billion.

You are right, Megafon has some nice price plans, but the problem is in this regional roaming thing I mentioned earlier: if you buy their sim-card in Moscow, the prices for calls, texts and data will be very high when you try to use the same sim-card in Saint Petersburg. That's why I would recommend to purchase Beeline or Yota: in case of Beeline the price for data traffic won't change, and for Yota nothing will change at all.

The info you found is not entirely current, at least for Megafon and Beeline. Cell providers update their price plans constantly, so it's hard to keep up :(. 

Consider this Beeline's option: ""Всё за 400"". For the price of 400 RUb (about 5 euros) you get 400 minutes of calls to Moscow region numbers, 100 sms (only in Moscow region, other destinations are charged extra) and 2GB of data nation-wide (well, not entire Russia, but the European part). ""Всё за 600"" - 650 minutes, 300 sms and 10GB of data. Price plan ""Интернет навсегда +  Хайвей 4 Гб"" doesn't have voice calls or sms, but it has 4Gb  of data for 400 RUB. ""Интернет навсегда +  Хайвей 8 Гб"" - 8Gb for 600 Rub.

Will that trend continue and eventually lead to English being a common language for people? Obviously this may be dependent on the USA continuing to be a dominant global power- Chinese is always a possibility, too. And while English is probably the most widespread language, [there are many other languages]  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_language#Living_world_languages) that have more speakers overall.

Edit: Please notice I used the word surprise. Not the phrase ""nothing to worry about"". The tone of the original article suggests that lack of work is the only factor influencing these numbers. That is incorrect. The article itself alludes to this when it mentions the rates of employment for adult men did not fall.

The US is demographically skewed, by proportion, towards the baby boom generation. So are many other countries with Western European historical arcs, re: demographic transition. Some portion of that generation is retiring and the rate of retirement will increase as a function of total number over retirement age (this number increases every year as long as mortality among those over 65 is less than those reaching 65).

Yes, there are other factors influencing total work force proportion. I chose one that has been expected for years. Which, in turn makes decreasing work force proportion unsurprising.

I see what they are getting at, but that blanket statement isn't syaing, ""Hey don't worry about believing, you'll still go to Heaven."" [Here is the article the quotes are taken from.](http://www.repubblica.it/cultura/2013/09/11/news/the_pope_s_letter-66336961/) This paragraph specifically.

&gt;Given that  -  and this is fundamental  -  God's mercy has no limits if he who asks for mercy does so in contrition and with a sincere heart, the issue for those who do not believe in God is in obeying their own conscience.  In fact, listening and obeying it, means deciding about what is perceived to be good or to be evil.  The goodness or the wickedness of our behavior depends on this decision.

The Pope said ""if he who asks for mercy"". That part is important, the rest follows this. That means the atheist still needs to seek out God. Then the Pope is saying that God has mercy on those who do seek Him out and will be judged on their conscience when they didn't believe. 

That last link to catholic.com was a much better interpration of the Pope's statements than the first two. it explained that everyone is saved by Jesus, which has always been Catholic doctrine, and God will judge based on how they lived. To expand on that, the atheist still needs to accept God, but when/if they do, God will judge their lives on the good they did, not when they converted.",worldnews,False,,t3_3n7pun,Colts56,1443803624,0,t1_cvlst5l,,0,,0,1446729603

0,t5_2qh4j,cvltq6l,"&gt;I hope so, the current situation is helping no-one, except maybe Putin and his buddies. The normal people on all sides are suffering.

It doesn't help anyone in government because they have to deal with the pressures of economic weakening, the embargo is essentially a canary for our economy, at least now serious thoughts have emerged on self-sufficiency,  and domestic brands are receiving a period of boost until EU products will be let in again. Ideally, domestic brands must use this headstart to make themselves more competitive with foreign brands, so when the sanctions are lifted, people could develop domestic brand loyalty to some extent.

&gt;When I grew up there was a lot of hate towards Russians, mostly because of the events of the wars. In the 90's and early 00's that improved a lot with trade and travel, but recent events (Georgia, Ukraine, trade sanctions, negative media attention) the sentiment has been going down and Russia is being viewed as a threat and not as a partner.

That's because Russia was not being treated as a partner at all since the collapse. We opened up and tried to get advice from Western neoliberal economists that were sent in from the US, they dismantled almost everything that we had left through that sham of a privatization scheme. When Yeltsin shelled Parliament, the West did not condemn him, when Berezovsky helped rig the 96 elections, US campaign advisers helped him do it, when Crimea had its first referendum, nobody batted an eye when they were shut down by Kiev. The only time that the West condemned Yeltsin was when he flew in Russian troops into Pristina during the NATO bombings of 
Yugoslavia and demanded a role in KFOR. And serious opposition began against Russia when Russian oligarchs were one-by-one either arrested or exiled. Then all of a sudden Mr. Tie Eater manages to rally an overthrow of government in Georgia, meeting with Colin Powell the day of his inauguration, followed by Ukraine 2 years later. Just like in Maidan these people promised smooth sailing ahead, in both countries their final rating was abysmal, all they managed to do is align themselves with American Republicans. How could Russia possibly believe that Western nations are partners, when there is very little semblance of good faith in foreign relations? 

And don't get me wrong, I don't consider Finland to be part of the states responsible for this situation, it's just that as you are a part of the EU you are targeted by the embargo as well, much like how Japan is a good potential economic partner if it wasn't lockstep with the US on foreign policy (not the best example, but the point is still there). Frankly I don't think that many people see Finland as bad, at this point it's just a lot of politics and rhetoric coming from everyone

0,t5_2qhu8,cvltrz4,"I manage a Part 91 corporate flight department in the US. My biggest piece of advice that I can give to an airline pilot looking to switch over is to really assess your ability to be flexible. Most airline pilots are used to pretty rigid schedules, in terms of days on/off, and very predictable flight schedules. Within my company, we require a tremendous amount of flexibility. 

The principal/owner that I work for has a constantly evolving schedule, and is quite busy when he is on the road. We get a lot of trips on short notice, and regularly get stops added during the middle of trips, as well as extensions to trips during the trip itself. A perfect example was a Europe trip we did last month in our Challenger. Trip was W. coast to Edinburgh, and then back to the W. Coast. Once he got to Edinburgh, he decided he wanted to leave a day earlier, but go to Nice for 4 days. Once he got to Nice, he scheduled a meeting in Paris, so we had a day trip there. He then added on a day trip at the end to Zurich, with an overnight in London before returning to the W. Coast.

The problem that former airline guys have with an operation like this is dealing with the unknown. The owner has the airplane specifically because of the flexibility that it gives him/her. It is a time machine. When someone is so wealthy that they can own a Gulfstream/Challenger/Global Express, the cost of a trip is not the concern, but rather the time savings and the ability to be as flexible as possible.

Our flight department has a 4 hour call out. Outside of ""normal business hours"" (Mon-Fri, 9-5), if the owner wants to go somewhere, within 4 hours he can get on the plane and go. Anywhere in the world. He pays very well for the privilege, and we try to communicate this as clearly as possible to our new hires, but it can be an issues. You need to evaluate whether or not you are able to work in that kind of environment, and if you and your family can cope with that type of lifestyle.

If you have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

0,t5_2qm4e,cvltsza,"What about a more specific project, such as a tall structure that gets hit by lightning on a regular basis?

Let's take the Empire State Building as a study. It gets hit by [20 to 25 lightning strikes per average year](http://www.livescience.com/13704-empire-state-building-lightning-strike.html).

&gt; In Florida, where lightning is more common, a 1,000-foot-tall (300 m) building might average hundreds of strikes a year, Uman said. New York State is considered to have a ""moderate"" occurrence of lightning, with 3.8 strikes occurring per square mile each year, according to the New York City government's website. This compares to 20 strikes per square mile in Florida, and two in California. (One square mile is about 2.5 square kilometers.)

Thus, just like solar, wind, and geothermal, different areas have different feasibility levels.

&gt; While 25 strikes a year is average for the Empire State Building, it can also see hundreds of strikes in a given year, according to the building's Facebook page. That's exactly what the building's engineers had hoped for. The antenna was designed to serve as a lightning rod for the surrounding area and can prevent electrical damage to the building and its neighbors, according to the city government's website.

From your article:

&gt; The company purchased a design plan from Steve LeRoy, an Illinois inventor who reportedly powered a 60-watt bulb for 20 minutes with a small, artificially generated lightning flash. Then they went about trying to develop a real-life system in the Houston area, where electrical storms are frequent. In the simplest terms, LeRoy’s concept involved a tower, an array of grounding wires to shunt off most of the incoming energy and a giant capacitor. Theoretically, if enough energy is delivered to the capacitor, it can be stored, converted to alternating current and transferred to the power grid.

&gt; The team believed it could attract strikes and collect ambient electrical energy from storms. But according to Donald Gillispie, C.E.O. of Alternate Energy Holdings, “Quite frankly, we just couldn’t make it work.” And so for now they’re out of the lightning-farm business and concentrating on other projects (including a proposed nuclear power plant/biofuel facility in Idaho). “Given enough time and money, you could probably scale this thing up,” he says. “It’s not black magic; it’s truly math and science, and it could happen.”

So, it's proven to be doable - it just did not come off as feasible in the only study of the technology that was conducted (no pun intended).

On the other hand, the same guy with the Empire State lightning stats from my source dismisses the concept in your article:

&gt; Dr. Martin A. Uman, co-director of the Lightning Research Laboratory at the University of Florida, disagrees. “Lightning is just really fast and really bright,” he says, but doesn’t actually carry that much energy by the time it gets down to earth. He estimates that dozens of towers would be required just to operate five 100-watt light bulbs for a year. 

&gt; More pratically though, the question becomes: why even bother? Even collecting all the energy from all the lightning strikes in the world (and almost impossible prospect) would hardly make a dent in the world's total energy needs. To see this a bit better, go back to the fact that a lightning strike carries about 1 billion joules. This may sound like a lot of energy, but in the grand scheme of things it's not. For example, consider that on average in a place like the US or Europe, every meter square of surface area gets about 200W of solar energy (that is 200 joules every second). If you covered a 20m X 20m area with 20% efficient solar cells over 24 hours, you would already get over 1 billion joules of energy!

Covering a random patch of land (or even a short tower) with lightning collectors definitely sounds unfeasible, but what about a tall, dedicated structure, especially in a lightning-prone area? A project like the Empire State has no potential for, say, solar power, anyway.

Let's do the math for feasibility. Please correct me if I'm wrong - I'm only estimating.

""powered a 60-watt bulb for 20 minutes with a small, artificially generated lightning flash"" - am I correct in assuming that a natural lightning would be, say, 100x as powerful? I have no idea - I'm just guessing.

In that case, 1 Lightning Strike (LS) = 60W for 33.3 hours

1,454 foot / 443 m high Empire State = 25 LS/year = 60W for 34.7 days

Similar structure in FL = NYC output x 5 = 173.5 days

So, in worst case, if my initial 100x estimate was off and we used the ""small artificial lightning"", the 60W lightbulb would run for 1.735 days. In my case, it's half a year, but my initial number was a complete shot in the dark and it seems to conflict with what Dr. Uman cites. For all I know, I really underestimated natural lightning power and the output may be much greater. If someone could verify my estimate of lightning power output, it would be easier to assess whether making such a device would be cost-effective given how much power it may generate on top of an existing or proposed supertall (1,000 ft+ / 300 m+) building/antenna.",askscience,1443853742,,t3_3n7tyq,Tokyocheesesteak,1443803733,0,t1_cvllnr7,,85,,85,1446729644

0,t5_2qh68,cvlu1q0,"&gt; Were you born in Canada? If so, then your Canadian citizenship cannot be revoked.

That's what I would have assumed until [two days ago](https://twitter.com/InklessPW/status/649373790330318848). From [the article](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/exclusive-tories-move-to-strip-citizenship-from-canadian-born-terrorist/):

&gt; In early August, a senior immigration official mailed a Notice of Intent to Revoke Citizenship to Gaya’s current home at Warkworth Institution, a medium-security facility near Brighton, Ont. The letter acknowledges that Gaya was born in Canada, but claims he is a citizen of Pakistan by descent because his father, who moved to Canada in 1977, and his mother, who immigrated here in 1981, were both Pakistani-born.

&gt; But the paper trail gets somewhat confusing. The notice goes on to acknowledge that Pakistan did not recognize dual citizenship when Gaya’s parents swore their oaths as Canadian citizens in the 1980s, so they were technically no longer Pakistanis when their son, Saad, was born in Montreal on Nov. 17, 1987. However, the Harper government now says the parents’ dual citizenship was retroactively reinstated when Pakistan passed an updated citizenship law in May 2004.

&gt; Which also means, according to Ottawa, that Gaya suddenly became a Pakistani citizen, too—making him a dual national now eligible for revocation under the new Act, despite the fact he was born here.

&gt; Gaya disputes that conclusion. “The Applicant has never applied for Pakistani citizenship and denies that he has Pakistani citizenship,” his court filing reads.

According to [the BCCLA](https://bccla.org/2015/06/its-official-second-class-citizenship-goes-into-effect/), C-24 affects not just dual citizens, but also Canadians who are *eligible* to apply for dual citizenship (e.g. if one of your parents was an EU citizen). This applies to roughly 40% of Canadian citizens (half born outside Canada, half with at least one parent born outside Canada).

Someone's [already asked Harper](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/30/bill-c-24-harper-tories-criminals-trudeau_n_8223162.html) if revoking Canadian citizenship could be applied to other major crimes as well as terrorism; he said it's an option.

Both the NDP and the Liberals are opposed to C-24. [Trudeau](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/justin-trudeau-ready-or-not/):

&gt;  “I think, any time you have a state that has the power to remove Canadians’ citizenship—that makes a distinction between Canadians who have chosen Canada and those who have been here with their families for generations—is problematic,” he said. The rule of law means that penalties should apply equally. “But the idea of imposing a radically different penalty, depending on whether or not your family was born in Canada or not, goes completely against a rule of law and a respect for justice that I know Canadians expect,” he said.

&gt; “Quite frankly, Conservatives themselves, who are supposed to not want a particularly interventionist state, should be particularly concerned that an elected official could somehow decide to revoke your Canadian citizenship. There are consequences for anyone convicted of a heinous crime against Canada, terrorism or acts of war against Canada. Severe consequences. And there should be. But we should not be creating two classes of citizenship. That goes against everything that Canada has ever succeeded in creating, as a country that is strong, not in spite of our differences, but because of our differences.”",canada,False,,t3_3n829y,russilwvong,1443804065,0,t1_cvlsenn,,2,,2,1446729759

I don't think using countries in Europe as a benchmark is useful here though. The U.S. will never attain the same rates as European countries, in part, because the U.S. will never have gun laws even close to as severe as those in Europe and the U.S. will never confiscate enough weapons to bring gun ownership rates down to anything like countries in Europe.  

That will never, ever, ever happen.  

If we want to reduce the number of shootings in America, and we all do, we need to look at realistic goals that are achievable without conditions that the majority of the population will not tolerate. You may see all kinds of surveys quoted alleging that the majority of Americans are for ""more gun control"" but that is misleading. Look further and you will see that a little over half of Americans would like *slightly* stricter rules than we have now, such as universal background checks. That's it. The percentage of Americans that support the kind of gun control they have in the UK and Australia for example, is in the single digits. It just isn't want Americans want and the reality is, even if you could pass those laws here (and you can't) you would still have more than 300 million guns out there, and I can tell you that most Americans are not going to happily drive down to their local police station and turn their $1500 AR-15 rifles in for a $75 gift certificate.

Franks style is the death by football style, I don't know if anyone has ever watched Ajax here, but if you did you'd know. All the analysts agree on this btw, it's incredibly boring to watch Ajax play under Franks reign. Death by football isn't fun :(

But besides that I do think Frank is a solid coach and manager.

0,t5_2rru6,cvlv5ys,"Let me give an opinion:

Armies in Berserk have cannons already. The only innovation of Guts' arm cannon is its miniature size and trigger mechanism. Grunbeld has one too. Inexplicably, there are no other hand guns. All other hand weapons used by armies are bows and crossbows even though they could obviously make handguns with existing technology. The problem with the full size cannons is they have the same problems they did in real life for several centuries. In the Midland-Tudor Hundred Year War we mostly saw 15th-century style breech-loading hoop cannons with primitive gun carriages. Their power is devastating against massed formations and fortified walls, but they're cumbersome to set up or transport, and relatively inaccurate. In those times cannons would sometimes explode from having flaws in the steel or being loaded with too much powder. Griffith's cannons being made in Falconia as well as the cannons on the Seahorse look like cast cannon of the 17th-early 19th centuries and are mounted on lighter wheeled carriages. That's a step up, but as we saw in the Sea God arc there are some monsters so big that even cannons can't fell the monster on their own. Perhaps the bigger problem is that many apostles are fast moving targets, and unless you set up a perfect ambush they would be able to dodge and close in. 

Getting to hand weapons: Guts' cannon is small enough to be used by him as a point-blank weapon while being big enough to really wreck an Apostle's flesh. It's not necessarily accurate, though, and is slow to reload. He basically has to fire it in the Apostle's face, like he did with the Baron, Rosine, and the Count. The only time I can think of that he hit something at significant distance was Femto in volume 3, and even then it was an indirect hit. Anyone who wasn't as strong and fast as Guts wouldn't be able to use it as effectively, I suspect. Anyway, it's not a main weapon for him so much as a backup weapon for when his sword doesn't cut it. And when he needs to lay down rapid fire, he uses the repeating crossbow which spits out bolts and can be quickly reloaded. 

The lack of widespread hand firearms in Berserk is kind of inexplicable if you just look at it from a realistic point of view, and what it actually is is a conscious artistic choice made by Miura for the setting's atmosphere. I guess it's compensated for by the existence of an unrealistically efficient repeating crossbow, in Rickert's case. In real life Europe, handguns were invented almost as soon as cannons were at the start of the 14th century. However, it wasn't until the 16th century that handguns were made practical by the invention of shoulder stocks and the matchlock mechanism which allowed you to pull the trigger with one hand while aiming from the shoulder. They replaced bows because they took weeks instead of years to train a soldier to use, pistols and carbines could be used by the cavalry better than crossbows, and the larger calibers could pierce all but the best armor. However, accuracy, reloading, and the amount of smoke were serious problems. The improvement of guns over time was undeniable, especially in the convenience and reliability of the lock mechanism, but actual power and accuracy improved much more slowly and for a long time muzzle-loading put a hard limit on fire rate. Even as late as the 1840s, Texas rangers had serious trouble fighting the Commanches who could rapidly shoot arrows at them from horseback while they had only three single-shot weapons before they had to withdraw. Guns back then also had to be large caliber because the black powder produces less energy than modern smokeless powders. While handguns were revolutionary for human-on-human warfare as early as the 15th and 16th centuries, I doubt that historical hand firearms would change the game much against the Apostles. 

In the Berserk universe it would take too long for them to develop anything like modern firearms, much less Ash' Remington shotgun. Modern smokeless powder, brass cartridges, interchangable parts, repeating firearms...all of that stuff required more metal, industry, chemistry, and mechanical precision than even a genius like Rickert can make. It takes a transformation of the entire economy, society, and exploitation of resources rather than one lone genius. Why should we want all that anway? The limitations of gunpowder in the story just raise the stakes. ",Berserk,1443933082,griffith11,t3_3n8kve,Azurepark,1443805696,0,t3_3n8kve,,18,,18,1446730286

It's war. So what the hell is Putin supposed to do? When the US was at war, they imprisoned the entire Japanese American population.

If the US would just back the hell off of Russia and the Middle East, none of this would be an issue, but the US is the most meddlesome, interfering country on earth. Putin is just fighting back, and for that he is branded as a dictator, instigator of a new Cold War, and all kinds of other labels only the illiterate, ill-informed members of the US and Europe neocon, neoliberal bloc can swallow.

 The problem with your reasoning is that you think an asylum grant process is istantaneous. A refugee reaches Turkey, asks for asylum, Turkey takes months, even years, to process an asylum request; actually Turkey doesn't even offer asylum at the moment. So what does that refugee do? Heads to the next country, he arrives in Greece, he asks for asylum, the greek state informs the refugee that the asylum process will take a couple of years. 

More refugees = asylum process gets longer. Do you honestly think Turkey and Greece can absorb every refugee? They move towards north, they spread across Europe in search of a life worth living. Greece and Turkey basically don't offer asylum to refugees, and when they do it takes an unreasonable amount of time... you can't wait years in tents and accomodations offered by the State processing your asylum request.

0,t5_2qh4j,cvlywqg,"&gt;What gives the intervening power the 'moral' legitimacy on the international stage?

Not to answer your question with another question, but it's debatable as to whether ""moral"" considerations are even given much serious thought on the world stage. Moral considerations are respected somewhat, but it really varies from country to country, as it's so dependent upon culture and the level of human development. Either way, taking moral considerations into account in international relations is a relatively new phenomenon (last few centuries, even then they're not always taken into account as they're so subjective). 

The constitutions were imposed ""legitimately"" by occupying powers who had won in war time. They were the internationally recognized government of Germany at the time and the population had accepted their authority as legitimate. Raw power is why those constitutions were legitimate at the time, and then afterwards they were legitimized as the populations of Germany and Japan did not radically alter them. 

&gt;Being that any argument contingent upon the use of force to resolve disputes creates factions the populations of Germany and Japan would have to 'naturally' accept and adopt these new institutions as not only beneficial to their society, but accepted as their own. What then, considering the odds, enabled these countries to succeed?

Both countries were well developed at the time and had populations that were accustomed to a high standard of living and a certain standard of law and government. Prior to the dictatorships emerging in both Germany and Japan each country had a somewhat developed legal system etc. Both Japan and Germany were industrialized countries at the time they were defeated. In the case of Germany, the destruction was so immense that it's called ""stunde null"" (zero hour). The German people saw everything they knew, any vestige of a state, and their state-imposed national identity die and bring all of them with it, so they were pre-disposed to accept something radically different with which to rebuild. The western allies also made a lot of attempts to ""re-educate"" the German population and teach them about free speech, tolerance, etc. But there were plenty of Germans who already wanted that. I don't know enough to comment about Japan.

&gt;What does that say about Germany, Japan, and America?

I think I covered this in the essay above (sorry, bruh, that wall of text) but I think the main thing it says (if the argument i'm presenting holds true) is that a country usually (there are exceptions) needs to be at a certain stage of development (it has to be industrialized, etc) before a stable democracy can emerge. Incidentally, when Japan began to westernize in the meiji period (late 19th century) and the early 20th century they chose to adopt the German model of government. 

&gt;What enabled the United States, Germany and Japan to mend their differences (particularly with the US) in creating lasting security, fraternity, prosperity, and peace? What did it take for leaders in Japan and Germany to not only accept but implore the imposition by the United States over matters of national sovereignty?

The overwhelming force of the United States, their almost total destruction at the end of World War II, the fear of communism and the Soviet Union (the US was the only country strong enough to fight if it came down to that), and their dependence upon the United States for economic aid in the immediate post-war era. Japan was made highly dependent upon the US for defense. 

As for why they accepted the imposition by the US: most of the time the US is pretty reasonable. For all their faults, they make a lot of good decisions and have ensured stability in Europe and Asia since World War II. In addition, they're also not dictatorial. The US allows its allies to disagree with their decisions and remain on good terms.

[Great Britain](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/greatbritain.php) still has private gun ownership but it's not going to be on the level of the US. Semi-autos and handguns are banned explicitly. But then again, majority voted in favour of the strict gun laws after a major shooting in the 90's.

&gt;but countries like Switzerland I could be more agreeable towards. I certainly love guns, but Americans can be incredibly irresponsible with a lot of their belongings, guns included.

Understand that the [Swiss](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/switzerland.php) are still stricter than the US by a wide margin, and they are a lot more stringent. It may have been more liberal than the rest of Europe, this is heavily due to the fact Switzerland has mandatory conscription, which the US would uniformly reject. 

&gt;Actually having a gun on your person would probably help more than hurt you if someone actually decided to start chasing after you, too.

I've been in the Deep South, and I live in a thankfully less weird area right now, but I've been stalked and harassed more than a few times by police and store owners. Since then I've been more than bit paranoid with gun owners in the US. Unlike my home country, I never feel safe when someone open carries near me.

My personal ethics are more or less pacificist and I don't want to hurt people if I can. More or less I utilize Tasers or other non-lethal means to subdue anyone attacking me. Which, for the most part I've been in altercations where a gun will not solve anything.

I went to Catholic high school. My former theology teacher posted the same thing. He even believes it was a set-up by some of the Catholics who do not like him. Trying to create controversy and rock the boat. 

You have to consider the fact the pope overseas the entire church- globally. Do you think he has time and knowledge to pay attention to everything that happens in the US? Kim Davis isn't Catholic. How big of a story is her case outside of the US really?

Its possible he vaguely has heard her story, but didn't know who she was, didn't recognize her, or didn't recognize her name. Think of all the issues in the world right now, do you really think Kim Davis is a big thing on his plate?

&gt;""The church distanced itself on Friday from the case of Ms. Davis, the Rowan County, Ky., clerk who defied a judge’s order and refused to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It said “the only real audience” Francis gave in Washington was to a former student of his.

&gt;Contacted by phone, a former student of Francis, Yayo Grassi, said he had been granted a meeting with the pope. Mr. Grassi is an openly gay man living in Washington, and he said he had been accompanied by his partner of 19 years, Iwan Bagus, as well as four friends.""

&gt;""Mr. Grassi said that he resumed contact with the future pope years later, when he was the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He also visited the pope at the Vatican in September 2013, and later contacted his office to ask for an audience.

&gt;“Once I saw how busy and exhausting his schedule was in D.C., I wrote back to him saying perhaps it would be better to meet some other time,” Mr. Grassi said. “Then he called me on the phone and he told me that he would love to give me a hug in Washington.” 

The fact he met with a former student, a personal friend, who is gay and his partner, is a huge deal. I would look into that more than the fact that Kim Davis walked in with a group of people. ",worldnews,False,,t3_3n7pun,TheBarefootGirl,1443814677,0,t1_cvlu2j7,,1,,1,1446733099

*He stressed that the refugees are to be housed in dorms for only three or four months — that all are Syrians applying for asylum in Austria and that none will remain in Slovakia. (The E.U. plan calls for 800 refugees to be settled eventually in Slovakia, though Slovak leaders are opposed).*

*Jaros said he has been impressed with the first arrivals at the dormitories. “Very calm. Very orderly. You can see they are educated people. They speak better English than me,” he said.*

In the same way that I would be decried as Anti-Semitic if I decided to perpetuate old clichés about Jews in Europe, I should be equally decried if I decide to say things like ""Muslims cannot integrate - They are not as intelligent as Europeans - Etc."" 

The issue comes from the fact that there seems to be a deliberate conflation of criticism of a religion as criticism of a person personally. I am reminded of some of the comments from Muslims interviewed in this country after Charlie Hebdo. One gentleman said that he hoped there would be protests in the streets against Charlie Hebdo like there were in support of it (fair enough, his views have been criticised and he is annoyed about that.) The thing which stuck with me though was his comment that (paraphrased) ""You can insult my wife, you can insult my children, but you can never insult my Prophet. I love my Prophet more that anyone in my family.""

That intertwining of religion with personal identity is something that has disappeared with most Europeans and therefore is something that is difficult to understand.

6. Table needing action doesn’t take precedence over other software.
7. Preflop pre-action are missing when on the button or in the cutoff seat in 6-max. (Also true for all positions in full ring games.)
8. Hand replayer, Previous hand, and Hand History links are not functional.
9. I checked “Sit out next BB All” when I was sitting in the big blind. The next hand I was the small blind, the software didn’t autopost my small blind.
10. Waiting for player to rebuy counter goes away and looks like table froze for 15 seconds.
11. The cost is blank in the rebuy prompt.
12. The money amount at the far right of the table title bar is not to show how much money the player has left on the table. It’s to show how much money the player has put on that table since he started playing on that table.

0,t5_2qnzu,cvm3axd,"&gt; Given that the European Union lost the Resource Wars against a middle eastern coalition over oil many years before the Great War started

It's not clear they lost the Resource Wars so much as their entire reason for fighting them was rendered moot when the Middle Eastern oil fields ran dry in 2060. But, either way, the Resource Wars bled them dry economically, shattered them politically, and may have led to isolated nuclear attacks (though, to be sure, the only attack referenced in game was on the Middle East). Nasty business, to be sure, but nothing like the apocalypse of the Great War.

&gt; since its been said the nuclear bombardment was on a global scale that means that anything that survived the civil war there was then burned by nuclear fire.

This is never actually said. Everyone seems to think it was, but it wasn't. The only time we hear any significant insight to the pre-war international situation is in the game intros, and the wording is very careful there. The only countries mentioned to have fought the Great War were the US and China. ""Much"" of the world was devastated, and ""continents"" burned, but you don't actually need to include any countries other than the US and China for those statements to be true. A ""global war,"" much like our World Wars, doesn't necessarily mean all, or even most, of the planet is directly involved. It's actually kind of hard to construct a geopolitical picture of the pre-war world where Europe would have the reason or ability to be involved in the Great War, given their impoverished status, lack of resources, and the isolationist stance of the US. It's not contradicted any more than it's outright supported by the games, but I'm not comfortable taking it for granted.

&gt; While the US commonwealth was more or less functional before the War the European Union was already gone and most of the countries barely existed anymore due to the lack of oil and resources so after the nukes went off there is likely even less stuff left to survive on than in the US.

The state of Europe during and after the Resource Wars is actually a pretty big question mark. They were damaged, certainly, but all we know for sure is that they broke down into a mess of ""quarreling, bickering nation states."" Those states could have been nominal, or they could have been quite strong (domestically) in their own right. Either is historically plausible, given a major economic collapse. Heck, it probably varied quite a bit depending on what part of Europe we're talking about.

&gt;The remarkable success of the English as colonists, compared to other European nations, has been ascribed to their “daring and persistent energy”; a result which is well illustrated by comparing the progress of the Canadians of English and French extraction; but who can say how the English gained their energy? There is apparently much truth in the belief that the wonderful progress of the United States, as well as the character of the people, are the results of natural selection; for the more energetic, restless, and courageous men from all parts of Europe have emigrated during the last ten or twelve generations to that great country, and have there succeeded best. . . . Obscure as is the problem of the advance of civilisation, we can at least see that a nation which produced during a lengthened  period the greatest number of highly intellectual, energetic, brave, patriotic, and benevolent men, would generally prevail over less favoured nations. Natural selection follows from the struggle for existence; and this from a rapid rate of increase. It is impossible not to regret bitterly, but whether wisely is another question, the rate at which man tends to increase; for this leads in barbarous tribes to infanticide and many other evils, and in civilised nations to abject poverty, celibacy, and to the late marriages of the prudent. But as man suffers from the same physical evils as the lower animals, he has no right to expect an immunity from the evils consequent on the struggle for existence. Had he not been subjected during primeval times to natural selection, assuredly he would never have attained to his present rank.

Starting to become? It already was that:     

Discussions of big events like Eurovision, the world cup, Oplympics.    
Discussion of varied EU &amp; national political topics &amp; events.    
Discussion of varied European culture.

It was there. Now it's primarily discussion of immigrants overshadowing loads of other stuff.
Everyone was fine with megathreads where everyone was free to discuss. There was no outcry over the one for the Greek crisis, the Ukrainian crisis &amp; for the more minor ones....but refugees/immigrants? Oh no muh swj suppression of freedom of speech!!1

&gt;I also believe that talking about immigration does more harm than good to the Eurosceptic cause

What? They've been feasting on every little disaster that the letters ""EU"" could even remotely be attached to.
Sure from your perspective it might turn many of these parties more into protest vote ones with a constantly attached anti-foreigner label...but let's be real here. For most this was already the case &amp; they're rushing to highlight that. (VB, FN, PVV, jobbik, Golden Dawn, DPP, LN, republicaner, etc.) They're all loving the attention.

The United States isn't an especially low-trust nation in comparison to certain others, but most of us have had sufficient experience getting screwed even by our own countrymen that we know to be very cautious before extending generosity to others.  I think the Eastern Europeans are of a similar mindset.  Unlimited generosity is often perceived as a weakness to be taken advantage of by cultures outside of Northern Europe, and the Germans and Swedes don't seem to grasp this.

I'm not anti-immigration, but anti-stupid-immigration.  Make sure that it actually benefits the existing population given the present circumstances!  If Germany has a shortage of workers in certain areas, why not target specific people who have these capabilities, rather than letting in several hundred thousand Muslims from countries with cultural values completely opposed to that Germany, before sifting out the few that might have needed skills?  I'm sure there are plenty of Ukrainians who have needed skills who won't present any threat to the social stability of Germany.",europe,False,,t3_3n89a8,[deleted],1443818531,0,t3_3n89a8,,1,,1,1446734264
