The reason they cut the EU from canon and made legends leaves them free to cherry pick the best stories (or fuse stories) and make more great movies.

Decals are different: Japanese and current Airfix, and some Italeri decals are kind of thick and 'slow': slow to separate from the backing, and being thick they don't 'fold over' themselves easily. They are easy to use but hard to blend in as they don't easily conform to detail underneath. Many modern kits from the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe have great decals: thin, opaque, responsive. But they have to be handled with care as, being thin, they can screw themselves up into a ball, or break while being positioned. 

First, you need a gloss surface. No ifs or buts. I use either floor polish ('Future') or acrylic gloss clear. If the surface is 'pebbly' I will then buff it with *very* fine abrasive cloth, used wet. 

If you haven't used the particular brand of decals before, do a test decal on scrap.  In all cases the idea is to cut out the design (I usually leave the carrier film on, I don't cut the decal close, as the 'natural' edge of the carrier film is easier to hide than a cut edge), dip it in warm water and wait for it to begin to 'float' off the backing paper. Be patient. Prod it gently with a finger tip and be ready to apply it to the model.  Thin Czech-type decals should be treated with gentleness and care, and not manipulated too much.

Now you're ready to go, use a wet brush to apply a puddle to the model: my formula is to use a bit of Micro Set, and a bit of moisture taken from decal backing paper (ie, the empty sheet left over after my last decal was applied). This is not just water, but soapy water that really helps the air bubbles get out and allows the decal to be manipulated, 'floated' over the surface. I hold the decal paper edge with tweezers, and push the decal design off with a fingertip. Small decals I grab with fine tweezers and sit in place. If the decal is a struggle to position, apply more decal-paper water to ensure to does not start to 'grip' the model.

The majority of my decal disasters occur either when the decal separates in the water and screws itself up, or by moving the decal on the model without enough water/moisture underneath it. 

Once the decal is in place, wick off the water with a tissue, and add a dab of Micro Sol or Gunze Mr Mark Softer. If necessary, roll out air bubbles with a wet Q-tip. After 10 minutes, if necessary cut the decal  along panel lines with a sharp razor. After 30 minutes-2 hours, gently wipe away decal soap with a damp tissue or Q tip.

Once done, apply another gloss coat to seal in the decal, then a matt coat to make everything uniform.",,t3_4viw4m,llordlloyd,False,d5yypln,1,,1,modelmakers,0,t5_2sf9u
t3_4vhzkv,False,1473126262,1470011173,My Baby Girl,0,"&gt; I think they want to create their own universe.

Well, I think what they really wanted to do was a few things. First, they saw potential in the old EU but also saw some things they didn't like. So, they made it legends and cleared the slate. What they've been doing since is pulling some things back in - like Thrawn. This is proof they haven't sold out the old EU completely. Where this gets interesting is the story of Jacen Solo/Darth Caedus from the old EU. 

Read the wikia if you aren't familiar with his story:

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Caedus

His story is eerily similar to Ben Solo/Kylo Ren's. Now this is important: It's clear that Lucasfilm is using some of the broader ideas of the old EU to rebuild the franchise and NEU. They're not going to do that and not have Luke be a father - like he was in the old EU. In fact, some of the best conflict from those old stories is between Jacen Solo and Ben Skywalker. 

I made a post about it but I'll break it down here. Basically, there are 4 children from the old EU. Three were Han and Leia's and one was Luke and Mara Jade's. So far we only have one confirmed and one potential. What matters is, I think we can expect the following:

EU = NEU

The Solo Twins 

Jacen Solo = Ben Solo

Jaina Solo = Unknown or doesn't exist

Anakin Solo = Unknown, but possible Luke's son.

Ben Skywalker = Rey Skywalker

I have to think that Lucasfilm isn't done with pulling in concepts from the old EU. Oddly enough, I think the Legends and old EU is some of the strongest evidence that Rey is Luke's daughter and I think it's highly likely she has a brother to be discovered.

&gt; Biography

&gt; Rawlins Cross, one of Canada’s most accomplished Celtic bands, rekindles the magic with the national release of Anthology (Ground Swell/Warner Music), collecting a dozen of its best-known songs along with four brand new tracks into one beautiful new package. With an extensive essay on the history of the band and gorgeous artwork by French/Newfoundland painter Jean Claude Roy, Anthology is a must-have addition to the Rawlins Cross discography.

&gt; The band was formed in St. John's in the late 1980s by songwriting brothers Dave Panting (guitar and mandolin) and Geoff Panting (keyboards and accordion) and Ian McKinnon (highland pipes and tin whistle).  Since then, Rawlins Cross has been at the vanguard of the fusion of Celtic traditional music with the rhythms of rock, pop and worldbeat music. Equally at ease with a soulful Highland Air (MacPherson's Lament) or a raucous party song (Colleen, Wild Rose, Reel 'n' Roll), Rawlins Cross never fails to electrify its faithful fans.  Rawlins Cross is always a “fan favorite” on the North American and European music festival circuit consistently earning return engagements.

&gt; The band burst onto the East Coast recording scene in late '89 with its first indie recording, A Turn of the Wheel and a video for the single Colleen. Just weeks after its release, Colleen scored a top ten radio slot on Toronto's influential CFNY station and Rawlins Cross was on its way. 

&gt; In 1992, the band released Crossing The Border, which further developed the ground-breaking fusion of highland bagpipes, mandolin and accordion with a rocking rhythm section.  A year later the band recorded Reel 'n' Roll, which would prove to be its best-selling commercial success and launch a national radio hit with the title track. With the solid rhythm section of Halifax bassist Brian Bourne and Ontario-based drummer Howie Southwood, Rawlins Cross enlisted PEI singer Joey Kitson to complete its signature sound.

&gt; Already one of the top concert draws in the region, and with a growing fanbase across Canada and in Europe, Rawlins Cross released Living River in 1996, which garnered two Juno Award nominations. The band toured Canada three times that year and signed a licencing deal for its music in Europe.

&gt; Rawlins Cross performed live on the nationally-televised East Coast Music Awards before an audience of two million viewers. The band expanded its international audience by headlining the 9th Annual St. Patrick's Day Celebration Festival in Germany and also representing Canada at the Expo Cumbre de las Americas in Santiago, Chile.

&gt; Two more albums followed: Celtic Instrumentals in 1997, a retrospective collection and the studio album Make It On Time, which would prove to be the band's last album for more than a decade.

I'm always interested when certain areas in the world produce certain cultural goods over a period of certain time (i.e. Greek philosophy was super innovative, especially around the time of Plato and Aristotle, or alternatively, West Coast Gangsta rap, or the 90s New York scene produced an abnormal amount of classic hip-hop acts) and I'm wonder if there is something essential about this specific time period and place that seems to produce a superior cultural product. My vulgar theory would be something like: America in general is more accepting of economic theory (compared to the more politically left Europe) and has enough money, and institutional support, to create an almost merit-based (politics eventually mucks this all up) environment where the people with the best ideas float to the top. Also maybe something with the amount of people in America, the quality of research in America compared to elsewhere, and maybe the ability to pool all the other good economic researchers into American schools to form a kind of dialectic process for *all* researchers within the American system (but that's the marxist in me) to produce better work (if you have direct access to the most innovative work you probably have a head start to even more innovative work, and so on).",,t3_4vcc2z,probablyaname,False,d5z2puh,1,,1,badeconomics,0,t5_2wbw4

I think a lot of people forget almost all of the ""traditional"" culture we know and love today has had some form of modern repackaging and this isn't unique to Asian culture.
Look at Japanese Sake for example, traditionally a very harsh high proof drink (~40-50 or so) but due to modern necessity recreated into the low proof floral drink we know and love (literally watered down). There's many examples of this stuff. Look at Italian cuisine for example and see how the most modern/well known dishes deviate from the traditional recipes. 
Even in realm of literature there's really a lot more than just the four novels which really became more popular in the last few centuries due to the shift to vernacular Chinese and promotion of 'vulgar working class arts'.


I really don't see China as some sort fragile house of cards that its seen overseas, it has its own problems sure but almost insignificant compared to its contemporaries and none novel problems others haven't experienced before. The biggest challenge I see is whether it can continue to provide social mobility to people who are ""outsiders"" to the original CCP 'feudal class'- if not those people will have to find pathways outside of China as Europeans seeked opportunities in the New World when the old world limited them.

The first thing I did was google 'killings by religion' which took me to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_violence) wikipedia article. This article seems to suggest that violence in the name of religion is very common among religions, but didn't really give any specific numbers. This article led me to these two articles: [Islamic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism) and [Christian terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism). These articles are long so I will admit that I didn't read the entire thing, but I paid attention to the 'Contemporary' section in the Christian one and the terrorist organizations in the Islamic article.

Unfortunately it seems that neither of these articles gave conclusive evidence to support the original point that Islam is the worst religion. There are definitely differences in where attacks happen. For example, the Islam article clearly states that ""The majority of deaths by terrorism in Europe from 2001 to 2014 were caused by Islamic terrorism, even while not including Islamic terrorist attacks in Russia."" While with Christianity, most of the violence is happening in Africa, with huge amounts of Muslims being killed and displaced by Christians.

This is allow under the restriction of killings within the last 50 years though, if we extend it further back we can clearly see that Christianity is the most violent religion.

t3_4viwbb,False,1473129335,1470024067,,1,"To be honest, as a left-leaning libertarian who believes in maximum personal freedoms and sensible and effective economic regulations, I at one point considered voting for Trump.

These were my initial positives.

1. He seemed anti-campaign finance.

2. He seemed, at the very least, apathetic to social issues and mostly was speaking about economics and immigration. He didn't even seem that bad socially in the beginning. I didn't think he was racist, sexist, or homophobic. Just a little rude and nationalist. 

3. While I wasn't pro-""Ban All Muslims"", he did seem to have a point, corroborated by more recent attacks in Western Europe that mass Muslim immigration would prove to be a problem that went beyond a purely economic discussion of immigration.

4. Milo For Press Secretary

While I didn't really like him too much, I thought if the Republicans would win, I would want John Kaisich (who seemed the most reasonable during the debates) and if not him, then Trump. I felt that I couldn't deal with the current establishment and either wanted someone to tear it down, or someone to start killing the social conservative platform of the Republican party so we can move on to things that matter.

However, more recent events have caused me to decide to vote third party in order to show my distaste with the current system.

1. Trump stopped being his own man. He's now under the foot of the Republican Party, just like any other nominated candidate. Maybe he'll break out of it and say ""to bad so sad, you've nominated me, now you're stuck with me."", but I doubt it.

2. Bernie Sanders lost and wasn't nominated to be Hillary's VP. He was the last candidate who could break the current party divide. Now he's supporting Hillary in exchange for some minor policy changes.

3. Mike Pence. Goddamn it Trump. I might have voted for you if you picked Kaisich or someone similar to Kaisich. But instead of trying to sweep up moderates, Ohio, and some of Sander's supporters, you moved to reclaim the religious right

Regardless of my opinion, if I had to put money on it, I would say Trump will win. He made a crappy VP pick, but so did Hillary. Overall, I think the scandals surrounding Hillary will pile up and people won't end up voting for her. Can she really bring the energy and excitement necessary to get her supporters to vote? I don't think ""vote for me because the other guy sucks"" is a very effective strategy.

I think that if the West and/or the international community wanted to do something about Crimea, we should have done it two years ago. Our allies are not prepared for a land war in eastern Europe. Our allies don't even meet their agreed upon targets for defense spending as per a NATO agreement made in 2001.
  
Fighting proxy wars with Russia in Syria and the Middle East is not good. We destabilized that region. We funded AQI and fostered the growth of ISIS. We are squarely to blame for the blowback that the West is experiencing, and I do not believe that we should use our own malice or stupidity as pretense to engage in further battles with Russia.
  
If Russia is really beating the shit out of the West, then let's have a frank discussion about what we can do as common nations to stop them. In reality, Russia's sphere of influence does not extend much beyond its borders. They are a regional power, and the US has been poking the bear, so to speak, for decades.

Even the best vetting will of course never be perfect, I won't argue that but there sure as hell can be a decent amount of background that will limit this problem.

O problema de algumas capitais brasileiras é o número de ""inocentes"" mortos, as vítimas de assaltos e de balas perdidas.

Sinceramente não ligo pra assaltante ou pra traficante morto, tem que encarar isso como um risco que eles assumem ao entrar no negócio. Pra ser vítima de assaltante noiado ou de bala perdida basicamente precisa apenas colocar o pé pra fora de casa em algumas metrópoles brasileiras.

Aqui no interior tem índices altíssimos de vítimas de homicídio a bala, coisa tipo 40 a cada 100 mil habitantes, mas... numa cidade de 5000 habitantes quando 2 marginais se matam mutuamente num acerto de contas isso é 2 em 5000, que dá 40 em 100 mil. A chance de assalto na rua é zero, mas o índice de homicídios NO PAPEL é assustador.

(Tá, na verdade tem muita morte no campo, briga de peão bêbado ou acerto de contas com algum jagunço que matou alguém no passado, é ter 5 mortes numa cidade em 1 ano e já dá 100 mortes por 100 mil hab., no papel seria tenso, mas na prática é mais fácil alguém ter medo de mula sem cabeça do que medo de assalto ou roubo (Menos ainda medo de um assaltante atirar em você caso você reaja))

Eu posso sair tranquilo agora as 2h da madruga em qualquer canto da minha cidade. Quem diz que sua metrópole é segura faça o mesmo, dá um pulinho naquela favela ali do lado, mas ó, vai sozinho e com o vidro do carro abaixado, anda no máximo a 20km/h, para em todos os sinais vermelhos, quero ver o suposto ambiente seguro porque ""tem só 40 homicídios por 100 mil habitantes""...",,t1_d5z507d,rubemll,False,d5z8v5q,2,,2,brasil,0,t5_2qh9i

I haven't read comics in a long time, but the genre is still important to me because they're a part of my identity from my youth, I know  lots of young people read them, and today's young people will be the politicians leading my society before too long.  I am still a huge fan of the film industry that's sprung up around the genre.

I think it's important for young minorities to believe they are capable of greatness. And for thousands of years, grand mythical tales from Beowulf to Blade have inspired people to dream about being heroes who can make their societies safe and right the wrongs around them. I don't want young minorities to think white people are their only hope of being rescued. I want them to dream of becoming crime-fighting billionaires. I want them to believe that in a mythical universe where people are randomly born with superpowers, those gifts wouldn't be limited to people of European descent.  I want them to feel like a part of society.  I want *you* to feel like a part of society.  I think shows like ""Duck Dynasty"" and Tim Allen's ""Last Man Standing"" are important.

Liberals are absolutely capable of intolerance and can be insufferable dicks with no empathy for the fact that many rich people busted their asses working 90 hours a week to get there, no empathy for the fact that some people think their life-giving creator wants them to take a certain action.  Like conservatives, we get enraged by needless suffering.  But a lot of the time in situations where there's no win-win situation, where no resolution can alleviate both people's suffering, liberals and conservatives have different ideas about who should be the one to suffer.  And for both of us, we're outraged because we see someone in pain who we don't think should be.  Liberals absolutely need to do a better job of recognizing that fixing things for one group sometimes creates a burden for another.  We need to do a better job of showing some fucking empathy for that and trying to create a solution for the *new* problem we've created, and strive towards reducing human suffering for everyone.",,t1_d5yka4t,KurtWagnerX,False,d5z9bpe,3,,3,Marvel,0,t5_2r40o

The hedge fund guys shorted MBSs, and in a real capitalistic market, it would've caused a market correction. It didn't. Why?

It does frustrate me a bit that I don't drive too much yet get charged the same as someone who drives 50,000km a year. I just paid my rego and it was like $720 because they have added that no fault insurance thing to it, I'm starting to fell it's a little excessive, I'm already paying $2k a year for my own personal comprehensive insurance. I've got a completely spotless driving record too not even a parking fine so it's not like the insurance is high because I'm a dick head.

... with that said if you charged people based on how much they drove, the kind of people I imagine it would screw over is people who do like pizza delivery, couriers but most importantly first home buyers who might only be able to buy a house on the outskirts.

Either way traffic in Perth really isn't that bad unless you are driving at 8-9am, what we really need more than anything is for people to dump the stupid 9-5 mindset and have people starting and finishing at different times so we don't have a huge deluge of traffic for 1-2 hours then nothing. It's completely inefficient to be pouring tens of billions into roads every single year when they are only utilized to their potential for 5-10% of the day. I drive to work at around 5:30 sometimes 6 if I'm running a little late and hardly see a car on the road, there is absolutely zero traffic. I finish at 3pm and again there is very little traffic. 

Start it at the government level. A good example is schools, until you are older and nearly done with school all classes start and finish at the same time, try and drive in a school zone at 8am or 3pm and you'll have a great time - why don't we have some classes starting at 7:30 8:00 8:30 and 9:00 - something like that would probably halve the traffic around school zones. Implement flexible start and finish times for all gov employees and you could easily reduce the amount of traffic by 25% or so at 8-9am

One thing that pisses me off, first world problems I know is I'd really like to have more than one car, having a hobby/project car and a daily driver is fairly common in Europe and extremely common in North America, but it's almost unheard of here because at minimum a second car will cost you $1k a year for rego and third party insurance even if you don't drive it. I would really like it if there was a discount for registering more than one car for personal use (obviously would need some checks and balances to ensure all families don't just register cars under one persons name) - why can't I pay like $200 a year for a car with a special licence plate that only lets me drive it one or two days a week on average? Monitor it from the speed cameras or something. I don't know how it would work, but I'd happily pay the government a few hundred a year extra for a second car, so they'd get more money from me, but right now it's crazy expensive.

I'm sorry, but from my point of view, this is actually true. And I do not see why such words are racist, considering that they are only targeting a particular group of white people. In fact, every race has some crazy or dumb/stupid people, and whites are certainly not an exception. On the contrary, to say that a particular race has no crazy or dumb/stupid people seems like saying that it is superior to other races, hence, racism. Finally, I like the white race and have many white friends. There is no way I could be racist towards whites. There is/was a resident Muslim troll here, known as Syed, who frequently uttered shit like ""the evil White race"". Now, that is racism.

&gt; All of us--or at least your ancestors--were duped by this stupid cult.

True. But our distant ancestors were living in a completely different world. Back then, Europe was just as barbaric, if not more, than the Middle East. See, our ancestors actually had a valid excuse to become Muslim. While now, **a modern man living in a modern country, with television, internet, etc. has no excuse at all if he is duped by Islam.** We, on the other hand, were raised Muslim since our childhood, by our Muslim parents, and had no say at all about it. We all know that leaving Islam in a Muslim-majority country is next to impossible. And if we live in the West, leaving Islam may mean losing our family, friends etc, so it's still difficult. That's why I, for example, never insult for being Muslim people coming from Muslim background.

P.S. Do not misunderstand what I wrote. I have nothing against White ex-Muslim reverts, or you, in particular. In fact, I congratulate you for finally understanding what Islam is. But the very existence of White Muslim reverts is a troubling fact for me, and this phenomenon definitely deserves to be studied and criticized.",,t3_4vl94d,makahlj7,False,d5zcoa8,64,,64,exmuslim,0,t5_2s7k2

&gt; Tell me more

Well, basically they are greedy and incompetent. They fueled with foreign credit a massive housing bubble during the 00's in order to get electoral wins and personal gains through (illegal)real state comissions. We(well, not me) were stupid enough to vote them, and when the bubble exploded in 2008 our unemployment skyrocketed up to 25%(now it's recovering and it's *only* at 20%), we had to ask for a bail out to other european governments and our standard of living plummeted.

&gt; Ok first, Aragon sounds like LOTR. Second, that video made me jump. What are those costumes for? They look like ghosts or some satanic cult. Sorry if I sound bigoted. 

Those people are called *nazarenos*(natharetians). I don't know what's the origin of the costumes, but we joke about their similarity with KKK members. They wear like that in all Spain, but the drums are mostly an aragonese thing.

&gt; How much tax do you give annually?

Well social security is about a 1/4 of what the company pays for you. For the remaining 3/4, income tax applies. It can go from 0-50%, depending your personal situation(kids, etc...) and your income level but I would say most people are in the 15-20% range.

VAT for most products is at 21%. Property tax only applies to wealthy people, most people doesn't have to pay it.

Well, in summary,  **TOO MUCH**.

&gt; I had a friend once tell me that Spanish is the second strongest language in the world because you can understand portugese and some italian which connects you to more than half the world.

What I wanted is for the left not to make the same mistake they are making in Realpolitik, that is to position themselves as fundamentally pro-/anti-EU, because for all its positive and negative aspects, it is fundamentally working in the interests of capital while being the most powerful structure. So we should focus on advancing the struggle for the working class and also support decisions within the EU that benefit the working class, but it isn't the field of our struggle, if you know what I mean. Stuff like DieM25 is great if it is successful, a bit annoying if it fails, but it just is. It isn't something a honest-to-Marx socialist should really invest himself into. 

I disagree. The EU is a chance to do away with borders, imperialism and nationalism. In theory, it can give all people of Europe an equal voice and can help uplift the poor countries through the principle of solidarity. It's a very long way, but I don't believe we can go back and do socialism in one country after another without it leading to more war and injustice between Europeans. Thanks to technologies like the internet and ever faster travel, we are a globalised world. We should embrace it and use it for our advantage.

Vad un taxiu parcat in apropierea localului, ma urc, ii zic destinatia si pornim la drum.

Pe aproape de bulevardul unirii, domnul cu pielea colorata imi zice ""sper ca nu e politia pe aici, ca mi-au luat permisiul de o saptamana si nu stiu ce-mi fac daca ma prind"".

... speriat, ii zic sa mergem la un chiosc sa schimbam, el schimba tonul si imi zice ca nu se misca de acolo pana nu platesc cursa. Cacat pe mine, accept cei 10 lei si plec, fara sa ma uit la numar sau la ce firma lucra.

As a member of the 29th Infantry Division I would like to invite you to consider our Charlie Company.

&amp;nbsp;
     
The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU friendly times.**

We, the people of Saladin, of ibn Khaldun, of Muhammad (SAW) have blindly, like sheep listened to the arguments of the Quraiysh, and said ""our forefathers hated &lt;&gt; and we shall do the same"". Look at every country in the middle east. They are all RIVEN by sectarian divide, when not 200 years ago, Sunni and Shia would live side by side with little to no difficulty. And in our hatred we are cruel. We get upset when they in the west call us uncivillised savages, yet we kill our daughters if they love those we consider ""other"", we beat those who should be our brothers and compete with them for resources, instead of wanting the best for them. In this day and age, you cannot be ""Syrian"". You need to be ""Syrian-Christian/Sunni/Shia/Allawite"" etc etc, same applies to Iraq and so on.

Our ignorance, need I expand on this? I could write books. Islam was the faith that gave us algebra, chemistry and biology. Modern science would be that much poorer if not for the contributions of those muslims who lived 500-600 years ago. Yet now? we have somehow managed to logic ourselves into a circle where we think Science and Faith are somehow separate. Our ""scholars"", if you can call them that tell us to ""fall back on the deen"" and leave the ""dunya"" as if we can all just afford to be quranic scholars, as if a society of quranic scholars will somehow land a man on the moon, or guarantee a safe and happy life for all it's people. We are being told quite literally to let ""allah take the wheel"" in our societies. And in doing so we turn our backs on science, on innovation, on progress, as if they are haraam western innovations designed to weaken islam. Our education systems are failing our children and they too are being indoctrinated to fear technology and learning, to turn their backs on the dunya. This is not what our prophet (PBUH) taught us. Under his rule, and under the rashidun, society was the best it had ever been. People were educated, the economy was working and islam was ascendant. Now? our people are ignorant, they don't know HOW to think because we discourage questioning and critical thinking. So they elect every charlatan strong-man and give him power. We saw this in the middle east and we see this in turkey now, with erdogan. Say what you will about the man, his piety or what good he has done to the economy, but he DID lock up journalists, judges and is doing his level best to be a typical eastern dictator, in western trappings. Yet the people roar for his approval, and they elect him, knowing that they sell their freedoms away. 

And we come to our arrogance. It is THIS arrogance, this misguided belief in our own intelligence/strength/whatever that causes us to say ""only MY islam is the TRUE islam"", or ""Only those who follow MY faith are good human beings"". It is THIS arrogance that turns us away from the problems in our own communities. Wherever we go, people from the middle east find themselves associated with crime. All the Drug Dealers in Israel, Australia, Europe are Arabs, Turks or people from muslim back-grounds. It is THIS arrogance that let's our children grow up to embrace our hatreds. It is this arrogance that let's foreign workers be treated like subhumans in the gulf states. Our arrogance blinds us to our own flaws and we fall further and further behind.

tldr:
Our societies are failing because we are idiots. We need to stop being idiots RIGHT F@#$%$ NOW and embrace our faith in it's entirety. Even the parts that tell us to be merciful to our enemies, even the parts that say there should be no discrimination between humans, even the parts that tell us to seek knowledge, ""even if we have to go as far as china"". Muslims need to be educated, informed and united enough that they can choose their own leaders, and make good decisions. Otherwise we will stumble from one smiling wolf to the other smiling wolf while our nations are devoured by our own stupidity.

Oh you mean besides living in countries that operate on a grey market slavery system, with no desire or push for systematic removal, reduction or destruction of that system?

&gt;And we have many priests and pastors and other religious leaders saying the same things. Does that mean Christians approve of it?

Really?  Citation required.  I'd also like to see some of those for seminary schools.

&gt;You seem intent on making modern slavery an Islamic issue. Modern slavery is not an Islamic issue, it is something that can be found in many places in the world, whether they are predominantly Muslim, Christian or Hindu. Heck, most of the sex slavery that goes on happens in Eastern-Europe. Most slaves can be found in India. haiti and other Christian majority territories have a large problem with slavery.

That's because it is.  You're going to have to dig very hard to find absolutely nothing in the last 150-300 years to find christian denominations advocating slavery.  FYI those aren't christian territories, they're also don't operate under theological laws like many of those islamic countries which use either directly or a co-codified form of sharia.

&gt;Nothing ISIS operates is legal to the outside world as they are considered a terrorist organisation and are being fought by the countries surrounding that region.

That still makes it legal in their region, and that in turn makes it a fully legal slave trade.

&gt;Does the huge sex slavery amongst Eastern-Europeans and Christians around the world that bring their slaves to Europe indicate that it is not a small minority of Christians that approve of it?

Sorry, which countries are those outside of the vatican are christian countries which advocate slavery, the capture and use of sex slaves, and the castration of male slaves as a fundamental right under christian law.  Never minding that you're going to find problems in any of those countries that operate under christian law and you're going to find an even bigger problem since those countries all have anti-slavery laws.

Even though I know some Heathens who are non-European, of mixed racial heritages, or who had partners from other races, and that the ancient Norse did intermarry with other people, I added the ""racial purity"" part to appease the volkisch fellows (whom I thought are closer to Heathenry).

If the fictional Heathens in my sci-fi work are non-Whites or mixed-race people who actually practice and believe in Heathenry (either as willing converts or from upbringing), as having mixed-race marriages, or even as allowing foreigners into their land (which some of them do), I fear that actual Heathens may get offended at my work.

Also, is it a bad thing, if in my own fictional work, that I write about Norse myths appearing in other cultures, even those of extra-terrestrials? Thank you for your advice, and forgive me if my comments are irrelevant or offensive.",,t1_d5str6s,HorsesPlease,False,d5zfaqd,1,,1,asatru,0,t5_2r5lh

http://www.wsj.com/articles/pope-francis-urges-poles-to-embrace-migrants-on-final-day-of-visit-1469963264

The gist, in the pope's words?

&gt;“How many youths have we Europeans left empty of ideals? They don’t have work, and they turn to drugs and alcohol. They go [abroad] and enroll in fundamentalist groups,”

&gt;“If I speak of Islamic violence, I should speak of Catholic violence. Not all Muslims are violent, not all Catholics are violent,” Pope Francis said, dismissing Islamic State as a “small fundamentalist group” not representative of Islam as a whole.

And in my own words...

&gt;And that last point is the most important. We've mucked up the middle east for decades now. If it was primarily a Buddhist region, we'd have buddhist terrorists, because when you have no other options, you fight asymmetrically. When your opponent has tanks, planes, drones and you've got.... 40 year old soviet munitions and cheap cell phones... Well...IEDs happen. And when your region has been torn apart by various warlords and CIA backed dictators for the last 40 years and your only choices in life are to herd goats, grow opium for the local warlord, or pick up an AK47 and make some money for your family....

&gt;If that region had been primarily Buddhist, you'd be griping about Buddhism being evil, and equating it to terrorism.

&gt;It's not Islam. It's decades of power plays by oil companies, the US vs. the soviets, the CIA propping up dictators, etc etc etc.

Some of you hold a lot of hate in your heart toward Islam. It's easy to equate Islam with Terrorism, when you don't take into account the context of the region and just how badly other powers have mucked it up over the last 40-50 years. 

I'm a little sick of the anti Islam rhetoric I see from a small minority here. And I don't equate that to all TC members. 

See how easy it is to not equate the actions of a few to all?

You were the one to claim that there was even a significant margin between the Christian body count and the Muslim one. You are therefore the one that should back up his claims, not me. All I stated was that there is no reason to assume that the Christians killed more than the Muslims, given the vast amount of land that the Muslims conquered. We know this from the extent of the Umayyad and Abbassid caliphates.

&gt;I my be grossly misled by my eurocentrism but I thought that the area over which the caliphate spread was far less populated than the territories over which crusades happened.

Oh yes, that's most certainly not the case.

Look [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Umayyad750ADloc.png). This is the first caliphate. All those territories, including the densely populated Levant, fertile Crescent, Persian territories, Egyptian Delta, and Iberian peninsula, were all subdued through war. Bloody war.

And where did the crusaders go to? To Jerusalem, Iberia, and some Baltic states. Now, compare that to the vast empire that was the first caliphate, and you'll see why the caliphate is so much more bloody than the crusades ever were.

Your source isn't truly objective, either. For starters, it says total deaths during the crusades: It doesn't state whether the Muslims massacred those or the Christians. We know the Christians instigated a bloodbath during the first sack of Jerusalem, but it mentions nothing about the aggression against dhimmi-Christians prior to and during the Crusades. It also includes those that died during the journey, either from starvation, or from the desert climate (which was quite a lot, since European knights were not suited against the desert).

Your source also confirms my initial modest death toll of 3000 during the inquisition, so thank you for that.",,t1_d5zf6a4,Holdin_McGroin,False,d5zfokd,3,,3,exmuslim,0,t5_2s7k2

It's changed a lot since it's founding. For the first several years, it was a Confederation, or a loosely bound group of independent nations. (It used to be The United States ARE, not the United States is). It was something more akin to the EU. The point of it was to avoid complete centralized power, which the Founding Fathers thought would inevitably lead to tyranny at some point. Of course that went to shit when in-state rebellions started happening and Massachusetts was in trouble due to debt, and no other state would help, so a Federal Government was formed.

State-side sovereignty and State's rights were (and still are) a serious issue in the United States, and the vast majority of the law and order in the country is handled on a state level, only appeals and military/interstate cases go to federal courts. The States even have their own militias separate from the Military, and their own Assemblies/Legislative Houses that make their own laws. They elect their own governors, and basically handle their own affairs in (usually with some slight variation) a miniature version of the US federal system.

What basically happened in the American Civil War was that the Southern half of the country tried to forcibly withdraw from the Union, and form it's own independent Confederation. It was more of a failed war of independence than a Civil War, but it was labelled as a Civil War by Lincoln because he didn't want to recognize the CSA as an Independent Nation.

For one I wouldn't say that they are unrivalled, there are many EU universities in the Top 10 and that doesn't even include many institutes like EMBL. 

Second the rankings are often based solely on publications, which is not the same as quality of education. For example, the biology that you learn in Harvard would be very similar to the one you learn in most other Universities in the world. And the problem with big Universities is that many times during practical classes, due to the sheer number of students, they just don't have the same opportunity to be closely followed up.

Third, let's not forget how much you pay for education in the US. It's ridiculous the amount of debt that students get just to have a chance at a career they would like to try to pursue. It would not be surprising that top universities have better infrastructure for research as they get a lot of money from the students. In the EU most the universities lack this source of funds so they rely more on other methods to increase the quality of research.

Housing wise EU migrants are less likely to use social housing and place less of a strain on the market.

Of course now that we are leaving the EU things will likely get worse for the unskilled, as numerous firms move their factories out. Furthermore with tariffs due to rise, those companies that do remain will likely pay less still. Furthermore given the recent news on agriculture, it seems the UK will import more of its food. Already 40% is imported now. This means higher tariffs still, so the price of food will rise further. Now lets not forget that thanks to brexit several sectors in the UK will take a massive hit, including manufacturing and finance. This may not seem a big deal to you, but it means greater unemployment and with a lower economy even less to spend on services or investing in poorer towns like those you mention.

So actually these unskilled workers will lose out further thanks to brexit, after blaming immigrants and the EU for what was really the fault of our own government failing to adopt good policy.

The full story, which is linked from Drudge peals back a few more layers of the onion that is the Clinton money laundering scheme (a.k.a Clinton Foundation).  It seems the US State Department under Clinton encouraged some US tech giants such as Google, Intel and Cisco to invest billions of dollars into the Russian town of Skolkovo which ultimately began producing military technology for the Russian state.  Coincidentally, 17 out of the 28 Russian, American and European 'key partners' in this project have made financial commitments tot he Clinton Foundation totaling tens of millions of dollars, or sponsored some of Bill Clinton's signature high priced speeches.  It seems other notable Russians tied to the project also contributed to the Clinton Foundation.

Meanwhile, the FBI was warning US companies to be weary of Russian companies seeking venture capital investments claiming for many of them their true motives were to gain access to classified or sensitive technologies, and specifically warned about the Skolkovo foundation which Clinton was pushing to US tech companies.

Even though the Lords happen to be making a decision I agree with, this only strengthens my opposition to them.",,t3_4vlx85,L96,False,d5zi3hz,14,eng-lancashire,14,unitedkingdom,0,t5_2qhqb
t3_4vm1ca,False,1473134117,1470054820,United States of America,1,"I personally think that Brexit is an bad idea for the UK and I think that the referendum reflected both a poorly-designed ballot that merged all Leave possibilities and that the electorate voted with a poor understanding of the implications.  I would personally be delighted if the UK managed to back out of Leave, either in effect or entirely.

However, this article is abysmal.  Slicing and dicing the article, most of it is going to do precisely nothing to convince anyone:

&gt; In the days after the Brexit vote, a favourite taunt of Leavers was to tell those who were warning of the difficulties of Brexit that such critics were “in denial” and were indulging in “wishful thinking”. Brexit meant Brexit and it was now inevitable. But it is now evident that it is the Brexiteers who are denying the challenges of reality and wishfully thinking away the problems they now face.

Divisive, unlikely to convince anyone, us-versus-them.

&gt; The Canadian diplomat Jeremy Kinsman has a scathing phrase for the predicament of the pro-Brexit UK government. The Brexiteers, the former high commissioner to the UK and ambassador to the EU, observed, “are the dog that caught the bus: they hadn’t thought what to do next”.
&gt;
&gt;The UK government does not know what to do about Brexit. This is not a rhetorical exaggeration, it is a statement of fact. As the foreign affairs parliamentary select committee reported recently (paragraph 19):
&gt;
&gt; “The previous Government’s considered view not to instruct key Departments including the [Foreign and Commonwealth Office] to plan for the possibility that the electorate would vote to leave the EU amounted to gross negligence. It has exacerbated post-referendum uncertainty both within the UK and amongst key international partners, and made the task now facing the new Government substantially more difficult.”
&gt;
&gt; (The committee, at paragraph 17, also generously adopted the view of this blog that it is not so much that the UK government does not have a plan for Brexit — it does not even know what is to go into a plan.)
&gt;
&gt; The scale of the Brexit task ahead is becoming plain, even if there is still shapelessness in policy.

A criticism of the Leave campaign but not Brexiting itself.  I think that the latter is what is probably interesting to everyone other than people who have a personal beef with those involved with the Leave campaign.

&gt; **Many would say** the job is impossible, at least in the short to medium term.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word

&gt; Take for example the need for an exit agreement with the EU. In the memorable example of Gus O’Donnell, former cabinet secretary and head of the civil service: Greenland, population less than Croydon, one issue — fish, and it still took three years for it to leave what was then the EEC. There is no sensible reason to believe that the UK could extract itself from the EU (a more complex entity than the EEC) in the two years envisaged by Article 50.

It would probably make arrangements unofficially, whether Article 50 wants it or no, and have an official process in which these are formalized.  The short two-year period cannot realistically be viewed as a barrier that could hold a country in.

&gt; “I wrote Article 50, so I know it well,” Amato told a conference in Rome, saying he had inserted it specifically to prevent the British from complaining that there was no clear cut, official way for them to bail out of the Union.
&gt;
&gt; “My intention was that it should be a classic safety valve that was there, but never used. It is like having a fire extinguisher that should never have to be used. Instead, the fire happened.”

That may be true, but his intent will be of little interest.  Rather, to a Brexiteer, it is only a sign that British entry was obtained via dishonest pretext.

&gt; Another person claiming credit for Article 50 (you would think no one would want to admit to authoring the provision) is the British diplomat Lord Kerr. He explains that it was inserted into the Lisbon treaty as a sop to the Eurosceptic media.

Ditto.  Not only that, I find that personally-unconvincing to treat this as a nothing.  I think that countries would probably *not* have been willing to join the EU without the existence of Article 50.  Joining a union that cannot be left is a very different thing from joining a union that can.  Acquiring US statehood, for example, is very probably a one-way road, and territories do not choose lightly to take it.  Those who created the text lowered the bar to EU acceptance, but are also bound to accept that their offer might be exercised until such time as members collectively agree to remove that offer (which I suspect *will* happen one day, or at bare minimum the bar raised).

&gt; Regardless of who wrote the provision, no one can say that it provides a feasible process: the departing member state may have the immense advantage of setting the timing of the notification; but then the see-saw reverses dramatically, giving the remaining member states a near-absolute advantage in negotiating position. Any extension of the two-year period cannot be taken for granted, and so unless an agreement can be reached in less than two years, the member state is ejected. It would be a weird and unworkable way to deal with a complex negotiation of the nature required. Article 50 may have “worked” as a work-around negotiation ploy for Amato and Kerr but it does not work as a legal framework.

That may have been the attempt.  I do not think that a diplomat who had the desire to do so could not work around it.  It is probably possible to obtain, via hook or crook, effective assurance of terms before initiating Article 50.

&gt; This is why any Brexit may perhaps be by a new treaty rather than by the unfit-for-purpose Article 50. But this would create new problems. Most notably, it could require a fresh referendum in the UK. It would also need unanimity by the remaining member states.

There may be reasons for another referendum at some point -- in my eyes, putting the actual terms that Davis or whoever is able to obtain and their direct consequences to the public -- to the public to see whether they actually want it and its consequences in preference to Remain.  If the mood is comparable to the mood now, my belief is that that vote would be Remain.  However, I have an extraordinarily hard time believing that the Article 50's design warrants another referendum.  I have a very hard time believing that the British electorate would buy into this, either.  That information was available to the voters at the time of the referendum.

&gt; Then there are the international trade agreements that the Brexiteers say the UK should enter with the rest of the world. There are many difficulties here. The UK has no trade negotiators; the rest of the world will want to see what the UK-EU arrangement is before committing to a trade deal; and Britain has a weak and needy negotiating position. Such negotiation is as hard-headed an exercise as one can imagine, and the inexperienced UK ministers and officials will be lambs wandering into a slaughterhouse.

Irrelevant.  The UK can surely obtain negotiators or train them; it is no helpless, mewling pup.  It could also make use of a sunsetting deal and later establish a fuller one.

&gt; Theresa May, the new prime minister, has spoken of there being a need for a UK-wide approach, and she now also wants to consult British dependencies.

She is (possibly intentionally) being ambiguous.  That may be a real barrier, but she has at no point explicitly given Scotland or Northern Ireland a veto.  Further, my belief is that she will not take this route even if she wants the UK to remain -- while I am no expert in British public sentiment or politics, I would imagine that having a tiny fraction of the population given a veto would be unpopular.

What I'd like to see is an article that lays out not a list of implementation issues for the bureaucracy, but that splits up the different options and makes an actual argument for an impact on the public.  In particular, if it is consensus that leaving is not going to be a win for low-skill employment in the UK, that should be made explicit and convincing.  What alternative answers are provided for issues that were raised by Leave, like housing costs?  Will the UK commit to automatically authorizing construction of additional housing whenever housing prices rise above some point?  ",,t1_d5zgy2b,nounhud,False,d5zi41a,7,UNSA,7,europe,0,t5_2qh4j

Except that these people are not the ones who are turning into refugees, these are the people that the refuges are fleeing from...


Also, a majority of the rebels based in Northen Aleppo are NOT syrian, but someone who emigrated from elsewhere.

""47,114 foreign ""opposition"" fighters have been killed by late May 2016, according to the SOHR."" Therefore we can assume that through Syria passed at least twice of that number of non-syrian militant fighters. So the actual number of foreign jihadists and helpers is huge, especially in these occupied parts of Syria along Turkish border.

I'd wager that these videos should have the opposite effect on you. now you see what barbarism the people of Syria are fleeing from, but it's pointless to try and tell people like you this, cause to you it's all just black and white.",,t1_d5zfwvf,LCkrogh,False,d5zi82m,15,,15,worldnews,0,t5_2qh13

It's there so that all member states are guaranteed equal treatment and equal opportunity in all other member states. 

From a purely economic perspective, it's also there to along with free movement of capital and free movement of goods: I can have someone from Sweden invest €60000 in my factory, and I can get cheaper imports from Italy to make more goods with that first investment, but it's all worthless if there aren't enough workers locally for me to hire. The solution then, is to offer the position to workers from a neighboring country. 

It also gets somewhat ideological, of course. From that first point, it could be argued that since people from all member states all deserve equal treatment and opportunity, then there is no difference between hiring foreign workers over native ones because they both have as much of a need to work, and they might be just as qualified as native workers to do the same work. 

This point is arguable either way, but it's certainly a valid one, IMO. ",,t1_d5zbuw2,Kryptospuridium137,False,d5ziarh,7,EU,7,europes,0,t5_39twl

The power of cherry-picking compels you!

I doubt they'd be anywhere near Islamic levels of crazy, honestly.

And even if you're right, so what? Those numbers are true for Islam in almost *any* country. (I believe things are somewhat better in the USA, but they're awful anywhere in the EU, and in every Muslim country.)

&gt; No study can be trusted. Not in isolation. Good science revolves around repeatability and sound sampling practices to eliminate sample bias

I'm not talking about just one study, and you know that.

&gt; why weren't there parallel surveys of Christian, Jewish and Atheist attitudes as controls?

I agree they should've published these values. (Apparently they did a control study... but [I can't see the results anywhere](http://www.icmunlimited.com/polls/icm-muslims-survey-for-channel-4/).)

&gt; that's about as helpful as me doing a survey in the Westboro Baptist Church and presenting it as ""evidence of Christian values"".

Don't be ridiculous. A survey of WBC members is not even close to being the equivalent of a large-scale survey of British muslims.

&gt; Without context of the wider population it's hard to say.

That would be an interesting follow-up survey, but it's not the main point. The problem is clearly *enormous*. That's the point.

Sure, it may be that certain sub-groups are better than others, but that's a follow-up question.

&gt; Lets not be complacent in thinking we know what ""British values"" actually look like.

No. It's no longer reasonable to deny that there's a problem here.

I live in the Chicago area where until very recently we had the toughest gun laws in the country and in the city there are still no gun stores although I believe one tried to open recently. It doesn't matter because the majority of gang members that commit crimes could never own a gun legally because of their criminal past so the only people that are effected by future gun regulations are legal gun owners who aren't killing people on a daily basis.

In Chicago we have a black being killed by another black with an illegal gun every 14 hours this year. Every two hours a black is shot by another black in the city. We have no space for them so they don't get charged with the illegal gun crimes that have mandatory long prison sentences because the DA drops those charges.

Ah, thanks then and sorry for the reaction, but the internet being the internet it wouldn’t be the first time someone has tried to hint at my having an ulterior motive.

There are multiple reasons for white children in particular doing badly, but I do think that one of them is that to a large extent the success of a significant proportion of the white population economically and academically has overshadowed their lack of attainment for years.

When I was younger, almost every years when the GCSE results were released, there would always be a story about how comparatively poorly young black boys had done compared to other ethnic groups.

Yet to me, growing up in the North and going to a comprehensive, I could see quite clearly that every time this comment was raised for concern regarding black boys, absolutely nothing got said about white boys from the same socio-economic group who had performed as poorly if not even worse.

The devastating effects of unemployment and the loss of industry have had a huge influence on this since the 1970s at least. The higher incidence of the break-up of the family has also played a part.

Thos things I mentioned also apply to other ethnic groups living in the same circumstances and the same areas of course, but that’s kind of my point - focussing on ethnicity is a red herring to me because it is not the real issue.

As for the IQ argument … I’ve also seen a lot of people talking about how on a global scale, higher mean IQs tend to match with countries with higher GDPs (e.g. USA, Canada, France) and, conversely, lower mean IQs match countries with low GDPs (e.g. Nigeria, Tanzania, Cambodia).

The conclusion to be drawn from that seems so obvious to me as to be hardly worth mentioning - except to my astonishment there are loads of these ‘Alt. Right’ guys who are claiming that the reason why e.g. Nigeria is both poor and corrupt is due to the mean IQ of its population.

I’ve even heard it argued that the migration out of Africa and into Europe meant that IQ had to increase to deal with the challenges of surviving colder Northern Winters i.e. long-term planning - and that raised Europeans IQs and that in turn led to them gaining ascendancy in the 16th - 20th Centuries.

For example , in TSM alone , i'd argue that sven and bjerg were more instrumental to their success then DL is. They both singlehandetly won games for the team , while DL just wins his lane and does his job in tfs. He isn't the playmaker of the team (duh...adcs shouldn't be the primary playmaker anyway) , and he isn't their pilar either (that would be bjerg. The fact that he wins midlane so hard , releases pressure for sven , and he can invade - since his midlaner has priority over the enemy midlaner - or control objectives a lot better. And i'm guessing that will be even more obvious when teams will stop doing laneswaps. Also his utility picks especially zilean , literally won games for tsm.)



That's the issue i have with DL : he's not even the best contender for being MVP even from his team.




Outside of TSM , one could say that RO has been the backbone of IMT and the sole reason they are destroying any team not named TSM.....especially with huni underperforming.
Inori turned around a 0-9 team , and made it middle of the pack with a terrible terrible roster , and Jensen has been 1 of the most consistent midlaner in NA , and the hard carry of c9.

What else in the Lisbon treaty is a cynical deception like the Article 50? Or is the whole treaty intended like this?  

EDIT:

&gt; it was inserted into the Lisbon treaty as a sop to the Eurosceptic media.

Eurosceptic media? It is serious arrogant deception of millions of European citizens that approved the treaty in referendums.  It is disdainning democracy  and it delegitimizes whole treaty. Anyone who accuses Boris Johnson , that hedeceived British people, should realize that the authors of the Treaty of Lisbon deceived people of whole European Union and now they have the audacity to publicly ridicule all.

&gt; * London: Britain's House of Lords could delay the process of the UK's exit from the European Union which could lead to a second referendum, a senior Conservative party peer warned on Monday.

&gt; * Baroness Wheatcroft said she hoped that a pause in introducing Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the official trigger for Brexit, could lead to British public potentially changing its mind.

&gt; * ""If it comes to a Bill, I think the Lords might actually delay things.

&gt; * And I would hope, while we delayed things, that there would be sufficient movement in the EU to justify putting it to the electorate, either through a general election or a second referendum.""

- cannabis seeds reselling has been a big market for decades. In many countries the seeds have never been made illegal (for instance they're considered as souvenirs in some EU countries where cannabis is strongly illegal) and are legal until germinated. And the sativa/indica classification has been a big selling point for a very long time.

- one of the most easily perceptible effect of ""being high"" is on anxiety. It seems that THC lowers anxiety at low doses but increases anxiety with higher dosages. The dosage itself, i think, tends to be variable for the same individual, conditioned by tiredness for instance. It's easy to mistake that with the effect being different because of the cannabis, instead of because of oneself (and especially when one has specific expectations.)

With the effects of THC being relatively situational and dosage dependent, and the market pushing the indica/sativa ""label"" since the earliest seedbanks in the 80s, i can see how easy it is for an average stoner to honestly believe in that classification.",,t1_d5ziv45,dstz,False,d5zkf2s,7,,7,explainlikeimfive,0,t5_2sokd

It's where EVERYONE was 500 years ago. And, while most everyone else got a software update at some point, somewhere along the line Islam (despite being born in a part of the world that had always been at or near the peak of civilization since civilization began, so that it was born on third base, so to speak), decided that a return to the 7th century was the right way forward.

I understand why medieval Europe, which was founded by a bunch of raving barbarians trashing the Roman empire, took a while to get its house in order. Civilizations take centuries to build when one starts from scratch. I'm a little more puzzled as to what exactly is Islam's excuse, given its enormous head start. There's only so much that can be blamed on the Mongols and all that cousin-marriage.

Also, I find it annoying that there's this implicit life-cycle or ""teenage years"" to every religion, as if we're supposed to shrug it off as a rite of passage.

Fui praxada, tendo participado como doutora durante algum tempo - 2 anos? acho que nem isso. Nunca gostei muito de praxar, acho que não tenho a energia nem o sentido de humor necessários para estar a entreter caloiros durante tardes inteiras, pelo que me fui afastando ao longo do tempo. Nunca ninguém dentro da praxe dirigiu uma crítica a esta minha decisão.

Na minha opinião, tudo depende da instituição de ensino. Fui praxada quase exclusivamente no recinto da faculdade, completamente à vista de quem passava e nunca me senti humilhada. A minha praxe passou muito por berrarmos coisas parvas que nos faziam sentir desconfortáveis (com todo aquele vocabulário muito colorido do Norte), fazermos jogos patetas quando os doutores estavam bem-dispostos e estar de prancha ou de quatro sempre que fazíamos merda, o que acontecia quando não respondíamos de forma suficientemente rápida/entusiasta às questões sem sentido que nos eram bombardeadas - ou seja, quase sempre. Também não gostavam quando só apareciam 3 ou 4 fulanos para a sessão de praxe *semanal*- porque a nossa praxe só se tornava diária lá para Abril, quando a Queima estava já à porta - o que levava invariavelmente a mais exercício físico.

Após aquele período inicial (4/5 semanas?) em que nos chateavam imenso para ir à praxe, formava-se o núcleo duro daqueles que realmente queriam participar, e todos os outros caloiros que não estavam interessados nunca mais eram incomodados. Na minha experiência, foi uma excelente forma de integração, sem recurso a ovos, farinha, banhos de lama, ou afins.


Porém, sei que a minha faculdade é a exceção e não a regra... e que muitas comissões de praxe pelo país fora abusam e de que maneira. 

Na minha humilde opinião, as comissões de praxe não deveriam ser banidas, porque sei, da minha experiência, que é possível existir praxes humanas e decentes que ajudem a integrar os novos alunos. Mas para isso, tem que existir

* um maior acompanhamento por parte da faculdade (a nossa praxe era à vista de todos porque a faculdade o permitia e encorajava)

* uma relação mais próxima entre os diretores e os duxs (o nosso dux estava em contacto permanente com o diretor da faculdade e éramos lembrados do facto várias vezes no início do 1º ano - ""se houver algum problema, não hesitem em contactar X e Y"")

* um conjunto de regras muito básicas a seguir, aprovado pela faculdade

* redução do tempo dedicado à praxe. Praxe semanal chegava e sobrava, não faz sentido nenhum ter praxes diárias quando é suposto estarmos a estudar.

* consciência da parte das comissões de que algumas ""tradições"" não são apenas estúpidas como em alguns casos completamente fabricadas. Mitos. Balelas. Cursei numa das faculdades mais antigas e com mais tradição do país e nunca me fizeram nem metade do que vi fazer a caloiros de institutos com menos anos de existência que eu.

* basicamente, transparência. Não éramos nenhuns santinhos, mas as bebedeiras e afins aconteciam fora da praxe.

I started it up in FM14 because I had grown tired of the usual saves I did, taking my favorite club (Bolton Wanderers, if you're curious) to the top of the world, being myself, etc. I made a guy in Ukraine and started with some dinky team in the second division, Olimpik Donetsk (ironically, they're in the top flight in Ukraine now). I cant remember the characters name, but this guy was very very greedy, and he would leave a club if it meant he'd get paid more. It was a very interesting save, because I went all over europe looking for the next big paycheck. If the board wouldn't pay my excessive wage demands, I was out! I finally ended up in Manchester City, where they paid me incredibly high wages to win the premier league over and over. 

I ended up bored with that character, so I made another. He was Slovenian and was very concerned with hiring slovenian players. Every club he went to he would do his best to bring along as many slovenian players and staff as possible. That guy got fired a lot because, as it turns out, Slovenians aren't that great as a whole, but it was entertaining nonetheless. Developed some nice slovenians and learned a lot about player progression and how to develop youth systems during that save.

That was all in FM14. In FM16 I presently am playing with this character in Romania. This character is into catenaccio, aggressive defending, and brutal matches where you win 1-0 or 0-0. He is also partial to romanian players. He's a loyal character though, and won't leave the club unless he really needs to. 

Anyway, I've been rambling. That's what I did to fight the boredom. I just made some characters with very specific motivations and concerns and rolled with them. The things I always did were start at some odd nation that I've never played in before, such as Finland, Slovenia, Romania, etc., starting at the lowest level available, and just play.

Le Pôle emploi, soit dit en passant, fournit aussi gratuitement des billets de train voire d'avion pour se déplacer aux entretiens, ainsi qu'une carte de chercheur d'emploi qui refile pas mal d'avantages. Ca vaut le coup de se déplacer à un entretien mensuel pour ça :)

*Réponse plus précise, avec explication du pourquoi, tu comment et du ""ça va me donner quoi ? ""*. La dernière partie est la plus intéressante... 

J'ai été dans la même situation côté motivation. J'avais un job mais aucune évolution, bloqué par un tas de trucs (principalement dans ma tête), pas de voie de sortie, à la limite de tout claquer. Et on m'a donc orienté vers un bilan de compétences. En tant que chercheur d'emploi, tu y as droit, et je pense que t'es un candidat idéal pour la chose. Des diplômes et des connaissances, mais aucune motiv', l'impression de taper à côté.... 

&amp;nbsp;

**C'est quoi donc ?** 

Le bilan de compétences, c'est un truc qui va durer quelques semaines/mois (en fonction du nombre de séances dans la semaine), pendant lequel tu vas avoir des entretiens d'environ 2 heures avec un conseiller d'un organisme spécialisé (CNAM, organismes privés spécialisés, y'en a un paquet). Ma conseillère avait une double compétence psy/marché de l'emploi très intéressante, en plus de l'expérience. Ce sont des gens à qui tu peux parler librement, la confidentialité est inscrite dans le contrat, et ils sauront faire la part des choses entre ces moments où tu te défoules et ces moments où tu es plus constructif. Ils noteront, poseront plein de questions, et te feront littéralement revenir à ta scolarité, te feront raconter ce que tu as voulu faire selon la période de ta vie, pourquoi tu l'as fait ou pas, bref, un gros flashback nécessaire à la construction du projet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Comment ?**

Le choix de l'organisme est important, selon ta situation et tes dispos tu pourras peut-être avoir un RV avec plusieurs et en choisir un. Il faut que tu te sentes à l'aise là-bas. Puis une fois l'organisme choisi, tu auras ses RV réguliers, avec un petit peu de boulot en-dehors pas compliqué pour retrouver des éléments de ta vie qui seront utilisés ensuite. 

Au fur et à mesure des questions, le conseiller (ou la conseillère) va dessiner une ""carte"" de tes intérêts, et t'orienter petit à petit vers un ou des domaines qui peuvent t'intéresser. Te sortir des fiches de postes, te parler de métiers qui peuvent t'intéresser, juger de la pertinence et de la possibilité de faire un éventuel parcours depuis là où t'en es aujourd'hui...

&amp;nbsp;

**Et ça va me donner quoi ?**

De la putain de motiv'. Tu as en face de toi une personne qui ne te juge pas, qui regardera ton parcours avec du recul et qui sera assez ouverte pour te proposer aussi bien des choses évidentes que des choses plus surprenantes. Dans mon cas, j'ai eu droit à plusieurs chemins proposés, dont celui assez inattendu de bibliothécaire-documentaliste. Mais à la description du poste, je me suis dit ""bah merde effectivement"". Les choses ont fait que j'ai pris une autre voie, mais ça t'ouvrira potentiellement pas mal de perspectives auxquelles tu n'as pas encore pensé.

&amp;nbsp;

Et maintenant ? Et maintenant je suis en reprise d'études, suite à ce bilan de compétences, pour partir sur une voie qui me permettra de réaliser le grand projet que le bilan de compétences a mis au jour. J'ai bénéficié de dispositions légales qui me permettent de partir un an tout en conservant un salaire. Avant d'en arriver là, j'ai donc fait mon bilan de compétences, candidaté çà quelques offres, rencontré des gens du métier.... tout s'est fait très simplement, sans forcer, naturellement.

But the reality is that there's no causal link between immigration and violent crime in general. The only exception is with terrorist attacks (though many have been long-term immigrants), but they would get in regardless and their aim is to create the divide that you support. The fact that the media loves to report on an immigrant related crime means that many people take it as a given that if you come from abroad you're more likely to be all rapey and murdery, but the reality is that our native population is just as unstable. I'm far more wary of the loudmouth chavs staggering around throwing beer bottles and swearing at 2 in the morning than I am of a refugee family from Syria.

&gt; It is disproportionately more likely to be that countries which come from *inferior cultures* will commit these crimes

Inferior cultures? That's a nice high horse you have there.

&gt; However, by their own hand, these refugees and migrants have forced us into this position by continuously abusing the generosity of Europe

But they haven't. A very small minority of them have. This is just like how everyone was up in arms about the idea of football being excluded from the euros because a handful of British fans were getting violent.

&gt; If the Chinese or Canadian or Australian or whatever immigrants demonstrated a similar pattern of concerted violence against European citizens then, no matter the fact they were white, or Chinese or whatever, I would be arguing exactly the same thing. 

So if a minority of Canadians killed a bunch of people you'd start arguing for the vetting of Canadians because of their ""inferior culture"" would you? I very much doubt that.

Take a read:
https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3g7fkw/pendragon_incident_what_happened/

I do not want to support a game full of shitty management.

Now back to the games them-self

1. Dota is by far more balanced. Recent tournaments used 90%+ of hero pool. LoL is sit around 60% and has some 100% ban/win heroes.

2. Dota2 is fair f2p while LoL has runes progression.

3. Dota2 has proper solo queue and no one super anal about meta.

4. Players of any nationality can dominate the game: USA, China, EU all kinds of teams. The lack of korean master lords creates healthier competition. I wonder tho, is it due to game mechanic difference or just lack of interest from korean players.

5. Much much bigger prize pools and community involvement in events

6. I personally feel that tactical aspects, split pushing and map movment in general is much more deep and common in Dota.

Long time ago I asked LoL player why he prefer to play it over Dota and he said that stats and items are easier to understand in lol. But in reality both games require some solid hours to figure it out and learning about stats will take only small fraction of it. So it more about lack of desire to re-learn another complex game then actual issue. 

But if you a fresh to both games I think Dota is more fun and despite it ominous tryhard aura you can always play minigames instead of main mode and have fun anyway.

LoL has more anime like visuals so if you really want it maybe you can stick with lol, but that is the only reason to choose it I can think of.",,t3_4vmqfw,BW_Yodo,False,d5zn1cf,8,,8,DotA2,0,t5_2s580

My circle of friends and contacts is highly unlikely to be fully representative (as with all anecdotes) but most people I know aren't that 'bothered'. I can't think of a better word to describe it but we're pretty much the exact demographic targeted by the attacks in November (young Parisiens who frequent bars, clubs, and cafés), but don't live our lives with it as a permanent concern. I was at a concert and we had our bags pretty heavily searched, as well as a pat down, and my friend said that if someone wanted to get in these little searches wouldn't exactly stop them. 

Occasionally, when you hear a series of loud bangs everyone freezes but once it is established as nothing (usually someone with a piece of shit car or bike that is misfiring) everyone goes back to how they were. But I see similar reactions whenever I see videos from the States at public shootings. People initially don't react, but once those closer to the location begin to panic it spreads along the crowd. 

The people I work with are from all over Europe, and many of the senior people here are much older. The general view of the attackers is to hold them in disdain, but not to live in a constant in fear. I am going on holiday to Nice in a few weeks (like thousands of other people) and I'm not living in much fear for that either. Maybe I am just nïave, maybe I am foolish, or maybe this is the view held by a lot of people.

That being said there are certain places in the world that are more accepting of your choice to go on this path. There are many centers and communes that focus on meditation and personal growth. These range from week long retreats to full time live-in communities. It kind of depends on what you are looking for. 


I would recommend looking at places that have a strong tradition of this kind of work. There are many places in Southeast Asia such as India, Bali, Tibet. I have heard of people going there and doing anything from a month long yoga training to massage to life long commitment to studying the various practices of that particular culture.


I recently spent the last year in Peru in the Sacred Valley. There is a good mix of traditional and new age philosophy. It is very common to find people with the exact same goal as you. While not the focus, many of the shamans and healers use traditional plant medicine (San Pedro and Ayahuasca) to aid in healing and growth. I would do some research on that though to see if that is something you are interested in. If you have questions about it send me a PM.


You can find new age communities all around the world. There are a lot in California and I've heard of a lot in various parts of Europe. I will warn you though, it can get expensive. A month long yoga training can cost a few thousand dollars. A week long meditation retreat will cost you a few hundred. If you want to do this long term, I would suggest finding a community that will provide for you. Many of these places will have a farm or something that you can work on in exchange for food and a bed. 


Remember to be careful. Now that the modern new age movement has become so popular there are many people trying to take advantage. There is a lot of money in the business and people will try to rip you off. Do your research and find someone you trust. Again if you have anymore question feel free to send a PM

Trump wants to come up with a process for investigating someone's background for ties to radical Islamic organizations before letting them into the country. We've seen that this is necessary by the terrorist attacks which have been occurring in the EU multiple times a week as of late. That requires a temporary hold on Muslim immigration, not a permanent ban. 

And no, it is not a racist policy. If you look at the background of every terror attack in EU in the past few months, its all radical Islam. That's just a common sense policy. You can't be worried about being so PC that you completely ignore the facts. If you want to stop Malaria from being spread you can't be afraid of offending mosquitoes and you would be wasting your time making sure you investigated an equal number of badgers and honey bees.

 ^^[EDIT: ^^listen ^^to ^^[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_zjgZJOFl4) ^^song ^^while ^^you ^^read]

&gt;Just speaking for myself (Sam)--
 
&gt;I'll always have anarchic/outsider sympathies/tendencies but... the SJW stuff and the diversity stuff have gone too far, past the point of no return. And I'm a super tolerant guy, I'm perfectly happy to have people screaming in my face and insulting me if that's what it takes to have prosperity and a stable and fair society. But if you read enough of this shit you realize that's not the endgame plan--the plan is to have anything white/masculine/traditional totally eliminated or suppressed.
 
&gt;A year or two back, I might've said the most important issues were... surveillance, ending the war on drugs, campaign finance reform, military adventurism--something like that. But I've grown weary of having all this feminist nihilist shit plopped on my lap, and I'm tired of people telling me that I've got some original sin and the only way to cleanse myself is by acting like Tim Wise. Gamergate was eye-opening, #BlackLivesMatter was eye-opening, but what really drove the point home and crystalized this perspective was reading about things like Rotherham...
 
&gt;Europe is in a dire situation: culture is being destroyed, some neighborhoods are being turned into trash dumps, and a lot of these places might not ever be the same. I don't think that's a good thing, or a healthy thing, to take people who build statues and create wealth and invent science and replace them with people who use alleyways as bathrooms and are 10-20x more likely to rape. I'm sorry I just don't think that's good, I know it's insensitive as hell, but it's too late now to tiptoe around it or use a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to explain it differently. This is just the way it is, Europe is being invaded and we'd better fucking wake up if we have any chance of preventing that from happening here.
 
&gt;It's possible to feel this way and at the same time be compassionate. Send them money, let them use the technology we invented, give them whatever they need to pull themselves out of poverty, quit starting wars for oil and for Israel--all that stuff is well and good, but by keeping borders open we're taking the most productive, inventive, civilized, free countries and dumping them into the incinerator. Of course we have problems, of course the NSA is bad, of course it would be nice if we could all have $15 an hour for whatever, but would you rather live here, or in Malaysia or China or Saudi Arabia? Do you really think the best way to make our society more Utopian is by importing displacement levels of Malays, Chinese, or Saudis?
 
&gt;Whether you think the problem is genetic or cultural, it doesn't matter when you import immigrants in large numbers, because they form communities that don't integrate. They bring their language and their religion with them, and they vote for socialist policies. This will continue until white people have been sucked dry, and then there won't be any voting anymore, there'll be Sharia law instead. We're putting Western Civ on the alter as a sacrifice to white guilt because we're worried some frizzy-haired Afro transsexual will wag his finger at us.
 
&gt;We didn't build all this shit and invent all this shit, our ancestors did--it's only ours to safeguard, not to flush down the toilet. You didn't get burned at the stake for saying something heretical, your ancestors did, so it's pretty fucking shameful if you're ready to give up your guard post for intellectual freedom and separation of church and state because some snarky tattooed dyke is hissing at you. These fuckers have shifted everything so far out of wack and to not fight back now is the same thing as being on their side.
 
&gt;Comedy shouldn't be 'political'... Sensitive WASPy types don't like when things get publicly political. Sam Hyde is funny I just wish he wouldn't be 'political'... First of all, nobody even BATS A FUCKING EYE when Zach Galifianakis or Jim Carrey dips into some political issue that they know nothing about (because their views fall safely in the bubble of insanity that is societally accepted as 'OK'). Secondly.... THIS ISN'T EVEN POLITICAL! The slow smothering death of Western Civilization is not a political issue, it's a historical issue, as in we are toying with the fruits of 2000 years of bloody labor as if they're just piNata prizes.
 
&gt;I don't want to shove politics in everyone's face all the time. I happen to think that free-market capitalism kicks socialism's ass and that spying and war are bad. I voted for Gary Johnson in 2012. If you think that a universal basic income is a good idea, or that weed should remain illegal, or think whatever about gay marriage, I don't care about those things enough to alienate viewers and I'm trying to shove my opinions in your face as little as possible. Even if you think that people are born boys and turn into girls, whatever, I think Bruce Jenner is really funny but I don't care enough to go beyond making jokes about ropes. But this isn't about politics, it's about having an identity and a home and not losing these beautiful civilizations that took so long to create.
 
&gt;The future is headed towards Cormac McCarthy's The Road and talking/thinking about it gives you an uh-oh boo-boo feeling in your tummy because someone might call you waycis? A lot of people have been hitting me up recently to ask about this, and everybody comes to the same conclusion, they agree and can see what's happening, but addressing it head-on gives them a no-no feeling, like a bad. They feel a bad, and they worry that people will think they're bad racers, shame no-no.
 
&gt;This doesn't mean you have to start hating black people or using racial slurs or deliberately making yourself unpopular at parties, but whites need to regain some sort of cohesive tribal self-interest and identity right now just like everybody else has or in fifty years this country is going to be like Brazil (the bad parts, not the sexy babes and beaches and rich dudes in white linen suits). It's possible to have compassion for Third-Worlders, goodwill towards all mankind, respectful conversations with and attitudes towards people who don't look like you, and at the same time not want your own country to become a cesspit :) Sorry for getting all 'political', I'll go make some funny faces now!",,t1_d5zngg7,studcase,False,d5zr0wl,15,,15,milliondollarextreme,0,t5_2vsta

Read what I wrote earlier. The treaties restrict power. That's what the four fundamental freedoms do and restrictions like state aid. They are designed to stop intra-Community distortions in the market. Really basic, mate.

&gt; So is it diluted or centralised, you are mixing yourself up. Fact is that there are matters that are better considered on a continental scale, and the EU is there for this.

I was trying to avoid the question of the Commission. It's diluted through the European Parliament and the Council. That's a fact of sharing power with 27 other nations.

I mean, critical thinking mate... This is the point of the EU. It restricts national measures and confers national powers to EU institutions to create common rules for a common market.

&gt; We were talking about different things, but ok. The point of the ECJ is to ensure that the laws are maintained. As you say, it shows no favour or bias. What is the issue? It is still not foreign as we are a part of it. It is just shared. It is for matters in the EU.

Let's meet between the two and call it a supranational court.

I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw, a beautiful woman, bathing herself. but she was crying...
I hesitated, watching, struck by her beauty. And also by how her presence; the delicate curve of her back, the dark sweep of her hair, the graceful length of her limbs, even her tears, added to the majesty of my surroundings. I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy, but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.
She spied me before I could compose myself. But she didn't cry out. Instead our eyes held and she smiled, enigmatically, fresh tears still spilling down her cheeks. I was frozen. I knew nothing about this woman, and yet, as we stood on opposite sides of a pool of water, thousands of miles from my own home and everyone I had ever known, I felt the most intense connection. Not just to her, but to the earth, the sky, the water between us. And also to the entirety of mankind. As if she symbolized thousands of years of the human condition.
I wanted to go to her, to comfort her, to probe this feeling of belonging I had never encountered before. But I couldn't. Because I knew that if I spoke, if she spoke, that moment would be ruined. And I knew I would need the memory of that moment to carry me through the inevitable dark patches throughout my life.
And so I watched her lower her hand, turn, and slowly walk to the shore opposite me. The rest of her perfect form was gradually revealed to me, and I held my breath as I watched her disappear behind a copse of trees near the water.

&gt; Germany and the European Union &amp;quot;Should under no circumstances be blackmailed&amp;quot; by Turkey during talks on visa liberalization for Turkish citizens, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said Monday.

&gt; Gabriel&amp;#039;s remarks came after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl&amp;uuml;t &amp;Ccedil;avuşoğlu warned that Ankara would no longer support the EU-Turkey migration deal if Turkish citizens do not receive visa-travel by October at the latest.

&gt; &amp;quot;The decision not to allow the broadcast was absolutely fine and also lawful,&amp;quot; Gabriel said Monday.

And if you're *actually* poor, and not this middle class version of poor, then you have less in terms of assets than could be justified by court proceedings, let alone selling everything you own to pay for court.

&gt;That, however, doesn't mean that they ""aren't all that concerned with quality of life'"", which is what you said. In fact, your assertion that poor people will trap themselves in debt for a TV is pretty incontrovertible evidence that some poor people are very concerned with quality of life.

If every attempt at improving one's quality of life is monetized by those with more than you, it's not the same as these things being taken for granted. I've seen people fight because someone broke an xbox by accident and neither they nor the owner could afford to replace it. That's not being ""concerned with quality of life"" - 
**it's pursuing a single luxury and failing**. 

If poor people were overly concerned with quality of life, eating less fat and less sugar would be more important than having a TV. Those foods are harder to get ([food desert](http://americannutritionassociation.org/sites/default/files/food-deserts.jpg)) and more expensive than ""regular"" poor people food. The fats and  sugars are often necessary in low income diets because you might not **get** three meals a day. 

&gt; it's possible in many parts of America to have a house note with similar monthly installments as rent would be.

Credit and income for a down payment don't exist for poor people, sorry. You're thinking of the middle class.

&gt;Okay, so it's still no different than an apartment.

You are the one claiming people prefer a yard. If you want one, you get to pay someone else's mortgage - but your rent goes up while the property value goes down. That's how you pay for a yard - get victimized by some middle class fuck that thinks he understands poverty while contributing to yours.

&gt;Someone who is poor according to American standards (below-median, &lt;$200 in disposable income/month after living expenses) might have things a European would consider a luxury.

This is almost *always* the MDs.   And they have the *least* right to the word. 

The word ""doctor"" in Latin mean teacher.  See related words like *docent* and *doctrine*.    In the Middle Ages, the word came to be associated with the titles in the schooling system: Baccalaureate 
(which means to crown someone with laurel berries), Master, Doctor. 

Just like the trades had (and still have) apprentice/journeyman/master -- where the masters were expected to instruct. 

The word doctor actually has *nothing* to do with medicine.   It's acquired that meaning simply by common usage. 


In the UK system they only receive a Bachelors of Medicine. In the USA/Canada and most of the rest of Europe they receive a  Doctor of Medicine degree.  Some of these programs don't have ""premed"" like in the USA and start right from ugrad, sort of like many pharmacy schools do now, which also award ""Doctor of"" degrees. 

""Doctor of"" degrees are professional degrees, which is to say they don't require scholarly research.

Ph.D. are not ""Doctor of"" degrees.  They are Doctorates.  They are *literally*, *licentia docendi* or licenses to teach.  If you read the text of a degree they always mention the ""rights and privileges"" of the degree.  

Ph.D. degrees revolve around original scholarship.  You can't just 'check the boxes' and get through it and they are in no way comparable to a Ph.D.   Law school for instance is only 3 years long. 

Anyway, I never use my title, except in the classroom where its proper, and in doctor's offices because fuck them.

The whole wild-west shootout thing that some people claim will happen, is simply bullshit. It's possible, in the whole ""anythings possible"" sense, but it's realistically so insignificant a scenario it's not a concern.

The issues that I, personally, take with campus carry don't revolve around those dramatic and unrealistic events.

You've got a lot of people on campus, from many different countries. Many of them aren't familiar with guns and don't own them.

Now let's say you're in class and you're forming up for some group discussion about European history or some other mundane thing. Discussion starts and a foreign student says something you disagree with. You two start discussing it with some back and forth and everything is polite and agreeable. You lean over to grab a folder for something you need and he sees you imprinting, which is legal is Texas as of 2013.  He is genuinely, if irrationally, scare of guns. He may feel that he should stop disagreeing with you because he doesn't want to get hurt.

Now you didn't do anything wrong. You certainly didn't intend to intimidate him. But the academic setting was ruined by the presence of a gun. Sure, he wasn't being rational, but that doesn't change the outcome.

You think your test was incorrectly graded. You approach the prof after class to speak with him about it and you set your backpack/purse down to grab your test out and he sees your gun inside (you may not carry this way but many guys/girls do, and will). He has to think ""Did they intentionally let me see that to influence my decision on this test grade? Is this some kind of threat? Does he have a license for that? Should I say something? Perhaps it was unintentional...but...""

That could result in unintended consequences even though you certainly didn't intend it to be a threat or even for them to see it.

People have this irrational, completely bullshit idea that gun free zones are supposed to keep guns out. They aren't. They're just signs. They're specifically designed for law abiding citizens. If you're in a gun free zone and you see a gun you KNOW that its illegal. You don't have to ask a myriad of questions and wonder what the intent is, what they're doing, or if they have a license. It's just flat out illegal.

On campus, now with guns, those questions are going to come up and go through people's minds, which isn't inherently good or bad. But in many cases it could prove a hindrance to academia.

Well, this building has labs that require federal security clearances. Do we allow guns in this building and just not in those area, or do we not allow guns in the building at all, or do we not allow guns on that floor?  What if those areas are on the first floor? We can't have a negligent discharge going off and going through an Anthrax container (I use this example because my alma mater had an anthrax lab.)

UT decided to mandate that students couldn't carry with a chambered round. Not sure if they reversed that decision because a lot of people were upset about it, but the intent was to eliminate negligent discharges.

Additionally, many gun owners have publicly said they won't adhere to the chambered round policy, and sometimes not even to the campus carry policy ""because they shouldn't have to; it's their 2nd amendment right"" and I've even seen some claiming they've been carrying on campus for years. These people are, by definition, not law abiding, and are creating a problem for school admin.

These concerns aren't glamorous so people don't usually bother to outline them, and they certainly aren't all doom and gloom. They're issues that can be addressed with some outreach, safety courses, etc. But as long as those irrational dipshit reasons keep prevailing; nobody is going to talk about these seemingly small reasons.",,t1_d5zoha5,TwiztedImage,False,d5zudaq,2,,2,news,0,t5_2qh3l

There is no real technical problem with making what's known as a Passivhaus (passive or net-zero consumption house), but what you will run into is a lack of expertise in general construction. Retrofitting existing buildings is very hard, because in order to build an effective net-zero house you need:

- A hermetically sealed house with balanced ventilation (i.e. an active, deterministic ventilation system that harvests heat from the exhaust and puts it back into the inlet)
- Good insulation (but nothing particularly groundbreaking, we're taking 0.15 or better k-values on average, so standard-issue triple glazing and insulated double walls are often good enough)
- Low-temperature heating, i.e. floor/wall heating
- Depending on your geology either an underground buffer or direct geothermal heating
- A water/water heat pump to drive the two above points
- A small solar panel array and battery array (a couple kWp/kWh generally suffices)

These houses are already being built in bulk in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands for pretty cheap, however you do really need to build it like this from the beginning. Retrofitting an underground buffer vat in a built-up area with pipes and foundations in the way is no fun and really expensive. Replacing glazing and insulation in an existing, thin-walled house is needlessly expensive. And the ROI of heat pumps and low-temperature heating/cooling is pretty long, so retrofitting that is almost never worth it unless you're heating electrically.

Pure energy harvesting (just brute-forcing it with loads of solar panels and batteries) is a lost cause. You'll be spending ridiculous amounts on a grossly overdimensioned solar+battery system and have none of the comfort and cost benefits of a net-zero house.

He is a disruptor and does not play by the agreed-upon rules of the club, therefore me makes a lot of people nervous.

While you make some fair points, especially regarding the birther movement, I still see a lot of the liberal twist still in the reading of his statements.  I parsed them a little differently both when I heard them and when I reviewed them again, so it bristles me to this day when the same adjectives get thrown about as though they were facts, when in fact they seem to be PC conflations.

The subject of Mexican immigration is a good one because so much of the xenophobic, racist attributions started when he talked about Mexicans coming across the border.  In the discussion, he was talking about illegal immigrants who were crossing the border from Mexico, not legal migrants or those going through the offical channels.  This is a huge distinction, as one means a vetting process and the other could be anyone.  Where he made an assumption was where he suggested that Mexico was happily encouraging it's lowest to seek refuge in the United States so they wouldn't have to deal with them.  Whether or not this is true could still be fairly contested.  One thing is true, when illegals come over they are not necessarily a country's best and brightest.  As the admission of thousands of Syrian refugees into Europe has shown, in the absence of a good vetting program this can include rapists.  Even further to this point is that most countries in the world show no shame in securing their borders from those who would try to come in illegally.  

Now, let's consider how the left used his comments.  First, they intentionally conflated the distinction between immigrants and legal migrants, suggesting that he had meant Mexicans as a whole.  They then used this as ""evidence"" that Trump was racist, xenophobic and hated Mexicans.  It goes beyond a simple misreading of his intent.  It is a willful, systematic misleading of a section of the population in order to demonize their opponent.  I understand that political parties do this as part of their mission statement, but so much of the US media has packaged this so well that it is pretty obvious they are part of this machine.  We all know that branding someone a racist is both the worst thing in US discourse, but it is here being used as a tool of censorship.

For the Muslim ban, another very politically incorrect proposal, it was suggested as a way to halt the spread of terror to US shores, not as an attack on Muslims directly.  It wasn't a George. W invasion of Iraq as response to 911 attack on Muslims.  In fact, Trump's rhetoric has been restrained when it comes to actual violence or war on Muslim countries, even mirroring Sanders' view that Muslim states need to be involved in halting the spread of radical Islam.  He has lately proposed that the ban be country-based instead of religion-based.  Yes, they may have been problematic, but they were not maliciously motivated like the left keeps pretending they are.

Ghazala Khan looked exactly like a typical Muslim woman who quietly stands behind her husband.  This is not uncommon in the Muslim world.  Women don't have a voice in many countries.  His comment ""was she allowed to speak? you tell me"" is hardly prejudicial and not even close to an attack.  Given Trump's ability to go off the handle, I would say he took (and is still taking) their insults against his character with a lot of patience and is staying on message.  What the media is going crazy about was an aside and barely a response.

I'm not one to defend everything he does, in fact I think there are plenty of things to attack him on policy-wise without resorting to these distortions of what he's trying to get across.  I do think he proposes some non-PC solutions to problems that have been dragging through every single political cycle and never get solved.  For that reason, I really do think he will be voted in come November in what will be the USA's own Brexit moment, where the masses reject the political elites for someone who is flawed, but independent.

&gt; The output index fell to 47.8 in July from 53.6 in June, its lowest since October 2012, while new orders - which grew robustly in June - suffered their sharpest turnaround since 1998 and fell at their fastest rate in over three years.

As long as you're not the ""it's a conspiracy man"" kind of person there's a good example on why voting is important.

As voters of young age had a lot to lose when leaving the EU this would have been a much more important issue for them than for anyone older.

t3_4vlv9b,1470080186.0,1473141103,1470079946,Early Medieval Slavery,0,"This is actually the basis for not one but *two* hotly debated theses for medieval slavery: (1) Roman/Classical slavery became economically unsustainable once society shifted to systems of feudal landholding, and (2) Rules prohibiting the enslavement of Christians gradually drove up the costs of slave imports, causing slavery to disappear in Europe over the course of the middle ages. Both arguments have their flaws.

The first argument is really based on Karl Marx's idea of history—that history isn't about politics; it's rather about the deeper socio-economic changes that drive politico-ideological change. Marx argued that social relations had evolved from primitive peasant communes to ancient slave societies to medieval feudalism and on into modern capitalism. But we now acknowledge that history isn't a single one-way street but rather a vast multiplicity of stories. Ancient slavery was much more diverse than Marx thought. Since Marx was writing in the 1840s, the living model of slavery that he used as a reference was US antebellum slavery, which was a tremendous historical peculiarity for a number of reasons and forms a poor basis for understanding classical slavery. Once we start thinking about there being multiple kinds of slavery, the reasons for its disappearance must be just as diverse. New forms of landholding might help explain why the agricultural slavery of the Roman villa system disappeared, but it doesn't explain why domestic slaves went away (if, indeed, they ever really did). Conversely, domestic slavery disappeared after the US Civil War, but sharecropping and chain gangs seem to have perpetuated some of the same forms of racialized labor extraction that existed before emancipation.

The second argument is in some ways based on the opposite premise of Marx—that ideology, including religion, drives human action (rather than simply obscuring its economic motives, as Marx might more likely allege). But the fact is that few people do something just because they're Christians, and even if they point to religion as their motivation, chances are you could find a historical example of someone doing the exact opposite and still claiming that Christianity informed their motives. People's understanding of Christianity has turned them into murderers and martyrs, and it's driven both enslavement and emancipation. So in this case, I think it's possible to argue that changing conceptions of what Christianity is (and whom it should protect) gradually made slavery economically unsustainable in parts of Europe, but this is as much about the changing place of slave labor in society as it is about religion or economics.

I suspect your question was meant to target the 19th-century abolition movement, in part because there isn't much public knowledge about medieval slavery, although that's starting to change. Nevertheless, I hope these examples discourage thinking about it in terms of either economic or moral reductivism. Instead, I'd recommend thinking about it in terms of historical particularities (abolition in the UK happened very differently from emancipation in the US) and attention to how slavery—and its disappearance—must be deeply entangled in the fabric of society, from the philosophies and ethics that guide it to the economics and institutions that sustain it.

I'm not the best person to recommend a book on US emancipation, although Sven Beckert's [*Empire of Cotton*](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/10461/empire-of-cotton-by-sven-beckert/9780375713965/) (2014) is a great read. For British abolitionism, I really enjoyed Christopher Leslie Brown, [*Moral Capital: Foundations of British Abolitionism*](http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=1239) (2006). There's also a brilliant study of Haiti: Laurent Dubois, [*A Colony of Citizens*](http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/t-6589.html) (1998). For the medieval period, see Jeffrey Fynn-Paul, ""[Empire, Monotheism and Slavery in the Greater Mediterranean Region from Antiquity to the Early Modern Era](http://past.oxfordjournals.org/content/205/1/3.extract),"" *Past and Present* 205 (2009), 3–40.

And even the return of YS was a bad decision, because he will retire soon. You need fresh blood, like mithy or hybrid. Not someone who will retire at the end of the split (or a stupid rookie like klaj/noxiak). they did everything wrong, listening to fanboys. and not making smart moves like G2 did.

In my opinion the fnatic org show poor decision making with their roaster and now we are paying the price. 

A good decision was to re-sign Ro&amp;Huni after the S5 spring split. They just did not and let them free agent at the end of worlds... And of course they receive many offers... Fnatic didn't want to put the money. And they let them + the captain leave. So pretty much all the team to rebuild. Again, with rookie and korean players while you can have better in EU. (like cabo top, etc...).

So I'm a very disappointed by the fnatic org, they are not making their best to have a great team... And keep saying that they will be the best team in eu and in the world... But you can't, with poor decisions like this.

I just hope fnatic not go to world this year, like that they will have more time to rethink about this team... Because they will need time to rebuild what they destroy this year.

A good 2017 fnatic for me:

Top: Cabo (aggressive top wih a really good champion pool).


Jungle: RO (or someone like him, not a carry jungler, strategic jungler always win in the end).


Mid: Perkz (or febi) (aggressive mid laner)


ADC: hans sama (can be a new zven or even better).


support: Rekkles (I'm sure he can be a really great support, because he is far from the best now as an adc) or Ignar/hybrid.

Overall, Fi is a great and affordable service and I really wish I could ditch AT&amp;T for it. After using Fi for months on and off, I have my reasons for sticking with AT&amp;T for now:

* Fi's service coverage is iffy at best around Los Angeles. The idea of switching between carrier towers is neat, but it isn't flawless in practice. There were many days when I'd notice ""No Signal"" on my phone while driving from metro LA to my house. With a ton of logging and other apps, it looked like the cell signal would stall any time there was a hand-off between T-Mobile and Sprint. Having to toggle Airplane Mode every 5 minutes wasn't an ideal solution. 

* Fi's support is amazing (it really, *really* is amazing), especially since you can chat with a specialist within 1-2 minutes max, or jump on a call with a knowledgeable person in the same amount of time. None of the long AT&amp;T holds, marketing BS, etc. That said, there were a number of issues that I had with service that they weren't able to comment on or solve. I let this slide, though, since Fi was (and still is?) a beta service. 

* Fi refuses to play nice with Google Voice. I completely understand the reasoning behind the fact that you can't combine Voice numbers and have it forward to a Fi number, but I have two work lines that are through GV. This was somewhat of a deal breaker for me. 

________________

Even with its shortcomings, Fi is still great and I still retain my service (albeit on ""Pause""). I used Fi during my vacation in Europe and paid only $47 in data and call fees for the entire month. That is a beautiful number, especially when you look at your AT&amp;T bill for a family member and gasp when you see a number 10 times bigger.

Finland has highest gun ownership in Europe I think, which is kind of logical considering they are the most sparsely populated country in Europe (78% of their land is uninhabited forests). Its a real wilderness over there with bears and wolves and what not, so its logical people there who dont live in the big cities have guns. It's a kind of necessity really. Firms like ''Sako'', ''Tikka'' come from there.  Plus they have obligatory military service for all males over 18 years, and if I am not mistaken they can keep their service rifles at home after completing their service and beeing transfered to reserve troops. 

I am not sure, but suspect Sweden and Norway are simular, since those countries as well are sparsely populated with big wildernesses up north. I know that many Norwegians own guns.

Western Europe as well, but you must understand that philosophy here is different. Few people here own guns like Americans, just for the fun of it, or just because they can and have disposable money laying around. If a European buys a gun, he will generally do it because he plans to do something with it, something specific. For hunting animals in the forrest or protecting his farm from bears, maybe he lives in a dangerous neighborhood and buys a pistol for self defense. ''Sport shooting'' exists, but its very small, its not mainstream. 

In recent times some people at least in Eastern Europe, have bought guns because they are afraid maybe war might start between Russia and NATO. Vice news made a documentary on Polish paramilitaries, and those guys said that they bought a semi auto AK-47 because of that. 

But in general, ''assault'' weapons or ''war'' weapons are usually ignored and frown upon, I think its because of the history. American civilians didnt need to live through the horrors of World war 1 and 2, their soldiers died but their civilians were safe. While people here experienced it first hand, I think that is why guns meant for war and military use are kind of unpopular. ''If you want a Assault rifle, go and join the military, dont try to play soldier while ignoring the horrors, that's disrespectful'' kind of attitude.

t3_4vm1bf,1470086176.0,1473142613,1470084940,,0,"Wishing doesn't make something true.  There is a long list of difficult things to negotiate out before Article 50 is filed and before we would actually succeed in leaving the EU.  
1) What is the risk of breaking up the UK on the altar of Brexit, with regard to Scotland? 
2) How does the 310-mile Eire/Northern Ireland border stay open as it is legally bound to be under the Good Friday Agreement and at the same time prevent all of the Freedom of Movement Romanians and other EU citizens from entering the UK that way?  And if the border is made hard what is to prevent the further brake up of the UK?  
3) The Gibraltar question - in a normal year the risk of losing Gibraltar from the crown would be a major new story — today to May and the Brexiteers they pretend as if it doesn't matter.  
4) You cannot legally negotiate trade deals with other nations while you are in the EU; even ""informal chats"" risk prosecution, so how we get new trade deals is unclear, 
5) Trade deals take 7 to 10 years to negotiate, 
6) If our new agreement with the EU goes beyond simply Trade, then it will need ratification from all 27 Member States - that has never happened in less than 4 years.  Any one of the 27 could veto the sweetheart deal say 6 years from now and stop Brexit happening.  
7) The Lords could block Brexit.  8) The age demographic is changing - older people were more in favour of leave, young in favour of remain.  In just 4 to 6 years the dying off of the old and the young becoming of voting age will tip the balance from 52% to 48%.  Just think you need a 2% swing.  Voting age is 70-18 = 52 years.  2% of 52years is 1 year.  Give it four times that and there will likely no longer be a majority support for Leave.  [Young people are much more interested in having the opportunity to live and work outside the UK].   
8) More United is a new political movement in the UK that is going to crowd fund MPs who seek to Remain, with its members deciding who those MPs are and it is likely to be a key force to cut any Leave MPs from getting a seat.
9) The EU can't give us a 'sweetheart deal' because if they did, other countries would want one - so they have to give us a grotty deal, which once the negotiations are over will be seen for what it is — worse than the sweetheart deal we have today (with the Rebate and numerous opt outs)
10) The Frontier at Calais, even though we twisted the French arm to do our security for us, if negotiations get bitter that kindness could quickly lapse.  The border razor wire and refugee holding areas would then be near Dover.  See the film Children of Men for the Bexhill Refugee camp - its a real place in Sussex, it just doesn't have the razor wire today.
11) Big one - what about all of the Brits abroad in the EU today — if we are nasty to the EU these Brits will likely get deported and that will create a political fire storm, probably blocking Brexit  [By now you can probably see that this thing has not begun to be thought through  — they really didn't have a plan, in fact they hadn't taken responsibility for the consequences of their actions like shouting Fire in a packed Theatre.]
12) EU citizens in the UK
13) The need to keep compliance with EU regulations to sell into that market - and at the same time giving up a place at the table, a say in what they are — that is not logical. 
14) The various EU-lite deals being discussed by the right wing press tend to sacrifice the City of London's financial services market on the altar of Brexit - when that is seen in its true light, there is likely to be a fresh appreciation for the value that financial services bring to the UK economy.
15) Economic impacts.
16) And one people aren't talking about but is probably the most important of the lot: Systemic Failure triggered by attempting to do so many fundamental changes all at the same time.  So much change so quickly will likely wrap our public, private and voluntary sectors in so much transformation that figuring out the new business processes and compliance regimes will be hard.  If you try to do too much change too quickly then the outcome is likely to be a logjam where no change happens, or worse still end-to-end systems, such as food and petrol distribution become disrupted.  Knock on effects can compound and aggravate what seemed simple at first sight - as simple as coining in a new mantra ""Brexit means Brexit"" without beginning to work out the solution to the sixteen simultaneous equations just outlined abo
17) The UK doesn’t have trade negotiators.
18) Negotiating trade deals raises the need for sovereign encryption, a need even more tantamount than secrecy in war – in war you have allies – in trade as the UK (apart from the EU) has no allies that it can just give the crown jewels to.  However, [the UK is having to rely on Canadian know how to polish up its encryption capability  that doesn’t sound strong.](http://www.cgi-group.co.uk/news/cgi-to-provide-support-for-uk-ministry-of-defence-cryptography-management-system.)
19) The UK Government has several jobs to do in parallel. Think of it as someone getting a divorce.  They have to 1) spend literally hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of pounds [mine cost quarter of a million] with lawyers untangling them selves from the old partner, 2) and then they want to be off wooing the new partner … who is keen to have lavish attention so as to prove that they are more special than the old partner, 3) and they have to keep doing they day job plus 4) work a lot harder to earn more money to pay the double mortgage, the double car payments, the double utility bills, plus all the lawyers fees and 5) the kids are upset with all of this disruption and they demand more attention than usual and 6) the person is upset and stressed and needs more ‘me’ time to decompress and unstress… That is just like the UK, getting divorced from the EU.  There are 27 children involved, many of whom [like France] are mightily upset.  The new girlfriend is the new trade partners – such as China – and look how well that is going (Not) with the funding of the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.  May, simply doesn’t have time in her day to woo China. 

My prediction: The Tory right in alliance with UKIP and Murdoch will press the Article 50 button in about 2 years time.  Negotiations go from bad to worse to awful as parties attempt to balance over a dozen competing goals.  Either A) we find ourselves outside the EU without new trade deals in place or B) we are technically still in the EU until a set date and a new deal is on the table in front of us.  In either A or B my forecast is that what is on the table will be worse than the status quo — and almost everyone will see that difference - in the cold light of day.  At that point I forecast we'll go back to the EU with a new election mandate to remain, and will be told to take the default terms, which we'll take.  Euro.  Schengen Area.  No Rebate.  And no sweetheart deal on any emergency brakes.

Our presence there matters. It's mutually beneficial. Our allies have the strong arm of the U.S. military. We are able to protect our economic interests in those regions.

Economies are global. If we leave Korea, for example, do you realize how that might affect our economy? It would create an emboldened China, who would exert more pressure on S. Korea. If they influence Korean politics it has a major effect on our trade relations with them as well as our diplomatic relations.

Sure bases have a cost but there is immense benefit to having them. And I'd argue that removing then wouldn't put a dent in our spending and would only harm our interests abroad.

Yes

&gt; Common people in medieval Europe not only practiced magic, but embraced it, only distinguishing between beneficial and malicious actions

Please tell me you are not one of those wicca cranks, you'll need a source for this. superstition, cunning folk and *magic* are very different things.

&gt;  Before the Catholic Church's condemnation of all non-Christian practices, only negative behaviors or perceived magical beings would be targeted. The ostracization of a harmful ""other"" is little different from most social management behaviors across the world. Targeting witches as an inclusive group was not something the masses were used to doing; the rise of witch hunts in Europe were largely the influence of the Church in response to the shifting European world after the Black Death and the rise of Protestantism. 

This sounds very confused, like, 6 centuries in three lines confused.


&gt; In this, I do see a lot of similarity between Christianity's Wars of Religion and the schism happening in Islam today.

Blaming the church wasn't? I have no interest in defending the bloody church, however...


&gt; Blaming Islam as inherently backwards, when American Muslims, for instance, largely don't adhere to the tenets of wahabbism, is an inconsistency that needs to be addressed by people making such claims.


American Muslims have passed through a great deal of selection to cross the pond.  I can well imagine they are much more ""western-friendly"" than the average Muslim


&gt;  A small but powerful and wealthy group of people have been funding Islamic extremism for the last 30 years (eerily similar, again, to the medieval Church).

Yes, I am with you on this


&gt;I will not hold a religion that has so many sects, interpretations, traditions, and such a long history to the narrow, xenophobic, and sexist version promoted by that small group.


That's the point. It is not a small group. This may be news for you, but homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance and anti-western hatred are **mainstream** in the Muslim world both in Asia and Europe...

t3_4vnaps,False,1473143463,1470088008,,0,"Thanks.  I should probably disclose that I did consult on the FasTracks project in 2014 during a summer internship I had with RTD where they brought me out to Denver from DC to do a benchmarking study for them.  I was in Denver during that summer of peak construction, but my view into what they were doing had a heavier emphasis on benchmarking from the construction point of view rather than the operational point of view.  I studied a fair amount of urban planning and TOD theory in college so I have some insight here as it has been my job to compare the design and function of American transit systems.

Streetcars are like most forms of transit, they operate only as well as they are designed but usually serve a particular market with generally smaller capacity/train but high frequency compared to light rail and subways.  They are usually the cheapest form of rail transit to build (cost-per-mile), but have limited rewards in ultra high-density areas if cost discourages cities from putting in higher capacity transit (i.e. subways) in where there is/could be demand. Denver is less dense than most cities with subway systems which is one of the reasons we are seeing light rail and busses first.  

Denver likely has several corridors where streetcars could be effective from my point of view, especially as Denver (like most US cities) has limited options for grade-separated, high capacity transit built from the ground up due to the limited amount of exclusive ROW's transit agencies can acquire, even with a large amount of funding.  

If you put a streetcar on a busy street that can be impeded by cars, it is absolutely possible that the benefits would be considerably smaller than the largely grade-separated light rail service RTD operates outside of it's downtown loop.  That said, streetcars can operate over large sections of exclusive ROW where the amount of track over standard pavement it shares with cars depends entirely on design.  In European cities, streetcars often jump from street to street (usually not the huge multi-lane heavily-trafficked boulevards) on roads that generally have less car traffic than average (Hong Kong is kind of an exception to that).  Streetcar systems can have sections of ROW that are protected from cars with special lanes reserved exclusively for transit in addition to sections where it can run over park space with short grass around the rails rather than pavement.  US regulations make this more difficult here from a planning perspective, but it should be a possibility for connecting south to Cherry Creek.  

Streetcar and light rail trains can operate over the same infrastructure so future streetcar lines RTD would build could connect to the currently operational light rail lines.  From a design point of view, sharing the same voltage, catenary height, and other design factors is highly convenient in a lot of ways.  The difference is that streetcars have a lower carriage weight, lower height off the ground (easier to step on and off), and operate at a lower speed. For RTD's system, this can be done and may well be done with the new L line that would be extending and replacing the current spur line to 30th &amp; Downing with streetcar trains going around the downtown loop and north without a direct connection down RTD's main spine.  I would highly recommend against RTD attempting to run streetcar trains down the spine of shared track between 10th and Osage and i25 &amp; Broadway due to how it largely operates at capacity now, but this can be done in other places.  

Ultimately, with Denver's current density, streetcars with higher frequency could do well to serve Colfax and the neighborhoods between downtown and Cherry Creek.  Transit through the Mall and the densest part of Downtown may be another story.  One of my perceptions was that the Mall Ride operation was highly inefficient and could be improved.  Based on current demand, a streetcar loop downtown on 16th and 17th streets could be a solid replacement to the Mall and Metro rides but this could change as Denver grows.  Depending on how much further Denver's population and downtown density grows, a subway line from the Highlands, down under the mall, and possibly going all the way down to meet up with light rail trains at i25 &amp; Broadway could almost be justified based on density and traffic.  That said, tunneling is highly expensive so the option would require a heavy commitment.  As the Mall is overdue for a makeover anyway, I would not be surprised if there is a solid argument pitched within a transit study for a streetcar service but that it would get shot down in the short run due to funding concerns and lack of public demand.

If I were a current Denver resident (I really love Denver and would love to move back someday), I would absolutely vote for a streetcar system.

(Personally I think it is better, but it is a controversial issue). Either way it still has an old school feel to it and it is pretty ""hardcore"" as far as mmo's go.

As for being too late, that's definitely not the case. The game was already more than 10 years old when Kharsek made his account, and I bet you people were telling him it's too late to start playing. Now he's the highest level in the game. Kharsek and many older players grinded on old spawns which are no longer popular or as good as new spawns. You won't have to do that. Hunting new spawns you can catch up pretty fast. Anyways that doesn't even matter unless you're goal is to be the highest level or something. Once you're level 300 or so you can enjoy pretty much all the content the game has to offer so far (except the 999 door...), and there's plenty to do on the way to 300. (Many players have played for years and are still not 300).

You're probably wondering what server to play. All the servers have open world pvp except for optional pvp servers. On optional pvp you can only fight other players if you agree to an arena battle, but IMO those are boring. Optional pvp servers are basically non-pvp servers.

My favorite part of Tibia is the open world pvp however, so I'd suggest one of those server types. Hardcore servers are IMO the funnest, but they are hard worlds to start on and they are also lowly populated. For a noobier friendly experience, pick either a retro pvp server or open pvp server. Basically the difference is that retro pvp servers have a harsher pvp death penalty. Retro worlds also tend to have higher server populations, so if you like bumping into other players go with a retro world. The open pvp server Antica also has a high player population, so if you want to play open pvp and you're from EU that's a good choice. You can also consider servers which have reddit guilds (see the side bar), though I don't know how active they are.

t3_4vjkos,False,1473143684,1470088825,,0,"As others have said, it sounds like you enjoy high acid wines. I second the notion that you'd probably like a lot of Italian wines. As an even more general rule - *one with plenty of exceptions* - I'd say to go to European wines, and ""traditional"" wines more broadly. A lot of Californian wines and South American wines - and even European wines in the ""modern"" style - are lower in acidity. Same with most wines you'll find at the supermarket. 


That said, this has way more to do with the winemaker's style than a region, so in any region you'll find people making zesty acid-driven wines and some making rich, sometimes flabby, lower-acid wines. It's just that different regions have different winemaking traditions that hold certain elements in different esteem. Your ""typical"" Napa Cabernet will be high in alcohol, low in acid, and rich and concentrated (to the Napa apologists: Yes, I've had some great old-school stuff from the area, and I'm sure there are plenty of gems, but most of the time I drink Napa wine it only confirms this stereotype). Your ""typical"" nebbiolo from Langhe will have a distinct sourness that some find off-putting. In each case, it's partly due to climate, partly to the varietals grown there, and most importantly due to the winemaker's style. 

 
Also, do you like white wines? I've gotten super into whites for this very reason - you can a fantastic sensory experience from the zingy acidity a lot of whites offer.

Why the EU should have done that? Don't you think they have other things to do than to find what could be achieve on every subjects due to an hypothetical leaving of the UK (we are speaking of negotiations during at least 2 years and surely more)? Btw there was a (conccise) new deal between EU and UK (with UK in, agreed, but It was said as the best deal that could be found) that I'm sure most of Brexiter didn't bother to read.

And what? You have to make it for every 27 other countries? The real problem is here: Uk had so much special deal and opt out from the EU that they think that they are entitled to more than other countries.

The ones who should have shown the alternative were the Brexit camp.

&gt; It was more a case of 'project fear' and a mentality of 'we're not going to prepare for it because we don't want it to happen so we'll Ignore the possibility'

Still about that project fear thing? Even if some of the things that were labelled like that have proven true. EU officials and officials from member states(and other countries) warned British people what would be a post Brexit UK and you choose to dismiss it by the ""Project Fear"" thing. Stop saying it is EU fault, it is ridiculous. If British people didn't want this situation, they had to inform themselves.

Moreover, even if there was a deal agreed on it I don't get why it wouldn't have been pictured as ""Lies from Bruxelles"", ""Project Fear"", ""We don't care about EU, we have Commonwealth"" as it was during the campaign.

&gt; it happened and both the EU and the British government were all left not knowing what to do.

&gt; tricot is an experimental rock band from Kyoto, Japan created in 2010 by three talented female musicians: Nakajima Ikkyu (vocals, guitar), Kida Motoko ""motifour"" (guitar, vocals), and Sagane Hiromi ""hirohiro"" (bass, vocals). Previous drummer Kazutaka Komaki left in 2014 with no official replacement but live drummers have included Yuumi of FLiP and Yamaguchi Miyoko of detroit7.

&gt; The band has developed a unique mix of elements using their fragile but dynamic vocal styles combined with thrilling, unpredictable and addictive song transitions as they explore dreamy post-rock-esque melodies and the complex rhythms similar to math rock.

&gt; In 2012 and 2013, due to the well recieved singles, EPs and mini-album releases, they performed at several major festivals across Japan such as ARABAKI ROCK FEST, FUJI ROCK FESTIVAL, ROCK IN JAPAN, RISING SUN ROCK FESTIVAL, MONSTER BASH, WILD BUNCH FEST, SWEET LOVE SHOWER and more.

&gt; Not long after this was the arrival of tricot's debut full-length album ""T H E"" which followed another long and successful support tour, leading into the 2014 year with appearances around 5 countries during the “What’s Ochansensu-Su!? tricot Asia Tour”.

&gt; That same year the band appeared at four large festivals in Europe and show no signs of slowing down their rapidly expanding career.

&gt; The band's name is sometimes stylized as: トリコ (toriko)

You're also clearly willing to play into the pro-choice caricature yourself, by calling a fetus a collection of cells, as if a fully formed human isn't ultimately just a collection of cells. It's a dumb argument. And a dehumanizing one too.

&gt;There is no such thing as an infallible form of birth control. 

The efficacy of birth control is heavily dependent on proper and consistent usage, which the study you site doesn't acknowledge. Women who take birth control pills don't became pregnant because the pills didn't work, they become pregnant because they weren't consistent in their consumption of the pill and didn't follow its directions properly. Same could be said about most other forms of birth control, including condoms. 

&gt;https://www.optionsforsexualhealth.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control-options/effectiveness

This site lays out the difference between effectual use and theoretical use. In other words, just be more fucking careful and read the directions.

Personally, I think that 99.7% efficacy rating is pretty damn great, and for the .3% who could possibly still get pregnant I would simply suggest getting an early abortion, which me and many other people who have been labeled ""pro-life"" by planned parenthood are in favor of. I'm for an 16-18 week limit, which is more permissible than the majority of European nations, but gets you labeled pro-life here in the United States. 

&gt;Funny, because it's not your body, not your choice. I am an adult and I have the right to choose not to be pregnant. 

An emotional argument through and through. A man, in a drunken stupor, can have unprotected sex and be held responsible for the consequences of that action for 18 years. A woman, who can take birth control, who can take the morning after pill, who can use a condom, who can use a contraceptive device, who can get her tubes tied, who can give up her child for adoption, who can be abstinent, who can have forms of sex that aren't penetrative vaginal sex, who can even have an early abortion (which many pro-lifers are willing to compromise on) isn't really free unless she has that one extra option.

Modern women have more control over their reproductive organs than in any other time in human history. Yet they need that one extra choice, because society so infantilizes women that it doesn’t expect them to be responsible enough to attempt one of the other choices I listed.

Unfortunately, this is likely the wrong place for you to get the advice you may need. The Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, for example, does not have the remit to satisfactorily address your claims. 

There are likely a number of redditors here with similar experiences in foreign countries who may be able to weigh in and provide you some other advice, but mine is to go elsewhere for more pertinent advice.

Step 1. Go to /r/legaladvice or /r/LegalAdviceUK to try to get advice on the laws of the specific nation in which this privacy violation took place, as well as advice on how this may fall under EU Law.

Your ability to get copies of police reports dealing with the allegations against you that precipitated the event, and screen grabs of the Facebook messages you've received may be seen as useful pieces of evidence. As well as the names of all of the actors in this drama.

You may be told you have no case, despite it being traumatizing, or you may have grounds to sue the Hostel in a way that makes you feel whole again. Keep in mind, of course, you are unlikely to get the result you might anticipate from a US court. And if the potential damages are less than the cost of returning for any trial, the practicality of moving forward may become moot.

Step 2. Get some specific advice from somewhere about identity theft and how to protect yourself (and monitor new applications for credit or whatever). 

There may not be much you can do to stop it (I mean the information is already out there) but being watchful may allow you to mitigate any negative consequences to your credit score.

Step 3. You may want to talk to a counselor about your experience. I had my flat in London broken into (and they got my roommate's cash tips he'd been saving and our laptops) and it was useful for us to talk to each other about how we felt vulnerable after the fact, and about how we may have been marked for future break-in's because they knew we'd have to buy new laptops, etc...

Since you don't have a roommate that experienced the same violation with whom you can commiserate, having a professional to consult may be helpful to talk through your anxiety. 

Finally, Step 4, you may need to chalk this up as simply a shitty experience that you can learn from. So many of us go on a European vacation to learn about the world and about ourselves. 

There are a lot of great lessons in this experience that you may look back on as useful, even if they seem invasive and painful at present.

Good luck sorting all of this out.
