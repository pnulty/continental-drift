This isn't exactly true.

Inner-city areas in the US have a violence problem.  If you control the statistics to include only white Americans, the rate of violent crime is no different than Europe or Australia.  It's a little bit lower actually.

If you look at New York alone, something like 98% of illegal shootings were by blacks or latinos targeting blacks or latinos.  There is some controversy about these figures.  Mainly, these figures don't fit well into a popular narrative so they are discounted by some sectors of political ideology.  But the numbers are solid.

It's now possible to do this sort of analysis as the FBI has finally started to release its crime statistics with racial breakdown included whereas for the longest time they did not.

I bring it up only because it's an important issue.

You should wonder why if such-and-such countries are so Democratic, prosperous, happy, and wonderful, why would anyone plot a coup or help a small faction of coup plotters?

If you keep an open mind and if you look through the history of real or imagined coup-plots being supported by the West, you'll come to realize that the #1 reason is because of the fascistic or communistic oppressive nature of such countries. 

Really, crack open some books and do some specific research on all coups that you think ""westerners were involved in."" If you look through it deep enough you'll start to see that the West aren't ""bad guys"" in all this.

We all know why there were civilian-combatants willing to die to fight coup-tanks... (MOSQUES).

But the real question is: why were there Turkish people willing to die to fight Erdogan? Because they follow a Gulen cult? Sure but Erdogan was a Gulenist and implements similar things to what Gulenists wanted. 

Who really knows exactly who the coup plotters were? What if they were a mix of people? What if they were AKP-people who were betraying Erdogan? What if they were Gulenists and other Gulenists didn't join the coup? What if there are more than 3-4 factions? 

We all know anti-Muslim Russia is definitely meddling in Turkish affairs but strangely, Religious Muslims don't ever question it. Russia's whole foreign policy is designed to either kill off all Muslims or to make Muslims-fight-each-other.

Have you asked yourself these questions?

Maybe a friend of yours died to coup plotters and so you're angry and support Erdogan.

Here's what I've learnt about decals, which might help you (I like the decalling phase myself). 

Decals are different: Japanese and current Airfix, and some Italeri decals are kind of thick and 'slow': slow to separate from the backing, and being thick they don't 'fold over' themselves easily. They are easy to use but hard to blend in as they don't easily conform to detail underneath. Many modern kits from the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe have great decals: thin, opaque, responsive. But they have to be handled with care as, being thin, they can screw themselves up into a ball, or break while being positioned. 

First, you need a gloss surface. No ifs or buts. I use either floor polish ('Future') or acrylic gloss clear. If the surface is 'pebbly' I will then buff it with *very* fine abrasive cloth, used wet. 

If you haven't used the particular brand of decals before, do a test decal on scrap.  In all cases the idea is to cut out the design (I usually leave the carrier film on, I don't cut the decal close, as the 'natural' edge of the carrier film is easier to hide than a cut edge), dip it in warm water and wait for it to begin to 'float' off the backing paper. Be patient. Prod it gently with a finger tip and be ready to apply it to the model.  Thin Czech-type decals should be treated with gentleness and care, and not manipulated too much.

Now you're ready to go, use a wet brush to apply a puddle to the model: my formula is to use a bit of Micro Set, and a bit of moisture taken from decal backing paper (ie, the empty sheet left over after my last decal was applied). This is not just water, but soapy water that really helps the air bubbles get out and allows the decal to be manipulated, 'floated' over the surface. I hold the decal paper edge with tweezers, and push the decal design off with a fingertip. Small decals I grab with fine tweezers and sit in place. If the decal is a struggle to position, apply more decal-paper water to ensure to does not start to 'grip' the model.

The majority of my decal disasters occur either when the decal separates in the water and screws itself up, or by moving the decal on the model without enough water/moisture underneath it. 

Once the decal is in place, wick off the water with a tissue, and add a dab of Micro Sol or Gunze Mr Mark Softer. If necessary, roll out air bubbles with a wet Q-tip. After 10 minutes, if necessary cut the decal  along panel lines with a sharp razor. After 30 minutes-2 hours, gently wipe away decal soap with a damp tissue or Q tip.

Once done, apply another gloss coat to seal in the decal, then a matt coat to make everything uniform.",,llordlloyd,t3_4viw4m

Well, we still have an embassy in Baghdad's Green Zone the size of Vatican City, but it's a fair point :)

It's also not a comparable situation because Iraq wasn't done for US interests (in fact it was done in spite of US interests), whereas Crimea *was* done for Russian interests. The US never had any designs on annexing Iraq. The real reason Saddam was removed was for Israel's interests.

But I still think there's enough congruity as far as the 'voting under occupation' goes to mention it.

I agree that it's not ideal to let Russia do these kinds of actions with impunity (not that we did, we sanctioned the shit out of them and whipped Europe into doing the same despite their economic interests). 

In Russia's defense though, their involvement in Crimea was not just apropos of nothing, for the sake of conquest or territorial enlargement only. It was a direct response to the coup in Kiev which was poised to install a new government actively hostile to minority rights in Ukraine (such as the ethnic Russian minority in Ukraine). 

And also, I don't think the USA can criticize Russia on this without appearing to be hypocrites. Not only due to the precedent of the illegal 2003 war on Iraq, but also due to the precedent of the illegal 1999 US/NATO war  on Serbia (which was a stepping stone for Kosovo declaring unilateral independence and the US recognizing them), and the illegal 2011 US/NATO  war on Libya as well.

O que eu estava a dar a entender é que os ciclistas têm um maior incentivo em não criar situações de perigo, pois normalmente são o elo mais fraco na via pública (a seguir aos peões).

Custa-me a perceber porquê tanto problema com os ciclistas a ultrapassarem vermelhos quando estes serão com certeza os maiores interessados em não serem atropelados. Se atravessam o vermelho é porque quase de certeza o podem fazer sem correrem grande risco de levarem com um carro em cima.

Por isso é que a mim só me chateia que não deixem passar os peões, esses sim, são o elo mais fraco em relação à bicicleta.

&gt; O problema, especificamente, de andarem em contra-mão é que dá-me menos tempo de reacção uma vez que se soma a velocidade deles à minha em vez de se subtrair.

Pela minha experiencia é irrelevante. Venham eles em sentido contrario a diferença de velocidades é quase sempre tão grande que é como se estivessem parados.

Se eu for a 50 e a bicicleta a 10 a diferença será de 40, se vier em contra-mão a diferença será de 60. Mas se eu for a 70 a diferença já será de 60 mesmo que a bicicleta vá no sentido correcto.

Portanto o maior risco nem é andar em contra-mão, é simplesmente o ciclista expor-se a situações em que está pouco visível.

Acho muito mais inconsciente um ciclista que vá andar à noite sem luz ou em estradas apertadas e com curvas do que um ciclista que circule devagar em contra-mão numa rua com visibilidade.

&gt; Sabes... As leis existem por um motivo. Não é nenhuma conspiração para lixar a vida aos ciclistas...

Esqueces-te é que as regras de transito são feitas essencialmente para os carros.

Sabes porque é que muitas ruas são de sentido único? Porque não cabem dois carros lado a lado.

Numa rua de sentido único mas que seja larga o suficiente para passar uma bicicleta e um carro é irrelevante em que sentido ela vá.

&gt; Pelas tuas respostas presumo que sejas um dos ciclistas que pensa que a lei não se aplica a ele.

Sou automobilista, ciclista e peão. Por isso acho que sei bem ver ambos os lados. 

Há questões em que fico do lado dos ciclistas e há questões em que fico do lado dos automobilistas.

E tu?

&gt;  e espero sinceramente que não aprendas que a tua arrogância está errada da pior maneira possível

A minha segurança é a minha prioridade. Simplesmente isso não implica cumprir todas as regras de transito.

Até te digo mais, muitas vezes não cumprir as regras de transito é mais seguro, as coisas são mais complexas do que pensas.

Aliás, quem é incapaz de avaliar situações e apenas sabe cumprir cegamente regras de transito tem mais probabilidades de correr perigo. 

O facto de achares que não cumprir as regras de transito constitui necessariamente um maior risco para a minha segurança é indicador de que não sabes avaliar o que constitui riscos para a segurança. Boa sorte.

Firstly in Europe [Vans](http://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transitcommercial/) or [flat beds](http://www.ibbotsontransport.co.uk/transit-flatbed-and-trailer.php) the open stripped down cousin, similar to a pick up are highly popular over here. I chose the Ford transit in both those two cases as according to the [European Vehicle Market Statistics pocket book](http://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/ICCT_EU-pocketbook_2015.pdf). The Ford Transit Van sold 168,802 vehicles in Europe or 10.9% of the light-commercial
vehicle models market. This is compared to the VW Golf that sold 496,834  at 4.0% the highest selling vehicle for passenger
car models. The stereotypical/ derogatory description of the owner/ user of this class of vehicles in the UK is a [White Van Man the least offensive description I could find was from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_van_man), typically described as tradesman, self employed or running a small business etc. 

As regards the inbuilt power points the idea comes from providing power or charging such as wired or wireless power tools for trades men at off the grid locations, at work say in someones house were they may not be allowed to access a power out let. Or say a mobile sales person trying to sign people up on multiple tablets for utilities or mobile plans. (This bits from a previous post with a bit of editing ) Most power tools are wireless i.e. battery or petrol powered and require, either or both multiple packs or regular recharging/ refilling. Plus it's frankly a hassle removing tools or equipment from the your van or truck at the end of each day and which you have to put back each morning, either risking to charge your batteries the night before or forgetting to bring them, leaving you useless at work all day. 

Well at least [Bosh](https://youtu.be/p8n6HLjD0XU?t=7m9s) thinks so adding both convenience and time saving. Why bother setting up all your charge stations in your home or garage if you can pop them in your work vehicle and charge them both on the go and at home with one easy plug for your Telsa with the switches personalised with names and turned off and on from your Tesla touch screen display or timed turn on and off on your Tesla App. So yea that's the basic concept enjoy.",,Rossi100,t3_4vi02k

He is a world traveler, been to like 130+ countries...anyway, he is in the Caribbean and tells me to meet him anywhere...knowing nothing about the Caribbean, I randomly suggest Jamaica cuz, you know...Bob Marley.

I get to Jamaica with no plans but to backpack around the island (a little naive) and immediately realize it's a 3rd-world country. I've been through Europe and a lot of South America, but honestly was not expecting the amount of poverty and violence found in Jamaica (on the taxi ride in from the airport the radio announcer spent 15 mins recapping everyone who had been murdered the previous day). But I am with my world traveller friend and though it got a little sketchy at times (we partied hard...heh) nothing really awful happened for almost 2 weeks.

So it's our last full day in Kingston before we fly out, and we decide to go to the beach. We get a late start, and our taxi driver is some 16 year-old-kid who is not happy about driving to the beach because it will take hours with the afternoon traffic. So instead, he drops another idea on us (in the thickest Jamaican accent you can imagine) …”Whyyyy don't you go to Marrrr-co, Po-low"" What's that? We ask. ""Only the greaaaatest Jamaican parrrrty all month"" Fuck yes, OK, we're in.

We drive deep into the heart of Kingston, and get to ""Marco Polo"" which turns out to be a giant water event / concert set up in the massive parking lot of the Jamaican national futbol stadium. We get dropped off in the street outside and it’s a really buzzing atmosphere. Lots of people walking around, hanging out, selling jerk chicken cut up and grilled for you on the street, etc. The main gate is closed, but it looks like they had just let 100 or so people in. Thinking we’ll be in next, we line up right in front of the gate behind three young girls probably 14 or 15 years old. We wait and wait and wait, and it turns out they’re doing a really thorough job searching everyone for weapons which actually makes me feel safe, so no problem. But the system is completely disorganized, and it ends up taking over an hour just to search these first 100 people. By this point, you can hear the musicians sound checking inside and you can just feel this excited energy building in the crowd. The space is getting tighter, people are talking more quickly, you could feel everyone’s anticipation. I turn around to check out my surroundings and am stunned by what I see. There are now maybe 1500-2000 people filling the street, just waiting for the gate to open. It’s absolutely packed, and me and my Swedish friend are maybe five or six rows from the entrance.

Finally, two dudes inside the gate with giant dogs walk up and begin to open it. The gate rolls horizontally on sliding wheels and opens maybe a 15 ft section in the fence for people to go through. As soon as the gate began to open, the surge was incredible. Within 3 seconds, I was no longer on my feet walking, I was literally in a human meat train of force pushing through the entrance. Another problem with the set up of the entrance was that once you passed into the gate, you went down a ramp into an open air passageway kinda like driving down a boat ramp that is enclosed on both sides. Immediately, I realized the situation was not ideal, but part of traveling in a 3rd world country is that you go with the flow, because you are always outside of your comfort zone (if you’re doing it right), so I literally just kind of held on for the ride.

And everything was OK until one of the three girls who was in front of me kind of stumbled, and fell down. A few people in front of me, including my Swedish friend, manage to slide right by the girls who were now trying to pick up their friend. But not me. I was right behind them and I ended up getting pushed into the back of this girl, bending over her kind of like I was humping her (sorry, but best description to describe this awkward moment). Immediately, I felt the person behind me crash into my back, and I felt the whole upper half of my body start to bare the weight of the person behind me. Interestingly, the Cambodian incident was fresh in my mind as this happened in 2011, so I knew EXACTLY what was happening. It’s really strange, and I am kind of tearing up when I think about this, but as more and more people started piling up, I remembered what my had dad told me about swimming when I was young. “If you get into trouble, don’t panic. When you panic, you die.”

So I actually stayed remarkably calm, I kept thinking “this isn’t good, but just hold on a second and it will work itself out, don’t panic”…and thats when I got kicked in the face…but not kicked, stepped on, because within a few seconds, I was completely horizontal to the ground, laying on top of the girl who had fell, with a few people on top of my back, and someone else was stepping on MY FACE trying to hop over the pile so they could avoid ending up in the crush as well. This is the moment I knew I was going to die.

I used to play a lot of the Janes air combat simulator games. In those video games, if you made sharp turns in your jet fighter, your character would start getting tunnel vision from the G-Force and it made it hard to see where you were flying. THIS PHENOMENON IS FUCKING REAL. As the crush continued, and I started having trouble breathing…reality through my eyes just started to get farther and farther away. I remember thinking, “well, this is it, you had a good run, you lived a good life, you didn’t fuck anyone over too bad, you’re going to die here, in a 3rd world country, you took some risks, but you weren’t completely reckless, this is just some bad fucking luck.” And that’s about when I passed out.

I woke up, any where from 1 to 3 minutes later. I really don’t know. But somehow, I was now kind of on the side of the pile, gasping for air. I strained my head up, and I could see this ripped young Jamaican kid standing up on the wall of the ramp above me. We locked eyes and I tried to scream real desperately, as hard as I could between gulping breaths “HELP ME” …he hesitated for a moment, I don’t know why, maybe it was the shock of my desperation, but finally he reached his arm down and we locked arms elbow to elbow kinda like Cliffhanger. He must have been really strong, because I think he gave me 3 or 4 good yanks, and I was out of the crush. This kid literally ripped me out of my clothes (I was wearing a tank top and swimsuit). He did not stay with me or treat me after I was out. He probably went back to pull more people out. I just laid on the concrete gasping, trying to catch my breath.

5 or 10 minutes later, my Swedish friend had managed to get back through the crowd and found me. I was totally naked, but after I could breath alright, he found my shorts. He helped me back to the street where we got in a cab and went back to our hostel. I was in shock for a good hour or so after. My friend was actually totally unfazed (classic world traveller who has seen it all). He said it was a near miss, but no one died, and as far as I know everyone ended up being OK because the guards managed to slide the gate close and cut off the crush. But I am totally aware of how it easily could have gone the way of the Cambodia incident. The conditions were perfect for that.

That said, we fucking rallied. About 4 hours later, we went back to Marco Polo (now night time) and it was of the most insane things I have ever done. We were literally the only foreigners in an endless crowd of 10,000 Jamaican kids dancing and going wild. I can best describe Marco Polo as something similar to a big traveling fair in America, except this is mostly just large inflatable water slides, a bucking bull machine, a couple of stages with people playing awful reggae-tone music, and fucking FIRE HOSES that anyone can climb up onto these giant platforms and spray the crowd with.

Yes, so uprooting kurds and replacing them with assyrians will clearly be the solution to this conflict while kurdistan and its hulking army is right next to the new tiny Assyrian state.

In the eyes of ISIS, the whole world is their land.

In the eyes of Zionists, the Naqab and the west bank are their land, for some even sinai is too.

In the eyes of Hitler, much of Europe was his land.

the argument that ""in the eyes of ... it's ...'s land"" is an exact clone of an unjustifiable argument that has been used repeatedly in history, That land technically belongs to Arabs too, since many North Iraqi arabs are actually mixed between arabs and assyrians and the Arabs living there are part indigenous.

If structured as a UBI, there is an increase in both expense and revenue (even if the money that cancels out never actually changes hands, it still gets printed as two items in the national accounts and in your PAYE statement). Th other extra cost is that a UBI would be paid in advance, which adds one period's payments to the deficit (but will claw it back when they die or emigrate). That shouldn't cause a problem for credit ratings, since the debt will almost certainly be paid back, but it would be a problem for countries subject to deficit limits (the EU, mostly).

If the current benefits aren't adequate, then it would cost more but for obvious reasons fixing the current system would also cost more. 

Where things get trickier is that existing welfare systems tend to include reliance on mandated service provision and indirect taxes in kind, which would need to be replaced by direct cash taxes, and on multiple levels of government cooperating either willingly or not.

Olha o tamanho da distorção da falta de imposto sobre a renda

[Brasil é paraíso tributário para super-ricos, diz estudo de centro da ONU](https://nacoesunidas.org/brasil-e-paraiso-tributario-para-super-ricos-diz-estudo-de-centro-da-onu/)

“O resultado é que a alíquota efetiva média paga pelos super-ricos chega a apenas 7%, enquanto a média nos estratos intermediários dos declarantes do imposto de renda chega a 12%”, disseram os autores do artigo, Sérgio Gobetti e Rodrigo Orair, que também são pesquisadores do Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (IPEA).

Essa distorção deve-se, principalmente, a uma peculiaridade da legislação brasileira: a isenção de lucros e dividendos distribuídos pelas empresas a seus sócios e acionistas. Dos 71 mil brasileiros super-ricos, cerca de 50 mil receberam dividendos em 2013 e não pagaram qualquer imposto por eles.

Além disso, esses super-ricos beneficiam-se da baixa tributação sobre ganhos financeiros, que no Brasil varia entre 15% e 20%, enquanto os salários dos trabalhadores estão sujeitos a um imposto progressivo, cuja alíquota máxima de 27,5% atinge níveis muito moderados de renda (acima de 4,7 mil reais, em 2015).

I lost my wife to BC, too. We thought we had it beat, cruising to the five year mark. Then she went for a checkup just before we were to leave for a vacation in Europe. Tests indicated a pulmonary clot so they did a CT scan. It came back negative for the clot, but showed lesions in her liver, and lung.

I knew what this meant. She did not. So we decided to go anyway, since I thought she had a year and that year would be going through chemo again. Right off the bat, her health went rapidly downhill. I wanted to cut everything short and get home but she refused. My wife died mostly peacefully overseas, exactly 30 days after her stage 4 diagnosis. 

It was so fast, so sudden, I never had time to be angry. Just in shock, that 35 years together, then she's gone. Just a deep, dark sadness, sadness for losing her, sadness for not being able to get her home, sadness that she never met her grandchild, born a few months later. Sadness that it should have been me, not her. 

I feel for you, brother...because I replay that memory of her last hour in my head every day. I feel for you for feeling the anger. And I feel for what I see as your sense of abandonment. 

You have a long road ahead of you. And on that road you will find your anger dissipate, then disappear...leaving just the pall of sadness. And you will move forward. You have no choice.

You argue that even if this was the case, it wouldn't matter because since Trump cares so much about himself, he would not let himself do a terrible job. 

I argue that this is far from the truth. Politics is complicated, and it's hard to tell what is right or wrong. People say Obama is the worst President ever while simultaneously, other people argue he is the best. Therefore, public opinion of Trump is not going to prevent him from doing a terrible job. Finally, Trump is already one of the most hated Presidential candidate in recent memory both domestically and internationally. While traveling in Europe this summer, people would often ask me about Trump after finding out I was an American. They would ask me questions like how are Americans so crazy? Are people actually voting for Trump? How did America let Trump happen? etc. My point is that he is hugely unpopular, but he is still running because he is power hungry and will do whatever it takes to be the most powerful man in the world. This goes hand in hand with being a narcissist. Personally, I think he suffers from NPD (Narcissistic personality disorder). 

Also, your argument implies that Trump has the CHOICE to do a good or bad job. In reality, many Presidents fail because they were never qualified to be President in the first place. It's hard for people like you, me, or even Trump to understand the job of the POTUS simply because we are outsiders. So many candidates make these crazy claims about changing the country, because they don't understand just how difficult their promises are. For example, I am willing to bet that even if Trump becomes President, his wall will never be built and he probably knows that too.

Many people get taught that the Romans somehow persecuted the Christians because they were different, when in reality the Greco-Romans were very tolerant of a plethora of different religions and cults, so long as you paid tribute to Caesar (taxation), which these Jews did not want to do.

I've seen this attributed to the fact that Jews, unlike the Romans and most of their neighbors, weren't really into the concept of other gods being on equal footing with theirs. Historically, calling Judaism ""monotheistic"" is a little suspect, but there's always been a strong degree of [henotheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism) in Judaism.

Anyway, back to poverty; desperation tends to lead to bad behavior, and this is extremely true in an era with no social welfare. Being ostracized as a group, due to being foreign and poor, led to many Jews being unable to find work. The notable exception, which you brought up, were certain jobs like banking and also clerical work; the second due to an ancient and strong tradition of educating young boys in how to read and write,which is why Yiddish and Ladino are written in Hebrew script, and the first due to a combination of that and taboos against moneylending for Christians. However, there weren't really enough Jews in this position for it to be a part of what a lower class Christian in Europe would have thought of as a typical Jew. In fact, given that poor people didn't use banks and weren't allowed in noble courts, I doubt it would have been widely known that *any* Jews were in these positions.

A tool that does not even do the same things, this did not benefit users at all and made moving from machine to machine subject to the amount of bandwidth you have.

You don't know why MS deprecated and have made gross assumptions.  I asked for a citation of evidence that this was strictly done in an attempt to sell a service.  You have not provided evidence beyond ""they discontinued it"" while proceeding to throw a tantrum.

&gt;Skydrive needs users, MS killed off easytransfer and told people to use skydrive instead to get all those people to put their stuff up on MS's cloud service.
It's not like I'm throwing out tinfoilhat stuff here, these are glaringly OBVIOUS moves by microsoft. It's already happened. That's just one example, there are plenty more.

You're saying they did it for profit.  Prove it.  Show the sales they got by this an that it was an intentional money making move.

&gt;Enough people disagree that Microsoft is actually **literally forcing** people to use their second and third rate services by preventing them from being able to chose other services.

I'm sorry, how are they ""forcing"" them?  Once again, you have to provide evidence that a competing service was entirely removed?

&gt; There is NO technical reason for it. It was easy to do otherwise before MS decided to ""fix"" it.

Cortana didn't work with anything else beyond it when I first tried it.  I know some people tried to force workarounds to get it to use other browsers and whatnot.  Most didn't work properly and had various stability issues IME, which is what stopped me from using it.

&gt;That is the proof, if edge and bing were superior, people would use them.

It's not proof of anyone being coerced into using something they don't want.  They don't *have* to use Cortana.  Nothing has been restricted in terms of installation or what can be searched.

Choosing to make Cortana a closed ecosystem for MS could have popped up for a few reasons.  Specifically, not wanting to be stuck supporting other software that isn't their own and trying to expand their platform integration.

&gt;The part I think that you have wrong here is that you believe microsoft's ""perspective"" has consideration for the benefit of the users, it does not.

I've said no such thing.  They deprecate them for their own reasons, but if you're going to scream it's for profit you need to *prove* it.

&gt; You DO remember the EU fining Microsoft and forcing them to stop forcing people to use IE? This is the same behaviour.

Except IE was never actually forced to be used.  The EU forced MS to distribute Windows without a browser.  Yes, because I totally want Windows to not be able to even surf the internet upon starting it, total sense right?  Being unable to even download a browser . . .  

Later they were allowed to distribute ""competing"" browsers on installation which is asinine - they should not be forced to distribute another's software which could cause support issues.  It would like being forced to distribute iTunes because Media Player came pre-installed.  Even worse, how about Flash being forced because they allow Silverlight?

&gt;And FYI, Microsoft would love nothing better than to ONLY allow you to install stuff from their market

Yet this still hasn't actually manifested in any way and isn't realistic in the least.  Enterprise and just about every user would walk - that would be the fastest way to make Mac OS and Linux take over the market.

&gt;I guess you don't remember but installing 3rd party apps is something you have to find and tick a checkbox for in win10.

What are you talking about?  I've installed various browsers and haven't had to check a single box?  The only thing I can guess you're desperately grasping at is the control to change the default browser to prevent hijacks.  You can install software like normal.

I haven't dealt with the Windows store or true ""apps"" - the only thing I could guess you're referencing if that's the case is possible side loading . . . which even Android requires you to grant explicit permission to.

&gt;If microsoft could get away with building a walled garden like IOS has, making you buy ALL the software on your machine through them (with a percentage going to them) they would in a heartbeat.

But they realistically can't, and you keep on stretching based on this ""if they could they would!"" attitude that is devoid from current reality.

&gt;I have a question for you, with windows 10 being the LAST version of windows, and it becoming ""OS as a service"" How exactly do you think that they are going to pay for keeping windows 10 up to date and fresh and new for the next couple of decades?

I dunno, I'm not saying its a great city or anything but I definitely end up having a lot of fun for a couple of days without getting bored. Compare that to Indy, where I feel like I've explored the worthwhile parts of the city in maybe 2-3 days. 

That said though, as someone that was born overseas and travels more than the typical Midwesterner though, I feel like its because Midwesterners talk about cities like Indy, Cinccinnatti, St. Louis, and Cleveland like they're LA and New York.

 I went to uni in the Midwest and people would say things like ""you can find anything you want from Asia in Cincinnattti"" when talking about grocery stores or ""we have world-class food in Indy!"" Obviously neither of those things are true, and there's a lot of basic things in SoCal suburban Asian supermarkets that these international destinations in the Midwest don't even really have. As someone completely new to the Midwest that doesn't really have an idea of what its like though, it just ends up as a lot of disappointment. Sort of like spending a few days in a city and thinking, ""That's it?""

To put in context, my hometown is a city of 1.5 million, with a lot of international flair, but is still considered as a ""small city"" by obnoxious Tripadvisor reviewers. The city I grew up in, Taipei had about 6 million people, and we'd frequently go to Tokyo that's 10m+. I also spent some time growing up in Europe where I would regularly visit London, Berlin, Munchen, etc. 

I've met a lot of Midwesterners that had never even left the United States, which is sort of baffling to me given the amazingness that is the US passport, but they talk about the Indianapolis's of the Midwest like a Bavarian talks about Munchen or a Californian about SF/LA. My first year in the Midwest I was more excited to go Cleveland than I was to go Toronto because... well people from Toronto that I knew gave it a kind of a ""meh"" description while Ohians that I knew talked about Cleveland like it was the greatest place on Earth. IMO its more about expectations not being matched rather than these small cities in the Midwest sucking in any way, but those expectations wouldn't really exist without those Midwesterners that are so proud of these of cities that they talk them up like this.",,[deleted],t1_d5yniza

Like you, he was also 100% culturally an American. After the initial talk about his name, his cultural heritage never came up again.

I would think it strange if someone in the US named their baby Clem. But I don't think that your name, Klim, is odd at all. The pronunciation and spelling reflect your heritage. People you meet might initially be surprised, or stumble over it initially, but that's not because they think less of you- it's because they've never seen it before. That said, I vividly remember how hard it is to feel different in high school, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. My best (unsolicited) advice is to be confident and assertive when you explain, and then don't engage in any more discussion about it. Tell them you're as American as they are.

Sharia law is extremely violent compared to traditional western laws. calling for drinkers and gamblers to be whipped... 
Allows husbands to beat there wives even if they fear ""highhandedness"" in their wife. 
Allows for eye for an eye style ""justice""
A thief MUST have a hand or a foot caught off if found.
Homosexuality is to be met with execution
Unmarried fornicators are to be whipped and stone to death especially if they are women.
Anyone who critiques the quran and thus sharia laws are to be met with death... so you can't even argue to have the laws changed once they are in place.
and finally apostates are to be killed if they leave islam. 

So you can see when you have polls of european muslims where 85% of them support sharia law (and world wide polls show 90% or more support sharia law) and want it to enforced by european countries you can see why islam can be considered a VIOLENT religion. 

It is violent because its belief and legal system was structured at a time when there was no law and order... and in 3rd world countries without structure islam and sharia law might actually be better... but in first world countries with legal systems that evolve over time and can be changed do to the wants an needs of the people... we have no need for sharia law... and we have no need for islam.

These were my initial positives.

1. He seemed anti-campaign finance.

2. He seemed, at the very least, apathetic to social issues and mostly was speaking about economics and immigration. He didn't even seem that bad socially in the beginning. I didn't think he was racist, sexist, or homophobic. Just a little rude and nationalist. 

3. While I wasn't pro-""Ban All Muslims"", he did seem to have a point, corroborated by more recent attacks in Western Europe that mass Muslim immigration would prove to be a problem that went beyond a purely economic discussion of immigration.

4. Milo For Press Secretary

While I didn't really like him too much, I thought if the Republicans would win, I would want John Kaisich (who seemed the most reasonable during the debates) and if not him, then Trump. I felt that I couldn't deal with the current establishment and either wanted someone to tear it down, or someone to start killing the social conservative platform of the Republican party so we can move on to things that matter.

However, more recent events have caused me to decide to vote third party in order to show my distaste with the current system.

1. Trump stopped being his own man. He's now under the foot of the Republican Party, just like any other nominated candidate. Maybe he'll break out of it and say ""to bad so sad, you've nominated me, now you're stuck with me."", but I doubt it.

2. Bernie Sanders lost and wasn't nominated to be Hillary's VP. He was the last candidate who could break the current party divide. Now he's supporting Hillary in exchange for some minor policy changes.

3. Mike Pence. Goddamn it Trump. I might have voted for you if you picked Kaisich or someone similar to Kaisich. But instead of trying to sweep up moderates, Ohio, and some of Sander's supporters, you moved to reclaim the religious right

Regardless of my opinion, if I had to put money on it, I would say Trump will win. He made a crappy VP pick, but so did Hillary. Overall, I think the scandals surrounding Hillary will pile up and people won't end up voting for her. Can she really bring the energy and excitement necessary to get her supporters to vote? I don't think ""vote for me because the other guy sucks"" is a very effective strategy.

&gt; If you would read careful enough, you would see that only the first farmers and the Germanic tribes were settlers, all the rest were immigrants. The people the Netherlands needs right now are again immigrants. Nobody has said anything about settlers.

Who do you defined as ""the first""? As I said: Peoples of Netherlands (or whatever that region was called 5000 years ago) were PREDOMINANTLY Germanic in their racial character. That is a fact. Do you dispute that? People who arrived here when it was pretty much empty were not ""immigrants"". What exactly did they ""immigrate"" into?? Wilderness is not a country. 

&gt; The people the Netherlands needs right now are again immigrants. Nobody has said anything about settlers.

Dutch people don't need more alien foreigners squeezing them out of their own homeland.

&gt; You make no sence anymore.

Netherlands is not a ""land of immigrants"". There is no such thing. That's an American invention (false too btw). I really hate seeing Europeans eating up American propaganda whatever it happens to be. That's what I have tried to say there.

Islam in its pure form only following quran is also dangerous to unity. You are discounting 3rd world when many 1st world people made up ISIS. Even more than India the epitome of 3rd world with more muslims than USA UK and europe combined. 

What I ask of you is to stop trying to push the blame on others and revisit the core tenets of your religion. If it says to reject infidels or kill them then its wrong. If you support rebels from palestine and kashmir only because of sharing religion then you are wrong. The true reform comes when internally you have a look at scriptures that promote killing people in name of God to get Civil unity. 

Hopefully you can touch the holy quran and say that it does not promote killing. If you blame Hadiths- please show me the link where muslim groups are giving up on Hadiths. Hopefully you understand why the world fears Islam, and its not our job to tolerate the people who misinterpret the book so easily.

&gt;a set of characteristics inherited from one's parents

you're referring not to *race*, but to *heridity*. Heridity is the scientific result of reproduction; race is an anthropogenic way of dividing heridities. Unfortunately for racists, however, these divisions are *always* on arbitrary grounds, and determined by the culture making the division (in our case, Western European imperialism). There is *no* common conception of race - American, English, Japanese, Nazi, whatever - that accounts for the actual genetics of populations, since internal diversity within these ""races"" is greater than diversity in between races. The Nazi one is a particularly obvious example (and therefore so hilariously wrong) - the difference between the average German Jew and the average non-Jewish German was way smaller than the difference between the two most divergent non-Jewish Germans.

Just as poorly construed is the Anglosphere's definition of ""black"", which refers to West Africans (most African-Americans, often highly mixed), the Khoisan Hadza, and in Australia, Aboriginal Australians. There is practically no genetic material which links these three, and yet they are all considered ""black"". Similarly, Hmong, Uzbeks and Japanese are all considered ""Asian"", but Inuit are not, leaving indigenous Siberians in a bizarre middle ground. Any thorough analysis of racial systems of any culture will reveal contradictions and absurdities like these.

These distinctions are caused, not by actual heridity, but by capitalist society, beginning broadly with the colonization of the Caribbean and South America. These new lands first required a justification for conquest (which began, interestingly, as one of religion rather than race) and second a huge labour supply, which was most easily gained via slavery. Unlike the Slavic and Greek slaves of the Middle East, the slaves of the Spanish and Portuguese came from West Africa and the Congo; and as this system of Spanish planters and African slaves began to take hold, a kind of essentialism set in, and so the idea of race was born.

1.) Yes, the community for Competitive *is* indeed there...........but, that's 3,000 people............out of 60,000 that play daily. And those numbers for those who play it, casually, have dropped to lows of about 36,000. Also, as for the different regions, you do realize that, before Competitive was added, and QuickPlay was removed that there was a system in place to keep him from being matched in places with terrible ping, whereas you could be in a U.S. server in Competitive and be matched in a server in Dubai, right (no joke. There's actually a Reddit post made earlier today about this)?

2.) I feel it's a mixture of both, but, more so based around the latter because, as mentioned before, there are many instances where you could be from the US or EU, and be matched in a different country with terrible ping, meaning it's not **just** an AUS thing.

3.) If you say it will be proven false in time, that's fine.

But hey, let's talk a little more about the Turkey vs. Japan thing:  

* If the Blue Mosque was in Tokyo instead of Istanbul, I bet there wouldn't be trash everywhere.  

* If the Japanese were responsible for the on-base road repair, a quarter mile section of road replacement would've probably been complete in 2-3 days, instead of still being unfinished five months later.  

* I bet that people wouldn't be complaining from time to time about small personal items disappearing from their homes, if the maids they hired to clean their houses were Japanese instead of Turkish.  

* If my car inspection had been handled by a Japanese guy instead of a Turkish one, I bet he wouldn't have gunned it out of the inspection stall right in front of me only to slam on brakes into the parking spot across from the stall, coming within inches of the curb that was high enough to destroy my front bumper had the timing been a little off.

* If the base ISP were Japanese instead of Turkish, I bet that my Airmen wouldn't have gone six and eight months (respectively, this happened to TWO of my guys) without internet, only to finally get it by moving into a dorm room that already had it turned on.

* If the base infrastructure were built by the Japanese instead of the Turks, I bet the power wouldn't take a hit every time someone fucking sneezed.

* If the first local food you ate was Japanese instead of Turkish, I bet you wouldn't spend that first weekend on the toilet.  (After all, who's heard of the ""Tokyo Trots?""  Not me...)

Antoine Marie Izoarde, i.Media: Holy Father, before all I make the congratulations to you and Father Lombardi and also to Fr. Spadaro for the feast of St. Ignatius, if you allow me. The question is a little difficult: Catholics are a bit in shock, and not only in France, after the barbarous assassination of Fr. Jacques Hamel - as you know well - in his church while celebrating the Holy Mass. Four days ago you here told us that all religions want peace. But this holy, 86-year-old priest was clearly killed in the name of Islam. So Holy Father, I have two brief questions: why do you, when you speak of these violent events, always speak of terrorists, but never of Islam, never use the word Islam? And then, aside from prayer and dialogue, which are obviously essential, what concrete initiatives can you advise or suggest in order to counteract Islamic violence? Thank you, Holiness.

Pope Francis: I don’t like to speak of Islamic violence, because every day, when I browse the newspapers, I see violence, here in Italy… this one who has murdered his girlfriend, another who has murdered the mother-in-law… and these are baptized Catholics! There are violent Catholics! If I speak of Islamic violence, I must speak of Catholic violence . . . and no, not all Muslims are violent, not all Catholics are violent. It is like a fruit salad; there’s everything. There are violent persons of this religion… this is true: I believe that in pretty much every religion there is always a small group of fundamentalists. Fundamentalists. We have them. When fundamentalism comes to kill, it can kill with the language -- the Apostle James says this, not me -- and even with a knife, no? I do not believe it is right to identify Islam with violence. This is not right or true. I had a long conversation with the imam, the Grand Imam of the Al-Azhar University, and I know how they think . . . They seek peace, encounter . . . The nuncio to an African country told me that the capital where he is there is a trail of people, always full, at the Jubilee Holy Door. And some approach the confessionals -- Catholics -- others to the benches to pray, but the majority go forward, to pray at the altar of Our Lady... these are Muslims, who want to make the Jubilee. They are brothers, they live… When I was in Central Africa, I went to them, and even the imam came up on the Popemobile… We can coexist well… But there are fundamentalist groups, and even I ask… there is a question… How many young people, how many young people of our Europe, whom we have left empty of ideals, who do not have work… they take drugs, alcohol, or go there to enlist in fundamentalist groups. One can say that the so-called ISIS, but it is an Islamic State which presents itself as violent . . . because when they show us their identity cards, they show us how on the Libyan coast how they slit the Egyptians’ throats or other things… But this is a fundamentalist group which is called ISIS… but you cannot say, I do not believe, that it is true or right that Islam is terrorist",,kmerian,t3_4vjotm

Yes, large costs to set up infrastructure is one of the issues, however europe seems to have had no trouble expanding despite many competing ISPs.

&gt;Even a company the size of Google is expanding their service relatively slowly in that market but that's the reality of the internet service industry.

Google, according to their own CEO, are not trying to become an ISP. they only wanted to make speeds higher in regions they care about and try to push others to raise. Basically what google fiber did is made the monopolies in those areas match the google speeds not to loose customers, whitch is exactly what google wanted to begin with.

If anything, Facebook is the one trying to be ISP, with its internet drones and whatnot.

&gt; If you ask me, if the US government had chosen to invest more money in improving our fiber optics nationwide after that market crash instead of programs like cash for clunkers all those years ago that would have been a great initiative.

Its a bit old but nothing has actually changed. ISPs are literal criminals.

It is [well documented](http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/05/08/1069397111402465.abstract) that as nations develop their cultures move away from the religious aspects or at least take a far more lax approach on them.  Culture is NOT irrelevant when you're talking about religion, because religion is THE essential part of many cultures. It's deeply ironic that you can call me ""plain uninformed"" and make a claim as unsettling as ""culture is irrelevant"" when you're talking about faith; you sound like someone who has never lived outside the first world and is talking out of their ass.

That aside, you nitpicked on my semantics and moved the goalposts. Since when did I say what's happening in the middle east could only happen with Islam? Who exactly is straw-manning who here, you pedant? Are you just going to ignore the fact that your original statement regarding the crusades, which happens to the only thing I'm arguing about, is completely off the mark?

I'm sorry, but you're trying to deflect this into an argument about the fact that I used the word ""culture"". Address the main point or back down.",,YoureWrongUPleb,t1_d5zaadl

Ah yeah sorry for not being too clear, yes the whole package, bombings, boots on the ground, full-scale invasions. Trump knows that boots on the ground is not the best way to solve these conflicts in the Middle East (he was against Iraq war) but he also knows to be realistic: ISIS is a threat to the whole world and frankly air strikes haven't done much in stopping them.

Firstly, I don't buy the premise that the region known as China is unique in its unity for the following reasons: 

1. The foundational assertion of this whole article, that ""the region of the world now known as ""China"" has spent most of the last millennium united under one political regime"" is flat out wrong. What now constitutes modern China has, throughout the last millenium, been composed of several states (e.g., the Tibetan Empire, various Mongolian or Manchurian Khanates, independent kingdoms in Yunnan, etc.) While they may have participated in the imperial tributary system, that is far from being under a singular, unified, or centralized political authority. The only part that has consistently remained unified is Tianxia (""All Under Heaven."") 

2. The assertion that Tianxia has been **uniquely** characterized by unity in the last millennium is also wrong. While it is true that Europe never achieved any regional unity like China did, the Middle East was quite unified (that is to say, sub-regions of the Middle East roughly equivalent in size and political diversity to medieval and early modern China have remained largely unified for most of their history in a similar fashion.)  Yes, ""once it fell, no caliphate has ever matched the glories of the Umayyads"", but that is hardly a useful comparison, seeing as the Umayyad caliphate was much, MUCH larger than pre-modern China ever would be, or hoped to be - to have even unified an area that large at the time, while an astounding achievement, was just not sustainable given the technology. 

  Naturally, it is much easier to unify somewhere small and homogenous than somewhere large and diverse - thus, we would need to account for these differences by considering successful attempts in **analogous contexts**; pre-modern China and the Umayyad Caliphate are not analogous -  the region of 'Persia', however, is roughly equivalent historically to pre-modern China in size and diversity, and also has remained unified for most of its history. Similarly, Egypt, the Levant, and much of Anatolia have virtually always been part of the same political entity since the Roman Empire, albeit with brief periods of division (and these periods still do not suggest that China is unique, as it too had secessionist rebellions and briefly independent states well into the 2nd millennium.)

-------

Secondly, I think that when he says ""imperial unity is not a Chinese invention. The Roman political system was just as dependent on an ideology . . . "" he misunderstands the central distinction between imperial Chinese unity and Roman provincial unity that Goldstone draws attention to - Aegyptus [Egypt], for example, though a province of the Roman Empire, was not seen as a necessary and defining constituent of that political entity. While the idea of Rome persisted far beyond the expiration of the Empire itself, it was more of a cultural than geopolitical legacy - that is to say, while the HRE saw itself as inheriting the legacy of Rome, that did not necessarily entail possessing the lands that once belonged to the Roman state. The idea of a Roman state as necessarily controlling the Mare Nostrum had virtually faded after Justinian. 'Rome' or Roman authority became overly abstract, and the 'Roman' in HRE (which essentially amounted to a confederation of German states) was more of an artefact of bygone pretentions than a true belief that what once constituted the Roman state rightfully belonged to them. When the Emperor of China claims the Mandate of Heaven, however, control Tianxia is a necessary legitimizing element following the Han dynasty. By the Song, the idea of a unified Tianxia gained normative force as the ideal (and, importantly, cosmologically proper) political entity. The Roman state didn't define itself by geography in such a way.  

---- 

Thirdly, I only partly agree with this sentiment:

&gt;The Chinese also continued to dream of unity--but more importantly, they never completely lost their capacity to transform their dreams into reality.

It is as much ""having the resources to fulfill your ambitions"" as ""having realistic ambitions in the first place."" I.e., an important part in understanding why Tianxia remained unified while, say, the Mare Nostrum (entire Mediterranean under Rome) or umma (entire global population of Muslims) did not, is because it was not nearly as unfeasible given the contemporary technology to achieve. The amount of resources needed to govern each is vastly disparate. China, like the states of Europe and the Near East, similarly would not have had the administrative capacity to legitimately control areas of that size. 

Both the Umayyads and the Chinese dreamed of unity, but the Umayyad dream was much more ambitious. As I mentioned above, if we look at norms of unity on a more regional scale, equivalent to that of Tianxia, then the Middle East was quite successful in its attempts and administratively competent. 

&gt;some historians argue we should not describe the feudal structures that followed as ""governments"" at all.

There is a great distinction between having a decentralized government and having no government at all. Yes, during the 9th and 10th centuries Abbasid central power was continually eroded and minor 'states' on the periphery began to assert their autonomy more - however, in the end, they still remained domains of the Abbasid Caliphate. Moreover, their autonomy does not itself indicate much, seeing as most Chinese provinces were similarly highly autonomous. And, anyway, after the 1100s the trend was back towards increased centralization in the Caliphate (though it was stopped abruptly by the Mongols.) 

Even in Europe, where centrifugal forces eroded truly central authority considerably, it is quite hyperbolic to suggest that there were no ""governments"" at all - perhaps there is some truth to the suggestion before the year 1000, but given that we are considering the 2nd millenium, that is irrelevant.

It continues to fiddle the EURO and ECB rates to suit its desired inflation and exports and this is absolutely ravaging Southern Europe, who cannot compete or weigh in on this, to the point of alienating their entire infrastructure and business fabric and disenfranchising their people, absorbing the most qualified which were these countries best hope and also a huge investment they made that is now benefiting Germany.

In short yes, a company can deny you a refund(short of laws, think about the EU and steam), but in the end they can NOT deny you a chargeback(at least not in the US.)

The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU friendly times.**

""Trump"" isn't what's wrong with the American state, in entirety. He is a symptom. The people of america are the ones who elected him. They are the issue. Leaving trump aside, what exactly am I saying? I am stating that societies get the leaders, the politics if you will, that they deserve. The muslim world deserved Assad, Hussein, Khaddaffi and any number of other tinpot despots. We were the ones who put them in power, not anyone else. Sure, they were aided by foreign powers, but that shouldn't have made the difference it did. So what did we do to deserve this?

I'll go point by point below, but to summarise, muslims have turned tribalistic, cruel, ignorant and worse, arrogant. Why do I say this?

I say we are tribalistic and cruel because we are bred to embrace and continue our forefather's hatreds. We, living in the modern world, in what should be a shining age, are insistent on hating so and so group for xyz reason. Doesn't matter who. If they consider themselves muslim, they must be apostates, if they are non-muslim, then they are crusaders/jews who must be wiped out. We have sacrificed so much for these vendettas. Economic empowerment, social ascendancy. We, the people of Saladin, of ibn Khaldun, of Muhammad (SAW) have blindly, like sheep listened to the arguments of the Quraiysh, and said ""our forefathers hated &lt;&gt; and we shall do the same"". Look at every country in the middle east. They are all RIVEN by sectarian divide, when not 200 years ago, Sunni and Shia would live side by side with little to no difficulty. And in our hatred we are cruel. We get upset when they in the west call us uncivillised savages, yet we kill our daughters if they love those we consider ""other"", we beat those who should be our brothers and compete with them for resources, instead of wanting the best for them. In this day and age, you cannot be ""Syrian"". You need to be ""Syrian-Christian/Sunni/Shia/Allawite"" etc etc, same applies to Iraq and so on.

Our ignorance, need I expand on this? I could write books. Islam was the faith that gave us algebra, chemistry and biology. Modern science would be that much poorer if not for the contributions of those muslims who lived 500-600 years ago. Yet now? we have somehow managed to logic ourselves into a circle where we think Science and Faith are somehow separate. Our ""scholars"", if you can call them that tell us to ""fall back on the deen"" and leave the ""dunya"" as if we can all just afford to be quranic scholars, as if a society of quranic scholars will somehow land a man on the moon, or guarantee a safe and happy life for all it's people. We are being told quite literally to let ""allah take the wheel"" in our societies. And in doing so we turn our backs on science, on innovation, on progress, as if they are haraam western innovations designed to weaken islam. Our education systems are failing our children and they too are being indoctrinated to fear technology and learning, to turn their backs on the dunya. This is not what our prophet (PBUH) taught us. Under his rule, and under the rashidun, society was the best it had ever been. People were educated, the economy was working and islam was ascendant. Now? our people are ignorant, they don't know HOW to think because we discourage questioning and critical thinking. So they elect every charlatan strong-man and give him power. We saw this in the middle east and we see this in turkey now, with erdogan. Say what you will about the man, his piety or what good he has done to the economy, but he DID lock up journalists, judges and is doing his level best to be a typical eastern dictator, in western trappings. Yet the people roar for his approval, and they elect him, knowing that they sell their freedoms away. 

And we come to our arrogance. It is THIS arrogance, this misguided belief in our own intelligence/strength/whatever that causes us to say ""only MY islam is the TRUE islam"", or ""Only those who follow MY faith are good human beings"". It is THIS arrogance that turns us away from the problems in our own communities. Wherever we go, people from the middle east find themselves associated with crime. All the Drug Dealers in Israel, Australia, Europe are Arabs, Turks or people from muslim back-grounds. It is THIS arrogance that let's our children grow up to embrace our hatreds. It is this arrogance that let's foreign workers be treated like subhumans in the gulf states. Our arrogance blinds us to our own flaws and we fall further and further behind.

tldr:
Our societies are failing because we are idiots. We need to stop being idiots RIGHT F@#$%$ NOW and embrace our faith in it's entirety. Even the parts that tell us to be merciful to our enemies, even the parts that say there should be no discrimination between humans, even the parts that tell us to seek knowledge, ""even if we have to go as far as china"". Muslims need to be educated, informed and united enough that they can choose their own leaders, and make good decisions. Otherwise we will stumble from one smiling wolf to the other smiling wolf while our nations are devoured by our own stupidity.

Many would compare it to the Christianity or other religions. Technically they are right, Islam is a religion just like any other. The big difference is what does Islam mean to Muslims and what does Christianity mean to Christians. It's a complex issue ranging from ideological and cultural to socio-economic problems.The majority of countries with mostly Muslim population suffer from chronic political, social and economic instability which has long-lasting effects on the culture of the said regions, including their religion. Such instability is like a breeding ground for extremism, which is one of the core reasons why Islam population has such a high rate of extremists. 

This is also why people comparing Sunni and Shiite to Catholics/Protestants/Orthodox are wrong as well, at least in the modern cultural environment. Given how important religion is in their lives, the division of Sunni and Shiite is actually closer to different nationalities in Europe than it is to different denominations of Christianity. 

This is also why after the Arab Spring Islamists started winning the elections. After decades of authoritarian rule when any kind of political opposition was being effectively eliminated (especially liberal), religion is something that none of the rulers could ban without public outrage. Mosques, Muslim culture, Muslims schools. Even before the revolution the Islamists already had a political base, political electorate and an easy political program that any ordinary Muslim understands and familiarizes with. Nobody that has been studying the Middle East was surprised by the outcome. While religion certainly isn't the only factor responsible for the mess in the ME right now, it is a major one. Example, look at Syria or Iraq. Syria = for decades rule of the Shiite minority over Sunni majority with Sunni being treated practically as a second class population, eventually the pressure blew up and the mess of Syria has developed into a sectarian conflict. Iraq = Sunni minority for decades ruling the Shiite majority, with US ousting the Sunni out of government in 2003 and giving it to Shiite without any restrictions, Shiite then unsurprisingly looking for revenge started persecuting the Sunni, many of which later joined extremist groups (most notably ex-military Sunni joining Islamic Stat of Iraq - pre-IS group). 

Last but not least, Islam is a religion with specific characteristics, making it more collectivistic in nature and more likely to seek political power. The problem with power is that it eventually corrupts whatever it is tied to. We learned it the hard way and it took us centuries to establish secularism. Religion is also a very personal matter, people are more likely to argue about it, this kind of subjectivism is dangerous in the position of power. 

Most importantly, reddit fellows, it's not as much about the Islam itself, it's about people. It has always been about people. Economic and political instability in Europe in 1930s brought about the worst kind of nationalism known to man. Yet we didn't ban nationalism, we banned radical nationalism. Don't ban Islam, ban fundamental Islam, like *wahhabis* or *salafists*. There are moderate and liberal currents that try to bring Islam to the modern level, closer even to Western culture. Promote those. I don't say ""ey bring all dem mulims here in Europe"", as of yet we are still too culturally different to live permanently under the same roof and the problem of integration is a huge topic by itself. I'm saying give the guys a chance. Iran, closest thing to a stable theocratic state, has seen major changes in urban economically developed regions, when the modern youth has been slowly rejecting the official strict religious dogmas, doing borderline illegal things as a show of protest. While poorer rural areas remained conservative. Give people the stability they need and they will most likely leave the extremism by themselves. People are people.",,alexinternational,t3_4vjhqq

* Brand new engine. This is the single most essential thing. Fallout 4 is chugging along on a heavily modified Morrowind engine. It's time to let your dying, diseased horse rest, Bethesda.

* As little level scaling as possible, as much emphasis on hand-placed items and monsters as possible. Let us wander into a Daedra hell-murder island at level 5. Let us claim that kick-ass Daedric Dai-Katana at the end at level 5. Reward the knowledgeable, the skilled, and the crazy. Make powerful equipment meaningful again! Only one full set of Daedric Armor in the game, make Daedric Artifacts leagues better than anything I can make for myself-- I want *meaning*. In Skyrim, fighting Alduin at level 10 with Steel Armor was the same damn experience as fighting him at level 60 in full Daedric. That's... not fun.

* Set in a Mer or Beast Race province. Don't care which, at this point. Bring back the alien, fantastical wonderland feeling. Cyrodiil was classic medieval European fantasy, Skyrim was classic Norse mythology. Familiar. Human...

* Don't let us be the ultimate, do-everything champion of every faction. I want to have to pick sides. I want to make enemies the moment I make my allegiances clear. And I'm not talking about Skyrim-Civil-War style. I'm talkin' Tribunal Temple vs. Imperial Cult, Fighters Guild vs. Thieves Guild, Mages Guild vs. House Telvanni. My choices need to have negative consequences even as I am getting positive boons.

* No more essential NPCs. Every entity should be able to die at my hand. No exceptions! The solution to making this happen is to not throw bullshit vampire/dragon/werewolf attacks at cities again. Keep every town nice and safe from bullshit out of my control. And if you must, give the Main Quest a fail-safe route by giving an option to side with a Dremora, who can not be killed and are just ""recycled."" *Fallout: New Vegas* did exactly this and it was brilliant because of it. Could you imagine how insanely cool it would be if I could just walk into Windhelm and kill Ulfric, and end the war right there? I wanted that so badly.

* Overhaul the melee combat. Shoot for something resembling *Chivalry* and *Dark Messiah of Might and Magic*. In fact, Bethesda is all buddy-buddy with the folks who did the latter, so it'd be a dream if they enlisted Arkane for help. They're absolute wizards at first person animations. Also, spears spears spears spears spears spears spears spears

* No radiant quests. I'd rather exhaust a list of well-crafted, tailor-made quests and be left with none to do, than run down a parade of macguffin-fetching quests for eternity. Speaking of quests, I'd really quite like some more that are entirely narrative driven and have little, if any, combat. Oblivion had those by the handful and they were some of the most memorable sequences. \*Glares angrily at Skyrim's Bard's Guild*

* Bring back the RPG mechanics. At the very least, I want to have to give critical thought into how I build my character to function on Expert mode. Also, scrap the horrid Damage Resist defense system used in Morrowind/Oblivion/FO3/Skyrim/FO4 and go with the vastly superior Damage Threshold system from F:NV. Additionally, I would warmly welcome the return of custom spell making and all the old spell effects that were canned.

I´am from Europe Germany and i played Suddenattack NA 2 years + 2 years Suddenattack Latino + 1 year Suddenattack BR. I loved the Game so much. I was kinda addicted of it. Best Shooter on the Market. Sadly it was in Europe not so popular and many didnt even know the Game. I think the reason for that was the Promotion. Other Games like Call of Duty or Battlefield which are pay Titles was joining the most popularity. Which i never understand why cause in my Opinion these Games are cheap commercial casual Shooter. I ve observed the way Suddenattack 2 was going after the release in Korea and was hoping the time we can enjoy it too in America or Europe. I think for the Europe part a release via Steam will get many Players the internal Base aswell. The reason why we wanna play Suddenattack? Well i cant talk for all but here some reasons:

-We are fans of that freaking Game
-The Gameplay , the Hit detection, the Damage Balance, Net Code and all these things are in my opinion not compareable with any other Shooter which is released in America or Europe.

At the moment i ve playing also a Nexon Title and was part of closed Beta Test and Early Access and one week ago the Game released its Open Beta on Steam. Ghost in the Shell Stand alone Complex. Its a pretty nice Game i have to say. The concept is not bad. But let me say the true about the way Nexon Publish it. My oppinion about Nexon as Company isnt as good. I think there are many cases of corruption in that Company and if you ask me they miss Manage a lot of her Games.The Net code and Hit Reg of the Game is the baddest i ve ever saw in any Game. More then 1 year they bring 6 Updates which content was a Joke. 1 New Map was added some Guns and the Problems Player reporting getting more and more. They payment options not working. The Server crashed a lot even with in closed Beta maybe 100 Players or less. Nexon was in my eyes fooling the Community and the Players.
So as i read that Game Hi stop his contract i was happy and sad same time. I think for the Game its best to find another publisher then Nexon. They are incompetent , have a very bad Service and Support and at least many player complaining about the Corruption of Nexon in point of Nexon sells Vip Cheats in the SuddenAttack Game via a site was called Jambohacks. Nexon it self call them the best in free2play. They buy many rights of Game Titles copy them and bring them to a release of their own. So the profit they make is much more for sure. They make her own anti hack shield etc. Nexon is bad ass Noob Company. Fooling a lot of players and even use sexual things like the use of Woman developers to get a crowd on her Streaming in Ghost in the Shell. Use this sexual thing to make little kids horny to reach a higher rate of ppl watching the Stream and making more money. What should i say. Bad Ass Noob company.

at least its sadly about the shut down. Now i or we have to wait much longer for play the Game. Europe Market in Shooter is annouying bad.Also i never understand why they close Suddenattack NA. I see so many other bad Games like Counter Strike Nexon Zombies , Combat Arms which still open and have a horrible cheater base and Noob players which only interessted in Buggs exploits etc. and not have any real Skills. I saw it my self in Ghost in the Shell how many Noobs it play. Reactions so slow. Uncreative gameplay camping all the time even with only 1 Hp they wont come out her cover. Bad Ass players in a Bad Ass Company. Then Nexon even support such Noobs and even not block any Macro software and developers which using Scripts are just the point of the IceHill. Integrated Aimassists which make the Game more Newbie friendly cause they flame all the way that they not able to kill in the Game. The real skilled player cant even react on this random Headshots caused by these aimassists developed by Nexon.

Even being the lowest pop server there's still a lot of people around everywhere, and while it's hard to find raid groups, it's not impossible.

Yesterday when you said that about Malboro, I wanted to check it out, so I went and tried to create a new character there, and for close to an hour the server was locked to new characters, that's how ""dead"" it is. Anyway I got in and saw 50+ people in Limsa's aetheryte alone, and we have the Yo-Kai event running which means most people aren't iddling there.

Of course Gilgamesh will have 4 times that people in Limsa, since it's a overpopulated server, but not everyone likes that.

Now, Malboro may be a bad server for other reasons, and you can recommend against it if you want of course, but calling it a dead server is just wrong.

I am in a dead server in WoW (well, to be fair since the pre patch it's gotten much better, but we all know a few months after Legion it'll be back to being a ghost town). Blizzard merged us with other 3 servers back in MoP, and it's **still** dead. Like, those 50 people I saw in Limsa in Malboro? You don't see that in pretty much the entire server I'm on in WoW.

I'm about to buy a new pair of aggressive skates and I would appreciate some help or guidelines before I decide what to buy. I did some aggressive skating way back when I was younger and had a pair of beginner ones in a junior model. Those pair still fit today actually, but feel uncomfortable over time. I did some basic tricks with it, including ramps and rails, but now I want to improve and take it to the next level.


I have been checking out a couple of different USD skates:
Classic Throne Allstar, Classic Throne Lomax III, VII Clan black and olive. Also, Valo v13 Broskow Cream is an alternative. However, it looks like the USD ones offer a ""better"" design for rail grinds whereas the Valo frames are not as wide. Is this the case or is it not a big deal?


The mentioned USD skates have high cuffs and the Valo's don't. Is it an issue for grinds and flexibility?


An included shock absorber sounds, for me at least, like a big plus. When I read about the different skates, it says that some have shock absorbers and some don't. However, when I read about the liners, I realize that some have it as well but it wasn't presented when I read about them. Is it always the liner that has the shock absorber or can it be implemented in the boot? What are the pros and cons? Naturally, I want to stay away from unnecesary pressure on my knees, but is it really a problem if you don't do big jumps?


Other useful information could be that I'm 26 and want to skate all-around, practice technique, skate a lot in parks and takin' it easy. Also, my foot is kinda slim and my size is US-7/EU-40. Feel free to give tips on other skates or tips in general if you have something in mind.

Then the claim that ISIS have piggybacked the crisis in order to smuggle terrorists into Europe.

You were the one to claim that there was even a significant margin between the Christian body count and the Muslim one. You are therefore the one that should back up his claims, not me. All I stated was that there is no reason to assume that the Christians killed more than the Muslims, given the vast amount of land that the Muslims conquered. We know this from the extent of the Umayyad and Abbassid caliphates.

&gt;I my be grossly misled by my eurocentrism but I thought that the area over which the caliphate spread was far less populated than the territories over which crusades happened.

Oh yes, that's most certainly not the case.

Look [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Umayyad750ADloc.png). This is the first caliphate. All those territories, including the densely populated Levant, fertile Crescent, Persian territories, Egyptian Delta, and Iberian peninsula, were all subdued through war. Bloody war.

And where did the crusaders go to? To Jerusalem, Iberia, and some Baltic states. Now, compare that to the vast empire that was the first caliphate, and you'll see why the caliphate is so much more bloody than the crusades ever were.

Your source isn't truly objective, either. For starters, it says total deaths during the crusades: It doesn't state whether the Muslims massacred those or the Christians. We know the Christians instigated a bloodbath during the first sack of Jerusalem, but it mentions nothing about the aggression against dhimmi-Christians prior to and during the Crusades. It also includes those that died during the journey, either from starvation, or from the desert climate (which was quite a lot, since European knights were not suited against the desert).

What? So you are arguing against freedom of choice? You are arguing because its behaviour psychology that means they have no choice but to be criminals? Absolute horse shit. Yes I have been stopped by police, no they were not polite and I did not feel the need to become a criminal. Yes I have been searched by police, no they were not polite, and I *still* chose not to be a criminal. 

&gt;But I have a friend who was stopped and searched a couple of times a week post 9/11. The only difference I see between myself and him is the colour of our skin.

And that is because you are a racist. I have the same anecdotes that would totally contradict that, except the difference is I don't blame it on race. You have no idea how police conduct business, did your friend look like a suspect? Was your friend acting suspiciously to police? There are multiple factors that you are blind to but because you are a racist all you see is the difference in skin colour. 

&gt;Europe has seen an increase in home grown terrorism. How much of this is down to radicalisation by foreign extremists, and how much because citizens feel oppressed by their own country?

What? What sort of regressive bullshit is this? *I DON'T CARE WHAT CAUSED THEM TO BE TERRORISTS, FUCK. THEM.* You have just deprived them of all ageny, they are responsible for their own actions. They are not oppressed in anyway. Name me one way they are oppressed, not ""feel"" oppressed, but actually *are* oppressed. If someone hurts my feelings I dont *murder innocent people* you lunatic. If you really insist on talking about the ""cause"" well its clear as day the death cult known as Islam. 

&gt;Would an extremist even be able to radicalise someone who felt at home and welcome in their country?

How much competitive devaluation would we need to offset all those effects?

If we *also* leave the EU, then we'll lose access to the single market, and the devaluation of the lira will be offset by tariffs that our former partners will impose on us. We'll have to compete directly with China &amp; co. If you think this will improve the lives of Italians - think again.

One might argue we shouldn't have adopted the euro (I would beg to differ on this). But exiting the euro now will not bring us magically back to the 80s, it won't make us rich producing shoes, low tech appliances, and other labor-intensive products. It's a whole different world today, and our biggest problems are the debt and expensive pensions we accumulated (mostly during the 80s), and the lack of meaningful reforms between 2000 and 2008, when we stopped lowering our debt, didn't reform our economy, and generally our political system wasted time bickering with the judicial system.

Today there is no easy solution if we want to keep Italians as wealthy as they are compared to most of the World.

I agree on the whole but also think you should be as supportive in whatever way your partner needs you to be. If you need to be the light hearted charmer, dropping a joke about not being extended an offer years prior can be fun and humanizing (esp true as you're at a good place in your career at a better paying job). The kind of back and forth where it's okay to talk about potentially uncomfortable things shows confidence IMHO (so long as it doesn't come from a passive aggressive place, which it doesn't sound like it does as you've moved on). Likewise, the connections you make at the event can positively impact your partner's image. If you're memorable, the colleagues may keep you in mind for jobs at the company or other places as opportunities arise. (As an aside, a job offer I received was rescinded in Fall 2008 because the company filed for bankruptcy; I reached out to the hiring manager---who despite inside knowledge of the pending dissolution totally encouraged me to decline other offers in lieu of his firm's--to thank him for considering me. He subsequently reached out to his network and got me a comparable job at a friend's firm. So point: networking pays dividends over time.)

At my SO's events, I play the charming corporate wife/husband. I get excited when finally meeting for the first colleagues I've heard so much about and networking with the other family members. The relationships I've built from corporate mixers as the +1 have been super useful in humanizing my SO before his workers (who, at first blush, are distant and remote engineers from South Asia/East Asia/Eastern Europe) who haven't met a gay couple before. Also, I'm a bit strategic and do a lot of (subtle) intelligence gathering that has helped my SO navigate the workplace at times.

The Eastern Orthodox church held sway over what is now Kiev (the ancient capital of the Russ, now the capital of the Ukraine), and all lands between it, and Constantinople.  In fact, the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by a Byzantine Greek monk named Cyril.  

The double headed eagle was retained by Russia after the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire on Tuesday, May 29, 1453.  Russia sees itself as being a direct descendant of the Roman Empire, in this respect.  As such, those in its sphere of influence often retained the double headed eagle in its regalia, such as Bulgaria.  

The etymology of the word Tsar, is Caesar.  The kings and Queens of the Russ saw themselves as the caretakers of the Roman Empire.  That's why there's always this double headed nature in Russian Civilization to be both Russian, which is decidedly Eastern, as well as European.

There is a reason why if a US person buys a Volvo, it does not come off the manufacturing floor in Sweden but comes from China and the same fundamentals apply to the UK.

As for natural resources, well every Germanic country (England included) is low in natural resources, and yet those are Europe's best economies on every measure. Although we should mention when it comes to exploiting natural resources, DeBeers and AngloAmerican do run most of the worlds gold and diamonds (and have a controlling stake in many other natural resource mining) and both have roots and application in the UK, so you know, there is some natural resources, just not being pulled out of the UK itself, instead they have long term mining rights.",,fuckjeah,t1_d5zgjls

The full story, which is linked from Drudge peals back a few more layers of the onion that is the Clinton money laundering scheme (a.k.a Clinton Foundation).  It seems the US State Department under Clinton encouraged some US tech giants such as Google, Intel and Cisco to invest billions of dollars into the Russian town of Skolkovo which ultimately began producing military technology for the Russian state.  Coincidentally, 17 out of the 28 Russian, American and European 'key partners' in this project have made financial commitments tot he Clinton Foundation totaling tens of millions of dollars, or sponsored some of Bill Clinton's signature high priced speeches.  It seems other notable Russians tied to the project also contributed to the Clinton Foundation.

Meanwhile, the FBI was warning US companies to be weary of Russian companies seeking venture capital investments claiming for many of them their true motives were to gain access to classified or sensitive technologies, and specifically warned about the Skolkovo foundation which Clinton was pushing to US tech companies.

While this article is not a smoking gun, it certainly implies that Clinton was using her power as Secretary of Sate to funnel dollars into the Clinton Foundation.

What's very interesting to me is that the more then half of Mercy's playtime comes from the ESL Atalantic EU open qualifier #3. When you move to the really top tier teams in BTS, Overwatch Open, and Alienware, she basically vanishes. I still think Symmetra overtakes her in a week or so. Her niche appears to be if you have an awesome time on attack on payload/hybrid, and need to stall for 20 seconds with a suicide Res on point A. Basically if your time is good enough that one reasonable team fight and/or stall wins you the game, she fits in.

However, I think teams are having more success with Junkrat/Symm/Zen/Lucio/Rein/McCree, so that's probably going to be the go to. That or maybe they'll try the C9 defense with Tracer on Hollywood. That or just straight up winning a team fight using the standard comp.

On the flip side, Mei &amp; Junkrat are creeping up, and I expect them to crop up more as teams try to emulate C9/EnvyUs, at least for point A defense, but I'm not sure how effective Mei is going to be if you're not Surefour/Tailspin.

Christian Pulisic, you rejoined the team two weeks ago after the Copa America and your vacation. Are accustomed to the German language again?

“I’m slowly getting used to it again. When I returned to Dortmund from the United States, I struggled to find the right words. But it’s getting better from day-to-day, the more I speak.” 

Your cousin Will is in goal of Dortmund’s under 19. How much does it help in everyday life to have a caregiver by your side?

“It is great that Will is now in Dortmund, too. We always got along well, now we’re living together in an apartment in DO-City.”

How was it to play the Copa in your own country?

“It was incredible. My family and friends were in the stadiums and watched me play – an unforgettable experience.”

Can you compare the atmosphere of games in the US and Europe?

“No, it’s different — Which doesn’t mean that it isn’t loud in the States. It depends on the situation. It was a great feeling for me to play in front of so many of my fellow countrymen in the USMT-Shirt.”

You have become a public figure in Germany. How is it in the USA? 

“The fact that I’m still very young caught the attention of many people. I am obviously aware of that. They put their hopes in me, but I also have high expectations. I’m not letting that get to me or get carried away. I think that’s normal when a young player suddenly plays for the national team. I simply want to stay focused and not get distracted”

Which role did US-Coach Jürgen Klinsmann play in your development

“A very big one. Klinsmann is doing a fine job in my opinion. He completely rebuilt the team in recent years.”

Yet he is criticised, because of high expectations. What do you think is possible for the USMT in coming years?

“In america we say: “The Sky is the limit”. We don’t limit ourselves, but want to continue our great development. I think we can achieve a lot, if we continue going down the path of the past months.”

Debut in the Bundesliga, first goal, first international cap, Copa, championship with BVB’s U-19. Can you realise all that?

“No, not really yet. It all happened incredibly quickly. What happened in the last seven months is completely crazy, but it makes me insanely proud.”

You missed the U-19 final due to the Copa America preparations. How hard was that for you?

“It was a tough decision, maybe the toughest so far in my career. Luckily the boys managed to win without me. Everything happened the way I wished for.”

How happy are you with your first six months as a senior professional?

“Overall, I’m very happy with my displays. I had to make great strides. But my team-mates and coaches supported me well and made it easy for me. Everyone had my back In Dortmund as well as in the national team. I  gained a lot of confidence and I feel ready for the next season.”

Did you get any feedback from BVB-manager Tuchel?

“Yes, we talked briefly. He told me that I should carry on from what I did last season. Give my best in every training and in every match. Everything else would come on its own.”

What expectations do you have for your first full year as senior professional?

“I’m excited and thrilled of anticipation. I can hardly wait for the start. I’m convinced that we will have a very strong team once again. I’m looking forward to fight for my place in this team.”

It won’t be easy. The competition in the squad grew.

“That is true. But I’m looking forward to train together with Mario Götze and André Schürrle. I can learn a lot from both, who have experienced many things in their careers. And they are simply very strong players.”

What are your impressions of Emre Mor and Ousmane Dembele?

“They are absolutely fantastic. They are both insanely talented and incredibly fast.”

Is it an advantage for you that the squad is rejuvenated?

“Yes, I find that great. It is normal that young players are looking for the company of other young players. Now we have a lot of them. All the new players make a nice impression. We will get along well quickly.”

Will you act as a role model for the new signings? You already know Tuchel and the Bundesliga.

“I will surely be able to help them – even though I’m younger than Emre or Ousmane. But I can also learn a lot from both in training.”

What was the biggest difference between U-19 and senior football?

“Definitely the pace of play. You don’t have time to think of what to do next in the Bundesliga or in international games. You have to be focused at every moment and make your decisions instinctively.”

Looking back to last season, you hadn’t had much trouble to adapt.

“Yes, it went really well for me. But I can’t rest on my laurels now.”

Did you set any aims for the next season?

“No, not in the sense that I want to rack up a amount of games or be involved in a certain number of goals. The most important thing for me is that the team is successful. While I want to play as many minutes as possible.”

What is your best position?

“I don’t have any preferences. I can play on all offensive positions in midfield – like many other players in our squad.”

Makes that flexibility the team stronger?

“This can be our advantage. We never have to play with the same eleven as in the week before, because of the vast amount of options the coach has. The depth of our team has improved compared to last season. We will be even harder to predict for opponents.”

What can BVB achieve?

“Even though we didn’t win any silverware, we had a great last season. Now integral players left the team, but we still want to continue where we left off – and ideally achieve even more.”",,curiousGambler,t1_d5zhov7

Here you have some NA adult, EU adult, and a squeaker. 

You are actually shit talking seriously because you derive your masculinity from a gear/stat-based interaction. 

You both run around like chickens missing shots and reloading. While shit talking with ""1v1 me bro"".

All that's missing is the Division-patented combat rolling to make it look even more ridiculous.

Except that immigration in Europe has nothing to do with immigration in the U.S.  We are already much stricter with who we let in the country from Islamic countries which is why we don't have the terrorism problems to the level of Europe.  The people who come here illegally by and large do it to find employment as opposed to getting welfare (which they are ineligible for in the U.S.) so that's totally different.

Os pesquisadores não querem outra vida.

Eles morrem por dados

– mal sabem que a vida é um incerto

e implacável jogo de dados...

E eu tanto que desejava que minha

biografia terminasse de súbito

simplesmente assim:

quem sabe se ainda estarei vivo?!)",,o_humanista,t3_4vm8yd

&gt; Elle est antinationaliste, sauf quand il s’agit du nationalisme européen.

Même pas. Les ""pro-européens"" ne sont en général qu'anti-nationaux et cosmopolites, et essaient de vendre une Union ""européenne"" post-nationale, sans identité propre autre que ""la tolérance"", ""la diversité"", ""le multiculturalisme""... D'où la volonté d'y intégrer la Turquie.

L'UE serait infiniment plus populaire si elle affirmait vraiment son identité civilisationnelle commune. Il n'y a qu'à voir le succès du drapeau européen (renvoyant à des siècles de symbolisme et même à une identité religieuse) comparé au désintérêt complet pour la ""Journée de l'Europe"" qui ne commémore qu'une déclaration diplomatique pour la mise en place d'un accord commercial.

&gt; Il faut donc dénoncer clairement cette schizophrénie dans le texte coranique et aider à choisir la partie saine pour permettre de se défaire de la partie corrompue.

Je n'y crois plus. Le Coran est inviolable, intouchable, complet et divin ; et il commande d'obéir également aux hadiths, dont la fiabilité historique est déjà contrôlée pour se prémunir contre ceux qui la discuteraient pour les remettre en question. Bref on ne peut pas retirer le ver de la pomme, il vaut mieux jeter la pomme entière dans la mesure du possible.",,Chepamec,t1_d5zhg9c

Non parce que déjà de base c'est inévitable, la peur du progrès, sans être forcément dénué de sens c'est toujours voué à l'échec: les Luddites avaient en partie raison sur les effets de l'industrie à long terme, mais même avec plus de pouvoir ils n'auraient jamais pu entraver la révolution industrielle.
Les lois de la nature sont implacables, à long terme c'est toujours la solution significativement plus efficace qui survit.

Du coup mon point de vue c'est que plutôt que d'avoir peur du progrès, il vaux mieux essayer d'organiser la société pour minimiser les dégâts et la souffrance que génèrent nécessairement des évolutions technologiques de plus en plus rapides.

Or investors. Investors are key to worthwhile space exploration (and colonization). Mars is a PR/advertising wet dream because we can realistically terraform it with dedicated effort, ESPECIALLY if we develop better manufacturing and space technologies OR better energy production (like fusion, if we ever figure out fusion, terraforming Mars becomes quite easy, cheap energy allows you to create considerable amounts of greenhouse gasses at decent speeds until you get a runaway effect and the caps start melting at an appreciable rate, if we developed fusion and could get it small enough to send a plant on a handful of rockets to Mars, we could have the caps melting fast inside of a century and have an atmospheric pressure friendly to humans and animals, then it is just a matter of introducing the right algae and plant life to start prepping the atmospheric composition for more advanced plants and humans). 

It's easy to sell people on the idea of something not realistic in their lifetime. Many European families purchased land in America centuries before it would turn a profit, because you can buy it and sell it at a profit as it's promise of being usable increases. Then that buyer turns around and sells it, then that buyer sells it until a time at which the land is actually usable or desirable to use.

I remember seeing guys as old as 16-17 who hadn't had their balls drop when we were in a Sauna. I don't know if it's because of Chernobyl or if it's just my races genetic makeup, but puberty hit our school at 12 the earliest, 15-17 latest.

Are you from Ukraine, or some part of Asia?

Or an Asian guy living in UK?

I live in Europe, was born in 86 when this happened so I am curious, since my experiance is nothing like yours.

I hit puberty at 10, had sperm at that age, was fully grown up by late 14, early 15 and so was the case with other guys I knew. Obviously some continue growing after that age, but they were already fully developed.

That's is a nice way for promotion!

2.After the switch to the actual nanite - system, many Squad and Platoonleader leave the game because the tactical fights for the map was ruined.

Bring a new nanite system! AND Serverdomination Event

I have a idea for a new system.


3. Bring a new and more splittet equipment-system for solider.

For example: you equip the extra granade modul yoz must see this in the game.

4. New side weapons for the Galaxy!! Two for the gal but the sunderer have over 10....

5. Hire youtubers for promo in europe; let make new tests in game magazine...

Let's deal with the other things you said in that reply. 

By what metric are you calling the sanctions a failure? Russia's economy has taken a major hit. The Ruble is still at half the value it was before the invasion. 

When you say that the entire world is dealing with them, are you leaving out Western Europe and North America? If you are, that seems like a pretty major oversight. If you aren't, I'd be interested to hear your justification for that.",,Tarantio,t1_d5zhonh

It's been two years and Russia still has Crimea. That was the reason for the santions, therefore they are failing. Look at the Iran sanctions. They forced Iran to negotiate an end to their nuclear program (for now) so they worked 

Western Europe did not severe all ties with Russia. There is still trade going on, just much less than before. We never really had close economic ties with them. They also are politically intertwined with essentially every nation. Russia is a geopolitical power. They are by every measure of the term a Great Power, not s hegemon by any means but they are a more powerful country than any Western European county would be standing on their own.

The EU's human rights are more exception than rule. Consider Article 8, for instance, as an example of relative length:

&gt; 1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

&gt; 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right *except* such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Yeah that pretty much gutted the legal protection, about all that's left is custom, which I'm pretty sure was there in the first place before the EU declared this flimsy wet tissue of a human right. IMO the EU's declaration of human rights arguably *worsens* protections of human rights since it contains so many catch clauses saying basically ""sure you can violate this for any one of half a dozen reasons"".",,LWMR,t1_d5zhhyh

And even if you're right, so what? Those numbers are true for Islam in almost *any* country. (I believe things are somewhat better in the USA, but they're awful anywhere in the EU, and in every Muslim country.)

&gt; No study can be trusted. Not in isolation. Good science revolves around repeatability and sound sampling practices to eliminate sample bias

I'm not talking about just one study, and you know that.

&gt; why weren't there parallel surveys of Christian, Jewish and Atheist attitudes as controls?

I agree they should've published these values. (Apparently they did a control study... but [I can't see the results anywhere](http://www.icmunlimited.com/polls/icm-muslims-survey-for-channel-4/).)

&gt; that's about as helpful as me doing a survey in the Westboro Baptist Church and presenting it as ""evidence of Christian values"".

Don't be ridiculous. A survey of WBC members is not even close to being the equivalent of a large-scale survey of British muslims.

&gt; Without context of the wider population it's hard to say.

That would be an interesting follow-up survey, but it's not the main point. The problem is clearly *enormous*. That's the point.

Sure, it may be that certain sub-groups are better than others, but that's a follow-up question.

&gt; Lets not be complacent in thinking we know what ""British values"" actually look like.

No. It's no longer reasonable to deny that there's a problem here.

Yes, the Brexit polls didn't predict the outcome, but [they were pretty close](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/eu-referendum-2016-poll-results-7699714). A 20% error wouldn't be enough to make things ok here.

&gt; FWD is better than RWD in the snow.

Did you *read* this article? He basically says that it's better in the snow and then attributes it to good snow tires. 


&gt; http://www.autotrader.com/car-news/why-doesnt-rear-wheel-drive-work-in-the-snow-228499
&gt; Same, FWD is better in snow.

The writer isn't well-versed in driving in snow, or never had snow tires.
Under ""weight problem"" he ignores the... uhh... weight. Yes, there's more weight over the drive wheels in FWD, but the second you step on the gas, that's shifting to the rear of the car. Also, try driving up a steep snow-covered hill to get a more concrete example of this. 
With a FWD car being lighter in the back, you fishtail easier - which is what he mentions as a 2nd reason for FWD=better.  ""Fishtailing is possible"" - yes, in any car.  In a RWD, your instinct to get off the gas will often bring it back to track. 
If you don't drive like a madman and you have decent snow tires, you won't fishtail in the first place. 
This is a driver issue, not a car issue. 

Performance and snow ?!  So now it's not RWD that is the problem - it's torque?  This is a driver issue.  The FWD invention was for financial reasons. It's cheaper and easier to lift an engine/transmission package into a car than insert a drive shaft, differential and other goodies. More parts, more cost. Still something that works well for cop cars, race cars and other vehicles. 

&gt; http://m.carsdirect.com/car-buying/front-wheel-drive-vs-rear-wheel-drive
&gt; Same again...?

This link shows some benefits and drawbacks of both.  Note that there's no REASON given for ""poor traction in snow and sand"", but he (well, assuming it's a ""he"" as there's no author listed) lists quite the opposite in the benefits side of the equation.

Here's a biased and amusing article on the benefits of RWD:
http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/gearbox/2003/04/why_frontwheel_drive_sucks.html


Ultimately it is choice. I actually drive a FWD car these days, but I also don't drive in the snow or inclement weather much given where I live. 
Part of my enjoyment of RWD isn't just the physics, but also that as a kid learning to drive, it was all RWD cars (Northern Europe). The driving instruction with the San Francisco Sheriff's Dept. was also all in RWD cars (Crown Vics) for the same reason most cop cars are RWD. Handling, and *predictable* handling at that. 

FWD is used for code enforcement and the like.  The problem with FWD in more ""active"" scenarios is the weight transfer away from the drive wheels when you floor it (excessive wheel spin) and then the massive understeer, which can turn into massive oversteer if you get off the gas mid-turn or just come in too hot. 

In a RWD car you feed in more gas to a controlled oversteer and get off the gas and the car snaps right back on track. 

The key in about any scenario is having good tires.  For 99% of regular drivers, just putting good tires on the car will eliminate any discourse on which is better. Coupled with traction and stability control, it can even be hard to tell the difference between FWD and RWD.

Still, get a BMW, Lexus or Mercedes and part of the superior ride and feel of the car is the balance and physics of the RWD platform. ",,Robdiesel_dot_com,t1_d5zi9f9

&gt;My wife is an EU citizen which may change things, 

Yes, both facts really change a few things. 

The companies tend to know a bit about the ""standard"" visa procedure for skilled English-speaking IT professionals, which usually assumes that the person applying is a citizen of a country priviledged under 41 AufenthV (= USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, Japan, etc). Lots of the information in English that you find online assumes the same. This is different for South Africans.  

You might find the information online that you can apply for a visa after your arrival. Not true for South Africans. You need to contact the German embassy in South Africa beforehand and get the appropriate visa for moving with your spouse from SA to Germany. 

An EU citizen has the same right to live and work in Germany with his/her spouse as a German citizen. As the spouse of an EU citizen you thus have the same rights as the spouse of a German citizen - this includes a full work permit as soon as you both establish residency in Germany. 

&gt;I am not sure if the lack of a job offer would immediately disqualify me from this. 

As the spouse of an EU citizen this does not matter. What is far more important is enough savings in the bank so that you and your spouse (and children?) can live off your savings for a few months until you both have found jobs and proof that you are both legally married - potentially apostilled and overcertified and whatnot (but this is something the embassy should be able to tell you) plus proof that your spouse is an EU citizen.  

The way it usually works is that the embassy gives you a short-term visa that allows you to enter Germany for a long-term stay. Once you are in Germany you need to go to the local foreigners office and get your residency permit from them. ",,maryfamilyresearch,t3_4vl03v

Of course, information on their society is limited, but from what we have I would venture to say their situation was better than that of the average African, European, or Asian in the 18th century or earlier. Pre-industrial pastoralism, which by the way they knew existed long before the British arrived thanks to the Torres Strait Islanders, was much more prone to famine than their system, and the class system that results from a wide division of labor meant that there was artificial scarcity and widespread poverty and starvation in these countries even in times of prosperity. Of course, the division of labor also lead to the development of science, medicine, writing, and many other things that lead to the development of the modern world which, problems aside, obviously has a higher standard of living than pre-modern Afro-Eurasia or pre-colonial Australia. Another thing to point out is the sustainability of their land management system compared to contemporary practises and the fact that many ecologists are coming to the conclusion that elements of this system will have to be adopted worldwide to improve sustainability (there's evidence to suggest this was also a big reason why the aborigines chose this system, as it is known they hunted megafauna to extinction prior to developing it).",,oscar666kta420swag,t1_d5zbp81

We use it as an add on to our trailer. It's a huuuge 5mx3.5m (16x12 foot) And 6 people can easly live in it. It's almost as big as the camper itself. You can even cook on the porch thingy if you manage to re-route the smoke out so you don't burn the fabric.

We're from Europe, but I checked on Amazon.ca and they have it as well.

Now for the CON: When I said it's almost as big as the camper, It's almost half as expensive as well. 380 EURO. Which is about 475 CAD. Bit cheaper on amazon.ca but still pricey.

I'm no historian but [this website](https://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/crusades_timeline.htm) is the basis for most of this summary:

After the year 950, Western Europe experienced both an economic growth and a religious revival.  This gave Western Europeans the *power* to fight a holy war.  At the Council of Clermont in 1095, Pope Urban II spoke of a ""pilgrimage"" with the mission of capturing Jerusalem from the Muslims.  (The Christians would be fighting an offensive war against the Muslims, in order to regain Jerusalem and the religious/political power that came with Jerusalem).  This was just after the Seljuk Turks (Islamic) captured an area of Asia Minor that troubled the Byzantine Emperor.

After almost 200 years of bloodshed and tragedy, which I won't get into, the Christian-held city of Acre fell to the Muslims in 1291, formally marking the end of the Crusader States in the Levant.  Some historians consider this to be the end of the Crusades, while others define the Crusades to have lasted *as long as the fall of the Spanish Armada in 1588*.

The current terrorism that Westerners are frequently victims of is much more advanced than the Crusades of nearly a thousand years ago, but it's still an ongoing war over the same things -- economics, religion, power, and hatred.  However, the tables have turned.  Instead of the Christians fighting on the offensive, it's now the Muslims fighting on the offensive.  These issues have been fought about for *a thousand years*!  They're not going away soon.  To address your comment, yes.  Most religions resort to violence in order to obtain power.  I pointed out Christianity, the media points out Islam.  However, the question remains as to how to deal with this religiously invoked violence.  As /r/iOwnEverything66 said, we can ban them from certain countries (especially with the Syrian immigrant crisis in Europe, this seemed like a good idea).  We can do other things, but in the end it will boil down to one religion suppressing another.

2,False,d5zkzuh,,2,0,t5_2s580,DotA2,False,1473135308,t3_4vkhvf,,0,1470059999,"1) In my opinion it's really good to have at least 2-3 set ideas/executions going into a draft. Have an objective/style you want to accomplish and have a variety of heroes that can fill said role. Always start off with your more open ended picks/heroes that can potentially fill more than 1 role so you can more easily adapt/it'll be harder for the enemy to ban you.

ie: Here's a good example that I saw in t2 eu dota that I thought was super smart. They opened with morph + ET. Followed with sky + drow. Ended with a surprise SF pick (idea that they decided to change morph into a support). They baited a shadow demon ban from the other side(not to mention picked a few anti morph heroes) and had an absolutely vicious combo that can farm, scale, push, and (most importantly) get easy pick offs with the supports alone.

2) I always open a discussing during drafts. At our level, comfort picks &gt; optimal pick a lot of the time, though I try to ask pre game if said members can play the heroes I plan on picking well. I'll never pick a hero that no one in our team can play (though at our level, most people can play most heroes at a decent level so this is rarely a big problem).

3)  I studied a lot of pro dota, mostly tier 2 for lack of t1 games lately, for like 5+ hours the past few days in preparation and created a list of possible executions, good first picks, common bans to X strategy, etc. At this point it's partly intuition, partly preparation, and partly luck. In drafting, there's always some risk as well: predicting what and what won't get banned, what the enemy is likely going for, etc. My advice here is to mostly focus on your plan/execute and avoid straying to counter specific heroes too much unless it matches your plan well (if you have a strong idea of their strat though, having a counter execution is really good).


1 final word of advice. Drafting is fucking hard. I always used to think people were idiots for getting outdrafted super hard but after trying it, it's actually so frustrating w. the time limit and the amount of possibilities. Learn from experience and your failures; if you got outdrafted, take a look at what happened and what you could've done better/avoided.

Do these kits include more plastic parts than other lesser priced MG's or are they simply more treasured collector pieces? While I don't mind paying more than 40$ for simplier Master Grades, kits like Sazabi that cost a little over 100$ on european Amazon (since I live in finland, ordering outside of europe could probably become expensive troublesome due to customs and other things) makes me think twice a bit, since I'm not sure if I could get a building experience and good piece for beautiful custom painting worth of what I'm paying.

I honestly almost bought a Synology with 5 slots around 2013, didn't go through for unrelated reasons but I'm sure I'd have liked it given how everyone and their mother (especially their mother!) seems to love their Synology. So that's what I would recommend for an all-in-one NAS box that just doesn't fail and has tons of features. It's the easy, albeit more expensive way to the solution. Your WD admittedly is just a watered-down version of the concept, it's probably just as good in terms of raw performance (hopefully you saturate Gb ethernet and that's all there is to it as I believe there's only 1 Ethernet port on these machines).

Now, what I would do personally. 

First of all I never throw out old PCs. Currently my NAS is a former workstation of mine (2007 Core2Duo 1.8GHz + 2GB DDR2, I may upgrade that to 8GB for a few bucks), so these old machines are always there for such needs. If you need to buy new, I'd grab something like an i3 CPU + 8GB RAM + $50-100 mobo, smallest PSU you can find (just make sure it's gold), and perhaps importantly Wake on Lan capability. You can also look at some integrated stuff (CPU already on board) like the Avoton series (really great stuff for NAS and appliances in general, it's 4 or 8 cores low power). Alternatively, a Xeon E5-2670 costs like $100 bucks on ebay (2012 8 cores CPU @2.6 GHz, but motherboards are a bit hard and expensive to find, it's either server chipset C-series, or X79 for that CPU).

In live in Europe where WD NAS Red 4TB costs ~150 euros ($170), so if we aim at 24TB that's 900 euros ($1K). The small PC above might cost more like $250-300 so that will probably take you slightly above your current budget --but it's a full fledged machine, it can do so much more. I think the comparison isn't even fair, it's like 10% more budget for 100x more capabilities over its lifespan. Then again if you're not gonna use any of it, that's 10% loss. Use-case always is the deciding factor. I personally like to keep my options open, so I always tend to go x86 PC even if it's slightly more expensive than appliance-style devices. It's saved my ass (and wallet) countless times in the last two decades.

Then I'd put some Linux server on that, setup a btrfs RAID 5 or 6 with snapshots (*snapper* is a really great tool for that and there's a GUI, *btrbk* for backup to other drives). I can give you links to detailed procedures if you want (I just set that up myself this very month). It's a weekend's work if you start from scratch (I had never used Linux before, but I'm quite computer-savvy), but boi does it run flawlessly afterwards.

What's great about btrfs arrays is you can add more disks (or remove some) from an array at any time, it's just a couple lines. Really handy. It just grows with your needs. Metadata is always duplicated by default so latency is really good. Probably best in class currently, spec-wise. (ZFS is better admittedly, especially the self-healing, but it's incredibly intensive and will cost you much more to get the performance on par with a simple btrfs setup).

Alternative: if you want and can manage a Windows Server license, honestly Storage Pools work great too, no complain about that from me (used it with ReFS for 3-4 years, not one single issue). It's just simpler, no complicated config. I just personally prefer open-source solutions to manage my data because I don't want to be dependent on MS's or anyone's whims for such a critical task. No candy crush on my NAS, lol.

The next logical step is to setup all kinds of servers on that machine --plex comes to mind. Maybe add a 2 or 4 port ethernet card and load balance the thing (if ~120MB/s isn't enough of a peak).

So that's how I'd approach this: longest-term plan, vendor agnostic, full control by me --even if it ""costs"" a few hours of learning, trading a little time for such skills is a good deal imho, especially when it's valuable for years, decades.

Just my 2cts. I won't be very available during the next few days, but I can probably find some time to send you links and stuff. Next weekend I should have time to reply if you have questions. Hopefully others can take it from there too!",,ikkei,t1_d5zi6b0

Le Pôle emploi, soit dit en passant, fournit aussi gratuitement des billets de train voire d'avion pour se déplacer aux entretiens, ainsi qu'une carte de chercheur d'emploi qui refile pas mal d'avantages. Ca vaut le coup de se déplacer à un entretien mensuel pour ça :)

*Réponse plus précise, avec explication du pourquoi, tu comment et du ""ça va me donner quoi ? ""*. La dernière partie est la plus intéressante... 

J'ai été dans la même situation côté motivation. J'avais un job mais aucune évolution, bloqué par un tas de trucs (principalement dans ma tête), pas de voie de sortie, à la limite de tout claquer. Et on m'a donc orienté vers un bilan de compétences. En tant que chercheur d'emploi, tu y as droit, et je pense que t'es un candidat idéal pour la chose. Des diplômes et des connaissances, mais aucune motiv', l'impression de taper à côté.... 

&amp;nbsp;

**C'est quoi donc ?** 

Le bilan de compétences, c'est un truc qui va durer quelques semaines/mois (en fonction du nombre de séances dans la semaine), pendant lequel tu vas avoir des entretiens d'environ 2 heures avec un conseiller d'un organisme spécialisé (CNAM, organismes privés spécialisés, y'en a un paquet). Ma conseillère avait une double compétence psy/marché de l'emploi très intéressante, en plus de l'expérience. Ce sont des gens à qui tu peux parler librement, la confidentialité est inscrite dans le contrat, et ils sauront faire la part des choses entre ces moments où tu te défoules et ces moments où tu es plus constructif. Ils noteront, poseront plein de questions, et te feront littéralement revenir à ta scolarité, te feront raconter ce que tu as voulu faire selon la période de ta vie, pourquoi tu l'as fait ou pas, bref, un gros flashback nécessaire à la construction du projet.

&amp;nbsp;

**Comment ?**

Le choix de l'organisme est important, selon ta situation et tes dispos tu pourras peut-être avoir un RV avec plusieurs et en choisir un. Il faut que tu te sentes à l'aise là-bas. Puis une fois l'organisme choisi, tu auras ses RV réguliers, avec un petit peu de boulot en-dehors pas compliqué pour retrouver des éléments de ta vie qui seront utilisés ensuite. 

Au fur et à mesure des questions, le conseiller (ou la conseillère) va dessiner une ""carte"" de tes intérêts, et t'orienter petit à petit vers un ou des domaines qui peuvent t'intéresser. Te sortir des fiches de postes, te parler de métiers qui peuvent t'intéresser, juger de la pertinence et de la possibilité de faire un éventuel parcours depuis là où t'en es aujourd'hui...

&amp;nbsp;

**Et ça va me donner quoi ?**

De la putain de motiv'. Tu as en face de toi une personne qui ne te juge pas, qui regardera ton parcours avec du recul et qui sera assez ouverte pour te proposer aussi bien des choses évidentes que des choses plus surprenantes. Dans mon cas, j'ai eu droit à plusieurs chemins proposés, dont celui assez inattendu de bibliothécaire-documentaliste. Mais à la description du poste, je me suis dit ""bah merde effectivement"". Les choses ont fait que j'ai pris une autre voie, mais ça t'ouvrira potentiellement pas mal de perspectives auxquelles tu n'as pas encore pensé.

&amp;nbsp;

Et maintenant ? Et maintenant je suis en reprise d'études, suite à ce bilan de compétences, pour partir sur une voie qui me permettra de réaliser le grand projet que le bilan de compétences a mis au jour. J'ai bénéficié de dispositions légales qui me permettent de partir un an tout en conservant un salaire. Avant d'en arriver là, j'ai donc fait mon bilan de compétences, candidaté çà quelques offres, rencontré des gens du métier.... tout s'est fait très simplement, sans forcer, naturellement. Et franchement, j'en suis ravi (et j'en fais la pub). ",,Herr_Roro,t3_4vmdk1

&gt;{ /wäg/ (n.) offensive slang. 1925-30, from 'Golliwogg': a 19th century blackface doll; or alternately, an acronym of '(W)orthy (O)riental (G)entleman' }

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;British English:



&gt;1. *racist* a black African or dark-skinned South Asian (usually Indian or Pakistani)



&gt;2. *Anglocentric* a non-Briton or non-Englishman: ""The wogs start at Calais"" (across the English Channel in France) -- British proverb

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;Australian English:



&gt;1. a non-Anglo-Celtic European, esp. from Southern or Eastern Europe (e.g. Greek, Italian, Balkan, Slavic, etc.)



&gt;2. an Asian, esp. a West Asian (e.g. Lebanese, Turkish, Armenian, Iranian, etc.), but now also inclusive of South Asians and Pacific Islanders

_USAGE: Until 1973 Australia had a white-only immigration policy, so the term used mainly as a racial slur in Britain was applied to ethnic European immigrants of the post-WWII ""populate or perish"" era. By now it has greatly lost its sting, and many ethnic Australians have reclaimed it as a jocular term, with some cleverly riffing on it (e.g. '[clog wog](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=clog+wog)' for a Dutchman, 'frog wog' for a Frenchman). Since the 70s, the wog label has been extended to include newer immigrants arriving from the Middle East and other parts of Asia, and many have come to identify strongly with it, facing resistance from more assimilated European wogs who harbor racist and anti-Muslim attitudes. The term is almost completely unknown in the United States and Canada, but in Britain it remains extremely offensive, somewhat akin to '[nigger](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nigger)'._

It's a worse situation for the EU, because we buy tons of crap from them.

I am not in the least bit worried. There is absolutely no way the public will allow freedom of movement, and the EU would be absolutely idiotic (signing their own death warrants) to not do a trade deal with us. (All those German car manufacturers having to pay import duties).

The point now, more than ever, is not whether small biases in aggregate annual revenue projections occur or whether, absent major macro shocks, long-term fiscal sustainability is likely. Instead, the point is whether policy in any sphere generates further big threats to the fiscal. That now includes threats which might come from government policies on the particular forms and timing of Brexit.

Thus, the OBR’s mandate has to be turned on its head. Responsibility for short-term macro and revenue projections should be returned to HMT. Instead, and akin to the US Congressional Budget Office, the OBR should be mandated to provide clear independent technical assessments of big aggregate threats to the fiscal from wherever they may originate and it should provide public technical analysis of policy options on those big risks. It should be restaffed and re-resourced to add real, financial, and international capabilities to its mainly fiscal skill set to do so.

Third, public investment must be strengthened, not just in support of short-term demand but also to offset the many hits to productivity and trend growth post-referendum. The primary means of doing so is to address the shortfalls in planning and pipeline preparation directly, rather than to fascinate over the precise specification of any fiscal rule.

Fourth, in setting overall fiscal policy for this parliament, the mantra “hope for the best and plan for the worst” should be applied in full to the numbers in which fiscal projections are nested, notably concerning assumptions on the form, timing, and consequences of Brexit.

So, for reasons outlined earlier—including preparing the UK macro for the possibility that negotiations with the EU might ultimately produce a non-cooperative outcome—policy should be guided towards securing cyclically-adjusted current surpluses of some 1 per cent of GDP, not as a formal target but as a guiding rule of thumb. This would rule out any suggestion of sizable corporate tax rate cuts.

Fifth, in the wake of Osborne’s copious signalling of an easing of official attitudes towards the financial sector — including the outster of FCA chief Martin Wheatley — confirmation is needed that regulatory defenses against financial sector risks will not be further eased in the face of post-referendum pressure on parts of finance to emigrate. From this perspective, the decision by the Bank of England post-referendum to lower the countercyclical capital buffer for banks but not (yet) to adjust policy rates or QE constitutes, at best, an ambiguous signal about the Bank’s priorities on this which needs to be corrected.

Correction cannot be by means of blustery assurances of regulatory intent or even formal rebuttal of Mr Osborne’s “New Settlement with Finance.” Instead, in the context of monetary action described below and given inadequate global bank capital standards, the Bank of England should immediately commit to raise the systemic risk capital buffers applied to UK banks in line with the recent recommendations of John Vickers, chair of the Independent Commission on Banking. And Vickers should be invited to reconsider the adequacy of his call in light of Leave, which he had not anticipated.

Last, and probably most critical of all, with fiscal support for demand reliant only on automatic stabilizers with little immediate support actually available from public investment (given past poor preparation of the pipeline), and with the current account deficit running at some 7 per cent of GDP, monetary policy must now take the lead in the stabilization of both domestic and external imbalances.

This is not a case of “overburdening” monetary policy. While the depreciation of sterling following Leave and prospective interest rate cuts and QE will help on the domestic and external fronts, options within the current monetary framework are running low. So this is the time to respond to concerns which date back to the early 1990s (Summers and De Long) that central bank inflation targets are too low.

A target of 5 percent for UK inflation should be set for the Bank of England immediately. This would further depreciate sterling, stimulating short-term domestic activity and assisting on the external side.

Thus, rather than follow the current mantra to “look through” the inflation boost from depreciation, the MPC should be mandated immediately to “lock that inflation in”.

In addition to further supporting domestic and external rebalancing, critically, this would help to restore the potency of the interest rate instrument itself. And the urgency of that is underlined by the multiplicity of global and UK-specific threats that lie ahead, all of which underscore the importance of assuring the potency of that instrument within the macro-financial framework.

Post-referendum, in an appropriately humble tone, in the context of a re-mandated OBR, strengthened public investment procedures, fiscal policy broadly oriented to a cyclically-adjusted current surplus of 1 per cent of GDP, and reinforced credibility on financial regulation, a 5 per cent inflation target set immediately is the appropriate form of “forward guidance.”",,BritRedditor1,t3_4vmssg

That's your main problem. What you really need to do is get out more. There are TONS of Christians at most universities; you just have to find them. You're right; the Saturday night frat scene or popular kids' parties may not be the place for you. But if you are willing to dig a little bit and find the less ostentatious social groups, I guarantee there will be something for you. 

For example, at least half of my friends in college were ""godless atheists"" and yet they barely ever drank if at all. I never felt pressured to drink, do drugs, have sex, etc and probably would have become more distant from these people if I were doing those things. Then, in graduate school, I discovered there had been these huge roving hordes of Bible-believin' Christian folk walking around the whole time. 

Your main problem is that Hollywood has sold us a certain vision of university that really doesn't ring true for the most part. The substantial majority of current university students have had 0 to 1 sexual partners in the past year (in the U.S., YMMV). The average drinks consumed per week is probably in the 5-10 range, which means that most college students probably aren't even getting drunk at all in an average week (once again, in the U.S., although I assume it will be similar throughout Europe as well).  More students have been to a Bible study this week than an orgy. More students have prayed this week than done LSD. Tell Hollywood to STFU and go find some real people! I promise you that they are out there if you are just willing to dig a little bit. :)",,stripes361,t3_4vkozw

I think their supercat eyeliner pen is brilliant, and their blushers/highlighters are also really good. 

Basically you need to find a large shopping mall with a huge boots and a huge Superdrug and go to town. I'd say Superdrug tends to be a bit cheaper, but also have more UK-only makeup (eg. the aforementioned Sleek, MUA, Makeup Revolution). Boots tends to have more high end makeup and international brands. Boots no 7 is a good skincare/makeup range (more expensive than typical drugstore but cheaper than high end) - try their foundation and BB cream. 

Bourjois is a good drugstore brand - not sure if that is available in Canada? 

Barry M is a cheap and cheerful brand for fashion colours etc. 
Essie has really cute nail polish shades. 

Lastly, [Kiko Milano](http://www.kikocosmetics.com/en-gb/) is reasonably new to the UK market but well established in western Europe.

The EU has protected the freedoms of nations from the threat posed by their large neighbour in the east, ensuring their rights to grow and to democracy.

Contrary to your view the EU is very capable of reform, and has done so on a number of occasions so as to make it a more democratic institution. In fact it is still looking to do so and represent the people better. The EU has made mistakes, but its policies are generally not harmful or disastrous but tremendously beneficial to its people, far better then our westminster government. Lets not forget the progress made by the EU to ensure health through laws on pollution, safeguarding the environemnt and human rights laws.

The EU has also allowed for cooperation on a scale unseen elsewhere, and has allowed for some of the greatest collaborative projects between nations for the betterment of humanity of all time.

The MLS has been around for 20 year now and is only now ""worthy"" of attention by the Bundesliga?

There is no doubt we have an extraordinary connection and influence with Germany, especially in soccer. We have had a pantheon of German coaches on the USMNT.  Before, there was Dettmar Cramer (USMNT coach in '75-76) who went on the very next year to coach Bayern Munich to two consecutive European Cup Championships to our current US NT coach in Jurgen Klinsmann, an icon in Germany today. But we have had German born coaches at the US National Team level, after Kramer there was Lothar Osiander, who were the LA Galaxy's first coach and was the USMNT coach at the '92 Olympic Games, where, much like what like Klinsmann did with Donovan, left the US's best scorer, Steven Snow off the team in a crucial game and condemning the US Olympic team to exit after the group stage. There are some who believe the clash of social and soccer cultures between the US and Germany lead to these events. 

But our cultures are uniquely combined by conflict. Even the recently released Sigi Schmid, has deep ties to Germany as his father was a captured German POW who settled in the LA area after the war to work in the new aerospace industry. Sigi's upbringing, while American were defined by his German family and heritage.

But something happened this weekend which is truly remarkable. Two German Bundisliga teams, and not just any two teams, The giants, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund were led in scoring by two young Americans, Christian Pulisic and Julian Green, were both the leading scorers on their respective teams. And while both were looking to make or solidify their spots on the roster for the upcoming season, it shows that the contribution to soccer between the two nations is now seeming to be going two ways.

It is because of the World War 2 that these two countries were thrown together, but since then, the US, as a nation, thought that it would be in it's best self-interest. to pick up the pieces of what was left of Germany and do some nation building. This left a legacy of US military support, that, in turn, left thousands of single American men in a nation that had just lost millions of single men. This friendly occupation extended into the cold war, then extended even further, into the Wars in the Middle East that used and expanded the US military structure existing in Europe and especially in Germany. New soldiers, but new German-American families, which embraced the culture of sport especially football were again formed. But now, as was after the war,  the US is an economic powerhouse, along with Germany, and while the US efficiency in it's economy is well known, the GDP of California is larger than Germany's but is done with a population of half that of Germany, making California more efficient than Germany, it's efficiency in turning out world class footballers may just be emerging. And  Germany, which has discovered, like Mexico, who have their own unique connection with the US, that there is a huge pool of gifted athletes, just waiting for an opportunity to excel in this sport, and Germany, sensing it's unique connection with the US, now wants to exploit this connection. And it's something that US football, its players and it's fans, should embrace.

you know damn well no one in China would consider him Chinese... oh, and Chinese people have a ""white"" skin color anyways. Stop obsessing about skin color. Why not hair  color? Not every blond person on this planet is Swedish, but most Swedes are blond. Holy this what a complicated concept!! And that's my god damn point. Everyone on this planet has this ""racial view"" of the world. It's only Germans, French, English, and Swedish (&lt;5% of the planet's population) that have gone completely nuts. It's your view that's in the minority here.

&gt; There is a difference between being Dutch (having a Dutch passport) and being part of Dutch culture. There are people in the Netherlands who are born and raised here and have the Dutch nationality, but are outside of Dutch culture and seen as second rate citizens (Turks, Mocrrocans, etc). 

What the hell is ""Dutch culture""?? Whatever happens to define ""culture"" for you, your parents probably had a different culture in their times. And their grandparents too. What holds it all together? It can't be ""values"" or ""Democracy""... that shit is less than 100 years old.  Dutch/Germanic people are thousands of years old. Under your definition of ""culture"", your grandparents wouldn't be part of this ""Dutch culture"" and thus wouldn't be considered Dutch since Dutch culture = Dutch. You're not making any sense which is why I think you're trolling me.

&gt; EDIT: for a good (but simplified) view on the Germanic migrations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period 

But that map just proves my point... Germanic people were much more widespread in the past. Visigoths, Vandals, and those north of Rome were purely Germanic. Hell, Hitler even tried taking northern portion of Italy because it was so German. This is why your nonsense about ""Roman migrations"" everywhere is so stupid.  
It's three times now where you have failed to show me this proof of Netherlands being ""a land of immigrants"" where Germanics, non-Germanics, and non-Europeans in general have come and go around this geography for thousands of years. Go back 2000 years, and you'll find Germanic people that are indistinguishable from Dutch people today living in that region. It's the same nonsense I get when I argue with English people who try justifying their extinction by talking about ""Roman invasions"" and Vikings or whatever, when the facts show something totally different:

Most countries however are not an option as English, German or Croatian is not the working language. I'm Swedish for example, and a foreigner who doesn't speak Swedish wouldn't really be considered unless they're worth it for the experience. There are exceptions of course, but it's way way harder finding a job if you don't speak the language. 

Then you can always venture outside of Europe to english-speaking places like Australia/NZ, Singapore, Canada and the US. In most places visas shouldn't be an issue. I know in NZ and Australia it's no problem if your job is in the list of ""in demand jobs"". In Singapore there's so many foreigners working too and banking is really big here. There's large numbers of both expats and locally hired foreigners. I'm a civil engineer here in Singapore and it took me 10 weeks to find a job fresh out of university. Met software engineers who got jobs in less than that because the domestic supply does not meet company demand. I'm not sure about the whole banking thing here, other than that it's quite competitive.

My tips are basically figure out what your visa rights are; eligibility, process length and so on. If you're not eligible for it, then it's not worth the hassle. Second you figure out what job sites are used in that country. In Sweden for example Academicwork and Monster are two sites that I've used, in Singapore Jobstreet and Jobsdb are popular sites. Update your LinkedIn-profile and apply on LinkedIn too. A lot of companies advertise on LinkedIn, and it's easy to apply to positions anywhere in the world. Going through company portals are great, but only a small portion of the positions available on the market can be found there so you're limiting yourself a lot. 

Then you start applying and hope you get interviews. If that happens you can see if they're open to phone or Skype interviews as you're applying from overseas. At some point in the process you're going to have to fly to whatever location it is you're applying for jobs in though, but that's a problem you solve at that point. You will most likely be at a disadvantage because you need visa sponsorship, but if people like you are in high demand where you're applying it won't slow you down too much.

More often than not you'll be at a disadvantage because you're a foreigner and you got little experience. On the other hand average people like me have managed to secure jobs abroad with no experience, and I got picked over local candidates each with years of experience as some places will look for a cultural fit more than anything.

It appears that the people of Europe disagree with you. Why not actually go there and see and talk to them before making such statements. Are you aware that since the vote the UK has become the joke of the continent?

&gt; Voice to the highest level is completely untrue... it has taken power from the local level and centralised it so the people's voice is at its weakest.

If you have not bothered to educate yourself in how the EU parliament works, and the power of sovereign governments or the nature of EU elections, I guess there is little helping you now.

&gt; The EU has nothing to do with preventing war in Europe, that was all the Cold War and NATO. Again, NATO has protected the freedoms of nations from Russia.

An alliance that has at times been extremely fragile and could become weaker depending on who wins the US election. The EU means that it is in the interest of every nation to help another and means that all 27 are united. NATO is important, but the EU is key at this point in time. Perhaps if you had spoken to those in the baltics you might have learned something.

&gt;The EU has consistently reformed to centralise more power and take more power from national governments. Depopulating poor countries and subjecting them to a brain drain while increasing unemployment in rich countries and driving down wages.

Firstly free movement has not been a disaster across the continent, and isnt viewed as such. do you really think that you are smarter or have more knowledge than most of Europe? Do you know anything of how free movement benefits every single nation?

&gt; That's the bad king of reform in my book. 

Actually it gives people from all over a voice at the highest level, and with MEPs a member of the public can have their views heard throughout, leading to policies that will suite everyone as best as possible.

&gt;Lots of its policies are disastrous. Look at free movement of people. Depopulating poor countries and subjecting them to a brain drain while increasing unemployment in rich countries and driving down wages.

Actually free movement has meant that businesses of all levels cooperate more with others across the continent and has given people in all nations opportunities. Rather than depopulating and making nations poorer, it has allowed increased economic development and given them a fresh start. Free movement isn't as simple or one sided as you think, and I've known many who have come and later returned, or moved from here to there. You really underestimate how important it is and how much it has done in so many areas and helped so many people. In fact it has helped prevent brain drains by connecting firms an universities around the continent, and giving funding for more research, making these places more attractive.

&gt;The Euro. Devastation of the UK fishing industry.

While the Euro is in trouble, many nations would be much worse off without it. Again, do you have special knowledge that nobody else has? As for the fishing industry all the EU did was prevent overfishing to the extents we were doing. That most companies suffered is due to the incompetent way the government handled the quotas.

&gt;What are these greatest collaborative projects are you talking about? Because a political union isn't required for any projects like a Hadron Collider or the space agency.

Actually it is. Although they predated it, the EU and free movement allows for cooperation and collaboration on a scale never seen before. As a scienctist it has proven invaluable and has allowed for specialised instituted to be created where the best in Europe come to work together on their specific field. Furthermore the centralised structure allows for funding on a larger scale, and provides a base for wider global cooperation. An overwhelming majority of scientists have said time and again that Brexit would be harmful for science, and there are many reasons. Look up the older videos and posts of the Scientists for the EU campaign.

&gt;Not being in political union doesn't mean a divided Europe.

Given that the UK is the only country leaving, no it doesnt. But if there was no union then that is exactly what it means.

&gt; NATO prevents Russian expansionism

An alliance that is not always stable and has had members leave before. Furthermore the US could become completely unreliable. Having the EU as another alliance of all 27 nations is key, just ask the baltic states.

&gt; A European superstate with all power centralised among unelected Eurocrats 

The European commission is accountable to parliament, while parliament is more democratic than ours thanks to their PR system, so votes are not wasted (unlike FPP where 64% can vote against a government, only for it to gain over 50% of the seats and 100% of the power). As for people not voting, well actually that is a UK problem, as in other nations people look at the EU as a good thing and take an interest, rather than scapegoat it and not bother. That really is a UK wide problem only. And the parliament actually has a large say in the laws that are drafted, had you spoken to any MEPs or read what they had to say (Not counting UKIP, who never bothered to show up! Yet have the gall to make audacious lies) then you would know this.

One thing I'd tell you is that while costs for health care, transportation, and education are less your taxes are also extremely high. Again, this is why I said it depends on where you are in your life. If you're a healthy adult aged 25-50ish then you are expected to pay into the system in order to maintain a benefit structure that helps students, the elderly, and people that cannot work. Also, the mentality around salaries is different than it is in the United States. Europeans tend to value equitable outcomes more than the United States which doesn't mean higher salaries for everyone. 

With respect to your friends that became millionaires in Europe I do believe that particular outcome is an outlier. Certainly, my experience is that people are generally happy in Europe with the work they are doing but they are content because they have enough money to take the occasional vacation with their family and no single loss is so catastrophic for them that they fall into desperate poverty. 

All that being said, I truly loved being in Europe and have many friends there. I particularly enjoyed the camaraderie I had with my colleagues and the fact that hard work was recognized there more so than my experience in the United States where it seems to be a given to work 12-16 hours days in certain occupations.

Not just the Autobahn. The vehicle restrictions in Germany are reportedly far more strict than in the US. I often hear speculation that this is because of the Autobahn, but that's not really the point. 

&gt;It is rare to see a dented, smoking junk car in Germany. This is not just due to typical German neatness or pride of ownership. It also has to do with a German institution that is as feared and respected as is perhaps the Internal Revenue Service in the US. The Technische Überwachungsverein or TÜV is an agency that must approve the roadworthiness of German cars and trucks. Without a TÜV (pronounced TOOF) sticker, a vehicle can’t be licensed or driven. Cars have been known to fail TÜV inspection for having a single rust spot or dent in a critical location. A broken light or a malfunctioning exhaust system would be obvious reasons for rejection. A popular bumper sticker seen on older German vehicles likely to run afoul of TÜV reads, “Bis dass der TÜV uns scheidet.” (“Till TÜV us do part.”)…

Do you already own the tent, sleeping bags, and other overnight equipment? What brand/model? Are they 'high-end' that compress well and weigh little?    
     
the main suggestion is always to buy the backpack last. You need to have the rest of your kit in hand to fully understand the size of pack you need. Otherwise you are just guessing - and going too large is better than too small.     
     
---
A few other questions come into play when determining the size of pack you need...   
          
* How is your area for water availability? Are you forced to carry over 3 liters always, or can you most often find water along the route?    
      
* What seasons do you plan to adventure in? Summer trips often allow for less equipment. Once the temps start dropping below 70F - you often need more insulation / clothing / stuff.     
      
* What is the weight of your kit? Size is not the only thing that determines what pack to buy. Some are optimal at carrying &lt;30 lb loads, some &lt;20. That Osprey will be fine up to 50 lbs I'd estimate - so again a good beginner pack (since noobs typically overpack).       
       
* What / how do you plan to eat? No-cook is an option, while other hikers prefer gourmet setups. I personally keep it simple with boiling water in my canister stove + titanium pot - mainly instant foods and pre-packaged dehydrated meals. In winter I'm forced to use white gas and carry a larger pot for melting snow.       
     
* What is the general style of your equipment? Are you investing in high quality fabrics/materials, or shopping for budget items that simply work? Do you prefer luxuries or only take the bare essentials? Do you stick with the motto 'just in case' or okay with risking not having something if your primary item breaks?  It sounds like you already go minimalist - but for overnights with the wife that may change. The 70 liter pack may allow for some experimentation here, until you 2 decide what is optimal for your comfort / adventure.              
       
---   
    
When you say no 'bed pads'... Does that mean you don't own any, or don't plan to ever carry any? I personally always take some form of sleeping pad. They are not only for comfort, but also insulation. I'd recommend checking this out. Therm-a-Rest, Klymit, Sea to Summit, and Big Agnes are some popular brands.    
        
Number of days is not the best way to choose a pack. 1 night and 10 nights require roughly the same equipment. Food is the only variable, and if you pack smart it isn't that big/heavy. Fuel bottles don't shrink, clothes are re-worn, the same shelter is used, kitchen items are washed, etc.   Instead you should focus on your kit for each adventure/season - and use that to choose a pack size.    
       
-----
   
Yes - 70 liters does sound big. Although not far off at 65 liters is my normal starting recommendation for beginner backpackers.    
      
You really want everything inside your pack. Strapping a bunch of stuff like sleeping bag, clothing, water, etc. to the outside of your bag is noob style and generally not smart. This is 1 reason a larger pack is advisable.  
     
Another reason is that you can compress a large pack down to a smaller size. Osprey specifically does well at this with compression straps all around. You can fill it full for the trips with the wife, and then tighten it down for solo or trips that require less gear.    
       
50 liters would be fine too, generally the smallest I suggest for new backpackers. Again - it really just depends on your kit.    
           
I know that this pack is an investment, but possibly consider it a starting point. You could buy the 50 liter pack later, once you optimize/upgrade your kit. I personally have a variety of backpack sizes / types for a variety of adventures. There is no 1 pack that does it all. Worst case is that you have this larger pack for winter trips, or trips where you want extra luxuries (like a 6 pack and chair), or to help a friend carry some of their equipment, or that European vacation, or a dozen other reasons when a large pack comes in handy.

As far as I know, you don't have to give asylum to people coming from a safe country such as Austria or Turkey. Plus, laws can be changed. Laws are made by people and people make mistakes. Circumstances change, so should laws. If the stongest argument is ""the law says so"", it's a sign of a problem.

&gt; Nonetheless, again, someone took risks we would consider unacceptable for soldiers on a war theatre, and you are bitching about how they look distraught??! You need to recalibrate your morals.

Yes, I'm sometimes digusted by their behavior, there are other example besides those I mentioned.

The way I look at it is that we should maximize two objectives: our well being and global well-being. The ratio between these two completely determines the optimal policy.. I think financing asylum centers or whatever would would improve both objectives compared to letting them in. So even for the nicest people who want to maximize global well-being, letting them in is not the optimal policy.

However, I would be against letting them in even if it was the most efficient way to help them. Because I prefer my well-being and would not be ok with taking what seems to be a significant economic and social risk. Another factor is that they're not extremely likeable.

As for morals, it's subjective.

&gt; People that keen to come to Europe could - should - be seen as people who should be welcomed, assimilated, and offered a path to citizenship.

Well, here's the problem, they're hard to assimilate. I would be 100% fine with, say, Australians or Japanese. I would even welcome them. But some random unaducated dudes from a very different and backward culture (on average)? Hell no.

In my experience Asian-Americans dress like anyone else in their age group. My gym in Seattle might even be about 50% Asian bros pumping iron. I'm not sure if they're mostly Asian-American or not though. Let me know, that I've only lived in Seattle for like 3 years - so maybe the culture has changed.

 I haven't hung out with international Asian students since high school/college. But even then, and the foreign-born Asians I see today, they were more stylish than your typical student. Most were quite well-to-do and they'd sport the latest designer brands. I think the FOB stereotype is dated or didn't cross into all socioeconomic circles.

I see way more white dudes that don't make an effort, dress poorly, and could stand a decent $25+ haircut. White dudes that I know have a decent job and could afford the effort. I also think to myself, ""Why aren't you making that effort?"" Maybe they don't feel like they have to, especially if they're straight. Which is cool? I guess? I feel bad for their girlfriends do clearly put in much more time into their appearance.

Yeah, the media perpetuated this white American dream. But fact of the matter is, there's a ton of poor white families. Uneducated white parents. Parents who can't afford much despite working hard. I think disillusionment among white Americans, and the realization that this comfortable 'middle class' lifestyle is likely out of their reach (because it requires incomes in the top 25% of the income ladder), is fueling the anger, discontent, etc. behind Trump, Sanders, etc. All those things you wish you had (maybe minus the Chinese medicine bits) kids growing up in these families wish they had too. 
 
&gt;That was my thinking until it dawned on me that I wanted to be a hot white guy, not an ugly white guy, and that's when I realized that it's not entirely about race.

This is crucial. I'd swap out race for wealth. An attractive, wealthy Asian is on top of the world as much as an attractive, wealthy European/Euro-American. But I'm white so maybe I'm off base there. 

My status didn't bother me growing up when my family had very modest means. But in my 20s dealing with college debt, getting my heart broken, etc. I sometimes think about what life would be like if I was a perfect 10, born independently-wealthy, etc. That's just part of life. 

By the way, I'm not trying to lecture you or anything. I definitely don't want to make it seem like I'm invalidating your experience. You seem like you've got your head screwed on right and it's cool having this conversation with you. Most of the friends I've made in Seattle are white dudes so topics like this don't really come up.

I'd like to see vegans and vegetarians easily survive in Northern Europe for a few years without buying their food. Because that would be like seeing pigs fly. And one more thing.

Good people born here mostly stay here because though the pay is less than in the US, the social benefits (NHS) friends, family, culture are enough to keep them here. It's often enough that a good fraction from outside the UK choose the UK over the US.

Couldn't agree more, it's a great community based ideal but it also has be protected against those who might abuse the system because even America doesn't seem to want to back such a system. Hence why people are very protective of it being taken advantage of when it's kind of a promise to the people of the UK, not the people of Europe.

As those countries improve the brain drain does slow, or even reverse. The pull of family and friends (speaking ones native language) is great. Once you get reverse brain drain, it becomes a positive feedback loop.

Yes but all the while that doesn't improve the lives of people who aren't at the heart of the economy in the UK and that should be addressed and not ignored because you can push them further out the way to make room for others.

Islam as a religion is a cause for many of the recent attacks, that's not refutable.  Really, the Middle East as a whole is a hotbed for unrest, religious conflict, and violence.  It has been this way since before the Crusades, and after World War II the European powers cut the Middle East apart into countries and regions which have perpetually been at war with each other for centuries.  Now, I certainly do not blame the European powers after WWII for this unrest, as it's been around for hundreds of years.  However, the point remains that this area is an unstable area where a disproportionately high amount of terrorists come from.  I think both of us believe that.  

Modern terrorism is fought largely by small terror cells that are nearly impossible to defeat.  This is because if you manage to put down one terrorist cell, the cell in question is seen as a group of martyrs for Islam.  A more productive way of exhausting Muslim extremists is by removing their economic power -- while theoretically possible, corruption and power will end up bringing some money to terrorist cells.  Banning Muslims from entering the country will not stop extremists already in the country, and many Muslims will take that as another reason to fight Western civilization more.  Look at how many illegal immigrants the United States has -- you can't stop them, just as you can't stop all Muslims.  Yes, you can block most of them from entering.  But the few who are in the country are impossible to stop.  It's really easy to create a bomb (as we saw with the Boston Marathon) with household supplies.  A few isolated extremists planting small pressure-cooker bombs in airports, train stations, stadiums, etc. is still religious terror, but it's impossible to stop.  By quashing Al Qaeda, we gave room for ISIS to thrive.  I think both of us agree on what the problem is, just not on how to stop it.",,Fuzzwy,t1_d5zoapv

You keep saying NATO has been disunited but have given no examples. My understanding of NATO is pretty good and the France blip is the only example, and even that only effected France. And the EU is not a military alliance, invading one EU member isn't an invasion of the rest.

Sheer ignorance... great counter.

They are stuck with the Euro. They've abandoned their own currency and it is now no longer possible, in their disastrous economic state to replace their currency.

Turnout for EU elections is low everywhere across the EU. Being a bit less low than the UK really isn't good enough is it?

You seem to be deliberately misrepresenting my point. I was talking about the Commission being faceless Eurocrats.

This time they had switched up my alarm code specifincally to a number I wanted so we chose my birthday, simple and easy. I went in the first day and my finger slipped while putting in the code and alarm went off. It's one of those alarms that you could hear like all outisde the house. The company normally calls to make sure all is well and then calls my other uncle for the password code. The trip they took was all togerther so where was no one to answer the call and give the code. About 15-20 min later a cop pulls up. I was expecting it and waiting on the sofa. I'm a super outgoing person so I didn't think twice and just walked out like it was all good. I was shaken up from the alarm so I went straight into what was going on. The officer that showed up was super good looking so I immedietly turned mushy. He was so sweet and calmed me down after reminding me not to ever just run out like that towards a cop. He said these days you never know, some of the bad apples would have just shot me right there. We talked for awhile and I told him about my buisness and gave him my card. He helped me navigate the alarm and remove the lock that it had put on. He called the company for me and we resolved everything. He gave me his card and told me to call any time while I was staying if the alarm went off again so that he could respond and get there quicker. He didn't write up a fine for the false alarm either.

I was at the end of this path, and I came to a clearing, and there was a lake, very secluded, and there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw, a beautiful woman, bathing herself. but she was crying...
I hesitated, watching, struck by her beauty. And also by how her presence; the delicate curve of her back, the dark sweep of her hair, the graceful length of her limbs, even her tears, added to the majesty of my surroundings. I felt my own tears burning behind my eyes, not in sympathy, but in appreciation of such a perfect moment.
She spied me before I could compose myself. But she didn't cry out. Instead our eyes held and she smiled, enigmatically, fresh tears still spilling down her cheeks. I was frozen. I knew nothing about this woman, and yet, as we stood on opposite sides of a pool of water, thousands of miles from my own home and everyone I had ever known, I felt the most intense connection. Not just to her, but to the earth, the sky, the water between us. And also to the entirety of mankind. As if she symbolized thousands of years of the human condition.
I wanted to go to her, to comfort her, to probe this feeling of belonging I had never encountered before. But I couldn't. Because I knew that if I spoke, if she spoke, that moment would be ruined. And I knew I would need the memory of that moment to carry me through the inevitable dark patches throughout my life.
And so I watched her lower her hand, turn, and slowly walk to the shore opposite me. The rest of her perfect form was gradually revealed to me, and I held my breath as I watched her disappear behind a copse of trees near the water.
I didn't follow her, in fact I turned around. I knew there was nothing else we could experience together that would be more perfect than that moment...and it still remains the most profound experience of my life",,obitrice-kanobi,t3_4vngfv

It doesn't.  The E.U. is pasty white.  Just 6.7% of the E.U's present population migrated to somewhere within the E.U. from *outside* the E.U.  Compare that to the United States, where *significant* parts of our population either *came from* other parts of the world (most notably Central and South America, Hispanics, which Europe is basically *completely devoid of*), or were born into families from other parts of the world.

That matters, and it pushes our politics and culture *away* from the European ""standard"" that you might've once been able to argue we had, and towards some weird hybrid of European and Central/South American cultures.  Long story short, direct comparisons of America with Europe are about as useful as direct comparisons of America with Central and South America.

&gt;Just as importantly, the majority of Americans have a similar culture to Europeans.

""Stephen Hammond: Can I ask you one other direct legal question?  If we triggered Article 50, is there any way we can change our mind and stop the process?

Professor Dougan: The assumption is that it will be possible.  Article 50 is such a bland piece of text.  It outlines a very straightforward scenario.  Like most legal provisions, it does not cover every eventuality.  You have to read various questions into it.  **One of the main questions is: can you undo your notification and remain a member state?  The answer that most lawyers have given—and I know that, for example, the French government legal service has told the French government the same answer—is “yes”, you can withdraw your notification before you leave.**

Raoul Ruparel (**the author of the piece you posted**): Just on that point, it would have to be in the context of willingness from the other parties as well.  You have to have goodwill to withdraw it.  Because it is not clear in Article 50, if there was unanimous agreement to force it on the other side, they potentially could, but the understanding is that if you had, say, a new democratically elected government that changed their position, there is a potential to stop it with the goodwill of the other parties.""

As I said, there is nothing in the treaties to suggest we couldn't withdraw. The ECJ would rule if there is a dispute. It's possibly true if most EU states didn't want us to rejoin that we would not though, even if legally possible to do so. ",,Ewannnn,t1_d5zt6qu

And that is how you feel for completely different reasons as well. Getting called up for civil service always made you anxious and this time is not different. You wonder what the next assignment will be while waiting for a connecting train on Bruxelles Midi. Just a few stops and you would reach the Sortition center learn what assignment Kishi selected for you and then you would temporarily live a different life and do a different job in a different town. Normally, these jobs are low level: Ma had been in a zoning commission in Lüttich, I had been in 2 different juries. Dad had in his youth been in an EUregio commission for harmonizing public transit between Luxembourg and Belgium. Only your brother so far had never been called up for anything, which is why you like to tease him about a 10 year assignment in the EU parliament in his future. It always enrages him as he thinks Kishi, the sortition computer should never even have been built. A sentiment which you cannot understand whatsoever. As you board the train, you remember history classes about instability, that the country had been 550 days without a government once, then 703 days, then more than 1000 days, after which democracy was deemed to have failed and informed sortition replaced it. The computer doing the sortition is Kishi. A supercomputer which ranks first in the global top 100 list. Regularly gets improved and upgraded even though the code supposedly never changes. Deep learning allowing it to become better and better at selecting. You get off the train and follow the signs to the office of sortition, a common destination around here. You follow the line of Belgian and EU flags into the building. You queue but cannot even get into doing anything while waiting as the line today is moving rather fast. Even a short look onto your tablet and a glance over new IMs means that a 5 meter gap appears to the pretty young boy in front of you. You catch yourself wondering whether Kishi imprived the system or someone whom it commissioned to do so, as previously, the whole process took longer. You remember having waited for half an hour already when passing by a corner with toys, when today, it has been barely 5 minutes until you pass it and the associated shrieks, shouts and whines. You authenticate yourself to a clerk with your assignment summon and your European passport. The clerk tells you to go into room 68 for the details of the assignment and points you into the right direction. Your stomach sinks and your breath becomes more shallow. Your steps are short. The door is already open and a harsh-looking walloon invites you in. He again checks your document and your biometric identity (via retina scan and earprint). He then smiles for the first time: ""Someone likes you! A lot!"" He slides the new assignment sheet to you. You turn it around and read. Assignment: Prime minister. Duration: 145y.

""This is a joke?"" you ask suspiciously.

The clerk shakes his head: ""This is directement from Kishi. And no one knows why!""

""Is Kishi okay? Or has it glitched out?"" you ask.

""We re-sanitized the data and used a completely new instance of the code to check it! Same result! I hoped to get a better idea for its reasons when I saw you, but I don't! No offense, but you look average! In the Quetelet sense.""

""None taken! I am special to my cat and my nieces, for everyone else... I am probably a face in a crowd!"" you nod.

""So, yeah, your assignment starts the next 1st. I want to congratulate you on the trust the system puts into you. May it be well-warranted!""

You shake his outstretched hand. 

As you return home, you think about what this means for you. All previous assignments were just temporarily. This one however... At least you know now what assignment is waiting for you so that is off your chest. You open your webbrowser and yandex ""responsibilities of the prime minister of Belgium"". You click on the first link that does not look as if it is spam, paywalled or in French. You sigh. This looks as if it reuired a lot of subtlety and sometimes, you feel like the least subtle person on this side of the equator. The various responsibilities of the job sound difficult to you: coordinating government policies, arbitration between ministries and ministers, arbitration between regions, communities and language groups, being responsible for the execution of the coalition agreement and the representation of the governmening coalition nationally and internationally, that all screams for a better person than you. A bigger person than you. You step out of the train, brace yourself for the bustle of Bruxelles Midi again, and make your way through the crowds to your platform. You feel utterly and totally lost as you take the steps to the platform, realizing that you soon have to live in Brussels dawns on you. As you stare into the void and moving the thoughts of living in Brussels around in your mind, thinking about how many people you are going to inform, how you will have to handling over your job and to whom. Geert? Louis? They are both rather inexperienced and will delay the project significantly. As you wonder about this and so many different things, the phone rings with a hidden number. You answer it as you know uite a few friends who use whatever VoIP service is cheapest this week for telephony. ""Yeah?""

The voice on the other end of the line was speaking English: ""This is Samuel Scornvale for the New York Times. Am I speaking to ... the person who got assigned as Belgian Prime Minister?"" You realize that he probably in that moment of the pause realized that he has no idea how to pronounce your name. This thought makes you smile.

You say your name and add: ""Speaking."" Neither an overt yes nor a no.

""Grand! Could you answer a few questions for me?"" the journalist asked.

You assume this is not a good time to make enemies: ""I can try, but I am right now waiting for a train so the connection is going to be bad."" 

""How does it feel to be Prime Minister-elect?"" he asks.

Several words come into your mind, none of which are suitable for polite company. You state: ""Difficult.""

""I am not sure I understand."" 

You look at your hands for a moment: ""It is a vast task and the entire country is looking at me. All I can try is to fulfill the trust the citizens and Kishi put into me. As someone without any political experience, this will be a monumental task.""

The journalist asks a few questions about your biography and you explain about your degree, your work in software development, your passion for Europop, and your cat Felix, he then changes the topic to something different: ""As a US citizen. Sortition is a very strange concept for me. How do you feel about it and do you see it superior to a democracy in the commonly understood sense?""

You pause a moment. This is a good question, you never really thought about. *Just don't appear thoughtless* you tell yourself: ""Well, we tried the conventional system... and we all know how that turned out."" you try to be as non-committingly as possible.

""You deem the US system as ineffective?"" he asked. 

You try to formulate a coherent thought: ""I think it is a bit... garish, I think is the term. It also had the habit of putting the Flemish against the Walloons and vice versa and the German minority was between all fronts. People were seriously expecting our country to fall apart. With Kishi, that sentiment has, while not gone away, decreased."" A pause, as if the journalist does not accept that. You continue in a flash of inspiration (or a memory of a sociology lesson): ""Politics has gone from the seats of power and sat down at your dining room table.""

There was a moment of silence before she asked: ""So, it sat down on your table and demands you cook dinner for it for more than 100 years?"" he asked pointedly.

You think about something to say. Yes, 145 years being exceptional, but you don't want to appear whiny or ungrateful. then, you realize where you are going, it becomes dark for a fraction of a second before the light turns on: ""Tunnel!"" you shout into the connection as it fails. As you leave the tunnel, you receive a barrage of IMs: friends, family, the boss and that girl who you thought you would spend the rest of your life with before you realized that you and her just didn't fit into the same life. Congratulations, mostly. A cousin, the family fuckup, uses this moment to ask for money, your boss asks you to teach Louis and Geert to take over your project, Mum invites you for dinner, you look at her message last, then, with sinking stomach open it: ""Congratulations on your assignment! If you need someone to show you around Brussels, give me a ring!"" You catch yourself grinning widely at the thought that maybe she was using this to flirt with you again. Then, you remind yourself that nothing must happen, that you were completely incompatible and there would be nothing but struggle if you got into her life again. Just as you are in these thoughts, you reach your stop, get off the train and walk home. ",,TenNinetythree,t3_4vlyc7

Islam, as the sacred texts and traditions, doesn't hide its disdain for the kuffar, nor does its history. Today's Muslims of course do hide the nature of Islam and its historical violence, but only because they can get away with it due to the West's self-hate and self-imposed, effective dhimmitude. This will end soon enough, with Trump in America and with the upcoming right-wing response to Muslim immigration and terrorism in Europe. Anyway, just one of the blatant examples from the old ""true"" Muslims:

&gt;The dhimmi is obliged not to mention Allah or His Apostle…Jews, Christians, and Majians must pay the jizya [poll tax on non-Muslims]…on offering up the jizya, the dhimmi must hang his head while the official takes hold of his beard and hits [the dhimmi] on the protuberant bone beneath his ear [i.e., the mandible]… They are not permitted to ostentatiously display their wine or church bells…their houses may not be higher than the Muslim’s, no matter how low that is. The dhimmi may not ride an elegant horse or mule; he may ride a donkey only if the saddle [-work] is of wood. He may not walk on the good part of the road. They [the dhimmis] have to wear [an identifying] patch [on their clothing], even women, and even in the [public] baths…[dhimmis] must hold their tongue...

— Muhammad al-Ghazali, Al-wajiz fi fiqh al-imam al-shafi'i

Basically, image a life for Jews in a scaled down Nazi Reich, spread over centuries, applied to all non-Muslims (at least those who weren't instantly enslaved, without a chance to ""submit"" as dhimmis, either for not being the ""people of the book"", because the definition was taken literally from the Quran, or just because Muslims wanted slaves or plunder more than a bunch of second-class citizens to leech off of through extortion)... although Islamic civilization still liked pogroms against kafirs within the Islamic states from time to time regardless. 

&gt;Although protected by the contract of dhimma, the dhimmis were never anything but second-class citizens in the Islamic social system, tolerated in large measure because they had special skills such as those of physicians, secretaries, financial experts, etc., or because they fulfilled functions which were necessary but obnoxious to Muslims, such as money-changing, tanning, wine-making, castrating slaves, etc. A Muslim might marry a dhimmi wife but not vice versa, for this would put a believing woman into the power of an unbeliever; for the same reason, a Muslim could own a dhimmi slave but not a dhimmi a Muslim one. The legal testimony of a dhimmi was not admissible in a judicial suit where a Muslim was one of the parties, because it was felt that infidelity, the obstinate failure to recognize the true light of Islam, was proof of defective morality and a consequent incapability of bearing legal witness. In the words of one jurist, ""the word of a dishonest Muslim is more valuable than that of an honest dhimmi."" On the other hand, the deposition of a Muslim against a dhimmi was perfectly valid in law. It was further held by almost all schools of Islamic law (with the exception of the Hanafi one) that the diya or blood money payable on the killing of a dhimmi was only two-thirds or a half of that of a free Muslim.  

&gt;It is surprising that, in the fact of legal and financial disabilities such as these outlined above, and of a relentless social and cultural Muslim pressure, if not of sustained persecution, that the dhimmi communities survived as well as they did in medieval Islam. Under the stigma of worldly subjugation to another faith, inevitably viewed by many as a manifestation of divine displeasure, and cut off from ready access to such centers of spiritual and cultural life as Rome and Constantinople, the standards of ecclesiastical discipline and clerical literacy amongst the Eastern Christian churches inexorably declined. Whenever a dhimmi was in difficulty under the laws of his own community, he could generally escape by a timely conversion to Islam, thereby putting himself outside the reach of his own legal system. In such a fashion, members of the highest clergy, such as bishops or Catholicoi of the Nestorian and Jacobite churches, not infrequently escaped the consequences of serious crimes like simony, unnatural vice and even murder. Hence in several regions of the Islamic world, such as North Africa and Nubia in the west; Circassia, Daghistan and other parts of the northern Caucasus; and Persia and Central Asia in the east, Christianity disappeared completely by the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. The mainly urban, though not exclusively urban, Jewish communities were more tenacious and Judaism survived even in a hostile enrivonment like Yemen, where until the exodus of 1949 a high male literacy rate and a fervent attachment to the practices of rabbinical Judaism preserved the historic community there largely intact.

— C. E. Bosworth, The Concept of Dhimma in Early Islam

The point isn't to hold the Islamic civilization to a higher standard than any other, the point is to recognize that the narratives being spread by apologists and propagandists are a part of that historical continuity of Islamic supremacy which presumes to benefit from the modern world, while not recognizing and honoring its superiority. Islam is an arrogant supremacist ideology that must die as such and at the very least be reformed into a self-conscious, religious identity that modernizes itself thorough a critical approach to its own history and scripture. At the moment, Islam is a modern day contortion of that same old supremacist ideology which now seeks to revise itself eternally to save face and position in modern societies, all the while perpetuating its clearly barbaric nature regardless. Muslims don't dance around Islamic barbarism because they believe it isn't barbaric, but because they think it's the only way for Islam to exist, as the barbaric thing that it is. It's the curse of Islamic dogma, of the Shahada, of the unity of Mohammad's speech and example and Allah's will for mankind. Mohammad was a bad person, but Islam is the true religion of God, therefore Mohammad's immoral behaviour is divinely sanctioned... How does that work? Through lies and propaganda for the non-Muslims, as a test of faith for the Muslims. Muslims are as good and bad as any other peoples in history, it's just that Islam is bad in and of itself, which has consequences for Muslim beliefs and attitudes.

Which there will never be due to rampant automation, we all know it. The alternative would be creating a large number of highly paid government jobs, but the neolibs will never let it happen again after the cold war because ""freemarket"" &amp; ""privatization"" is the only words they know.

And that's the problem : they're pumping money IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET. Not in the population strata. It's money that reach the financial systems, banks and hedge funds and the stock market and some big corpos, and it stays there. CEOs of big companies and funds get richer, but everyone in the general population gets poorer.

Historically it was compensed by cheap housing, free healthcare and welfare (retirement, unemployment, etc) and high wages getting distributed. But all of this stopped or is on the way of stopping nowadays (housing costing millions, privatized for profit healthcare and hospitals costing a damn kidney, wages crashing, sabotage of minimal wage, paid leave abolished in america, dismantlement of even food stamps, schools costing $30'000+ a year,...), all commercial prices rising for profit, etc etc) in western europe and north america.

The pose appeared by the 1750s to indicate leadership in a calm and firm manner. The pose is most often associated with Napoleon I of France due to its use in several portraits made by his artist, Jacques-Louis David, amongst them the 1812 painting Napoleon in His Study. The pose, thought of as being stately, was copied by other portrait painters across Europe and America.

While your procedure is shorter, it is actually a lot more complicated and difficult than one given in Arch beginer's user guide. Your explanation requires advanced knowledge and that is where all the work and complexity is. 

&gt;&gt; Except that EVERY distribution gives you choice to partition your hard drive in case you need to

&gt; Indeed, because it's super useful, but you said a system shouldn't and should just hardcode it.

Yes, for those who need intelligent default, which is 99% of people who are installing Linux on a single computer with a single hard drive. Donkeys can go where cars and jeeps cannot, but to have donkeys only for that reason would be stupid. 

&gt; As I said, if there was such a default, no one would use it in Arch, it's wasted effort.

Antergos linux is basically Arch with automated installer and people use it, so you are clearly wrong. 

&gt; This whole idea that 99% of users don't care about partition layouts is your invention, not mine.

98 % of Users do not even use Linux and they think that partition is a barrier used to divide your living room. You know what, dividing your living room is actually much more important and useful than partitioning your hard drive. 

Out of Linux users, most of those use Mint or Ubuntu and no they do not care about partitions on their hard drives. 

&gt; I quite frankly think most people do. I'm pretty sure that if you ask on /r/linux the majority of people here use a partition layout of their own design.

 r/linux is not representative of Linux users. Like I said Mint and Ubuntu are underrepresented here, and Arch is over-represented when compared to Linux users in general. That is because people here are misguided and I am trying to educate them. 

&gt; Als, most people probably have an SSD + HDD because SSDs are expensive and using them for mass media storage is kind of expensive right now while you definitely want a 120-ish GB SSD to run your main OS from.

Or, you can buy $300 computer from Wall-Mart, install Mint on it, and then spend all the time and money you saved on your kids. 

&gt; And no, it's not 'special', it's what most people here do.

Actually, I am starting to think that most people here are 'special'

&gt; Did you just call /home and /usr/local on a seperate partiion 'blowing yourself'?

&gt; That is like super common to share /homeand /usr/local between different systems and putting it on a separate partition, a lot of systems recommend it because it means you can keep all your data and settings easily when you install a new OS, it's just good foresight to do so.

You just described ""blowing yourself"" pretty accurately. Differences between software in different distributions are minor. You are basically running and reinstalling slightly different versions of the same damn thing. 

&gt; Do you have any idea how common it is to put /home on a separate partition, and then you have to make a judgement call on how large you want that partition to be and all that crap.

Or, you could just use one partition for the whole system and then you would not have to worry about running out of space in one partition while they other one is mostly empty. Migrating and upgrading is not a problem because you are supposed to back up your files anyways, so having /home on a different partition offers you no benefits that a backup does not give you anyways. 

&gt;&gt; According to you, my system performance must be abysmal, right?

&gt; Yes, it's 2016, not having an SSD is pretty unusual.

Nope! I use a 4 year old cheap computer from Wall-Mart. It does everything quickly because this is not 1990s. 

&gt; If you got one you'd see your boot times drop from 20 seconds to 4. You'll see a web browser open in a scond when you start it rather than take 6.

Does 14 second really matter? Think about how much of YOUR TIME you spent to save 14 seconds of COMPUTER'S TIME. You probably spent 40 minutes just looking for the best deal on SSD hard drive. You will recoup that in 171 boots.  

&gt; Get this in your head, an SSD reads files an order of magnitutude faster than an HHD, this isn't a little faster, this is ten times faster. 

Speed of computers compared to speed if people is like speed of people vs. speed of plants. Difference of ten times is not that big when we are talking about small quantities. Ten times faster than 100 ms is 10 ms. You would not notice the difference of 90 ms. So much of the time when you invest human time to speed up computer time you will not recoup your investment. 

This is actually useful to know in real life. Do not, for example, organize your computer files. It is much more efficient to just dump them in one place and then use search feature to find what you want. 

&gt; No, because again, the people whom Arch caters to don't need t 'figure it out', they already know it.

But that knowledge came at a cost of time and effort and you will not recoup that cost. A person who knows how to grow tomatoes is not really much better off then person who just buys them. 

&gt;&gt; You are assuming that you know exactly what you are missing and how to install it

&gt; Indeedilydee I do because Arch as well as the DEbian/Ubuntu netinstall and the Fedora minimal install and Void and Gentoo and Slackware are all geared towards people who do.

That makes no sense. Think about it, if that were true, how would Arch ever get any new users?

&gt;&gt; However, what usually ends up happening is that you end up having to learn how linux does something internally, just to be able to burn CDs.

&gt; No, you don't need to dive into the kernel. In fact, most Arch users probably use the coreutil provided called dd to burn a CD.

You are proving my point. 

&gt; Every serious server admin and anyone who knows their shit ever will use the netinstall.

Not if they have more important things to do. ",,hamobu9,t1_d5yue78

The reasons why it is my opinion (to which I am entitled by the way) that this may be necessary is twofold. Firstly what leaving meant was never specifically established. Secondly the result was very close. This could mean that    the option the government goes for, EEA for example, could be unpopular with more people than EU membership. The reason we are in this position is the first referendum was badly written and now we are in a terrible position of uncertainty. To be honest it is a bit strange to expect people to stop arguing and fighting for what the think is the best course for their country.

There is no real technical problem with making what's known as a Passivhaus (passive or net-zero consumption house), but what you will run into is a lack of expertise in general construction. Retrofitting existing buildings is very hard, because in order to build an effective net-zero house you need:

- A hermetically sealed house with balanced ventilation (i.e. an active, deterministic ventilation system that harvests heat from the exhaust and puts it back into the inlet)
- Good insulation (but nothing particularly groundbreaking, we're taking 0.15 or better k-values on average, so standard-issue triple glazing and insulated double walls are often good enough)
- Low-temperature heating, i.e. floor/wall heating
- Depending on your geology either an underground buffer or direct geothermal heating
- A water/water heat pump to drive the two above points
- A small solar panel array and battery array (a couple kWp/kWh generally suffices)

These houses are already being built in bulk in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands for pretty cheap, however you do really need to build it like this from the beginning. Retrofitting an underground buffer vat in a built-up area with pipes and foundations in the way is no fun and really expensive. Replacing glazing and insulation in an existing, thin-walled house is needlessly expensive. And the ROI of heat pumps and low-temperature heating/cooling is pretty long, so retrofitting that is almost never worth it unless you're heating electrically.

Pure energy harvesting (just brute-forcing it with loads of solar panels and batteries) is a lost cause. You'll be spending ridiculous amounts on a grossly overdimensioned solar+battery system and have none of the comfort and cost benefits of a net-zero house.

You're pretty thick. The mplication was that if the EU negatively affected trade relations between Ireland and the UK then it would likely result with Ireland leaving the EU. Because they are reliant on the trade we share with them. *Heavily*.

Seriously though. This is the exact same bullshit as the European immigrant crisis. We're told everything is fine, there's no issues that can cause us to have such a pessimistic view.

We should all be happy and accepting, because everything that Planetside 2 has gained has been perfect the past 2 years. DBG leadership has been so much better than SOE's. We got a construction system, which we all asked for, just like the implant system. It as enriched the game in manner we could never imagine! /s

Fucking bullshit. People can't differentiate between technical accomplishment and functional improvements. Is the construction system in Planetside 2 something amazing? Yes. It fucking is. No other game can pull this shit off on this scale, this dynamically.

Is it functional within Planetside 2? Fuck no. They had to cannibalize alerts, tacked on an anti-climatic generator to make the construction system have any strategic value. Then they added spawnroom level shields to the structures with the correct modules, made those invulnerable, and are planning to add a lot more fortifications.

All this is crammed into a continent where the bases -already- were in sight of each other, few not having direct line of sight to other bases. This is crammed onto an aspect of the game that most are already ignoring.

They added another phase one, and people are too blind to accept it. The construction system needs better integration before we get more toys. Hell, it can fucking fix Esamir on its own. Remove all the terminals, walls and turrets from Esamir, and just keep the points and standard buildings.. Let -us- build the fortifications, the terminals and such! A spawn room, point and some decoration for the standard bases.. The rest would be ours.. Sure it can, and will be abused. But we can directly circumvent it. Emergent gameplay would rise on Esamir again.

Instead, we get a shit Indar revamp that tackles individual bases, without touching the terrain around it. Where it's usually the terrain around a base making it horrible.

Do you say that as in everything being rigged or do you mean that as in you are only one of many and you can only do so much? 

As long as you're not the ""it's a conspiracy man"" kind of person there's a good example on why voting is important. When the Brits voted for the Brexit the overwhelming majority of young people voted to remain but in fewer number (a low percentage of eligible voters choose to actually vote) while the older people voted to leave. As voters of young age had a lot to lose when leaving the EU this would have been a much more important issue for them than for anyone older. However as they did not vote they were completely unrepresented and the old people fucked it all up. 

You have to vote so that all the fucking old people with their pensions and ""I don't give a fuck""-attitude don't fuck up your country!

It is only western Europe and its offshoots which have been fed this lie of ""diversity"" (always meaning fewer white people). It is only western Europe and its offshoots which actually *celebrate* becoming minorities in their own nations. And the brain virus has eaten so far that people like you think ""everyone does it."" No one does it. Nowhere in the world is a majority population allowing itself to be made into a powerless minority population, save for western civilization. Can you imagine the Japanese being told Japan will no longer be Japanese, and celebrating? Tell the Jews that Israel will no longer be a Jewish state and see them laughing and smiling? It shows a total misunderstanding of human nature. It's madness. 

For all of human history conquest was the only universal value. You took what you were strong enough to take, and held what you were strong enough to hold. What we're seeing in western civilization: a people simply handing away their inheritance to avoid verbal abuse from those who hate them, is without precedent in history. And without precedent for a reason. ",,BaronVonButternickle,t1_d5zlk4k

To speak of the consequences, mass homelessness, rioting and civil unrest aren't free either. Quite the opposite actually. 

The only good thing is, this year has been a bit quieter on the refugee-front, because European countries have mostly gotten their plans straight, and have imposed better border controls, especially in the Mediterranean, better immigration systems, more training and housing for migrants and have tried to curb the problem at the source by supporting the *enourmous* refugee camps in the middle-east, mostly Turkey.

I'm a Swede so I did not vote for the Brexit however there's a lot of good things about the EU. The EU is meant to work as a sort of open market, easing trade between the countries and creating trade arrangements with countries outside the EU. The EU is pretty big on bureaucracy and they've created a lot of different standards, everything from pillows to agriculture and medicine. This has it's pro and cons of course and some may say it's stifling while others believe it creates quality and efficiency. The EU also makes it possible to move to and work in any EU country for any EU citizen, this is great for especially young people. The EU however does not come free and it did cost the UK, not as much as the leave-propaganda would tell you, some amount of money.

To me the UK leaving made Europe weaker in a time when we should be getting stronger (economically of course). The UK will have to remake all of it's trade-agreements and before that's done we won't truly know what they lost but for the rest of the EU I hope they are made an example which makes us grow stronger together.

As for how the values of old and young people I'd like to simply state that even if older people are more experienced they are simply people. Even if humans all would become ""better"" with age we have to act in our interest because if we want to change the world for the better we have to make it so. The older generations have only gotten us this far and there's a lot left fixing.

Sure a lot of people say that's just youthful ignorance but every generation has been youthfully ignorant and most of them tried to change things for the better. I don't believe society would have gotten anywhere if young people didn't care and didn't try new ideas.",,FudgeThisCheese,t1_d5zztgf

With a ton of logging and other apps, it looked like the cell signal would stall any time there was a hand-off between T-Mobile and Sprint. Having to toggle Airplane Mode every 5 minutes wasn't an ideal solution. 

* Fi's support is amazing (it really, *really* is amazing), especially since you can chat with a specialist within 1-2 minutes max, or jump on a call with a knowledgeable person in the same amount of time. None of the long AT&amp;T holds, marketing BS, etc. That said, there were a number of issues that I had with service that they weren't able to comment on or solve. I let this slide, though, since Fi was (and still is?) a beta service. 

* Fi refuses to play nice with Google Voice. I completely understand the reasoning behind the fact that you can't combine Voice numbers and have it forward to a Fi number, but I have two work lines that are through GV. This was somewhat of a deal breaker for me. 

________________

Even with its shortcomings, Fi is still great and I still retain my service (albeit on ""Pause""). I used Fi during my vacation in Europe and paid only $47 in data and call fees for the entire month. That is a beautiful number, especially when you look at your AT&amp;T bill for a family member and gasp when you see a number 10 times bigger.

[To borrow from a wall of text I previously wrote...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/4m4ewz/wall_of_texti_got_my_grandfathers_notes_that/d3t4fha)

When tracing ancestries, when you start getting to 10th Century Royalty, while not outside the realm of possibility that you have an actual, verifiable trail of records, since those do exist for some people, it is the records themselves that are notable, not the actual nature of descent.  Once you are getting to 20 or 30 or 40 generations back, the pedigree collapse is *incredibly huge* and the number of *theoretical* ancestors you possess far exceeds the population of the planet at the time (2^30 = 1,073,741,824, 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776). This is obviously impossible, and is an easy way to illustrate that in fact, we are talking about the common ancestors of pretty much every human being of European descent. [It is also demonstrated by studies of genetic ancestry](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555) which backs up our napkin-back math ""[finding] that even geographically distant Europeans share ubiquitous common ancestry within the past 1,000 years"". The ""go-to"" figure for ""*Everyone is descended from him*"" is Charlemagne since not only is his name known, but he also had a number of children, and we can track their movements, and those of *their* children, around Europe, but it similarly holds true for other figures who lived many hundreds of years ago, and it is a safe assumption that most European royalty of the period could be advanced for a similar claim, as long as they did have progeny. 

Now, that all being said, just because our common European descent (Hi 35th cousin!) means that we *all* are related to the notable figures who lived 1,000 years ago doesn't mean that we all know *how we do*, and for me, that is the legitimately cool thing about genealogy, finding those paths. A family tree, once you start going back enough generations (or only a few in some places...) is really better thought of as a ""family web"", since, as I noted, while you have 1,073,741,824 *theoretical* ancestors 30 generations back, the actual number of real people is much smaller. If we assume a generation is 25 years, and the (totally unfounded) assumption that ancestry is evenly distributed around the globe, that means that 750 years ago, [when the world population was around 360,000,000](http://www.worldhistorysite.com/population.html), then each person of the 30th generation would actually appear ~3 times (and also a few times in the 29th, or 31st... since generations don't keep perfect pace). 

So this means there are an *incredible* number of paths which you can follow to reach any given person... but how many were *ever* recorded, let alone remain intact and accessible? Someone like Queen Elizabeth II can do it easily, [since her lineage is through notable figures](http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm), but for many, out of those literally *billions* of threads that your ancestry traces through, who knows if even a single one still remains. And if there is one out there to be found, it can be quite the slog as many on thus sub can no doubt attest. We can't all say ""Well King George was my dad, and King George was *his* dad, and King Eddie was *hiiis* dad"". Centuries ago, King Bob had ten kids... the 3rd daughter got married to a Duke, their 4th son, was only a Baron, and his 3rd daughter married a wealthy, but non-noble landowner who gambled it all away, and their kids faded into obscurity, and in only a few generations you've gone from royalty to insignificant, and a few generations from there, quite possibly lose any records that would have gotten you back there.

While I've been fortunate enough on my father's side to find many good, solid records at least into the 17th century, and a few tantalizing hints beyond, on my mother's side, it is nearly impossible to find information that reaches even into the 19th century, so the contrast can be really quite stark, and being able to reconstruct those records can often be *very* rare.

Common people in medieval Europe not only practiced magic, but embraced it, only distinguishing between beneficial and malicious actions. Before the Catholic Church's condemnation of all non-Christian practices, only negative behaviors or perceived magical beings would be targeted. The ostracization of a harmful ""other"" is little different from most social management behaviors across the world. Targeting witches as an inclusive group was not something the masses were used to doing; the rise of witch hunts in Europe were largely the influence of the Church in response to the shifting European world after the Black Death and the rise of Protestantism. 

In this, I do see a lot of similarity between Christianity's Wars of Religion and the schism happening in Islam today. With perspective, we can see how in the 1400s, religion both was and wasn't a major instigator and justification for some incredibly atrocious behaviors (the Church, after all, did boil people alive in hot oil in the name of salvation).  I have been arguing that the situation is similar with Islam.  Blaming Islam as inherently backwards, when American Muslims, for instance, largely don't adhere to the tenets of wahabbism, is an inconsistency that needs to be addressed by people making such claims.  That was also my point about Benazir Bhutto, who by the argument of those who blanket-chastize Islam should never have made it to the polling station in a Muslim-majority country, let alone been elected twice.  A small but powerful and wealthy group of people have been funding Islamic extremism for the last 30 years (eerily similar, again, to the medieval Church). I will not hold a religion that has so many sects, interpretations, traditions, and such a long history to the narrow, xenophobic, and sexist version promoted by that small group.  Some people point to wahabbism; I feel like we should also point out all the moderate Sunnis, Shias, and Sufis who populate and participate in democracies across the globe.

First, I apologize for not being more specific: I was looking at the Renault Megane, the base model of which has a 1.2L engine and does 0-62 in 10.9 seconds. It looks like the MSRP is right on par with the Focus and Jetta.

Second, I'm not really sure where you're getting your 0-60 time for the Jetta. [Car &amp; Driver](http://www.caranddriver.com/volkswagen/jetta) says the *1.5L* version (the 1.2L is the base in Europe) does 0-60 in 8.4.

Third, MSRP doesn't account for taxes. That American Focus with a 2.0L engine will incur much higher road taxes in Europe than the 1.2L European Jetta -- it'll probably cost you thousands more over the life of the car. That's kind of my point: in the US, there's not as much of an economic disincentive to bigger, more powerful engines. Here, it's *rare* to see anything below 2.0L and pretty common to see stuff as big as 5.0L. In Europe, it's the opposite: most car engines are smaller than 2-2.5L, and it's rare to see anything above 4.0. Granted, Europeans don't drive as much as we do, but if you have to drive a lot it'll be much nicer to do so with a big, torquey American V8!

&gt;But yes, in general it's true that many Europeans like efficient cars, since the public transport is better and there's no real need to drive long distances in their cars. That being said, Europe is also a huge market for more pricey cars. You see cars like BMW 7-Series, Audi RS7/R8, Mercedes-AMGs, etc... on a daily basis, since there are many many people who just love cars here.

“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.

He doesn't want to totally ban them from coming in and he can't. But he can stop certain immigrants from coming in. Besides, it's really a matter of where they came from and what ever info we can get on them. 

Also, he alluded to the fact that if Trump was president when he was trying to immigrate here he would not be allowed to. Well in 1980 we didn't have ISIS  terrorizing Europe. That's the only reason he wants to have a temporary ban. 

Then he said his son couldn't serve under Trump, which is false, trump never said that he was going to ban Muslims from the military and that is unconstitutional. He also made the illusion to kicking all Muslims out of the country. Which is false, the only thing I don't agree with but Khan never said was Trump has said something about a list, but technically we already have a list the terror watch list. 

The sacrifice thing was BS because, as Americans we all sacrifice our loved ones and friends during war. It's a terrible thing, I have lost friends and family. It's the sacrifice we all make to attempt to live freely. That's why I tear up seeing the flag, while the national anthem plays and see our men and women in uniforms. We all lost a hero when his son died and the thousands of other men and women in war. 

In my own view Trump has sacrificed millions of dollars, time, relationships and friendships to try and MAGA. We all have our own views of Trump, but he in his own heart and soul loves this country and the people in it. He is putting his, his children's and all of his employees futures on the line to try and ensure a better future for us all.  ",,Yolo20152016,t1_d6026rv

1) What is the risk of breaking up the UK on the altar of Brexit, with regard to Scotland? 

2) How does the 310-mile Eire/Northern Ireland border stay open as it is legally bound to be under the Good Friday Agreement and at the same time prevent all of the Freedom of Movement Romanians and other EU citizens from entering the UK that way?  And if the border is made hard what is to prevent the further brake up of the UK?  

3) The Gibraltar question - in a normal year the risk of losing Gibraltar from the crown would be a major news story — today to May and the Brexiteers they pretend as if it doesn't matter.  

4) You cannot legally negotiate trade deals with other nations while you are in the EU; even ""informal chats"" risk prosecution, so how we get new trade deals is unclear. 

5) Trade deals, in practice, take 7 to 10 years to negotiate.  

6) If our new agreement with the EU goes beyond simply Trade, then it will need ratification from all 27 Member States - that ratification process has never happened in less than 4 years.  Any one of the 27 could veto the sweetheart deal say 6 years from now and stop Brexit happening.  

7) The Lords could block Brexit.  

8) The age demographic is changing - older people were more in favour of leave, young in favour of remain.  In just 4 to 6 years the dying off of the old and the young becoming of voting age will tip the balance from 52% to 48%.  Just think you need a 2% swing.  Voting age is 70-18 = 52 years.  2% of 52years is 1 year.  Give it four times that and there will likely no longer be a majority support for Leave.  [Young people are much more interested in having the opportunity to live and work outside the UK].   

8) More United is a new political movement in the UK that is going to crowd fund MPs who seek to Remain, with its members deciding who those MPs are and it is likely to be a key force to cut any Leave MPs from getting a seat.

9) The EU can't give us a 'sweetheart deal' because if they did, other countries would want one - so they have to give us a grotty deal, which once the negotiations are over will be seen for what it is — worse than the sweetheart deal we have today (with the Rebate and numerous opt outs).

10) The Frontier at Calais, even though we twisted the French arm to do our security for us, if negotiations get bitter that kindness could quickly lapse.  The border razor wire and refugee holding areas would then be near Dover.  See the film Children of Men for the Bexhill Refugee camp - its a real place in Sussex, it just doesn't have the razor wire today.

11) Big one - what about all of the Brits abroad in the EU today — if we are nasty to the EU these Brits will likely get deported and that will create a political fire storm, probably blocking Brexit  [By now you can probably see that this thing has not begun to be thought through  — they really didn't have a plan, in fact they hadn't taken responsibility for the consequences of their actions like (Boris in his Telegraph articles) shouting Fire in a packed Theatre.]

12) EU citizens in the UK.

13) The need to keep compliance with EU regulations to sell into that market - and at the same time giving up a place at the table, a say in what they are — that is not logical. 

14) The various EU-lite deals being discussed by the right wing press tend to sacrifice the City of London's financial services market on the altar of Brexit - when that is seen in its true light, there is likely to be a fresh appreciation for the value that financial services bring to the UK economy.

15) Economic impacts.

16) And one people aren't talking about but is probably the most important of the lot: Systemic Failure triggered by attempting to do so many fundamental changes all at the same time.  So much change so quickly will likely wrap our public, private and voluntary sectors in so much transformation that figuring out the new business processes and compliance regimes will be hard.  If you try to do too much change too quickly then the outcome is likely to be a logjam where no change happens, or worse still end-to-end systems, such as food and petrol distribution become disrupted.  Knock on effects can compound and aggravate what seemed simple at first sight - as simple as coining in a new mantra ""Brexit means Brexit"" without beginning to work out the solution to the sixteen simultaneous equations just outlined about.

17) The UK doesn’t have trade negotiators.

18) Negotiating trade deals raises the need for sovereign encryption, a need even more tantamount than secrecy in war – in war you have allies – in trade as the UK (separated from the EU) has no allies that it can just give the crown jewels to.  However, [the UK is having to rely on Canadian know how to polish up its encryption capability - that doesn’t sound strong.](http://www.cgi-group.co.uk/news/cgi-to-provide-support-for-uk-ministry-of-defence-cryptography-management-system.)

19) The UK Government has several jobs to do in parallel. Think of it as someone getting a divorce.  They have to 1) spend literally hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of pounds [mine cost quarter of a million] with lawyers untangling themselves from the old partner, 2) and then they want to be off wooing the new partner … who is keen to have lavish attention so as to prove that they are more special than the old partner, 3) and they have to keep doing they day job plus 4) work a lot harder to earn more money to pay the double mortgage, the double car payments, the double utility bills, plus all the lawyers fees and 5) the kids are upset with all of this disruption and they demand more attention than usual and 6) the person is upset and stressed and needs more ‘me’ time to decompress and unstress… That is just like the UK, getting divorced from the EU.  There are 27 children involved, many of whom [like France] are mightily upset.  The new girlfriend is the new trade partners – such as China – and look how well that is going (Not) with the funding of the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.  May, simply doesn’t have time in her day to woo China. 

20) Bregret - there is about 7% of the electorate who while voting Leave, now in the cold light of day regret their earlier tick in a box.

My prediction: The Tory right in alliance with UKIP and Murdoch will press the Article 50 button in about 2 years time.  Negotiations go from bad to worse to awful as parties attempt to balance over a dozen competing goals.  Either A) we find ourselves outside the EU without new trade deals in place or B) we are technically still in the EU until a set date and a new deal is on the table in front of us.  In either A or B my forecast is that what is on the table will be worse than the status quo — and almost everyone will see that difference - in the cold light of day.  At that point I forecast we'll go back to the EU with a new election mandate to remain, and will be told to take the default terms, which we'll take.  Euro.  Schengen Area.  No Rebate.  And no sweetheart deal on any emergency brakes.   If you are to have an open market for services you have to have freedom of movement — to allow people to come and deliver those services to the customer.    Logical.  

There is a gulf here - I was just using rational argument.  I didn't even evidence my claims, relying on logic and general world knowledge.  It would appear that the hole in the Brexit Bucket is logic, reasoning, deduction, of one thing follows from another.  They didn't think this thing through, let alone have a plan.

I did. But explain further. Israelis was from the beginning willing to negotiate, but the Palestianians under the influence of the Jordan king and other Middle East state leaders would have none of that. 

&gt; They didn't want to cleanse all of the Arabs in the Middle East, just to get them out of Israel.

Not really the same thing, is it? And it is at best a huge exaggeration. 

&gt; Would you like a direct quote from an Israeli commander on the day after they attacked the village of Dayr Yasin and killed half its inhabitants? When asked if he was worried about Arab-Israeli tensions after the creation of the Israeli state, he replied ""Oh No. That will be fixed. A few calculated massacres will soon get rid of them"".

You can find all the confirmation bias you want if you look hard enough. 

&gt; Huh, what? Excuse? Where? Please stop just making things up. It's pretty pointless.

I think I have expressed this pretty well. You just cant ignore what I say, and then ask me to repeat what I have written. 

&gt; You know - history. Learn some.

Please, I have been trying to help you reach this simple point. You have to read more history if you are going to talk about it.

&gt;Huh? Where did I say that they did? Do you think that the Muslims living across the road from me identify themselves with Isis?

You keep bringing Uganda up, like I'm supposed to defend them for being violent like Middle Eastern countries always are against their people. Uganda has much more in common with these countries than they have with European Christians. 

&gt; The ones in the Balkans, on the other hand were European Christians from what had been a modern European country. As were the ones in Ireland. But that doesn't fit your narrative, so you just ignore it.

I don't give a damn about narratives. That is what the left side does, and you of course. 

&gt; Err, yes. Christian fundamentalists. Your point being?

They have less in common with American and European Christians and more in common with Middle Eastern countries. Uganda is not objectively representative of Christians if you take European and Americans into the mix. That is the point, dumbass. 

&gt; You do presumably realise that Christians believe that Jesus is God (the ""God the son"" of the Holy Trinity)?

Is it not widely asserted already that Jesus is to Christians what Mohammed is to Muslims? 

&gt; But that's still irrelevant, because the point is that the messages given in the Bible, just like the messages given in the Quran, have been used many, many times to justify war and killing in the name of god. 

Today, these violent messages are primarily acted upon by followers of Islam. Not Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism or Norse Gods. When that changes, come back to me with your regressive mindset. 

&gt; It doesn't matter which particular bit of their beliefs they take it from. What matters is that they've taken it from a part of their belief system.

But it does matter if you would like to deal with the issues happening in this reality and happening today.

&gt; I'm reading one right now - A Line In The Sand - going into great detail about this very topic. You should try reading it. Or some history of any description.

Clearly, you are committed to a world view which will not change no matter how badly you get disproven by reality. Of course, you feel the need to tell me that you are reading A Line in The Sand like that somehow proves you are capable of objectively considering historical accounts that goes against your ideology.

Left-wing populism has a long, long road ahead of it if it wants to solve the serious problems we are faced with. 

First of all, the word populism implies more than just passion and ""doing what the people want"". It also includes catering to simplistic opinions that amount to trying to have your cake and eat it too. The problem is, of course, that far right populism that sells easy solutions that ultimately solve nothing (for example, the likes of Trump and Le Pen can't solve the problems of the dwindling middle class left behind by globalisation with their policies) can always get away with it: they can use foreigners and the ""undesirables"" of society as scapegoats to continue ruling. They can become militaristic or authoritarian and survive. And that's in line with their principles. Would Trump lose his supporters and cult of personality if his policies don't help American workers? I doubt it. 

On the other hand, a left-wing populist government that tries the same can't get away with it. It becomes a mockery of the principles it's supposed to represent, de-legitimising itself. Take a look at Syriza in Greece now, every time they open their mouth to preach about the commons or economic equality it's like they are just mocking themselves when at the same time they privatise everything for peanuts or let the poor and weak fend for themselves. Or to use more blatant examples: Venezuela or even the collapsed USSR, the former trapped in a vicious circle of bad economic choices and clientelism and the latter collapsed under the weight of authoritarianism and economic disarray. 

Now, let's get back to passion for a moment. It's an interesting phenomenon currently because the far-right populists use it extensively but at the same time pretend they're not. We live in the age of reason, so they co-opt rationality as their main narrative instead of the usual [""action  for  action's  sake"" that Umberto Eco uses to define fascism](http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf). They almost never say ""we're passionate about keeping our nation pure-blooded, ""blut und boden"" and all that. No, it's all about immigrants=criminals statistics and incompatible cultures sophistry.

The article also mentions Podemos, which I feel like is not similar to Syriza any more, at least as far the ""populist"" angle goes. Iglesias has repeatedly tried to temper expectations by saying things like ""Spain is a big country, we have more negotiating power than Greece. We can't change much but we can push things slightly more in the direction we want than what Greece managed"". You can't compare than timid rhetoric with things like ""build a wall to keep the moslem terrorists out"" and call them both equally populist. It's not even in the same ballpark.

Another word that pops up many many times in the article is neoliberalism, presented as the main problem, which I disagree with. In Europe the main problem is the clash of economic philosophies between the Germanic ordoliberal/Ordnungspolitik ideals and the more Keynesian French ideals. Neoliberalism is in a weird spot right now, since even the IMF (supposedly the champion of such ideologies) has decried large parts of it very problematic.

So that leaves the left-wing in a pickle. As far as overall strategy is concerned, I'd say it's probably best to ally itself with the so-called ""globalists"" and ""neoliberals"", find some sort of middle-ground compromise on how capitalism should work with them. It's far more preferable than the nationalists winning. Trying to be the ""third way"" totally distinct from both the apolitical TINA ""end of history"" consensus ideology and the resurgent nationalist nativist trumpist ideology is a very big gamble since the left is at the moment much weaker in terms of popular support than either of them. With the capitalists in charge, the dream of international cooperation and understanding remains alive. With the nationalists in charge, disputes, a further lack of compromise and even military conquest become par for the course. Even if that wasn't the case, there is a non-trivial chance that the other two ideologies will find a way to ally to each other first, which would be catastrophic for the left-wing.

Even if they are attempting to bias the answer intentionally using a false premise, correction in the AskHistorian's-quality answer is potentially useful for other users reading the answer, regardless of if the questioner is disappointed in the outcome of their question. 

For instance, we often get questions asking about technological differences between Native American societies and European societies. Often, these questions are based on the false premise that  16th century European societies had massive and insurmountable technological advantages over Native American societies that lead to total domination of those societies. Any answer that fulfills the standards of quality we have set for AskHistorians answers will point out that this premise is false in many ways and address the technological advantage of European colonizers is often overstated in comparison to what we see historically.

I've said numerous times that after slavery came a host of injustices visited upon the newly-freed slaves, their descendants, and Black Americans who had never been slaves. I've said repeatedly that those injustices deserve compensation and reparations. I don't know how I can say it any more clearly.

You say that the abolitionist movements in the United States and Europe weren't altruistic...I would disagree. The prime movers of the British Abolitionist movement were William Wilburforce and his friends in the Clapham Sect:

&gt; After many decades of work both in British society and in Parliament, the group saw their efforts rewarded with the final passage of the Slave Trade Act in 1807, banning the trade throughout the British Empire and, after many further years of campaigning, the total emancipation of British slaves with the passing of the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. They also campaigned vigorously for Britain to use its influence to eradicate slavery throughout the world.

&gt; **The campaign proved to be the world's first grassroots human rights campaign, in which men and women from different social classes and backgrounds volunteered to try to end the injustices suffered by others.**

Wilburforce said to Parliament when the slave trade was made illegal: ""This is the first fruits of our efforts; let us persevere and our triumph will be complete. Never, never will we desist till we have wiped away this scandal from the Christian name, released ourselves from the load of guilt, under which we at present labor, and extinguished every trace of this bloody traffic, of which our posterity, looking back to the history of these enlightened times, will scarce believe that it has been suffered to exist so long a disgrace and dishonor to this country.""

I asked my dad, history teacher; "" I wont answer that , that question is too stupid""

There may be a very minor correlation in the present inability to defend themselves for the german jews. But given the availibility of weapons for jews in the european east and the dramatic lack of effective usage to prevent the holocaust from happening I cannot conclude that arming the jews would have made a major difference in the outcome.

taking for example the riot in the warsaw ghetto which ended in the brutal beat down of the armed rioters by the SS.

Did arming help them fight the germans? yes surely it did. 
Did arming make any difference in the end? no , not whatsoever.

My main takeaway is that, while it could make each encounter bloody, it couldnt change the outcome. There is no effective way for ""the jews"" to form armed groups when they have to wear their yellow badges already. When they are persecuted.

There is no effective way in stopping the holocaust by the jews themselves.

If you think there is, you drastically overestimate their strength.

in 1933 there were abou 560,000 jews in Germany. But we cannot use this number, because back then many of those jews who didnt emigrate in the US or other countries like France(unfortunate) believed themselves as part of Germany. 
It is not like active rioting by the jewish population would change anything between 1933 and 1941. Besides obviously hurting them in a massive backslash by the SS. This might have promted a much sooner start to the mass killing of german jews.

Only after 1941, when the Deportation of german jews began you can make the legitimate claim that armed rioting is a valid option. 

To make it more obvious: If your army invades France, Belgium, Poland, and the USSR, you are not going to care about the remaining around 170,000 german jews in the beginning of 1941. Whether they are armed or not. The numbers are insignificant in comparison with the actual enemy numbers.

And yes, I can see an argument for the case that armed people in Germany could have killed Hitler prior to him ordering the Holocaust. But I don't see it as a very good one. People tired on several occasions and failed. maybe it made a difference but it is really pointless in speculating about this specific instance.

Think about it this way, if the US govt. dediced to take habeas corpus from Muslims(thought experiment, bear with me), they would probably also take the right to bear arms. Because it's quite stupid to tell a group; you are not welcome here anymore and letting them arm themselves. It was never about the ability to possess weapons. It was only about the rampant discriminateion and overwelming hatred against all the jews in Germany. And of course finding ways to weaken them were - at the time- always welcome. And further, you are not going to give a damn about ""the rule of law"" when you are not living in a state of law anymore. Thus those bans on the jews were only effective because they were followed by the general public and executed by in the beginning the SA and later the SS and the Gestapo. Otherwise those bans mean nothing. 

But to come back to our initial point: I don't see a target group for some democratc policies. I can see the counter argument, that they are ineffective. I cannot see the right that they prepare for a authoritarian takeover. Because those always require massive public support at the start. And I dont see this happening with any democrat.


___


I'm not trying to diminish weapons or the ability of the jews to defend themselves. I just try to be realistic. If there is a desire to throughoutly annihalate a race or religion or ethicity or nationality, the govt of the state who has such a desire will of course do anything to make this goal easily achievable. Which means weakening the enemy as far as possible. And if this is not possible it will just attack this enemy.

As can be seen in Hitlers Undertaking Barbossa. (the attack on russia). It just didnt make a difference to the high ranking nazis whether the enemy was weak or not, they still wanted to annihate them, because they viewed them as inferior humans.

____

Now the actually important shit: The usage of guns by people who are effective with this type of weapons liberated Europe, and Germany. And the vast majority here are really thankfull for this. There is nothing greater than living in liberty and under a rule of law. I'm always humbled by remembering the fallen allied soldiers who died so that we can enjoy our life without fear.

Every single time a case of corruption from the PP or PSOE hits the papers the next poll ALWAYS gets a spike in popularity in favour of independence. Its been like that for over 20 years. Therefore there is a segment of the population where the economic principal its clearly the driving force behind their vote.

Your brief history of Catalunya is really cute but to be honest the places who favour independence heavily like Girona and Lleida are the poorest regions there while Barcelona is heavily in favour of remain.

Same shit in the basque country where most economic hubs are in favour of remain.

The identity thing is well and all but the population of both areas has doubled since Franco died, mostly through Spanish intra-immigration. Half the population talking about the identifying culture from Catalunya where born in Spain, like deep Spain. 

At least Catalunya has their independence movement being leaded by Artur Mas and CO. who are right wing nut jobs. They are basically saying ""we think Spain is full of poor people and if we left we could spend more on social services with less taxes"". In the basque country we have to hear that shit from Bildu who claims to be in favour of the poor, but apparently the poorer regions of Spain don't deserve our help. 

If you saw a guy in a suit saying ""give me less taxes or I will take my money to a tax heaven"" you'd think he is a huge piece of shit, yet Catalunya is saying that exact thing and everyone is happy about it.

Yes

&gt; Common people in medieval Europe not only practiced magic, but embraced it, only distinguishing between beneficial and malicious actions

Please tell me you are not one of those wicca cranks, you'll need a source for this. superstition, cunning folk and *magic* are very different things.

&gt;  Before the Catholic Church's condemnation of all non-Christian practices, only negative behaviors or perceived magical beings would be targeted. The ostracization of a harmful ""other"" is little different from most social management behaviors across the world. Targeting witches as an inclusive group was not something the masses were used to doing; the rise of witch hunts in Europe were largely the influence of the Church in response to the shifting European world after the Black Death and the rise of Protestantism. 

This sounds very confused, like, 6 centuries in three lines confused.


&gt; In this, I do see a lot of similarity between Christianity's Wars of Religion and the schism happening in Islam today. 


And so do I. The problem is, the reformers are the Salafis. 


&gt; Blaming Islam as inherently backwards


Blaming the church wasn't? I have no interest in defending the bloody church, however...


&gt; Blaming Islam as inherently backwards, when American Muslims, for instance, largely don't adhere to the tenets of wahabbism, is an inconsistency that needs to be addressed by people making such claims.


American Muslims have passed through a great deal of selection to cross the pond.  I can well imagine they are much more ""western-friendly"" than the average Muslim


&gt;  A small but powerful and wealthy group of people have been funding Islamic extremism for the last 30 years (eerily similar, again, to the medieval Church).

Yes, I am with you on this


&gt;I will not hold a religion that has so many sects, interpretations, traditions, and such a long history to the narrow, xenophobic, and sexist version promoted by that small group.


That's the point. It is not a small group. This may be news for you, but homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance and anti-western hatred are **mainstream** in the Muslim world both in Asia and Europe... 


&gt; I feel like we should also point out all the moderate Sunnis, Shias, and Sufis who populate and participate in democracies across the globe. They need our support to stamp out extremism, not our condemnation of their belief system.

What do you think the impetus was for the People's Crusade? It was the Pope's call to arms. Alexios didn't call them down on his own, it was the Pope.

According to Asbridge, the spread of Islam was unimportant because ""Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity"".

EDIT: and as far as a dogmatic view of the Crusades goes, I think that's pretty funny. They were not organized, they were a bunch of upjumped knights that were overemployed and had nothing better to do than make a name for themselves killing Christians while they pretended to kill Muslims. They committed atrocities and war crimes left and right, pillaged and raided anything that wasn't held down, and had their fair share of good ole fashioned wartime raping. The only thing they actually accomplished was successfully radicalizing Muslims, who were previously relatively tame under the leader Sahaladin.

You can not empirically declare a belief system to be fundamentally anything, since it depends how you define the belief system. Do we center the debate upon the words in the founding book? Instead, do we consider the actions of followers as reflective of the religion? Either way, whether we choose one, the other, or both, there will be contradictions. Do the violent phrases of the Quran influence the entire religion? Rather, is it the abstract ideals, usually more peaceful, that are the pillars to the faith? By observing followers you will obviously encounter difficulties defining the religion by one adjective. We have liberal, peaceful Muslims on one extreme, and violent terrorists on the other. I think it would be an insurmountable challenge to come to any relevant conclusion this way, without simplifying or generalizing the faith. There is no belief system on earth that is consistent among its followers. People will pick and choose what they adhere to, motivated by their environment and upbringing. 

Secondly, debating the religion as such is untoward since the provocation for this debate is events in current times. You can not look at Islam in a vacuum, and then hope to explain the larger space around it. Imagine if we were visiting 1800's America or 1940's Germany. We could say that an entire group of people were inherently racist and evil. But that would reject the political, social, economic causes that influenced these countries. It's easy to look back now and realize that slavery and Nazism were not products of one singular attribute. It is understandably difficult, however, to look at current events with a similarly discerning eye.

Terrorism is not the product of just religion. There are political and social effects that have created the problems in the middle east, consequences of actions by Europeans, the US, and Muslim leaders. To dismiss these is easy, but also myopic. It does not allow you to consider past, global events that have influenced current difficulties. It prevents you from acknowledging common threads between Middle Eastern strife and past conflicts. From the Sykes-Picot agreement, to constant wars in the latter part of the 20th century up til today, the Middle East is very much a result of outside influence. These are people who felt pushed into a corner, a loss of sovereignty. In reaction, the countries and societies became controlled by theological leaders, since religion was and is a strong tie between the people. Homogeneity has lent to a reversion to stricter, patriarchal structure, as well as extreme views towards the west. 

There is nothing fundamentally unique about countries in the Middle East. These are countries under religious control, homogeneous and polarized from the rest of the world. When America was under the homogeneous control of white men, we had slavery, segregation, lack of rights for women, cult of domesticity, discrimination of gays. Western societies are definitely more modern than Middle Eastern ones, however the evils that trouble the region have been experienced previously by the west. The rise of terrorism and extremist Islamic views is the consequence of much more than just a common religion. ",,gd__,t1_d5zfocf

You keep trying to act like it takes some sort of mental exercise to perceive Trump's bigotry and xenophobia, when it's actually right there in front of you. You clearly just don't understand what bigotry and xenophobia look or sound like.

&gt;Let's take your example of Mrs Kahn once again.

Ok.

&gt;You try to accuse me of prejudice now, when I was highlighting the trope that formed the basis of his ""attack"".

Because you're making the very strange mistake of trying to justify Trump's prejudice and xenophobia by espousing the very prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes for which he is criticized.

&gt;His response was actually quite funny, and they deserved it by coming after him.

Humor is subjective, and I'm the first to say so. But what Trump did was insinuate that a woman was prevented from speaking because she is subservient to an oppressive Muslim husband, when, in fact, she was too overcome by grief to speak in front of a large audience about her fallen child. That you find this funny is disturbing and goes a long way to explain why you fail to see the issues with Trump's rhetoric.

&gt; It was a jibe.

Even if you're correct, he is running for President of the United States. Since when does that job entail jibbing the families of fallen soldiers? This goes beyond political correctness to just normal adult behavior.

&gt;The fact that it was based on her standing like a typical Muslim woman was the very reason why it worked.

And there it is. This statement conveys the exact prejudicial attitudes that you fail to perceive in yourself and, not surprisingly, in Trump. How do you claim to know the manner in which a ""typical Muslim woman"" stands. You presume to know something about the general manner of Muslim women and then further presume that the specific Muslim woman before you is acting in conformity with the purported typical behavior. This is what prejudice looks like.

&gt; You don't like getting jibed? Don't step into the political arena and poke the lion.

For one thing, as we've already discussed, Mrs. Khan initially said nothing--she only stood by her husband's side. Trump proceeded to ""jibe"" her, without provocation. What does it say about this man as a candidate that he feels to need to mock a grieving mother who said nothing to him or about him?

&gt;It in no way follows that he views all Muslim women as subservient, yet you carry on like a slight against a person is a subtle revelation of the speaker's racist intent.

It absolutely follows from his comments that he views Muslim women as *generally* subservient. You have, yourself, perceived that this was his implication. See you own words: ""The fact that it was based on her standing like a typical Muslim woman was the very reason why it worked.""

&gt;Personally I think the Khan's are shameless and are exploiting their son's memory when he doesn't even have a say in the matter.

Mr. Kahn spoke about this matter a decade ago, and only spoke again at the Hillary campaign's request. You might argue that Hillary's campaign is exploiting the Kahns--that would at least be a somewhat defensible position. But to argue that the Kahns are exploiting their dead son again makes clear that you're at least as willing to enunciate repulsive propositions as is the candidate you support.

&gt;That has nothing to do with their religion or heritage and everything to do with their character.

It's also a fabrication direct from you.

&gt; I think they got off easy with what Trump said in his off-the-cuff remark.

What does this even mean? That Trump could have been even more bigoted and deplorable in his response? And you take this to be a bragging point?

&gt;Why is there always this conflation on the left between secure borders and xenophobia.

It is true that historically the left has resisted reasonable immigration reforms by unfairly painting the proponents of such reforms as xenophobic. This is unfortunate, not least because it allows people like you to pretend that legitimate denunciations of xenophobia and bigotry, such as those made against Trump, are just part of the same behavior from the left. But if you can't see the difference between Trump's statements regarding latinos and Muslims and the positions espoused by a mainstream, anti-illegal-immigration conservative, you're just plain lacking in your perceptive abilities.

&gt;Seriously, this is not even a debate in other countries.

Yes it is.

&gt; You bandy about labels as though one definitely means the other, when this just does not follow.

I have never suggested that being anti-illegal immigration is tantamount to being xenophobic. That's a straw man attack and you won't get away with it. I've repeatedly explained to you why what Trump specifically says about illegal immigrants and Muslims is prejudicial and xenophobic.

&gt;Take a good look at what is happening in Europe. Nobody is sitting around their inclusive bonfires singing kumbaya. Rape, violence and terrorism. Europe is feeling the effects of a loose policy on migration and many of the member states are questioning how this came to pass.

Text book fear mongering, from someone who has repeatedly complained about fear mongering. At any rate, there are several important things your fear-mongering response fails to take into account. For one, Americans are a far more diverse and integrated population than Europeans. Further, American Muslims specifically tend to be relatively liberal, especially when compared to other devout religious groups in the United States, like evangelicals. Moreover, the acts of terrorism committed in Europe are often perpetrated by native-born Islamic extremists. And, America is much better able to control and audit the influx of Syrian refugees. This is already happening in California, where the vast majority of refugees are women and children.

&gt; You can blow off Brexit as the work of an uninformed populace who didn't want outsiders, but this is entirely missing the heart of the problem.

I'm not blowing off Brexit--I'm noting that the result of Brexit is not favorable to your position.

&gt; It's not a bizarre comparison with the US.

It's not if you're trying to make my case for me.

&gt;Just as you miss the reason why Brexit carried the vote, despite the politicians ringing the alarm bells, despite Obama weighing in and urging them to stay, so too will you miss the reason why Trump surprises everyone and wins in a landslide.

And the politicians ringing the alarm bells and Obama, with his warning to stay, were all correct. So much so that the proponents of Brexit may not even go forward with it. Do you take it as a favorable comparison that you're proposing positions which are equally likely to have disastrous consequences?

&gt;You'll say the racists have taken over, that the public is deluded, but as long as you keep using the PC language they let you think with, you won't see that career politicians around the world are on the out.

I'm happy to see the demise of the career politician, if the career politician is replaced by someone who is rational, respectable, intelligent and informed. Trump is none of those things.

&gt;Governments are loaded with debt, pushing their bonds into negative territory, which will wipe out pension funds, at the same time they are accepting mass migration and the middle class is getting eaten away by the corruption of the political system.

I think we see similar problems here, but I don't think the solution is elect a deluded, thin-skinned bigot like Trump. For one thing, Trump suggests policies that will deepen the wealth gap (huge tax break for the richest Americans) at enormous government expense, to be paid for (only partially) by inevitable cuts to government programs and services most essential to the poor and middle class.

&gt;Right now, people are just giving a middle finger to the establishment and are voting in those who at least acknowledge there are real big problems with this globalist agenda.

While there are real problems with ""globalist agenda"", isolationism and xenophobia are not real solutions. There have, historically, been misguided populist uprisings like this before, that favor disorder and rage over any concession to the status quo. They inevitably lead to a retrenchment of establishment policies, typically with a conservative bent. Real, lasting change comes after careful implementation of well-considered policy. Trump offers a megaphone for the worst sentiments to come out of America's challenges. That's not something you should be proud to support.

Higher ? They were already significantly lower than in other countries like say germany. Maybe you think that people living on 400-600€/month with prices the same than in germany is ""high"" or ""overspending"" ?

&gt;  You're scapegoating.

No i'm not. I'm pointing out people that refuse to drop debts they have a part of responsability in, which continues to further wreak havoc on the country still as of now.

&gt; Besides, why on earth do you think interest is fictitious debt?

Because at that point dropping the entire debt and just giving QE to germany (that the ECB give them anyway) to make up the difference wouldn't change anything to germany, but would make a world of difference to greece. 

At that point, it's political face saving from creditors that want to hurt the country at any price for the sake of it.

That's just logic, I actually don't understand why NA is placed above EU while NA is playing bo3 and EU is playing bo2. A lot of people will tell you also that EU has improved pretty hard this split while NA tended to decrease in term of macro-plays and clear games.

You're also clearly willing to play into the pro-choice caricature yourself, by calling a fetus a collection of cells, as if a fully formed human isn't ultimately just a collection of cells. It's a dumb argument. And a dehumanizing one too.

&gt;There is no such thing as an infallible form of birth control. 

The efficacy of birth control is heavily dependent on proper and consistent usage, which the study you site doesn't acknowledge. Women who take birth control pills don't became pregnant because the pills didn't work, they become pregnant because they weren't consistent in their consumption of the pill and didn't follow its directions properly. Same could be said about most other forms of birth control, including condoms. 

&gt;https://www.optionsforsexualhealth.org/birth-control-pregnancy/birth-control-options/effectiveness

This site lays out the difference between effectual use and theoretical use. In other words, just be more fucking careful and read the directions.

Personally, I think that 99.7% efficacy rating is pretty damn great, and for the .3% who could possibly still get pregnant I would simply suggest getting an early abortion, which me and many other people who have been labeled ""pro-life"" by planned parenthood are in favor of. I'm for an 16-18 week limit, which is more permissible than the majority of European nations, but gets you labeled pro-life here in the United States. 

&gt;Funny, because it's not your body, not your choice. I am an adult and I have the right to choose not to be pregnant. 

An emotional argument through and through. A man, in a drunken stupor, can have unprotected sex and be held responsible for the consequences of that action for 18 years. A woman, who can take birth control, who can take the morning after pill, who can use a condom, who can use a contraceptive device, who can get her tubes tied, who can give up her child for adoption, who can be abstinent, who can have forms of sex that aren't penetrative vaginal sex, who can even have an early abortion (which many pro-lifers are willing to compromise on) isn't really free unless she has that one extra option.

Modern women have more control over their reproductive organs than in any other time in human history. Yet they need that one extra choice, because society so infantilizes women that it doesn’t expect them to be responsible enough to attempt one of the other choices I listed. Instead, it has to allow the killing of a fetus capable of forming pre natal memories.",,Jonmad17,t1_d60748r

Unfortunately, this is likely the wrong place for you to get the advice you may need. The Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, for example, does not have the remit to satisfactorily address your claims. 

There are likely a number of redditors here with similar experiences in foreign countries who may be able to weigh in and provide you some other advice, but mine is to go elsewhere for more pertinent advice.

Step 1. Go to /r/legaladvice or /r/LegalAdviceUK to try to get advice on the laws of the specific nation in which this privacy violation took place, as well as advice on how this may fall under EU Law.

Your ability to get copies of police reports dealing with the allegations against you that precipitated the event, and screen grabs of the Facebook messages you've received may be seen as useful pieces of evidence. As well as the names of all of the actors in this drama.

You may be told you have no case, despite it being traumatizing, or you may have grounds to sue the Hostel in a way that makes you feel whole again. Keep in mind, of course, you are unlikely to get the result you might anticipate from a US court. And if the potential damages are less than the cost of returning for any trial, the practicality of moving forward may become moot.

Step 2. Get some specific advice from somewhere about identity theft and how to protect yourself (and monitor new applications for credit or whatever). 

There may not be much you can do to stop it (I mean the information is already out there) but being watchful may allow you to mitigate any negative consequences to your credit score.

Step 3. You may want to talk to a counselor about your experience. I had my flat in London broken into (and they got my roommate's cash tips he'd been saving and our laptops) and it was useful for us to talk to each other about how we felt vulnerable after the fact, and about how we may have been marked for future break-in's because they knew we'd have to buy new laptops, etc...

Since you don't have a roommate that experienced the same violation with whom you can commiserate, having a professional to consult may be helpful to talk through your anxiety. 

Finally, Step 4, you may need to chalk this up as simply a shitty experience that you can learn from. So many of us go on a European vacation to learn about the world and about ourselves. 

There are a lot of great lessons in this experience that you may look back on as useful, even if they seem invasive and painful at present.

Good luck sorting all of this out.

The Mongol conquests resulted in the deaths of more people than any other human-orchestrated event in all of history, barring the Second World War. Every civilization they invaded was virtually annihilated and reduced to a few thousand enslaved survivors. Much of the reason the Middle East isn't the center of the world now is that the Mongols wiped out the Abbasid Caliphate, razed nearly every major city in the region, destroyed the cultural center of Baghdad, condemned huge amounts of classical knowledge, and caused a demographic collapse that the region recovered from only in the 20th century. The Mongols destroyed the politically weak but culturally blossoming Song dynasty in China, installing themselves as the country's rulers, and wiped out Kievan Rus', along with most of the Eastern European population, before running into logistical difficulties around Germany and Hungary and faltering.

They're certainly within their rights to do it, all I'm saying is that it is a scummy practice to do, and is not advantageous to consumers or gaming as a whole. I say this as someone who owns a GTX 760.

&gt;I don't think this stifles competition at all because AMD could be making the same deals with game developers to implement technologies from GPUOpen. The problem is they're either not doing that or they're losing out to Nvidia in these business deals.

Is it not similar to how Microsoft (allegedly) [bribed businesses for software deals](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/technology/us-said-to-look-into-microsoft-bribery-allegations.html), or how [Intel bribed computer manufacturers and retailers to not use or sell computers with AMD CPU's?](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/184323-intel-stuck-with-1-45-billion-fine-in-europe-for-unfair-and-damaging-practices-against-amd)

AMD does not have the funds to 'out bribe' Nvidia, and if they lose more money and market share purely because of Nvidia's bribes, meaning they can no longer put as much money into R&amp;D for better products, how is that *not* stifling competition?

&gt;If people are angry about games running poorly on AMD, it'd actually be more appropriate to hate on the game developers instead of Nvidia because they're the ones that chose to make their game with Nvidia-specific technology rather than using GPUOpen tech. Nvidia just makes the technology. They're not forcing anybody to use it.

This is true, and while we should not be approving of devs who choose to take Nvidia's money (though they oftentimes can be rather desperate), that does not mean Nvidia isn't at fault for enabling such behaivor in the first place. That'd be like not blaming drug dealers or casinos just because addicts and gamblers can't help themselves. =\",,RatherNott,t1_d609f10

&gt;""The Muslim world had, indisputably, excelled over the rest between the ninth and the twelfth century. This is because Muslims had overrun the worlds greatest civilizations—Egypt, Persia, India and the Levant—incorporating their wealth, brains and accumulated intellectual treasure. The Hellenic civilization, following the trail of Alexanders conquest, had moved eastwards from Greece to Alexandria and the Levant. Thus, the intellectual treasure of classical Greece also became incorporated into the Islamic world. Europe, battered by the so-called Barbarians from the North—the Vandals, Goths, Vikings etc.—and under obscurantist Christian influence, had sunk into darkness. Under these circumstances, which else could be the leading civilization of the world? After the initial battering by zealous Muslims, the vigorous pre-Islamic civilizations, which Islam had devoured, revived themselves in the vast Islamic world. It was not Arabs, but the Persians, Indians, Greeks and Levantines—many of them non-Muslims—who rejuvenated and nurtured intellectual and material endeavors in the Muslim world. The translation of foreign manuscripts, which was central for the medieval Islamic worlds excellence, was already occurring in pre-Islamic Persia. And in the Muslim period, the translations—patronized by the Godless Umayyads and wayward persianized Abbasids—were done entirely by non-Muslim scholars, mostly Christians; none of the translators were Muslims. Given the prohibition of the Islamic theology to many of these endeavors, little credit should go to Islam for the medieval Muslim worlds excellence; it must go to the pre-Islamic civilizations that Islam had violently appropriated and internalized""
-M.A. Khan


Most of the scholars were not muslim, Many of them were non-muslim, the most famous is Hunayn ibn Ishaq (c.808–873 CE), a Christian from southern Iraq. Then there is Abu Bakr Ar-Razi a deist.

&gt; If it wasn't for Greco-Roman philosophy, the Persian Court inspired translation movement, Indian &amp; Babylonian mathematics etc there wouldn't be a Golden Age.

I see where you're coming from, but I think that this is true for all science. Without concepts developed during the Islamic Golden Age, the European Enlightenment would have been impossible, but we don't typically bring up the Islamic Golden Age every time someone mentions the Enlightenment. It's the whole ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" thing. I think this is especially true for the Islamic Golden Age, as experimental empiricism really took off during that time. 

At any rate, I would definitely argue that the Islamic Golden Age was an altogether more productive time for science than any equally long time period that came before it.

&gt; The idea of wrapping this all up in Islam rather than crediting the peoples and cultures involved has been a huge mistake imo.

While it's certainly important to recognise the contributions of individuals, it's equally important not to forget that Islam was a huge part of their personal and cultural lives. Al-Farabi explicitly stated that science was an act of piety. In my opinion, to separate Islam from the scientists of that time period is to create a separation that wouldn't have made sense to those scientists. ",,abvdm,t1_d6091bv

&gt;* Polish and Italian experts will carry out a joint observation flight over Russian and Belarusian territory.

&gt;* MOSCOW (Sputnik)  Polish and Italian experts will carry out a joint observation flight over Russian and Belarusian territory under the Open Skies Treaty this week, the acting head of the Russian Defense Ministry's Nuclear Risk Reduction Center said.

&gt;* ""From August 1 to 5, as part of the international Open Skies Treaty, a joint Polish-Italian mission will perform an observation flight over the territory of a group of states party to the treaty, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, in a Ukrainian An-30B observation aircraft,"" Sergei Zabello said.

&gt;* He added that the flight will take place along an agreed route, with Russian and Belarusian experts to be present on board in order to ensure that the aircraft and the survey equipment used are in compliance with the treaty.

&gt;* The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in March 1992 and became one of the major confidence-building measures in Europe after the Cold War.

If you're going by CDC numbers, the US has 5.1 homicides per 100,000. That'd put homicides minus the cops at 4.7. 3.9 was the UNODC, which I believe uses FBI stats (don't quote me on that), a different metric.

&gt;It doesn't. The US also has a high rate of aggravated assault compared to the EU. 

Source? Everything I've seen has suggested: 1. It's pretty hard to compare assault between countries because different countries count different things. (The UK has a super high number of assaults, but only because assault is very inclusive.) and 2. When you do compare them, the US isn't ridiculously high like it is with homicide rates.

&gt;You go ahead and find me another developed country with all those problems.

Well...all/most countries have ""racial history"" and ""immigration"". And illegal immigration into the US is...a bit less of a problem than it is for Europe at the moment, it seems. Illegal immigrants to the US seem like overwhelmingly positive contributions to society, actually. And drugs are illegal in almost every country. When I look for ""developed countries"", am I looking at former soviet nations which are still poor as shit? Because while they may be in the EU, they're still poor as shit. I'm not sure if being more equal, but being significantly more poor is better.

&gt;3 of them. All of which are subject to EU gun control laws and still have higher rates

Just to be clear, I'm not really arguing for gun control. I don't think bringing in substantial gun control to the US would be a worthwhile effort right now.

It's pretty much accepted by all European or Medieval academics today that this is an unfortunate misconception that continues to be taught in high schools.

https://www.quora.com/Were-the-Dark-Ages-really-pretty-dark

You seem to have a slanted view on this area and age of history. While I obviously don't deny the horrible things that have taken place during this time, if everything was as ""ass-backwards"" and uneducated as you say, how would discourse with Muslim and Jewish scholars even begin? Wouldn't it have been easier if the caliphate in Spain just took over the rest of Europe and ""educated it""? Also, I would argue that the Church, as you say, destroyed intellectual thinking and progress. Just as there are, I assume, passages in the Koran to promote and seek knowledge, it exists in the Bible as well. Or else there wouldn't be monks in the Medieval Ages painstakingly writing, rewriting, and passing along not just the Bible, but whatever scholarly articles there were. I mean, who do you think destroyed the Libraries of Nalanda, which held far more texts on science that just Buddhist scripture? It was some Muslim warlord, but I don't say that Islam was some ass-backwards religion that held back the progress of knowledge. It was some military guy who happened to be Muslim and had conquering on the brain rather than scholarly pursuits. Same can be said for whoever destroyed the Library of Alexandria.

I believe all these scholars are a tiny fraction of the people that were educated within Europe during your period of 1800 years after the fall of the Roman Empire: Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus, Fibonacci, Tartaglia, Cardono, Cavalieri, Pascal, Hooke, Newton, Leibniz 

Go ahead, call me a European apologist :) 

Personally, I see the logical reasoning of intellectual thinkers like Sam Harris who have analyzed all religions from their historical beginnings, their founding principles, how these religions were spread, and how their modern day believers process their respective religious Scripture. 

I mean, both my parents are SE Asian immigrants from a third-world, war-torn country where most people are Buddhist. They had no hatred for a group of people or 1st world country that was meddling into their own countries affairs. They neither felt entitled to anything or were taught through their religious beliefs that they were better than anyone else. And this allowed them to focus on themselves and their hard work to better themselves, which they did since they both ended up extremely educated with professional degrees. 

You refer to how bad fundamentalism in a religion is. The more extreme or fundamental you become in Buddhism, the more peaceful and self-reflective a believer becomes. And then there's Jainism, which is even more peaceful than Buddhism; they are not only vegan, they are selective with the plants they eat so that they don't kill the plant. I have absolutely no problem hanging out with these type of extremists. 

I have Christian family members, and honestly, Jesus sounds like a modern day hippie wanting to spread the love around. They've progressed beyond claiming people are heretics and killing them.  

I also have Muslim friends, but I learned more about the religion in a World Religions class, although it never covered the nasty bits in its history that places like Saudi Arabia have adopted despite it being a modern day society. If Islam had a reformation like Christianity, I think that would obviously benefit humankind. And I think a majority of Muslims would like that as well since that's the way they have been practicing all their lives. However, when you get a person that is religious and has so much anger for whatever reason, if they go to their Scripture and it tells them all this nonsense about killing infidels, Jews and Christians are ok if they pay a tax but are still considered 2nd class citizens, ex-Muslims should be killed, and Buddhist and Hindus should be exterminated because they are polytheists, it obviously is the religion that gives them this skewed ""rationality"" and should be reformed to promote more peace. And yet their are religious clerics that are promoting violence to whole congregations. 

You bring up socioeconomic and lack of prosperity, etc, as factor as to why they turn to Islamic extremism. My parents were in the same situation, and if they turned more to Buddhism to find comfort, it didn't and wouldn't make them fanatical, irrational and crazy. Additionally, these extremists that decide to martyr themselves are educated, middle class, if not higher. They're engineers, doctors, or heirs to wealthy families. I highly doubt it was lack of prosperity that pushed them to martyr themselves as opposed to martyring themselves and taking infidels with them so that they have an automatic ticket to the afterlife. If they were truly peaceful and cared for humankind, I would think they would try to ""save"" these infidel people by helping them convert to Islam so that these people can be saved on Islam's version of judgement day, not be turned into a ticket for the afterlife.

I don't know enough about Christianity to assume if an extremist would have similar illogical reasoning today. However, in the West, the secular laws of the land overrides religion and that's a good thing because it, for the most part, treats people equally or at least with a set of rights. You can't impose your religion or religious laws on another, and I don't really see that in Muslim majority countries.. even those that are democratic. It's almost like the religious minorities and some Muslims in those countries have Stockholm syndrome. You never know what freedom is if you've never had it before or if you were prevented from free thought, critical thinking, and discourse that questions those in power.

Why shouldn't people be able to play for whatever region they want and whatever team they want? Citizenship is very very very hard to get for an Esport in many countries. Why are we forcing players to stay in EU or Korea where the pay is considerably less? Players who won't get play at all in Korea won't be drafted to NA/EU/LPL now despite being better players than the other options.

It's only 331 watts +/- 5%.

CE, ROHS and FCC certification is either entirely self certified or mostly self certified. UL, ETL and CSA actually has to be independently tested. CE is a European standard that I do not trust with cheap Chinese products due to rampant fraud, ROHS means there's no toxic materials like lead being used (they used bismuth based solder) and FCC certification is not needed for unintentional radio frequency radiators (except for phase locked loop radio synthesizers and super regenerative receivers I believe). It's self certified with switched power supplies. For intentional radio frequency radiators, like a wireless modem, then FCC certification testing is done (how I am phrasing the FCC stuff may be a little off and there are differences for hobby built stuff or amateur radio home made transmitters with the proper license. It differs by country).

Saying the light is good for up to 10 square meters is a joke. That's about 3 watts per square foot.

Saying it can replace 3-5 HPS lamps is bogus. Are they talking 1000w HPS or 35w HPS mini bulbs?

While we started primarily in WoW, we span a number of games online including Overwatch, DotA 2, LoL, Minecraft and a number of other smaller games. We're also starting up our own Roll20 RPG campaign with an original story and setting written by our own talented guildies! We stay connected through Discord, our Facebook Group and our guild site, [absolution-guild.com](http://www.absolution-guild.com).
 
**WoWGoals**

In terms of raiding, we raid three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday) from 2200 server to 0030 (Tues/Thurs) or 2100 to 0100 server time (Sundays). Thursday and Sunday are progression raids, Tuesday may either be progression or farming something lower down depending on where we are in the raid cycle. Our main focus for raids will be heroic raiding, however we'll look at mythic if the numbers and the demand is there to support it.

Outside of raids, our goals are to progress through the content including Mythic dungeons, challenge runs and PvP. Basically if it can be done in a group, we'll have a group trying to do it.
 
**Loot and attendance**

Loot's distributed via Loot Council. There's no minimum attendance - we've all got busy lives, jobs, kids, etc. that mean it's not always possible to raid. The only thing we do ask is that you're engaged enough with the game that you'll make a contribution when you can raid and you do the best you can to be competitive.

If Turkey wants to try to take advantage of the situation, we can always block everyone from Turkey, and take in refugees from Lebanon instead. 

3. Erdogan might dictate law in Turkey, but whatever influence he had in the EU was lost in the recent Putsch: And we'll take in all those intellectuals, professors and journalists you (you, Erdogan) just fired or jailed, and we'll give them Visas, and even EU passports when and if we feel like it. 

Erdogan, you're threatening the well being of your own people with a bargain of refugees neither EU nor Turkey wants, and thinking we'll go for the greater good.

Slaves were brought over from Africa because the landowners found that Europeans who they had working on farms in the South would die quickly from mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria. Certain areas in Africa had populations which were predisposed to sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell prevents malaria from affecting the person, thus making them in effect immune to mosquitoes. They effectively became the perfect candidate for workers in the South. But this can only be applied in areas where mosquitoes are most prominent, which corresponds very closely to the Mason Dixon line.

G2 and IMT are largely comparable even if we don't have a great grasp of the relative strength of their regions: both are *very* good teams with consistency issues. However, IMT lost pretty convincingly to TSM last week. Neither G2 nor Splyce have losses like that on their records recently. It is reasonable to worry that IMT's playstyle might not work particularly well against top-tier teams, since the only such team we've seen them play *ever* has beaten them in four games out of five and pretty handily in the most recent ones. RNG has basically the same problem vis-a-vis EDG. The grouping of those four teams in the order they are in makes sense to me; right now, none of them look like they should be as high as TSM or lower than WE.

That said, I'm not convinced by the ranking of KT and SSG, considering one of those teams won't make it to worlds and both can look pretty shaky at times.

That's not what I'm saying. This is probably a bit different in Hong Kong, but if you've been to China, you will know how racist Chinese people are.

America has a huge taxpayer-funded defense budget now which is used to protect the socialists in Europe from powerful capitalist countries that want to take their socialism away from them. It's best not to think about the details and the reasoning. It's the conclusion that matters.

Without the American taxpayer funding the American defense budget, Danish citizens could not have the freedom to use their taxes for socialist universal healthcare because socialist Denmark would have been conquered by capitalist Somalia or maybe Haiti a long time ago. Therefore, Danes must pay their fair share of the U.S. defense budget. Trump will make a deal with them.",,mshelikoff,t1_d60f6md

Read the damn study past the summery and for the love of god, stop trivializing rape by putting together some minor crimes with that horrendous act for fk sake.

You literally say that unwanted kissing in a sexual way, fondling or grabbing sexual body parts; exposing sexual body parts, being made to look at or participate in sexual photos or movies, harassed in a public place - are as worse as rape - THOSE ARE NOT RAPE, ITS ASSAULT

What is rape is: Completed forced penetration; Attempted forced penetration; Completed alcohol/drug facilitated, all these categories are included IN RAPE, you disingenuous newt. You can see that in figure 3 and then again in table 1.

Sweden IS THE RAPE CAPITAL OR EUROPE.

Variant covers are given to comic book stores on a per order basis by the company as an incentive for them to buy more (more variant cover issues and often more variety of variant covers) and as a financial incentive for the store to push a title. 

Most comic book shops pull the variants and sell them at a premium price. Often 3-5 times the normal cover price of the normal comic with the normal cover. That's literally the only reason for variants to exist (except perhaps to get hard core nerds excited about grabbing some hard to find variant for their collection). You wouldn't see the variant cover on the shelf with the regular books because variants are almost always immediately put into plastic bags and displayed where more expensive collectors items go. 

Rucka is a schmuck and I wouldn't be surprised if this entire kerfuffle has been created to simply whip up some free advertising to get more people talking/arguing about it and buying the book. He's taking someone else's art work (in this case Cho's interpretation of what Wonder Woman is) and censoring it because he disagrees with it; when it's on a variant cover and actually has a better chance of being seen now with the drama than it ever did if he had just ignored it and moved on. 

To suggest that an artist can't have their own interpretation of a Super Hero is ridiculous. People have drawn Wonder Woman naked and in porn cartoons and all manner of nasty situations. As long as they have legal license to do so nothing can stop them. Because every artist is entitled to their own vision of the character. Literally the only difference here is that Cho got a paycheck from DC when he turned in his drawing. If he had been drawing them on commission or for free no one would say boo about it. And to me that's what makes the argument dumb. This is about the fact that DC is paying him for the art. That's it. And it shouldn't make a difference what his motivation is. 

Additionally [the tiny difference](http://i65.tinypic.com/n20h0m.png) between what was drawn and what was published is silly. Real women show off far more skin on your average trip to the beach. European women routinely go topless. That's normal, everyday life in the real world and the pose in question hardly looks like a porn pose on a stripper pole. As I understand it her armor is based on the armor of a [Roman Centurian](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f6/10/fe/f610fe6b2ad5de1e56020900aeb3c29d.jpg) but made a bit more feminine. And the men who wore that armor often wore less under it than WW. And when running would probably be mooning anyone behind them. 

Also... Wonder Woman has never been a sexual character? Are you kidding me? Decades of innuendo with Batman and now not only dates but a full on romance with Superman in the new 52. Hell there was an episode of the animated JLU series where Lightray (one of the New Gods) slaps her on the ass and she exclaims ""he's worse than the Flash!"" To imply that Wonder Woman is never portrayed as a sexual being is to live in a world where one rewrites history that does not sustain ones own narrative. And it's ignorant. 

Teach your daughter about sexism. Teach your daughter right and wrong. Teach your daughter about sex. Teach your daughter to be confident and to love herself and others despite all our human failings and she will be a good person whether she grows up to be a stripper or Wonder Woman. 

But you should also teach her about expression and censorship. Because censorship is a cancer that infects everything it touches and ruins artistic expression whenever it touches a work even if the artist is vindicated. Because the very discussion about whether or not the work should be suppressed immediately and irrevocably changes the way it is viewed. ",,remedialrob,t1_d60dfum

The way they found the server was a hacker got into Sid Blumenthals emails and some of his emails were sent to the secret server. If it wasn't for that hacker we the American people wouldn't even know about it. Do you know who Sid Blumenthal is? 

 (from another post of mine) He's a Clinton political insider and adviser that a lot of people remember from the 90's because that's when he gained his reputation for destroying people that crossed the Clintons. One of the more famous victims was Monica Lewinsky. Blumenthal started leaking false information about her like she was a liar and a stalker when the press found out the president was in a sexual relationship with the 22 year old whitehouse employee. He's what you call a ""fixer"" or a ""spin doctor"" or a ""character assassin"". Some of you millennials are probably familiar with Christopher Hitchens. He's the famous atheist and political commentator who used to be friends with Blumenthal but when Blumenthal was caught trying to destroy Lewinsky it really pissed off Hitchens. The more he got to know the Clintons the more he realized just how corrupt they were. He was a very vocal critic of the Clintons until he died in 2011. When Clinton ran against Obama in 2008 Sid Blumenthals skills were once again needed when he put out stories about Obama that he wasn't born in the US or that he was a Muslim. This is the very beginning of the Obama ""birther"" movement. When Clinton and Obama made their deal for her to drop out of the race in exchange for the Secretary of State position Obama was so upset with Blumenthal that he specifically barred Clinton from bringing Blumenthal with her to the State Department. This last detail will come up in the scandal involving Clintons emails.

In 2013 a European hacker announced that he had hacked Sid Blumenthals email and when Blumenthals emails were read it showed he was communicating with a Clinton private email server. Even though Sid Blumenthal didn't have a security clearance and was specifically barred by the State Department he was getting sent classified information from Clinton from a server that wasn't even a government server. These correspondences included sharing information about the military intervention in Libya. When the government demanded the emails Clinton said they didn't exist or that the information wasn't actually classified because the actual email didn't say classified even though the information was classified. Some of the various things Blumenthal was advising Clinton on was where Qaddafi was or where the 7 billion in Libyan gold was located. At this time Blumenthal also worked for Osprey Global Solutions which was a military contractor looking to do business in post Qaddafi Libya with the Libyan rebels. This was also brought up in the emails.

So here we have Sid Blumenthal, who is a Clinton political insider, exchanging emails with our Secretary of State Clinton involving our military intervention in Libya even though he has no security clearance. Needless to say that's completely unacceptable for a Secretary of State to be discussing national security secrets with a private citizen. Especially a private citizen that was specifically barred from the State Department by the President of the United States. What's even more extraordinary is the communications were on a non-government server. That's another unbelievable fact because we the people have always kept a historical record of our national actions. So we demanded those records and she erased them. She said they were gone. She said they were wiped. She robbed us. Why? To hide her actions. When it was discovered some still exist her own staff decided what we got and we still don't have all of them. To make matters worse the private server wasn't secure. The top secret information Clinton was sharing with Sidney Blumenthal was hacked. Clinton's excuse? She removed the words ""Top Secret"" from the emails that way she could say ""They weren't marked Top Secret"" as if the information contained in the emails wasn't top secret.

So now we find out Blumenthal also gets payouts from the Clintons from the ""The Clinton Foundation"". A charity slush fund that foreign powers like Saudi Arabia pay millions into. This is how it works- Saudi Arabia wants an arms deal. An American arms manufacturer does to. So they both put millions into Clintons ""charity"" and later Secretary of State Clinton pushes those arms deals through. Then old Clinton political allies dip into that ""charity"" for money. Big Money. In fact Sid Blumenthal got 10,000 a month from the Clinton Foundation. Even Clintons personal assistant Huma Abedin gets hundreds of thousands from the Clinton Foundation at the same time YOU the tax payer are paying her at the state department.

As this story shows Sid Blumenthal also gets hundreds of thousands of dollars from ""Media Matters"". For those of you that don't know Media Matters is the Clinton propaganda machine funded by none other than George Soros. You think Trump is rich? Soros is worth $24.9 Billion dollars and he uses that wealth to manipulate public opinion in the Clintons favor. Not only does Soros directly fund just under 10% of the entire Media Matters money pot he also funds it in other ways by having his other political action groups donate and partnership with Media Matters. Ever heard of Move On.Org? That's Soros as well. You may have heard of these groups more recently as they were involved in funding some of the violent protests against Trump that were blamed on Bernie supporters. To this day its still a matter of controversy in the Bernie camp just who these violent protesters were but the fact that it hurt both Bernie and Trump should leave little doubt who it benefited the most.

If I made a mistake on any of my observations please point them out. I have no problem making corrections or being proven wrong as I've written some of this down previously. These Clintons are a corrupt political dynasty that uses propaganda and corporate money to destroy their political opponents or anyone else that gets in their way. They have a cabal of insiders who all share in this wealth and power.",,Lonsdaleite,t1_d60jq2h

Rather, one can simply do mathematics constructively, such as with Bishop-style constructivism (BISH). BISH is quite open-ended; there are many propositions which are undecided, and several interesting models which refine BISH. There's classical mathematics (CLASS), where the excluded middle holds, and so looks much like ZFC set theory (or any other formalization of classical mathematics). There's Russian-style constructivism (RUSS), which gives a realizability interpretation, and gives a concrete form that explains in what sense BISH is constructive; terms of a type correspond to computer programs (/recursive functions). Finally, there's Brouwerian intuitionism (INT), where every function is continuous (with respect to the ""right"" topology given on each type). RUSS and INT are called ""anti-classical"" in that they find the law of the excluded middle (LEM) to be false.

So when one works in BISH, one works in CLASS, RUSS, and INT all at once. I think the topological models (INT) justify focusing on continuous functions, since when one works in BISH, it may be that all functions are continuous, and so Banach-Tarski is impossible, as is decomposition into non-measurable sets.

Studying analysis constructively shows that it is in fact classical analysis which is missing the useful results. If one tries to simply ""port"" classical analysis to BISH, there seems to be trouble: Heine-Borel holds in CLASS and INT, but not RUSS, so it is undecided in BISH. Same goes for Tychonoff's theorem.

The solution is to redefine the topological definitions. A topological space is not a set of points with a topology pasted on afterwards; rather, the structure of the space comes first, and the points fall out from the definition of the space. This is the essence of constructive (pointfree) topology, as embodied by locale theory and formal topology. In formal topology, Heine-Borel and Tychonoff simply hold. And because this is all done in a constructive metatheory, the theorems now have constructive teeth! So with Heine-Borel, it is possible to *compute* the maximum of a real-valued continuous function over the unit interval. Compactness is realized as having computable universal quantification.

(Constructive) locale theory shows that classical topology is missing a concept dual to compactness, known as *overtness*. This is a notion that is classically invisible, because classically, all topological spaces are overt.

Even if one wants to work classically, locale theory behaves ""better"" than classical topology in several ways. For instance, the intersection of dense sublocales is dense (compare with classical topology, where for instance the intersection of the rational subspace of reals and irrational subspace is empty).

I highly suggest reading about [Paul Taylor's Abstract Stone Duality](http://www.paultaylor.eu/ASD/analysis) for more information. For instance, Taylor shows how the constructive formulation of the intermediate value theorem constitutes a *root-finding algorithm*, making it worth the small adjustment in this formal statement of its definition.

From the point of view of pointless topology, even the notion of non-measurable sets appears blasphemous, because it seems wrong to consider the points of a space divorced from their topology.

Measure theory, too, changes constructively, again for the better rather than the worse. The notion of sigma-algebras is jettisoned in favor of topologies. A measure maps open sets to real numbers endowed with the lower semi-continuous topology. By using the lower-semicontinuous topology on the real numbers, it is possible to take suprema of measures (this corresponds to directed suprema of points in domain theory). But when one considers the (closed) subspace of probability distributions, there are still strong computational properties. For instance, a probability distribution over a sum space `A + B` naturally allows computing the probability of being in either side.

Using formal topology within BISH, one gets the best of all worlds. In CLASS, the notions of formal topology almost exactly align with those of classical topology, while in RUSS, mathematical theorems are realized as meaningful computation. Yes, it's still true that in CLASS there are ""all"" the real numbers (R is ""spatial""), while in RUSS there are only countably many, the important topological theorems hold regardless of the model.",,bmsherman,t3_4vlbaz

I decided to do an Ironman run as Burgundy and just conquer Europe, and after a few false starts I got a run where I managed to get going. However, I'm really held back by two things right now: Monarch Power and the HRE.

* On one hand, Monarch Power is really getting low. I know all about releasing vassals and ""liberating"" their cores. The problem is, annexing Brittany and Gascony and Aragon and such all takes a lot of diplomatic power. Even when combining this with just regular coring, I find myself often pretty low on both admin and diplo power. I can't blob at an appreciable rate and ALSO keep up with tech and fill out ideas, it seems. Mind you, this is AFTER getting both the Influence cheaper diplo-annex idea and the Administrative cheaper core creation idea. Everything's just so damn expensive. It doesn't help that my monarchs all seem to be absolute dogshit recently.

* On the other hand, the HRE is a giant roadblock. Coring costs are gonna be high, aggressive expansion will be a bitch, and having to fight Austria every time I want to beat up a two province minor seems really annoying (even though I managed to seriously weaken them by getting them to release Hungary in a peace deal). I can't decide whether it's a better idea to vassalise a bunch of electors and try to make myself emperor and annex them all that way (which seems like it'd take a long while, plus completely eats at my diplomatic relation slots) or to try and just dismantle the HRE and eat the small fry one by one (which involves orchestrating a big war against a lot of enemies that also doesn't help with the big AE and monarch point costs). Neither option seems quick, which is unfortunate because from what I understand the other side of the HRE allows for much cheaper blobbing.

So I basically feel stuck building up monarch points for long stretches of peace, and neither my money nor my manpower can help with this bottleneck. If there's any good solutions to this problem, I'd be appreciative if you let me know.",,Glitch-kun,t3_4vqka1

Harry proposes to Ginny that day, by their favorite spot near the Lake on the Hogwarts grounds.  

Harry and Ginny get married at the Burrow, and the whole family has a bit of a time keeping the press out (good thing everyone's gotten pretty good at shielding and concealment charms). Ginny convinces him to invite the Dursleys, and to Harry's eternal shock Dudley attends, and insists on making an awkward speech at the reception about how Harry saved his life and he never deserved it and wishing him all the happiness in the world, in his own very Dudley-ish way. It doesn't make up for everything, but it's something, and paves the way for Christmas Cards and Christmas visits between the Potters and the Dursleys. 

Hermione and Ron get married, now that Hermione is a rising star in the Magical Law world and Ron is raking in buckets of galleons at the shop. Their wedding is a lot more lavish, because Ron can afford to spend it. They still bicker but it's fine, they're in love and they're happy. 

Harry loves being in the field at work, and while is own creative flair and instinct serve him well he's learning a lot. He's hunting Dark Wizards and he's happy. He's married to Ginny, who will soon happily retire from the Holyhead Harpies to have kids and write for Quidditch section of the Daily Prophet. He'll never stop being a celebrity, and his kids will have to deal with the particular burden of being the child of famous people.

1) I personally HATE the term ""backward caste"", ""scheduled caste/tribe"" is a much better term. Imagine if African-Americans were called ""backward race"", how would that sound? 

2) We must survey all Dalit Scientists/CEOs/Entrepreneurs in USA/Europe and publicize about them in media/textbooks. AFAI see in Indian/world media, almost all Indian-origin Noble prize winners and Indian-origin Scientist/CEOs/Entrepreneurs in USA/Europe are Brahmins/upper-castes.

Lets find out who (if any) they are and talk about them.....

&gt;* But if you look closely, you will find some more controversial search results, such as prostitution in Brazil, Ukraine, Hong Kong, and Latvia; slaves in Mauritania; a kidney in Iran; in vitro fertilization in Australia; and rhinoplasty in Korea.

&gt;* Some quirky search results for Europe include Rolexes in Switzerland, mooring a yacht in Monaco, nose jobs in Albania, and flying a MiG (a Russian fighter aircraft) in Russia.

&gt;* The biggest financial concern for people searching about Lebanon appears to be the cost of a PS3; for Kuwait it is Lamborghinis, carpets for Armenia, and watermelons for Japan.

&gt;* Apparently New Zealanders are a frisky lot, with great interest in vasectomies, while their Australian neighbors are concerned about the cost of in vitro fertilization.

Slightly longer answer: A Christian is not a Christian is not a Christian. There are some people like Tim Kaine and Joe Biden and to a lesser extent Obama and Hillary whose religion tells them to ""take care of the least among you"" and see government as a way to do just that.

Others, like Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum, believe in a theocracy where gods laws (as they interpret them) should be the nations laws for the benefit of all mankind.

And then there's Mormons, who generally believe in social justice, social conservativism and theocracy but also have a massive international brotherhood of missionaries in nearly all countries on Earth who do not see Mexicans as rapists nor Middle Easterners as terrorists nor Europeans as regressive leftist terror sympathizers, and are therefore much more likely to be turned off by Trump than turned on.

Then there's also another theory that posits that many evangelicals are not actually, truly evangelical but rather using it as a euphemism to describe... _economically anxious whites_ ... who are much more... liable to agree with Trump on the nature of immigration and non-Judeo-Christians than they are the core tenets of traditional Christianity.",,WorldsOkayestDad,t1_d60nrr2

So that gives us almost 8 billion a year, just like the article states, okay good. But now lets look at the average cost per year for a 4 year degree. According to NCES.ED the average cost to attend a 4 year college is 36k a year... but lets just say we want to pay for tuition so it's more along the lines of 9k a year. How many students do we have right now? 20 million Source, so lets ASSUME this number wont increase because once it becomes free there is no telling how many people are going to be jumping on the bandwagon. 

A couple things, 

All of those costs that you have quoted will be subject to change once the government is the one footing the bill especially since they are the ones running the place. You do realize that this will be only for public institutions? So no way 36k a year will be the average. 

Is your average cost including the actual amount paid by students? Because your source is just the actual cost, not the amount that is paid out of pocket by students. 

https://www.debt.org/students/scholarships-and-grants/

The government already doles out $46 billion in funds each year anyway, and we could even assume that private companies and organizations continue to donate their 3.3 billion for tax purposes. This averages about $5,750 per student at public universities. Subtracting that from your $9,000 hypothetical number assuming massive government cost cutting, you are left with $3,250 a year per student that would have to be made up by them if the government wasn't paying for it. 

This would equal $65 billion a year that would need to be paid out of pocket, ($3,250 * 20M) minus the 49.3 billion that already goes to education in the form of scholarships and grants which gets us down to $15.7 billion dollars that would need to be paid out of pocket by students in the scenario where the average cost of attendance was $9k - $5.75k in funds that already go to aid in tuition, room and board, etc 

Divide that $15.7 B by 243 M taxpayers and you have $64.61 dollars a year per taxpayer, which is nothing. People spend more than that on toilet paper each year to wipe their ass with.

Further still I'm not even suggesting that the average tax payer pay anything extra.

The military budget based on the DoD request is $585B and looks like they plan to stick around that mark for the years to come. http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/FY16-Budget

Decreasing the military budget by a meager 2.6%, ($585B/$15.7B) and every kid could theoretically go to college for free. It's just a matter of priorities and political will.

Just imagine an entire generation of young post-millennials with much higher potential purchasing power than this current generation due to the crippling amounts of debt that are weighing them down and what that would mean for the economy.

We could also implement an alternative path like they have in Europe and help kids identify whether or not the trades would be a better path for them and help to set up institutions which would make those like ITT and their ilk obsolete, and work to fight the negative stigma of the trades.

&gt; WASHINGTON Wary of a global confrontation with Russia, U.S. President Barack Obama must carefully weigh how to respond to what security experts believe was Moscow&amp;#039;s involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party organizations, U.S. officials said.

&gt; Washington also has diplomacy to manage with Russia in Secretary of State John Kerry&amp;#039;s long-shot attempt to enlist Moscow&amp;#039;s help in ending the Syrian civil war and sustaining the Iran nuclear deal, as well as Russia-NATO tensions over Ukraine and Eastern Europe to manage.

&gt; They said the hack was the latest in a series of aggressive moves by Putin, including Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Crimea, military intervention to rescue Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and funding of right-wing and anti-European Union groups in Europe.

&gt;  6 clubs thinking they can get the top 4 places and at least two of them (3 this season) getting hammered by their lack of CL money.

Refers to Chelsea and MU (and Pool as the 3rd) who are ""getting hammered"" by a lack of CL money.


Then, the Spurs' fan:

&gt;The lack of CL money is well offset by the new TV revenue

Opining that those clubs are making up for lost funds by the new TV deal. But that's not how the new deal works; in the areas that the money is not split entirely evenly, it goes by the season's year-end table. Meaning, if you're missing CL or Europe in general, you're probably not finishing high, and thus aren't really earning more than even half of the EPL clubs. [Here's the breakdown.](http://cdn.totalsportek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Premier-League-TV-rights-money-distribution-final-infograph.jpg)

All this to say that it's not even an issue - Liverpool aside. Chelsea and MU have owners with deep pockets, and they can theoretically live without a La Liga-esque TV deal and without CL money. It's just their reputation that takes a hit, which can take a toll in the long run, especially if the owners get sick of it and want to move on.

**tl;dr**: No, the new TV deal isn't adjusting for clubs missing CL. But the clubs with rich owners won't feel the effects anyway, as long as the owners stay committed/invested.",,SharksFanAbroad,t1_d60ppb9

The protests yesterday were specifically against the new mayor, as she has been sworn in for a month or so and she hasn't indicated a counsellor who will have the responsibility for housing problems in Rome. Before Virginia Raggi (the mayor) was elected, Rome had a special commissioner because the previous mayor had resigned, and he decided (the commissioner, that is) to evict several occupied buildings that were previously abandoned and unused and had been squatted - the housing problem is huge in Rome, so the protesters think the new mayor doesn't really care about the issue at all. This is oversimplifying a bit, but hopefully it gives you the general idea.

Trams are running as usual, actually. I was on a couple of them just yesterday, and again on Sunday. Which lines are you interested in? Depending on how long you're staying, you will maybe ""be hit"" by the atrocious summer timetable that began yesterday - there's less buses and trams because the company running the public transport system (ATAC) works on the assumption that since schools and universities will start their courses only in September, everyone is on holiday (most Italians used to get their holidays in August... in the olden days). That was maybe true until the Eighties, but the recession and the changing of the average family (AKA the end of stay at home moms) has made it so that there's much more people staying in the city in August - but ATAC hasn't still gotten with the times. They do need to send their workers on holiday, so there is also that. Anyway: no, trams are still operating. As a matter of fact, the no. 3 line will be re-opened completely on August 8, yay (we've been without most of it for ten years!).

As for your observation, we probably have a completely different experience of the city, but still I find it a bit odd. And for historical reasons, too - if you look around you, shops have mostly, still, English names because at the end of WWII Americans established themselves in the city and being understood was better for business! This is the city where local trains have bilingual announcements  on how to avoid being fined! It’s full of examples out there where it’s shown again and again how Romans try to be welcoming and include the enormous amount of visitors and expats (see for instance in Trastevere where lots of buildings have warnings in English near the buzzers). They get it wrong so many times (I had to laugh at a sign saying “CLOSE” instead of “Closed”, when it’s obvious it wasn’t even needed) but at least they try. This is the only city in western Europe where I've been and found that people try to adapt to the English speaking visitors. I never saw signs aimed at Italian tourists in London, or Paris, or warnings in Italian in Budapest, Amsterdam or Barcelona (all worldwide destinations!). 
If you have specific questions on specific areas of the city I can answer in more detail, and I'm sure other users of this subreddit will have their own views as well!",,lrpttnll,t3_4voe2y

I think Poland is more on the frontier, and feels foreign pressure very similar to the way it happens on Ukraine. The EU had courted Poland a decade before Ukraine, and brought Poland in the super-state. Now the Polish public and politicians are contesting the arrangement, taking into consideration what goes on in Ukraine.

Most of it is theater, like all politics, Poland is not immediately threatened. But the way the EU attempts to quell opposition and manipulate the public, it can backfire into a huge shift in public opinion. It is what happened in the UK. And politicians are taking this opportunity into consideration.

Since the central government of the EU is just another layer of oppression, it would be indeed best for Poland of their politicians accomplish a shift in public opinion. At least enough to pressure the EU to back off their social engineering and economic hegemony plans.",,anon338,t3_4vqg81

&gt; Former European Commission President Jos&amp;eacute; Manuel Barroso&amp;#039;s move to join Goldman Sachs International has set off a furious reaction among some EU politicians and watchers, and generated renewed interest in how to deal with potential conflicts of interest when top Commission officials leave and enter the private sector.

&gt; According to an EU diplomat, the current Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was not told in advance and &amp;quot;Probably [he] was not happy,&amp;quot; but the two men called each other after Barroso&amp;#039;s appointment was announced.

&gt; Barroso is not a banker by profession but as a former president of the Commission he has deep knowledge of and ready access to EU officials, diplomats, and national leaders, which he can tap into to help Goldman Sachs.

You're just pulling figures out of your ass. Even nowadays with all the cuts the average Greek pension [is €882](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/06/26/eurostat-greek-pensions-average-e882/) and prior too the crisis the average retirement age [was 57](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/retirement-age-men). You just can't have a system like western european countries when your revenue looks more like that of your eastern european neighbors. 

&gt;Because at that point dropping the entire debt and just giving QE to germany (that the ECB give them anyway) to make up the difference wouldn't change anything to germany, but would make a world of difference to greece.

And thereby becoming a transfer union and not changing anything about the Greek deficit?

&gt;Oh you mean apart the fact they contributed as an euro member for decades to the european union ?

Would you at least type it into google first before you make such an enormously bullshit comment? 

If you had, you would know that Greece was in fact the highest net receiver of EU funds for the entire decade leading up to the crisis. Compare e.g. [this graphic here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/europe/09/eu_budget_spending/img/graph_net_contrib_466x485.gif) for net contributions in 2007 or [this table here](http://english.eu.dk/en/faq/faq/net_contribution) for the actual figures. 

&gt;And when east germany went in EU funds from all over europe refunded it. But when it's other states suddenly they don't give a crap. Hypocrisy.

Again, total bullshit. Germany has been the highest net contributor to the EU for decades, even through the reunification period. Even today I'm still paying an extra 5.5% on income tax to buff up eastern Germany's pension. No EU money was ever used to finance that and the few projects the EU finance were paid for dozens of times over by our contributions. Are you really asking me to pay for Greek pensions as well? Why stop there? Why not pay for Romanian pensions as well? Those are even lower than in Greece? ",,JFeldhaus,t1_d607e4x

Qu'est ce que tu souhaites avancer ? J'ai bien lu tes liens, si ce que tu souhaites dire c'est que UK n'est pas à l'origine du conflit israélo-palestinien je te répondrais oui et non. UK a eu sa part de responsabilité, mais dans un contexte bien sûr très particulier. Une période entre les deux guerres, avec les Etats-Unis complètement désintéressées par ce qui pouvait se passer en Allemagne, une Allemagne qui reprenait de la puissance et se montrait menaçante avec sa politique intérieure, l'émergence du nationalisme un peu partout en Europe et en Asie (notamment en Inde), la Grande Dépression, l'après guerre etc ... Seul UK a choisi de s'occuper de ces sujets diplomatiques et géopolitiques. Pour battre les turcs, les britanniques avaient promis des terres arabes aux .. arabes. Mais aussi pour calmer les mouvements pro-sionistes au Royaume Uni et aux Etats-Unis, la moitié de la Palestine a été promise aux juifs qui souhaitait se rendre sur les terres sacrées. Puis est arrivé le Nazisme qui a complètement tout chamboulé. 

L'enfer est pavé de bonnes intentions, et ici ce principe est démontré. Avec du recul, UK aurait pu mieux faire bien sûr, comme tout le monde. Mais leur gestion de ce dossier a été globalement terrible, ils ont surestimé leur capacité à fédérer des dossiers à l'étranger et notamment au Moyen Orient. Conséquence de cela : Des arabes qui s’entre-tuent car ils veulent leurs terres promises, Israël détestée par tous ses voisins, une Palestine entièrement colonisée  et réduite en poussière, des atteintes graves aux droits de l'Homme de la part des Israéliens en Palestine etc etc...

Donc est-ce que UK est à l'origine de ce conflit ? Non bien sûr, mais ils l'ont influencé grandement. Doit-on les tenir pour seuls responsables ? Je ne pense pas, mais il est légitime que les autorités palestiniennes souhaitent au moins en discuter devant un tribunal. Je reste persuadé qu'avant tout, tous les efforts doivent être mis vers la Paix entre les deux nations. Cela calmera les tensions entre les pays arabes. Je rêve qu'un jour, les deux gouvernements travaillent main dans la main et soient de forts alliés qui puissent assurer la stabilité du moyen-orient (tout comme la France et l'Allemagne gèrent le dossier européen si j'ose faire cette analogie).",,AbdulElAzir,t1_d60e1lt

The series however was just ridiculous. Weird clumsy shields for the Saxons, a fantasy sword sheathed on the back (despite Uthred's swords being so prominent in the books), fur and leather bikergear everywhere, and all the Norse are psychopaths despite this being firmly in the era where they'd would be proper settlers rather than Vikings.

No, it's relevant to your statement that ""Democracy comes from the idea that all people are equal and inalienable rights"", which I pointed out is simply historically false.

&gt;Yes but what?

I wasn't presenting any lies, the automatic admission of new citizens is determined by ethnicity, even if the ethnicity of pre-existent citizens doesn't matter, same way it works in Israel, I said to highlight your own lie that Israel must be the only country in which this system is practiced.

&gt;Does Finland have a large native population that has no rights, lives under apartheid and is slowly ethnically cleansed?

Can you please name a single book or encylopedia entry that you've ever read about Israel, please? Getting a brochure form your university BDS rally doesn't count. Israel doesn't have any citizens who have no rights or live under apartheid.

&gt;... And also a large population of non-citizens who are not immigrats yet have no rights in their land. 

A large population of non-citizens under military occupation, yes. Yet what your originall said was that having a state for one ethnic group means others are second-class citizens at best, which isn't true, because Arab-Israelis, Druze and so forth are not ethnic Jews, and are not ""second-class"" citizens.

&gt;And do not forget the refugees who cannot return to property that they were forcefully expelled from

First of all, only a minority of Palestinian refugees were forcefully expelled, and secondly, the right of return for refugees is back to a country, not to property. Since most Palestinian refugees actually come from areas which were not under Israeli sovereignty at the time, but rather part of the proposed Arab state, their right of return is to Palestine, not to Israel.

&gt; while any Jew from anywhere in the world will automatically get citizenship.

Yes, that's how Jus Sanguinis works, ethnic Jews can get a citizenship for the Jewish state, ethnic Finns can get a citizenship for the Finnish state.

Listen up, you arrogant hypocrite. If you and all the rest of your colonialist offspring get the fuck out of America right now, the remaining native american would eventually repopulate and exercise their right over their land again.

What is really important here then is that alchemy was usually *esoteric* knowledge. Meaning NOT written in scientific notation in plain English (or Latin or whatever)... it was obfuscated with code, secret language like the ""green dragon"" or ""peacock's tail"" for specific compounds and steps in the process.

Meaning inflation was understood and feared by monarchs (or at least their governments) it was never really a fear that alchemy would become common place--that everyone would be doing it.

It cost money to make money. The alchemical process is *expensive*. Nobleman and up could do it. Perhaps monks. But peasants could rarely claim to be serious alchemists through their words/works alone. They'd need a lab to back it up at some point.
And now: alchemy was illegal throughout most of Europe for most of history (Prague around 1600 being a great exception, where alchemy flourished, for instance, or the Arab world, where it was seen as just another science and studied openly)...point is you can't just *hide a lab*. 

And then it was honestly believed (by some) that it was esoteric by nature: it was divine knowledge--even if you knew the recipe it'd only work if you actually had God's will. (meaning you had to be righteous and couldn't be greedy enough to cause inflation anyway).

That's Europe. The answer to your question is ""that's why it was illegal"" ..but in China, or the Arab world gold was seen to have medicinal value (like potable gold could be the elixir of life... really all the same thing) and therefore ""good enough fakes"" would still have medicinal value! So it was a way to socialize medicine and care for the poor! ...but that wasn't the European way (I'm thinking more of Al-Ghazali or Ge Hung if you want to do more reading on that though).",,bemonk,t1_d60i5m8

I mean, holy shit, the BBC made a fantastic documentary called ""the world at war"" in the 1970s that addresses this point - yes the anti-communist British state broadcaster in the middle of the cold war was more factually correct on soviet history than most Western understanding is in 2016.

Stalin mistrusted Western spies telling him Germany was about to invade for a few very good reasons. 

1) He was aware that wars had broken out between neighbouring countries just a few decades earlier as a direct result of amassing armies on borders. There was a very real and recent historical precedent of this. He deliberately made sure that his armies were not amassing on the border in order to not provoke Germany into war.

2) He had previously offered 1 million red army soldiers to France for the defence of Europe against Nazi aggression. His offer was snubbed. 

3) The West had, in the great war, encouraged the Tsar to send millions of Russian troops to their death fighting the Germans in order to protect Western interests.

With this in mind Stalin realised that, firstly, the West could not be trusted, secondly, the West had an historical precedent of getting the Russians to do the fighting for them, and thirdly, building troops on the border had an historical precedent of provoking war. Fourthly, the Japan was aggressively expanding Westwards, and the soviets felt the need to keep many of their soldiers posted in Eastern Russia in order to defend against potential Japanese invasion.

The soviets absolutely did not like or trust Hitler at any point in time; as evidenced by Ribbontrop's behaviour on his visit to Germany. Ribbontrop was so mistrusting of the Nazis that everything he ate was first taste tested to make sure it wasn't poisoned.

Stalin knew that there would be a war, as far back as the late 20s he was writing about a second ""imperialist war."" He invaded Poland and Finland for the purpose of having a ""buffer zone"" between the USSR and Germany, even proclaiming that there would be no blood shed on Russian soil - not something you'd do if you weren't expecting to be attacked. Russia was not caught ""entirely"" off guard, but they did severely underestimate the speed and aggression with which the Germans would attack, the organisation of their army, and the German tactics; resulting in over a million soviet troops surrendering in the opening weeks of the war. It wasn't until the winter that they pulled troops from Eastern Russia to fight against the German advance towards Moscow and were able to turn the tide against the Germans. ",,landaaan,t1_d60lxmo

I would agree that Cowspiracy is biased, and that some of it's figures are disputed - most notably the 51% of all greenhouse gasses being attributed to animal agriculture. Most reputable and non-controversial sources put total GHG emissions from animal agriculture at 14.5-18% (and I personally wish that Cowspiracy hadn't emphasised the Worldwatch Institute's 51% figure quite as much....). However, what appears to not be disputed at all is that the GHG impact of animal ag exceeds the entire transport industry - which is put at 13%. One of the most important things that I think the film did was show how none of the environmental groups were talking about this. Not Greenpeace, not Oceana, nor the Sierra club. Greenpeace recently tweeted that if the world ate a vegan diet we would reduce food related GHG's by 70%. 

Additionally, one of the things that Cowspiracy did do is put this issue into the general public consciousness, raising awareness, and in turn putting more pressure on policymakers to take these issues into account and hopefully in future to start trying to tackle the myriad of problems we are currently facing, a lot of which are in no small part linked to how we feed the world - the world as we run it is unsustainable, and we are facing crunch time. At the end of last year the film was shown in the EU Parliament, alongside 7 talks by guest speakers from environmental groups and scientists alike. No small feat, and hopefully something that will have a tangible impact.

Around here, if you show more white traits, even a smaller or pointier nose, you already are more deserving of things, from what I was told. You feel that you have more choices and opportunities, which sounds weird.

Only in university I got close to other black people and one girl was super cynic and negative for always pointing out a ""us against them"" attitude. It was in university that I was made conscious of this kind of mindset and honestly, felt like an outsider for the first time. I hated it.

If you look at quality, peer reviewed, comprehensive studies, it's not mixed at all.

Again, it's not the religion that's driving medical science, but a consistent and large pools of data. Also, infant circumcision isn't ""justified' on health benefits alone. The medical benefits only make it more difficult for people who want to take away that parental right. I think it should be a legal right of the parents even if there were no health benefits.

&gt;the sole tissue that is the exception to the general rule of respect afforded the human body in its naturally occurring state.

First of all i don't believe it's the sole exception. But even if it was, i don't have a problem with that. General rule means a rule with exceptions. You don't believe in the general rule, you believe in the absolute rule .That's the problem.

&gt;We've actually never studied the health benefits of removing folds of the female genitalia under the same sanitary conditions under which we examine male circumcision.** That's my point.

Nor should we. Conducting studies like this would be a waste of time and money. In order for it to be advantageous, benefits would have to be observed in the real world, not based on a theory.

&gt;Society has a sexist double standard when it comes to cutting genitals.

Yes. There's a double standard because there's two different standards, female genitalia and male genitalia.

&gt;Interestingly, one of the authors of the AAP's 2012 statement on circumcision all but admitted this year that one of his motivations for the study was to maintain circumcision as a parental right.

One of the reasons the AAP put together a task force to study infant circumcision was because of attempts  by some Europeans to ban the procedure. The AAP was trying to demonstrate that even if you oppose circumcision, a state ban would do more harm than good. The best way to bring a better understand of circumcision, both ethically and medically, is to provide parents with non biased and factual information.

&gt;However, a couple studies have shown an inverse relationship between female circumcision and HIV.

You have gone back and forth between female circumcision and labiaplasty when you stated ""I did not bring up female circumcision"". Again, for the third time. Do you believe female circumcision causes medical harm? or are you not sure?

mainly the article has two points.  1) for somone like yogi ferrall it was better being not getting drafted by a good team like the spurs.  This allowed him to get to try out and make the nets that gave him a guaranteed money.

2) if you are drafted 50th or lower the nba team is likely to either A) convince you to play over seas which means you are not in the nba which sucks.  or B) really try to negotiate a very team friendly contract with you that doesn't guarantee you a lot of money.  

so i mean the guy is right this is basically the nba just being cheap.  they should obvious pay late 2nd round picks and undrafted players more than they do.  

That said the article didn't really convince A) why this is a big problem for NBA teams.  I mean if an NBA team drafts someone over a better player because that better player is willing to sign in Europe, thats their own damn fault for being cheap and missing out on a better player.   


i do think his solution to have like 3-4 slots a year that nba teams allowed to pay d leagues a couple hundred gs is a good a idea.

Nei prossimi 3 anni verranno stanziati 6 miliardi di credito dedicati all'agroalimentare. Risorse  che permetteranno nei prossimi anni 10 miliardi investimenti e creeranno, si stima, 70mila posti di lavoro. 
Fino a qualche tempo fa c’era chi pensava all'agricoltura come a un retaggio del passato. Ma noi sappiamo bene che non è così; è, invece, un settore strategico della nostra economia, dove emergono le qualità, le capacità, l’identità stessa del nostro paese, del nostro territorio, anche nel mondo. Pensate al cibo, al food, settore in cui l’Italia non ha rivali sul pianeta. È una parte importante del presente dell’Italia e dell’impegno del nostro Governo e lo sarà sempre di più in futuro: per questo abbiamo deciso, ad esempio, di cambiare il nome del ministero guidato da Maurizio Martina che da ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali prenderà il nome di Ministero dell’Agroalimentare.
Non è, insomma, un lavoro che iniziamo oggi, contiamo già numeri importanti e abbiamo ottenuto risultati incoraggianti, grazie anche allo straordinario volano costituito da Expo. Ricordate? Soltanto un anno fa non ci credeva nessuno. Non ce la farete mai, ci dicevano. Sembravamo marziani in visita in una landa desolata nei sopralluoghi prima della partenza. Scandali, scetticismo. Oggi l’Expo di Milano è studiato nel mondo come una case history di successo, simbolo della capacità di fare e realizzare tutta italiana, in una città che ha riscoperto la propria bellezza come Milano.
Il 2015 è stato l’anno in cui abbiamo battuto il record delle esportazioni dell’agroalimentare: 36 miliardi di euro, oltre ad aver riconquistato il primato mondiale – con buona pace dei nostri amici francesi - di produzione vinicola. Nella primi 6 mesi del 2015 il Pil agricolo in Italia è aumentato del 6%, creando 20mila nuovi occupati, in particolare tra i giovani. Nei primi 10 mesi del 2015 nel settore agroalimentare sono nate 53mila nuove imprese. Abbiamo speso il 98% dei fondi europei nello sviluppo rurale.
Anche in questa legge di stabilità abbiamo inserito molte misure per il rilancio del settore: via Imu e Irap dai terreni agricoli, innanzitutto. Per capirci, con l’eliminazione di queste due imposte gli agricoltori risparmieranno 600 milioni. Abbiamo Istituito un fondo di 45 milioni per la sicurezza dei macchinari agricoli, aumentato le compensazioni Iva per la produzione di latte e sulle carni bovine e suine. Abbiamo previsto di estendere gli sgravi per le assunzioni a tutele crescenti nel settore agricolo ed esteso il credito d’imposta per gli investimenti produttivi anche all'agricoltura e alla pesca nel Mezzogiorno. Rifinanziato il programma triennale di pesca e acquacultura, oltre al rifinanziamento della cassa integrazione della pesca.
Potrei continuare: abbiamo istituito il registro unico dei controlli, riconvertiti in agricoltura 5.500 ettari di terre pubbliche. Abbiamo promosso un disegno di legge di lotta al caporalato. Inasprita la lotta all’agropirateria sul web con già più di 500 azioni legali a tutela del made in Italy, grazie ad accordi - unici al mondo - con Ebay e Alibaba. Con il progetto Sprecozero ci siamo posti l’obiettivo di  recuperare 1 milione di tonnellate di cibo nel 2016, il tema fondamentale dello spreco alimentare, in linea con l’idea una società più sana, più consapevole, più sobria, più responsabile. 
Non provvedimenti spot slegati tra loro, ma una idea d’insieme per il futuro dell’Italia. Dove qualità, sostenibilità, tradizione, impresa, lavoro, in particolare al Sud e per i giovani, stanno insieme in una visione per il futuro del Paese.",,stomcarlo,t3_4jklz3

No it's not. It's for the UK. Why would we give a fuck how long it takes the EU to get over it?

The most optimistic projections say we can be fully divorced and set up with our own trade deals by the end of the initial 2 year article 50 process. [David Davis is one of the people to have suggested this](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-13/david-davis-named-brexit-czar-in-u-k-prime-minister-may-s-team)

At the other end of the scale. the most cautious and conservative estimates I've seen were publishied by the government in a document called [""The process of withdrawing from the European Union""](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503908/54538_EU_Series_No2_Accessible.pdf), published earlier this year. That document stated:

&gt; It could lead up to a decade or more of *uncertainty*

That's uncertainty though, and if you read the report that assumes that all negotiations have been done and dusted, article 50 triggered, extra time given if the other 27 members agree and the whole deal is finalised. All that within a decade the government at the time reckoned, but with the prospect of uncertainty carrying on for a while longer. 

Worth bearing in mind the report also concluded:

&gt; The compelling case for staying in a reformed EU. 

So the document was hardly unbiased. 

And secondly also worth noting that the document was further updated, [May 2016](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldeucom/138/138.pdf) and the projections revised as follows:

&gt; The length of negotiations for agreements between the EU and non-EU countries ran from four to nine
years. The length of agreements between two non-EU countries ran from just under four years to just under 10.



Then somewhere in the middle of the most conservative estimates and the most optimistic, our current chancellor, reckons [about 6 years](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/12/brexit-could-take-up-to-six-years-to-complete-says-philip-hammond)

So again, I've shown you the evidence and references on which I base my opinions. If you want to convince me ""it will not be for a generation"" or ""It will literally be decades"" then you have to show me what you're basing that opinion on? 

So far I've seen nothing along those lines. Not whilst I was part of the leave campaign before the referendum and not since the result either. ",,[deleted],t1_d60u5dp

If not caught before Stage 3, you might as well as not do chemo and just relax for the last days of your life. The problem with AML is that its typical population is people in the ages of 45+. Cancer is a disease of age and since it is simply genetic mutations we increase the likelihood of forming something malignant. AML originates in the Bone Marrow which allows it to go throughout the body because the cancer cells are going throughout the bloodstream. Remission often occurs due to another tumor site forming. One of the hallmark characteristics of cancer is its ability to sustain nutrients and spread throughout the body. AML is one of the fastest progressing cancers. AML affects production of healthy red blood cells(carry oxygen) and white blood cells(fight infection); there is a life cycle for both RBCs and WBCs and the body retains immature RBCs and WBCs which can proliferate into RBCs and WBCs when needed like an infection will cause in an increase of WBCs. AML hijacks this process, which is why people with AML suffer from infections; similar to how AIDS does not directly kill you but an infection will kill you due a deficient immune system caused by the onset of AIDS. 

I am not an oncologist; I am simply a licensed clinical lab scientist with studies in Hematology where we went over case studies on Leukemias; so this is simply my view point. If this was me and I was in the late stages of AML, I would go on a trip or spend the last days with the people I love. I worked in a pharmacy with several cancer patients and it was sad to see the change of someone in a few months. A patient I know was diagnosed in August, so his daughter started to be his caregiver. The daughter and him would sometimes come in together and she said she wanted to go on a trip to Europe with his father. He always said next month. He was on some narcotics for the pain, so I would check in my database when he last picked it up. It has not been updated since December so likely he has deceased. Cancer or any serious illness does not solely affect the individual; it affects your loved ones. Just something I consider whether it is worth to go through the chemo and all mental anguish I would be putting to my loved ones, for a cancer type that presently has such a low success rate.

The money the ECB is using for that is 'just made' by writing it into the ECB balance sheet. Now creation of money should push the value of every singular unit of currency down - the governments issue debt also not willynilly, but to spend the money. So that additional money goes into the economy e.g. by paying road builders.  Effects like these is what the ECB is hoping for and why they do this (some say it'S direct government financing by the central banks printing press, which is outruled, really).

But the thing is - instead of seeing inflation jump up from these measures to the befuddlement of the ECB inflation has been quite listless.

So the hot question is indeed: Where is the inflation?

Some say all the additional money is going into things that the inflation measurement indicators don't capture typically, like buying stock and real estate. These prices have exploded in some parts. CPI inflation looks at things like bread and milk. Thanks to the flood of captial all these goods are produced in abandunce. With coal iron ore oil and steel in fact so much there are supply gluts. - Which subdues price inflation down the chain of things made from these.

My personal impression is that everyone is a tiny bit freaked by ZIRP and NIRP, that the just passed great recession as well as the wage cuts seen in general, and the rise of insecure employment (zero hour and monthly rolling contracts and that bs) make them rather uptight with their hard earned money, instead of having them consume happily, although in some parts of Europe people do consume on a several-year-high.",,[deleted],t1_d609yid

Wir hatten seit Ewigkeiten keinen Krieg in Europa. Und bis vor nicht all zu langer Zeit sah zB die Freihandelszone über den ganzen Kontinent als unschlagbar coole Sache aus. Warum kriegen wir nichts mehr gebacken?

Die EU - und demokratisch-bürokratische Organisationen im Allgemeinen - waren noch nie gut darin, Probleme schnell zu lösen. An dem Max Weber-Ausspruch von den dicken Brettern ist schon viel Wahres dran.

Dazu kommt, dass eine ganze Reihe von Problemen ohnehin nicht dauerhaft lösbar sind - das Thema ""Gesundheitsreform"" steht zum Beispiel seit ich irgendwann Anfang der 90er zum ersten Mal Nachrichten gesehen habe auf der Agenda. Auf Grund der sich ändernden Grundvoraussetzungen *kann* in solchen Bereichen jede Lösung nur ein begrenztes MHD haben, nach dem das Problem eben erneut angegangen werden muss. Das liegt aber in der Natur der Sache und hat nichts mit einem Politikversagen zu tun.

Jetzt mal zu deinen konkreten Punkten: 

*Staatsschuldenkrise?
Nicht gebannt, aber viele Staaten haben sich einen harten Sparkurs verordnet - ob diese Austerität die richtige Wahl war, ist eine andere Frage, aber dass dort nichts passiert ist, ist eine harte Übertreibung. Man hat etwas ausprobiert und evaluiert nun, in wie fern das was gebracht hat.

*Euro-Fehlkonstruktion? 
Nicht lösbar. Vor allem nicht von Deutschland aus - da wir bei einer Euro-Abwicklung die großen Leidtragenden wären. Eine Auflösung der Euro-Zone müsste von den Einzelstaaten ausgehen, die unter dem aktuellen Konstrukt am meisten leiden...

*""Verfassungskrise"" der EU? Wozu ist die EU heute eigentlich gut? Wann kann man die Kommissare direkt wählen?
Warum sollte man Kommissare direkt wählen können. Direktwahl einzelner Minister gibt es, so viel ich weiß, in keinem halbwegs bedeutsamen demokratisch verfassten Land der Welt.",,knifetrader,t1_d60t78w

After a couple of days of research and shopping, it came down to the Mazda 3 or a 2013 bmw 328i. I chose the Mazda 3 because it is reliable, not a money sink, feels good and it looks incredibly sleek. At my budget I could have gotten a camaro or a mustang, but imo those cars look tacky and scream ""I'm in middle school and love hot wheels"". The new Honda looks too futuristic. The Mazda 3 sedan is sophisticated, it looks chic, it looks sleek but most importantly: it is an elegant machine. It was the perfect car and I feel like it represents who I am very well: A young professional making his way up the ladder. I love everything about it. The exterior is a total head turner (people try to see what brand of car is it, I've been told it looks like an European luxury car and it definitely has BMW and Audi vibes to it) and the interior + sound system are so good that people are always impressed when they get inside it. Its really above other cars in its class.

Key part of the article here. The EU, NATO, and the ""West"" view Ukraine like they view any other potential ally / client state - what is the cost? what are the benefits? How long are we willing to support them for?

In the same way China's socialism of legal entities helps make the USA, and Europe live as anything, but the exploited serfs they are.

(Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will on Tuesday outline her bid to reshape the British economy for a post-Brexit world, reviving the once unfashionable concept of industrial policy **30 years after Margaret Thatcher killed it off.**

May will chair the first meeting of the ""Cabinet Committee on Economy and Industrial Strategy"" in her Downing Street Offices, bringing together the heads of 11 other ministries to set out her vision for a state-boosted industrial renaissance.

""If we are to take advantages of the opportunities presented by Brexit, we need to have our whole economy firing,"" May said ahead of the meeting in a statement released by her office.

""We also need a plan to drive growth up and down the country – from rural areas to our great cities.""

After a referendum campaign that revealed dissatisfaction in many of Britain's struggling post-industrial regions, May is pitching a plan to reunite the country by raising the prospects of those who she casts as ""hard-working people"".

The June 23 vote to leave the European Union has raised serious questions about the future of the world's fifth largest economy, with some surveys indicating a recession, a hit to consumer confidence and a possible fall in investment.

""We need a proper industrial strategy that focuses on improving productivity, rewarding hard-working people with higher wages and creating more opportunities for young people so that, whatever their background, they go as far as their talents will take them,"" May said ahead of the meeting.

The challenge is to find a formula that arrests a decades-long decline in Britain's manufacturing sector by helping firms tackle the challenges posed by globalisation without blunting the market forces that make them competitive.

She will make a priority of developing the industries already based in Britain - a push that could help carmakers like Jaguar Land Rover, GM-owned Vauxhall and Nissan, and aerospace industry leaders like BAE Systems to weather the Brexit storm.

The strategy will also involve finding new ways to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on the services sector, and ensure wealth is distributed away from the prosperous south east of England.

Whilst policy detail is scarce, the strategy is likely to combine state-backed investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and rail with funding for modern essentials like broadband and lower energy costs, along with a push to train more of the highly-skilled workers industry says it needs.

Luckily the mainstream sentiment in Western Europe is far from that.

Also there were no ""Western"" yet Allies at that point, there were Allies that is the United Nations, including the USSR. Read up on the basis of modern postwar world.

Right now, if you can do your work with just an Internet connection, you can live anywhere you fancy in England or Europe.  It's possible that more and more people embrace this sort of living arrangement and start to shop around for the city that will give them the best deal for things like setting up a start-up or ease of buying a property.

No, in other words if you want to assert points of fact you're the one who has to support them with evidence. Its not my job to make your argument for you. This is a pretty basic facet of even informal internet arguments.

&gt;Nice spelling of the city.

Yes, I misspelled a word. You know what that means? You're ready to start being a combative person in this discussion. I smell it coming.

&gt;Dear god, you truly have no sense of humanity/collectivism in you. So long as you can keep your high moral ground, you won't criticize any culture on old traditions?

I never said anything about not judging or even engaging with them, but what right does any culture have to intervene in another one, particularly militarily, in order to impose their values on them?

Cultural superiority is a feature of imperialism and has a history of being bloodier than when things are left alone. I take it you think we should just invade the middle east and secularize them or something? The lesson of Iran should be enough to make us realize this is folly.

A society is up to itself to improve. Historically the intervention of western forces into other societies has been to destabilize them away from focusing on improving themselves because a powerful healthy democratic modern society is hard to get to kowtow to you ala Iran or Nicaragua or Chile.

&gt;It is when thousands die afterwards and some enact invasive spying upon their their entire nation as a response.

If you're referring to our own domestic policies that have overreached into invasion of privacy and a limiting of due process that's not an existential threat originating in the terrorists, its a threat originating with our own society.

These are distinct issues. You don't blame the terrorists for the opportunism of your own corrupt leaders. You ultimately blame your own society for permitting it. It has nothing to do with justifying the policies that have reached into the muslim world since 9/11.

&gt;Oh is it that so easy to fix is it?

Why would assume that's what I said? The point is that we spent 40ish years turning around on the progress that was made in the decades before. Its not easy but its necessary and takes a long time, so we better start sooner rather than later lest we get into a truly sticky political situation at home.

&gt;It's never, ever, that easy you halfwit.

You see, I told you I smelt the combative persona coming. You're beginning to do that thing that frustrated people do when they find themselves inadequate in the discussion. You're attacking me the person rather than my arguments and you're even in this case misinterpreting my statements in order to find a way to be rude and dismissive.

Nothing about this is easy, but its essential if the average person wants their nice western lifestyle to be there in a generation or two without it being further diminished.

&gt;It's far more complicated than fixing ""greed"" itself.

I don't recall saying anything about greed or just fixing that base flaw in our character and our society. I recall suggesting we need to avoid letting ourselves go down the path where extremism is desired as it was in the 30s in Germany. You're putting words in my mouth now.

&gt;I really didn't want this to devolve into insulting, but you are clearly of the PC crowd that knows no boundaries beyond the social justice crusades that amount to nothing

But you chose to let it because you decided that I was of a particular view point that isn't deserving of basic respect. That's apparently your character flaw, that you're incapable of being polite to a civilized person you disagree with.

Now you're throwing labels at me and assuming I have a shuttered view point etc etc. You're preparing yourself for a departure from the discussion and you need to guard your pride by making me into an unworthy idiot.

&gt;I'm done. I can't argue.

Before I even got past the first sentence of this reply I knew you were going to flee by the end. I also agree with you, you can't argue. You aren't much good at discussing things that are important with people you don't agree with which makes your existing views questionable in their value to you.

&gt;Keep hiding in your fucking hole while Europe turns intolerant and the Muslim world stays 500 years behind everyone else.

Are you telling me that its the responsibility of the European world to civilize the muslim world and drag it forward into the future?",,monsantobreath,t1_d60qd7d

That's *complete*. Done and dusted, left, au revoir, auf wiedersehen pal. 

Are you trying to suggest that somehow we would need to do that 50 times over? Because you're certainly being deliberately obtuse if that's what you expect people to believe. 

However, with flair like ""pro EU"" that wouldn't surprise me. It's been over a month now since you were told we're leaving, isn't it about time you come to terms with it and stop stamping your little feet?

Il primo riguarda la Grecia, un paese che é in una condizione economica e sociale molto difficile. Gli incontri di domani dovranno indicare una via definitiva per risolvere questa emergenza.
Il secondo - ancora più affascinante e complesso, ma non più rinviabile - é il cantiere dell'Europa. Da mesi stiamo insistendo per discutere non solo di austerity e bilanci, ma di crescita, infrastrutture, politiche comuni sulla migrazione, innovazione, ambiente. In una parola: politica, non solo parametri. Valori, non solo numeri.
Se restiamo fermi, prigionieri di regolamenti e burocrazie, l'Europa è finita.

I had thought the EU was a seperate government made up of ambassadors from each member country and votes on laws. But I guess I was way off and it turns out Germany's Merkel is the leader of all of europe.

I've asked my euro friends about it and they say it's because Germany is the richest in the EU but why does that matter? Is the EU not about equality? The richest member tells everyone else what to do and how to live? Is Germany more equal than others?

The EU reminds me of the Holy Roman Empire. ",,Satouros,t1_d60tih3

&gt;Vai, saracii de noi, ca trebuie sa stam sa ascultam capriciile si mofturilor programatorilor care se dau drept boieri si o fac doar ca sa ne supere pe noi"". 

Asta ajuta si la pictarea unei imagini nedrepte a programatorilor catre 'oamenii de rand', care nu lucreaza in domeniu. Acum, am si eu oameni in organizatie care abia se descurca, care actioneaza ca si capusele, care devin frustrati cand trebuie sa lucreze si care raman in pozitia in care sunt doar prin circumstante necunoscute. Insa asta ar trebui sa fie exceptia, nu norma.

É necessário estudar os resultados financeiros divulgados pela empresa (análise fundamentalista) afim de descobrir se aquela empresa está sendo bem administrada ou se está, apesar do valor aparentemente alto da ação, num rumo ruim e com lucros em queda. 

Outra alternativa seria estudar o gráfico do valor da cotação (análise técnica) afim de encontrar certos padrões frequentes e comprar a ação num momento oportuno. 

De qualquer maneira você tem de investigar aquele papel (antigamente ações eram vendidas em papel) para descobrir se ele é uma (boa compra). Não há maneira de eu te garantir que um papel seja bom e te indicar a compra (e se não me engano eu estaria cometendo um crime, pois não sou analista certificado pela CVM). 

Pois bem, uma coisa que posso te dizer é que o valor das cotações da Nintendo aumentou depois do sucesso do ~~pô, que mongo~~ Pokémon Go. Quem comprou antes correu o risco de acreditar que aquele produto novo íris fazer sucesso. E fez. Mas poderia muito bem ter sido um fracasso. 

Você pode apostar no sucesso de um produto novo, de um presidente novo na empresa, de uma nova lei que pode vir a beneficiar aquela empresa, de um presidente que vai intervir mais nesse ou naquele setor, etc. São muitos eventos que podem prejudicar ou favorecer a empresa. E, como eu disse, descobrir quais são bons vai depender do seu nível de investigação e conhecimento de mercado. 

Dito isso, te recomendo comprar as ações Pai Rico Pai Pobre, A Árvore do Dinheiro (Jurandir Macedo Jr) e Análise Técnica dos mercados financeiros.

Currently we get a lot more out of the EU than we put in when it comes to science funding.

Well its still shit, because EU funding is what matters because it allows for collaborations between countries, and with the UK out of the EU all of the EU funded collaborative projects are off limits. That's *terrible*, that means that any projects lead by teams in EU countries are not going to be accessible to UK scientists. 

Basically UK scientists will have to apply for UK money and then hope the UK government allows for collaborative works with none UK countries, which means the UK effectively sending science money abroad....

Improvements to current headphones - Currently using Solo2. Thinking about getting Solo2 Wireless but the Solo2 hurts my ears a little bit. The way it pushes onto the edges of my ears is a bit sharp, after an hour it becomes a little bit painful. So I'm looking for alternatives, preferably not obscure brands so that I can check them out in the store before buying. 

Preferably with pause/skip function on the headphones and volume control that works with Android but the latter is not super important. 

I'm also open to ""open ear"" but maybe that's a bit too big or inconvenient or silly looking for walking around outside in the city center. Not sure about pros vs cons.

Thanks :)",,twinmatrix,t3_4vrvqk

Also consider future proofing, the 1070 is significantly more powerful than the 1060, even if you stay with 1080p the 1070 will last longer than the 1060. Plus should you ever decide to switch to 1440p within the next 1-2 years, you'll be set with the 1070, but required to buy a new card with the 1060.

Regarding the case, feel free to check out the Nanoxia, I love it, it looks very similar to the Fractal R5, has no window and is a silent case for just 69€

But the cartels have generally got **A Lot** more money than the average citizen so.... 

Similar things were true in the Balkans before they joined the EU. 

I just posted this video more to talk about how I thought it was interesting how a whole semi-city arose without any official urban planing, or licensing, or anything. there's an interesting an-capistan  angle to this story.

But also, the local people also established their own local associations and council (so, a protoo-municipal government). I guess people will always associate like that. maybe? ",,stolt,t1_d60vwdk

Donc la pub et la force du marketing des groupes commerciaux n'y est pour rien ? 

Mais tu as soulève une différence très notable. 

Je vais plus loin : des changements culturels issus de population (nombreuses) qui'vivent sur place ne sont ils pas plus logiques et acceptable que des changements culturels totalement exogènes ?

And who said that? No one. Neither in the article or on that thread. So no need to cast doubt on something nobody claimed.

I think it is pretty obvious that the rules of the institution is what matters and not on which level it applies.


&gt; Why do you think that his statements implies he believes that national governments are exempt?

&gt; The European commission does it again. What a cesspool of corruption. You know what would fix that? Consolidating even more power from national governments into their hands. /s

He is opposing national government and comission and saying that the comission is heavely corrupt while he doesn't about national government. That seems pretty easy to read between lines.

&gt;I think his sarcasm is more focused on the weird belief that somehow  centralized power will have more integrity than the sum of the integrity of all national governments.

It doesn't mean anything. Integrity is a concept, it is abstract. You can't add it and making sum of it.",,nic027,t1_d60v7da

The 2016 presidential primaries provide a great deal of evidence that this is the way things are going. Bernie Sanders, who had a very class-based message, lost the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton and this was mostly due to her strength with black voters. Meanwhile, Trump won the Republican nomination based largely on identitarian themes, easily beating out opponents who danced to the old Republican song of fiscal conservatism and limited government. We can see similar trends in Europe what with Brexit and the rise of nationalist parties.

I can't promise that this trend will continue for the next fifty years, of course, but I do think we can expect identitarianism to dominate politics for the next several years at least. In this climate, class conflict will be given a backseat to racial identity politics. If you look at how quickly ""Occupy Wall Street"" fell apart and compare that to how well ""Black Lives Matter"" has stayed together, I don't think it can be denied that we're going in a ""race beats class"" direction. Thus, I expect any changes to the economic system in the near future will be driven by technological changes rather than by social movements.",,Bob9999999999999,t3_4vhrj7

Regardez le beau côté des choses et non le plus sombre. Essayez de laisser ce monde un peu meilleur qu'il ne l'était quand vous y êtes venus et quand l'heure de la mort approchera, vous pourrez mourir heureux en pensant que vous n'avez pas perdu votre temps et que vous avez fait « de votre mieux ».

Bernie was against TPP and Hillary shifted gears to be against TPP as well (we'll see if she maintains that if she wins in Nov).

Also, there are some Democrats who don't agree with an assault weapons ban, mainly those from rural states. Doesn't make them conservatives by default.

Does anyone honestly think Hillary is going to open US borders to immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa à la Europe?

&gt;“My intention was that it should be a classic safety valve that was there, but never used. It is like having a fire extinguisher that should never have to be used. Instead, the fire happened.”

Just a thought but that seems very irresponsible. The EU isn't a unitary state (yet) so not having adequate provisions for a member state to leave doesn't quite sit right for me. I mean if we follow his analogy through, once the fire has happened, if that fire extinguisher doesn't work than someone's head would roll.

But anyway, articles like this are quietly encouraging but I think if May sets a date for setting it, we'll know we're leaving since to go past it without triggering A.50 would be suicide for her. Unfortunately, and I might be wrong here but hasn't she vaguely set the date for January 2017? So this delaying tactic will be dead in the water come Feb 1st?

Mind you not like Clinton has bailed on a debate she had promised to do... wait... she did?

Clinton is in the lead, they suffered at the DNC why risk difficult questions like

1. There are many accusation against your husband that he raped women and you indimidated them

2. You lied about the FBI

3. You say you believe 'No one is too big to fail' yet you appear to be 'Too big to jail'

4. Why did you oppose gay marriage for so long?

5. You have made racist comments, and your husband has defended them. Do you want to bring black people to heel?

6. You claim to want to help the poor, yet you insist on dressing in suits costing more than some Americans get in a month

So that's one way in which they are connected. Our culture would also be completely different without the influence of the Asians and Carribeans that helped rebuild our country after WW2. Also, to use a more contemporary example, Eastern European immigrants have higher levels of employment, and far lower levels of use of public services such as healthcare and welfare than native Brits, so they essentially 'pay into' these services far more than they take out. So its not unreasonable to speculate that these services would suffer without the contribution of these migrant workers. Of course, this may not be true of Sweden, I don't know enough about it to say, but I do know that Scandinavian countries generally have very stringent laws regarding work visas for immigrants, so I imagine that their cost in providing public services to unemployed migrants is even lower than the UK.

My point though is that generally how open-minded and tolerant (or 'politically-correct' if you prefer) a society is is almost always positively correlated with how its citizens are treated. Which makes a lot of intuitive sense but somewhat deflates the ""immigrants = bad"" argument that almost all of Reddit sadly seems to buy into. Immigrants are not the problem.

&gt; 

it would be completely spurious, and just plain, not relevant to the story of the favela. 

&gt; Brazil started shipping massive amounts of housing resources to the middle of nowhere to make a political city, there was also coincidentally a massive boom in irregular housing?

Favelas in latin america are generally much older than brasilia (or the brazilian housing boom). They are generally a purvasive feature of the region, and they exist in wealthy cities and in poor ones, in booming economies (like Brazil), and in flopping ones (like venezuela). So, no, I don't see that this general, region-wide trend has anything to do one specific housing boom in one specific region, in one specific latin american country, during one specific decade. 

&gt; It doesn't change the fact that they would have built far better structures had the country not sank into keynesian lunacy.

Oh, I dunno about that. We can always speculate about what **would have been**. I live in europe, and we do a lot of ""would have been"" around here. but usually ""would have been"" ends up with both sides saying ""whelp.... your guess is as good as mine"". 

Also, as a guy who lives in europe, I can just say that OUR ""keynesian lunacy"" doesn't look anything like that of brazil. It looks more like rail networks and autobahnen, and ports, connecting everything, while internal trade barriers are systemically done away with. Also, in terms of urban planing, there was the big emphasis of quantity of quality to rebuild everything right after the war. SO we have lots of towns with infrastructure that is ugly and functional once you leave the glitzy 500-year old tourist zones.

Taking important steps like reassuring immigrants they are valued while Tories and Labour are caught up in party politics, for example. A lot of my friends here have commented that we would happily vote SNP if it fielded candidates here, as you stand up for a lot of the values we in northern England (and perhaps Cornwall etc too) share..

Could you ever see a way in which SNP could put up candidates in rUK, either under its own banner or as part of a broader progressive movement, such that there might be a greater representation against London-centric policy in Parliament? And if so, how would you see such a movement happening? Do you think SNP would ever rename into something broader for example - it seems there is a chance here to become a party that stands for much more than Scottish independence/Scottish interests.... or is this just misplaced hope by a disillusioned Englishman?",,alexbfree,t3_4vrm06

I've been longing for a semi-realistic WW2 shooter for a while now, and as a big fan of INS, this game was like a godsend for me. Playing on Eu servers with 250ms ping but I'm still having plenty fun and would gladly pay the R200 again.

Just hoping that we (south africans) will get our own playerbase and servers going in due time! Incredibly fun game if you like INS and WW2.",,nekowaiidesu,t1_d609pea

It's currently 13th in the Uefa coefficient behind Switzerland and the Czech Republic. It's also very easy to score there, seeing 30+ goals a season from a player is not a rare sight.

Let's have a look at the last top scorers from the Eredivisie and how they did afterwards. 

Last season it was Vincent Janssen with 27 goals, moved to Tottenham for €22m, considerably less than Milik. Still remains to be seen how he will do.

14/15 it was Depay, he went to Man United for €34m. Huge disappointment, 2 goals and 1 assist in 29 games.

13/14 Alfred Finnbogason scored 29 goals. Moved to Real Sociedad for €8m the following season where he scored 2 goals and 1 assist in 25 games.

12/13 Wilfired Bony scored 31 goals. Went to Swansea for 14m, had an impressive first season with 17 goals, 11 goals in his second season and 4 goals last season.

11/12 Bas Dost scored 32 goals. Moved to Wolfsburg for 7m and scored 8 goals in his debut season, 4 goals the season after that, then 16 (thanks to de Bruyne who broke the record for assists in the Bundesliga that season) and then 8 again.

The last player from the Eredivisie who really took off afterwards was Luis Suarez, who basically tore the league apart with 35 goals at age 23.

€35m makes Milik the most expensive transfer ever from the Eredivisie and his stats aren't even extraordinary for the league. At age 20 he didn't make it at Leverkusen and was sold to Ajax. 
Milik is talented, sure, but if Napoli want to replace Hugain with him, I think they are in for a huge disappointment.

As for who else would have been available, there's a few options. 
If you you're looking for raw talent, there was Embolo. He had good stats in a comparable league (even better if you go by the Uefa coefficient), is 3 years younger and was 13m cheaper. 

Chelsea signed Batshuayi for €39m (probably would have been cheaper for a non PL side). He has similar stats (slightly weaker) as Milik in a much stronger league and is a little younger.

Considering they are looking to replace a 29 year old, I don't think age should matter too much. Mario Gomez scored 26 in Turkey last season (not a strong league but still stronger than the Netherlands) and 2 at the European Championship. He just turned 31 but he's also probably more or less for free. 

Those are some players who were definitely available. Maybe Lacazette would have been an option, we don't know. I'm not saying the others are necessarily better than him. All I'm saying is that Milik for €35m seems slightly absurd right now. Maybe he's going to prove me wrong, I certainly wouldn't mind.

He lost his starting spot due to injury and by the time he was fit again the whole saga was in full swing.

And I meant that people considered him not good enough even for Porto. I'm aware that Porto are a great side, but they'd struggle to make the top 30 in Europe (at least this current iteration would).",,ekky137,t1_d60z3zg

After the succession laws had went elective during Charlemange's rule France stuff decided to become Francia stuff. and Later i've mounted enough land to succeed the kingdom of Frisia. Lets say a lot of people wanted to go dependent after some time and Frisia, Burgundy and Auquitaine popped out with a little bit of player intervention.

Aside from myself Burgundy was the next biggest thing in the european theatre as well.. everything was so bordergore there only stood 4 kings of europe. the three french ones and well... Lombards because lombards. It is about the year 903 My King Bradley has passed

Anyway this was all good done and said. Welcome Rule new King Marcus of Frisia, you are now 14 years of age and you have an attractive, and quick betrothed princess of Burgundy. You are strong, and also quick.

For the first two years of regency which wasn't really all that bad because my marshal was regent, a kind, content, humble guy he was, everything in a vassal you'd wish for whom which was 24 at that time and also the duke of brabant. This dude was a bro the entire lifetime of Marcus.
I also had the Archbishop of Gelre
And for money purposes i had a republic of holland.
And a duke Walter of Koln.
At the age of 16 I had the traits brave, and just, with wroth, charitable, and zealous.

The vikings. Constant assaults on the shorelines of Flanders made it hard to move anywhere, not that i'd want to but i had my sites on England as it's still broken and no where close to being united. spoil alert did not get england.
I was about to start attacking the dukes of broken france, but vikings. these bastards where everywhere along the channel. this non-stop assaults. i had repelled all the invasions, the prestige grew, the peity grew.
I AM GALAHAD!
got money from the pope.
My god, Marcus is just amazing so far, i had this title at the age of 21. As my earlier years my focus was business i wanted a little more stewardship so why not. random hedge maze even happened. got so many more prestige. didn't really care for gardening though, but then the tower even happened. got that quarry right away and became an architect. by far one of my favourites.

these damned vikings keep attacking me... slay a few raid. pope gives me money. slay invaders invaders. stop an invasion on my shores. pope gives me money. the normal viking things.
 awesome, asked pope for more money, pope gives me lots of money. did it again right away more money yay.

My land was by far the most developed at the age of 33 at the end of 922. the only thing that was keeping me from upgrading my castle anymore was the lack of research so lets do learning. great, built an observatory. I sat there for a while fighting off these darn raiders and developing my kingdom for a few more years. 

The findings had started, publish, i need the research i need to tech, i need to get better castles. Pope doesn't like this, he takes my title. Galahad no more! this is a sad day, but i'm happy to have had that as long as i did. The pope becomes stress.

Marcus is pushing 50 now, with 1 son, who is, quick and strong, and is now 15 years of age. and 3 one died young to illness, however two ended up to be married off towards burgundy and auquitaine for alliances.

I take hunting, surely i would get the dog. My dude is awesome and i'd rather not have his rule end to soon, as i do want normandy at least before he goes. I was given a dog by a my Preist.
Faithful
Hunter
Tricky
Lucifer

Well... LUCIFER IT IS!! This will be my last laugh to you pope for insulting me continuously after discovering the truth about this world.

3 years later the pope dies of severe stress. what have i done!

I finally clean up normandy, Marcus is now 92. and it is 982 of january. i have my family focus on, my son has two sons, and my kingdom is rich, powerful, and the vikings are no more as they've converted to the armies of burgundy.

And I have duchies normand brittany the main duchies of Frisia, and i got Koln and luxembourg.

*Explicit*  
  
THRAWN!! We go back to Day 2 of Star Wars Celebration Europe to discuss Thrawn's glorious return!
We also cover official word on some Rogue One cameos, the much debated rumor of a Han Solo trilogy, the possible future of a live-action Star Wars TV show, and then we go as far off topic as possible.  
  
Hokey Religion is two guys talking about Star Wars. The films, Dengar's medical bills, you name it. Hokey Religion covers the theories, happenings, and excitement concerning the Star Wars world.

Well, last elections, it was Erdogan who stirred up fear, attacked political parties and journalists. It is that side that pushing the country into that sort of situations.

&gt; Ludwig Schulz, a Turkey expert at the German Orient Foundation in Berlin, confirmed that many of Germany's Turks saw the failure of the coup as a victory for Turkish society and democracy.

It was, Erdogans opponents even opposed the coup. And then Erdogan made it a loss.

And for all the idiots standing in a Polish street [""if this is a police state sign me up""](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4vmd65/people_cheering_for_the_police_thanking_for_a/d5zwc4c), go to Turkey, and do the same. 

This is not to say that Poland is as bad off, it is to say that repression *is not loud*, it is about *silencing people*. And force is not the only way, look at how few big media corporations there are, and how biased they are. Who they^\* choose to interview, what they cover.

Thinking populist racism was the driving force of why the majority in the largest voting turnout in recent times vored leave is nonsense.
Over 70% turned out to vote.
More than a general election! 

Half of those who chose to leave did it over the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK

A third said it was about having control of its borders.
Which still does not scream racism, as it was no particular race that people were worried about. This is Europe we are talking about. Made up from every race.

The news who loved a bit of scaremongering are who are owned by corporations who faced losing a lot of money had Britain left certainly claimed it was racism, but only someone who has no actual knowledge of the situation would believe what they hear in the news hook line and sinker.

&gt; To explain why the UK voted to leave the European Union, commentators have zeroed in on four potential reasons: fear of immigrants, voter dissatisfaction with a weak economy or the status quo, loss of national autonomy, and age.

None of which reasons for why the UK voted Leave and no sensible commentators have argued that these reasons have any validity. 

He then goes on about how young people don't care about the NHS:

&gt; The older members of society want more of the increasingly expensive medical treatments that extend their lives, whereas the young are on average healthier and they resist paying for large health systems or seeking out health insurance. 

Which again isn't correct. And went on to say contradictory stuff like this:

&gt; There is no doubt that taking control back from the EU was a part of the Brexit campaign... But according to surveys, average Brits did not see the EU as the main threat to their nation.

As if the EU had to be the main threat to be a threat!

If the author had spoken to a few Leave voters then perhaps the article wouldn't have so heavily demonstrated ignorance of their views. ",,DevilishRogue,t1_d60zpq1

I recently finished a linguistics/folklore book called ""The One-Eyed God: Odin and the Indo-Germanic Mannerbund"" where the author, Kris Kershaw, puts forth a theory that early Indo-European cultures had a complex warrior-youth initiation rite that involved (among other things) weapons dances. Kershaw briefly says that morris dancing is a remnant of that, but that the route is convoluted and it's millennia removed from that origin. 

I think folklorist (even serious ones), love finding continuities or counterparts so much that they sometimes overstate their case while (usually) still meaning well. It's clear to a scholarly reader that Kershaw thinks even our earliest Medieval morris dancing is about as ""pagan"" as Santa Clause in 2016. Is there a term for something that is both hidden under layers of etymology and research, but still largely superficial? I don't think there is, and that's a nuance that many people who hear this sort of thing seem to miss, thus creating terrible memes on Facebook. ",,spark-a-dark,t3_4vq1n4

You also don't seem to realize something very important:

https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/lone_actor_attacks_-_recent_developments.pdf

&gt; Although IS has claimed responsibility for the latest attacks, none of the four attacks seem to
have been planned, logistically supported, or executed directly by IS, according to the
information available at Europol. The allegiance pledge by the perpetrators of the Orlando,
Magnaville and Würzburg attacks indicates they were IS supporters but their actual
involvement in the group cannot be established. Moreover, there is currently no evidence to
suggest that the Nice attacker considered himself a member of IS.

You aren't going to stop these people short of completely blacking out the internet to prevent their access to ISIS (and other extremist) propaganda. You'd need complete state control of the Internet, Media, and religious organizations to achieve your goal.

It is kind of scary you don't realize that and think shutting down a couple mosques is going to work.

No it isn't.  Blanket statements are a threat to western values.  Don't you remember only the sith deal in absolutes?  

&gt; And if I have to choose one or the other I will always choose western values.  

It should clue you in that your argument is a strawman when you offer a choice that never actually happens in real life.  What imaginary world do you live in where you have to choose between some monolithic thing called ""Islam"" and some monolithic thing called ""western values""?  

&gt; Europe let in people to help them and what is happening? Attacks all over the place.   

are you referring to the recent wave of refugees? Because they are not the ones carrying out 99% of attacks. You don't get to claim Europe tried to ""help"" someone and then scapegoat them for something someone else is doing, too.

Yeah, that's exactly what I said. Oh, no, wait I didn't. I just highlighted how the intentions behind the killings might, maybe, in some way help understand if they are equally as horrible, or if one is more horrific.

Which it fucking is.

&gt; I don't know why you're still defending one form of collectivism whist condemning another.

Can you not read? 

&gt; both of these things are bad

If I'm defending anything, it's the sensible position that **they both suck** but Nazism is worse than Communism on account of the actual genocide. Stating this is not the same as defending Communism, nor does identifying one as being worse somehow make the other okay. This isn't black and white. It is perfectly possible to criticise both ideologies, while recognising that one is more horrific (which it is).
