Ele pode ser um porco preconceituoso, conservador, manipulador e gastadeiro, mas deixar esse atual governo com o pão, a manteiga e a faca se mostrou algo extremamente perigoso. Problemas na Petrobrás, por exemplo, podem ter começado lá nos anos do FHC ou de Getúlio Vargas, mas os valores sendo discutidos atualmente são sem precedentes.

Nada contra a Dilma, mas ela não tem força política para controlar a ala questionável do PT. Eu sinceramente acho que a solução para o sistema presidencialista seria ter sempre alguém **neutro** (ideal) ou em oposição ao Presidente da República como presidente da Câmara porque evita abusos.

Pelo menos o ânimo da população não está muito bom para tolerar esse tipo de desperdício e eu acredito que o Eduardo Cunha deve estar testando os limites dele com esses projetos. Dificilmente essa idéia sai do papel.

*The US.* While there would definitely be hangups over the death penalty, guns, food safety, etc. the big issues would be structural. The US is pretty protective of its sovereignty and Congress has about a snowball's chance in hell of ever allowing a foreign body to make laws for it. Even more fundamentally, the US has roughly *three times* the population of Germany and roughly a third of the new Super EU and would have an incredibly lopsided effect on any EU lawmaking. Then you have the numbers; the largest economy in a ""European"" Union being located entirely in the Americas (except for a few military bases) would be very odd, and the idea of fusing 45% of the world's GDP and half of its military spending into one alliance would give /r/conspiracy an aneurysm - doubly so if the US insisted on including Israel. Before '08, the political and values differences would have been a bigger barrier, but the erasure of George W. Bush from the history books and the rise of ultra-neoliberal politics, as well as the dubious human rights record of full EU member Hungary and the dubious economic regulation in Estonia have made that look foolish.

Ok, that's the issue. I'm in the US where things work entirely differently apparently due to corporate greed and whatnot. Everything you've said is pretty much how it works here; except my provider happens to use a G.984 GPON setup shared among 16 users max (although the subscriber rate was over-estimated and most lines sit idle). I've read docs about Google Fiber using more dense multiplexing to give each customer their own set of wavelengths. Fiber demarcs at an ONT mounted to the side of the house; a PTSN-like connection to internal VOIP gateway, Cat5E for data and coax which provides TV and data if you don't have that Cat5E going outside. You got an upstream signal, downstream signal, and RF-over-glass providing cable. I seem to recall Verizon looked at how they were doing things in Europe when they developed how they were going to run FiOS. In MDU, they will also go with a VDSL2 for data; sticking the DSLAM inside the building.

The switchover from copper to fiber hasn't been a smooth transition here. While yes, more and more of older customers are getting internet (my step-grandfather for example is 85 and has a fiber service); there is a percentage of the population that don't have a computer and are on a fixed income. When they get forced on to fiber from the copper lines; their costs go way up, plus the companies have been known for selling confusing packages they don't need or will ever utilize.

My last comment about getting in a world of shit for cutting off the copper plant only applies to companies that offered a telephone service to begin with; Verizon started out life basically in the landline business...and their fiber service operates as a replacement to it; so they're not allowed to cut a copper plant off. Plus, as I said, part of the confusion is my comments are solely based on how things have happened here in the US; where it's not so broadband friendly...especially when the cable companies are doing everything they can to stop fiber deployment.",,1,False,False,cp0dz9a,False,1427510875,t1_cp087qe,0,networking,1,t5_2qkaf,1425170641,,,t1_cp0dz9a,0
EagleFly_5,0,t3_2xht0l,"In this alt history, it goes as if Germany won WW1 around 1919 or 1920, and then the Entente nations (UK, France), experience Syndicalist revolutions (their play in Communism), so the Royal Family (with George V, and eventually Edward VIII becomes king due to no controversies unlike our timeline), of the UK flee to Canada, and the French (now a presidential dictatorship under (Philippe Pétain) and Maurice Janin), flee to North Africa. The peace deal was costly for everyone in the long run.
Italy is split into two, a Papal government (dictatorship sort of) in Rome (decisions can change it to Florence), and a Syndicalist government in Naples. 

Spain and Portugal are nearly the same (Spain has its monarchy under Alfonso, but he won't last for long), and Portugal has its dictatorship under Salazar.

When Germany won WW1, it had new conquests, like the former nation of Belgium (now called Flanders-Wallonia), Ukraine, the United Baltic Duchy, Lithuania, and White Ruthenia all with German puppet rulers. It also took a piece of France for war spoils.

Austria-Hungary, after the war, was on the verge of civil war, so the nation decided to ""decentralize"" and the Ausgleich issue is at hand (the player will have a chance at 1937, 1947, and 1957 to either keep the status quo, try to unite KuK, or form a all new Danubian Federation). Austria has its former lands puppeted, and Hungary has Croatia puppeted. Austria also directly owns Montenegro

Romania fell to national populist rebels, and is under the rule of Corneliu Codreanu, and Horia Sima. Bulgaria under Tsar Boris III took more land from Greece and Serbia, and is a powerhouse in the Balkans. Unfortunately, Serbia and Greece took the short stick of the war, as Serbia is reduced to a shell of its former self under Petar Bojovic, the hero of Serbia, until it can be decided (by the player or AI to guide the creation of Yugoslavia). Greece is also dealing with right wing sympathies, with Ionnis Metaxas.

Russia, after it left the war, just like in real life, had the civil war between the whites and communists. The communists had the upper hand at this point, and Germany, now finished with the Weltkrieg, sent help to squash the rebellion. Unfortunately that didn't stop other states from leaving, such as the Don-Kuban Union, Georgia (with a Syndicalist government), Armenia (has close ties with the Ottomans), Azerbaijan, Alash Orda, Turkestan, and Transamur (where former White Russian admiral Aleksander Kolchak has power, under Japanese supervision). Mongolia, under the helm of Mad Baron von Sternberg, who fled to Mongolia to establish a empire, seized a few territories around Lake Bakial in Russia, as well as Tannu Tuva. It's leader by 1936 is Kerensky, but there's a 4 way power grab between the Syndicalists, Grand Duke Dimitri (a false claimer to the Russian throne, where he can eventually invite the real claimer to the throne, Kiril), General Wrangel (who can make a dictatorship, or remake the Russian empire under his own name or the remaining Romanovs), a democracy, or have General Denkin establish a military dictatorship.

Scandinavia is nearly the same as in real life, with Norway possibly going into Syndicalism in 1936, with influence from the Union of Britain, and it has a chance to make Scandinavia. Sweden is ruled by the king, and is a right wing government. Finland has a right wing government as well.

The Ottomans after the war are still in decline, with the Sultan in his chair. He has to deal with increasing Arab nationalism, a very envious Egypt; Kurdish uprisings, and to regain spotlight in the world.

That's a superb reason to avoid the Gulf States. However, there are countless more reasons why daily life in the Gulf is hell.

Qatar, as with other Gulf States, is 50 C in the summer, has a atrociously poorly designed, car-first urban ""design"" (it's not really designed at all), and has the highest vehicle mortality rate in the world. This means you can't walk anywhere (too hot, too far), so the only way to avoid death by cabin fever in your compound is to risk your life on the roads. 

My wife and I played a game we called ""smash hit of the day."" The title was awarded to the first freshly mangled car wreck we saw each day. Fender benders did not qualify, because nearly every car is banged up. Only crashes sure to have severely injured, maimed or slain people were awarded. It was rare to go past noon before seeing the day's winner.

Now, some people may enjoy playing a real-life video game on the roads against others who try to run you off the road if you so much as pass them, but compare spending all your time doing this rather than walking and enjoying sidewalk cafés as you would in many other parts of the world.

-----------

So, for fun there is nothing to do but sit in your compound or drive to the mall you've seen every fucking day already. If it's a Westerners-only compound you can enjoy the pool and have an overpriced beer (if you don't live in Saudi or one of the more conservative Emirates). But most compounds are mixed, requiring modest dress and no visible alcohol, under pains of arrest.

However, the Internet is slow, expensive, unreliable, and censored unless you use a VPN. 

----------

Socially, you can forget about dating. Bring a spouse with you (no boyfriends or girlfriends allowed) or count on remaining single your entire time if you're a straight male. The gender ratio is about 75% male to 25% female in the country, because almost all expat workers save for some Filipino service and domestic workers are male. Local females have arranged marriages to their cousins and don't date.

If you're gay - or even if you're not - you may get propositioned at some point for gay sex. But it's illegal, and you risk arrest.

---------

The pay for expats used to be quite good. Someone making $65k at home might make $100k tax-free, with housing provided and a subsidized car lease. That gap has been shrinking, however, and these days is likely comparable to home but with fewer taxes.

Also, your pay - for doing the exact same job - depends on your nationality. The pay scale generally goes Locals &gt; Gulf Arabs &gt; white Europeans / North Americans / Aussies &gt; richer Asian nationalities&gt; Turks &gt; non-Gulf Arabs &gt; Filipinos &gt; Indonesians &gt; camel dung &gt; Nepalese/Pakistanis/Indians. A Westerner might make 10 times that of an Indian doing the same job.

Many Western expats take advantage of this situation, hiring cheap drivers, nannies, maids, and such. I sometimes hired a driver and I'll admit it feels nice to pretend being obscenely rich on a middle-class wage. But, I'm not white and the institutionalized racism meant I got treated like trash everywhere I went outside of my home. Also, my conscience ached for all the poor souls literally dying in the heat around me. 

From a social perspective, it's tough making friends with people from other backgrounds because of the economic and social barriers.

-------------

The world has many great cities and countries to live and work. I loved my brief time in Hong Kong, for example. If you're moving a great distance for work, you may as well try to live in one of the places you'll love, rather than some hell-on-earth.

Did the Americans or Russians ever treat a friendly nation, an ally, in the same way Germany is treating Greece and Spain? Perpetually extending their crises so they can then offer them space to breathe in exchange for another all-holes-allowed economic gangbang? This is unprecedented. America in particular could be extremely vindictive and violent towards nations that rejected its authority, but within their realm they clearly believed that as the 'leader of the free world' they had certain responsibilities. See: The Marshall Plan, the protection of the Kurds after the Gulf War, their crucial role in the Northern Ireland peace process, the current operations in Ukraine and against ISIS, lobbying Germany on behalf of their erstwhile NATO ally Greece, and so on. They're even using the ISIS crisis to pressure Baghdad into cutting down on anti-Sunni sectarianism. The USSR was similar - they pumped money into Eastern Europe to the extent that countries which were once on the same economic tier as Bolivia are now richer and more developed than Russia itself, their intervention in the Yom Kippur war basically forced the US to order Israel to the negotiating table, their Afghan proxies forced gender equality on a highly conservative society. In both cases these good acts were overshadowed by a backdrop of extreme violence and imperialism but in Germany's case all I see is self-interest. It's as if their chancellor is a highly complex AI algorithm designed to maximise German profits. There is no moral component. Where is Merkel in Iraq, or in Palestine, or in Kurdistan?

&gt;__Endorphins__ (""__endo__genous mo__rphin__e"") are [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) [opioid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid) inhibitory [neuropeptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide). They are produced by the [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system) and [pituitary gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland). The term implies a [pharmacological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology) activity (analogous to the activity of the [corticosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticosteroid) category of biochemicals) as opposed to a specific chemical formulation. It consists of two parts: *endo-* and *-orphin*; these are short forms of the words *endogenous* and *morphine,* intended to mean ""a [morphine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphine)-like substance originating from within the body"".  The class of endorphin compounds includes [α-endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-endorphin), [β-endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-endorphin), [γ-endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-endorphin), [α-neo-endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-neo-endorphin), and [β-neo-endorphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-neo-endorphin). The principle function of endorphins is to inhibit the transmission of [pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain) signals; they may also produce a feeling of [euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria) very similar to that produced by other [opioids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioids).

SirAwesomely,0,t3_2xhw7o,"Okay.  19 year old Canadian who joined at 18 here.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but the Legion is not at all what you think it is, and from your post, I can tell you with about 95% certainty that you will desert if you somehow manage to get in.  But I'll answer all your questions anyway because I'm bored as fuck.

1 - No, any income you make here is taxed by the French government, and has nothing to do with America.

2 - You're about as likely to die as any other soldier.  I mean yeah, there's danger on external missions obviously, but western armies are so good at war these days we almost never lose anybody.  Honestly you're more likely to die from one of your idiot squadmates accidentally shooting you than anything else (almost happened to me once).

3 - Basic training is 90% mental.  You spend a whole night in a wet, cold hole in the ground, staring out into the darkness in search of attackers that never come.  Then you march back into camp, eat a tiny piece of bread in 30 seconds for breakfast, stand in formation a while, then run around a building with your rifle above your head for half an hour because someone slept on guard duty last night.  Lunch time now, 2 minutes to eat some pasta and an apple.  Now you have french lessons, only you're so tired you literally have to keep slapping yourself to stay awake.  Now it's dinner time.  Same shit as lunch, but only one minute now because the same guy who slept on guard duty slept in french class.  You're tired, pissed off, and hungry.  You haven't even fired a real rifle yet.  And now the NCO is telling you that you're going to spend all night ironing your uniforms.  Rinse and repeat for 4 months.  

4 - Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  Oh god.  OK, seriously though, you'll get laughed out of the recruiters office if you say that.  I play ARMA myself...personally, I have to say it is far from realistic.  More realistic than Call of Duty maybe, but no amount of ARMA will prepare you for the military, much less the legion.  First of all, 90% of the time you are either waiting around or cleaning something.  Second of all, going anywhere with a rifle and a heavy backpack full of shit fucking sucks.  In ARMA you don't have to convince yourself to keep going up that hill even though your pack is heavy as fuck and your leg hurts like hell.  Third, there are numerous unrealistic mechanics in ARMA.  The guns are too accurate, everyone has a personal radio, the guns never jam and nothing ever malfunctions, gunshots are not deafeningly loud, and you are still able to fight after being shot once.  Its not realistic.

5 - Yes you will be harassed.  You are new, young, and American.  Bad combination.  There is a support system, it's called ""Pack your bags and run back home"".

6 - You might be allowed a phone call once or twice, but normally it's 4 months, during the basic training.

7 - For the first 4 months, 0 downtime.  Afterwards, most weekends and weekdays after 6 PM, excluding missions, exercises and guard duty.

8 - Unless you pick a good specialty, outside of security work, there really isn't anything you are qualified to do after the Legion.  If you're looking for a nice future stay at home.  You won't find it here.

9 - Depends.  You learn a lot faster when you're constantly punished for not understanding.  After 4 months you should understand enough to not fuck up constantly.  If you're really set on joining, take my advice and start learning right now.  Right fucking now.  It really helps to have the basics down before you get here.

10 - Everyone can ask for whatever regiment they want, but only the best actually go where they want.

11 -  See #3.

12 - Your Kepi, parade uniform, and medals.  Anything else you were issued must be returned.

13 - You have to serve longer than 5 years with a good service record to have the chance of getting citizenship.  Even then you may or may not get it right away.

14 - You normally take leave with the rest of your company, so if you have enough time to fly home and back, sure, why not.  Officially, you have to ask permission, but honestly, just don't be stupid and tell anybody.

15 - Officially you're not allowed to post photos on the Internet, but nobody fucking cares enough to check so everyone does exactly that.  Nobody cares about journals either.

16 - New recruits aren't allowed hair.  After a year or so you're allowed a little hair, I'll be damned if I know what styles though.  Honestly your hair style is the last thing you should be worrying about.

17 - Plenty of room here.  Way too many people like you, with stars in their eyes, set on becoming commandos.  They all run off sooner or later.

18 - Yeah you can bring your knife, you won't see it until after basic though.

19 - Yes, you will get treated like shit for being young and American.  I know from experience...most people don't see a difference between Americans and Canadians.  A lot of the people here have hard pasts, and at least 60% are from eastern Europe.  They usually don't like Americans.  I didn't join for adventure and I still got treated like shit for being North American...if that's your reason for joining you'll be scrubbing toilets for months. 

So there.  Answered all your questions.  If you somehow still think the legion is for you, by all means, come on over.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.  I'm still bored as fuck.",,8,False,False,cp0hhvk,False,1427512515,t3_2xhw7o,0,FrenchForeignLegion,8,t5_2vl4a,1425178551,,,t1_cp0hhvk,0

But you can tell a Roma in Berlin immediately when they are pulling a scam. They pretend to be deaf and want you to sign a petition, or they ask people if they speak English and give you a piece of paper with a sob story written on it.

Europe is racist, for sure, but there are some people who fight to overcome that racism and work their way into society, and then there are thousands of Roma who make their living scamming people. That's the reality of the situation. 

I understand that it must be difficult as a Roma to leave that culture behind, and they definitely face racism, but that is the case for all non-whites in Europe. But there is nothing stopping them from integrating in European society, except pressure from their own people.

Basically, Europe can be racist, but it's worth fighting through that racism to become somewhat integrated. Roma don't seem to be interested in integrating in any sense. And if you come from that culture and want to integrate, there is no support network for you, unlike with Asians and Turks, who not only integrated, but made themselves an important part of society.

brandiand,0,t3_2xiiof,"Wow! Ambitious travel plans.

Since it looks like you want to see as much as you can in the short amount of time that you have I'd suggest dropping some of the locations you have listed.

Day 9 - Skip Clearwater and Tampa and head straight to Miami. The local culture and nightlife are more lively here than in the Clearwater/Tampa area. I know I've got family that live there.

Day 12 - I'd personally skip Nashville for lack of interest but if it's a must have on your list keep it. Just note...

Day 13 - Your whole day is shot because you will be driving for 7+ hours to get to New Orleans. I don't know when you last drove that long but from my experience Europeans think 3 hours is far to drive. you're going to be pooped and really tired of being in a car. I'd stay in New Orleans through the 15th.

Day 15/16 - Skip Houston and Dallas. Although I currently live in Houston it's not built for tourists. It's huge and you won't have nearly enough time to see anything. The Space Center is kinda boring and Dallas is filled with douchebags. Go to Austin, you'll have a blast and eat some real Texas BBQ. And then go to San Antonio. Check out the Alamo. Also, you can shoot guns anywhere in Texas. There are gun ranges literally everywhere. The trick is to find one where you can rent a gun for the range. If you do decide on swinging by Houston, hit me up and I can take you to a range and you won't have to rent anything. Otherwise skip Houston.

Day 17 - Save your money and time and Skip Denver. I've lived there too and while the food is great and it has a huge independent beer community, so does Austin. And they do it cheaper and with more style. Instead head straight to Vegas.

Day 17 - 20 - While in Vegas hit the Grand Canyon, Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, and then Gamble and drink till you can't remember your name. Then rent a car and head to Death Valley.

Day 21- 29 look pretty sound although I would just drive from San Fran to LAX. It is a great drive along the coast and it's cheaper than a flight for 2.

As for Prices you're looking at a pretty hefty bill for this trip.  Average cost in the US...

Hotels $80-$120 per night

Gas $3.50 per gallon/ $.88 per liter (That's if gas stays relatively cheap)

Food $20 for fast food per person per day or $50 if you include non-fast food places

Drinks $3 Beer, $6 mixed drink, $9 expensive mixed drink, $8 Really Big Margarita (highly suggested in Texas)

Some places will obviously be cheaper and other places much more expensive (i.e. New York waaaaay more expensive than Austin, TX)

However, [this study](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140909/ncomms5835/full/ncomms5835.html) by Carmi et al argues that Ashkenazi Jews are descended from a pool of 330 people in the Middle Ages.

I am referring to basically all Jewish people living in modern times.

I understand that there may be some mixing with surrounding people groups, as well as adoption and conversion to Judaism, but Judaism is passed down as an ethnicity, it really isn't a proselytizing religion (it doesn't preach to convert).  You are born Jewish, and so the modern Jews are likely to be descended from the ancient Jews, which we know historically (from texts) and archaeologically (from artifacts) to be descended from the Hebrews.

Modern DNA testing (including [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771134/) indicates that certain Jewish surnames such as Cohen (meaning ""priest"" in Hebrew) are descended from a specific group of people about 3000 years ago, which is just about right in terms of archaeological dating.

[Here is a link to a bunch of scholarly articles about Jewish DNA in Ethiopia](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=jewish+dna+ethiopia&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C22).  Overall, there have been a lot of studies on Jewish DNA, and they are generally more cohesive and closer related to Jews in other countries than they are to non-Jews in the countries in which they live, as indicated by Nebel et al (2001, 2005)

(Nebel Almut, Filon Dvora, Brinkmann Bernd, Majumder Partha P., Faerman Marina, Oppenheim Ariella (2001). ""The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East"". The American Journal of Human Genetics 69 (5): 1095–11, ebel Almut, Filon Dvora, Faerman Marina, Soodyall Himla, Oppenheim Ariella (2005).

Cavalry use of Saber became one of the last refuge's of swords especially during the eve of gun powder battles, as people used less armor that previously. Also mongols horse archery didn't really refute that ""bows"" won wars and battles (agincourt and mongols come to mind,  cross bows were banned in catholic Europe because they were OP and could kill knights and rich players with relative ease )

Swords continued to be a side arm and a proof of status in most cultures (therefore romanticized). Pole arms (spears, haberds, etc.) were easier to train for militias and the poor and we're used to better effect in most cases. With plate armor rising in usage,  swords became more useless and smaller thinner daggers and big blunt weapons were used to counteract. Haberds and lances dominated armor vs armor But swords still had status symbols, so of course knights still used swords but it would be your weapon of last resort not your first choice.

In China you think wushu swordsmen, Japan you think samurai, Europe had the landschlect and knights. Gurka 's have their own knife, and the Sikh ' s were famous  for being great warriors often with a dagger at their waist. Many of the people who used swords were rich. It's a complicated to make, harder to maintain weapon,  that required a lot of good material and time to make,  therefore it's expensive.

I think the Romans used swordsmen frequently well but that being said,  Romans they won due to discipline and better formations and good supply lines. But pillum (throwing spears) would be used before their shield wall.

notable dedicated sword users would be melee fighters in conjuction with pikemen used to basically disable the other sides stupidly long pikes. ",,11,1425189570,False,cp0lr1l,False,1427514571,t1_cp0bcs8,0,outside,11,t5_2r3f3,1425188514,,,t1_cp0lr1l,0

The fact that in European countries, some tweets statements or jokes could land you in jail shows a sense of collective authoritarianism. Something like hate speech laws would be completely unspeakable in the United States outside of university classrooms (which are all controlled by authoritarian leftists) because we have an unshakable inherent stake in the complete unrestricted freedom of speech except in cases where immediate physical or economic harm would be the result, and the loophole to these laws is that even if it does cause someone economic pain, if it's true or satirical then there is nothing you can do about it.

gateh0us3,0,t3_2xhkeg,"I won't quibble with a lot of your post since it would be far too onerous a task for what it’s worth. (See below). 

But there are a few points: 

&gt;The fact is the Ukrainian people want EU membership precisely so they aren't as reliant on Russia and Putin has responded aggressively to this in order to bully Ukraine and maintain Russian influence

In this paragraph there are contained a number of assumptions/assertions, each undocumented:

* That the Ukrainian people (all of them together?) wanted EU membership

* That they wanted it precisely to become less reliant on Russia

* That Putin has in turn responded “aggressively”

I would argue the following:

* There is no singular “Ukrainian people” or “the Ukraine”. Ukraine is a deeply divided country along linguistic, religious, and ethnic lines. Just look at the maps depicting the proportion of [Russian language speakers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Ukraine_census_2001_Russian.svg), or the recent [electoral maps](http://observationalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ukraine_elections_1991-2012_maps.png).

* The EU Association agreement offered the whole of Ukraine an opportunity to get closer to Europe, at the expense of Russia and the significant portion of Ukraine that wanted to remain close with Russia. Counter-offers by Russia to compose a [tripartite-economic package](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/176159.html) between Russia-Ukraine-EU were spurned. Why would the Europeans offer Ukraine a deal with the condition of exclusivity, when Ukraine is inherently divided? Why not instead go with the tripartite economic deal offered by Russia in joint-union with the EU? 

* When Yanukovych was forced to flee Ukraine (in what you can either call a popular uprising or a coup), the east part of the country lost the President that they elected ([this is undebatable](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/%D0%94%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80_2010_%D0%BF%D0%BE_%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%85-en.png)); the new regime in Kiev didn’t represent Donetsk and Luhansk (since all local governors are appointed in Kiev).
 
* Instead, the new [President](http://www.thewire.com/global/2014/07/poroshenko-there-are-no-separatists-only-terrorists/374772/) regarded them as “terrorists”, and proceeded to launch an “[anti-terror” campaign](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27035196) against their territory, which houses some five-million people. The West, which is so benevolent and humanitarian in other scenarios, turned a blind eye towards human rights abuses and war crimes committed by our new friends in Kiev, crimes that they committed against their own citizens...[[1]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2014/09/ukraine-must-stop-ongoing-abuses-and-war-crimes-pro-ukrainian-volunteer-forces/)[[2]]( https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2014/09/ukraine-mounting-evidence-war-crimes-and-russian-involvement/)[[3]](http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/20/ukraine-widespread-use-cluster-munitions).

* And yet any action taken by Putin in Ukraine is a travesty, a horrific crime. I say the most tragic thing is that the citizens of the Donbass (East Ukraine) [were polled](http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2014%20April%205%20IRI%20Public%20Opinion%20Survey%20of%20Ukraine%2C%20March%2014-26%2C%202014.pdf) in early 2014 and asked where their loyalties lay – a resounding majority of them said they wanted to remain in a united Ukraine. They didn't want to have to choose between Russia and the West, but were forced to; in either case, they wanted their rights respected, along with some degree of autonomy -- principles that have been enshrined in the Minsk agreements. 

* The crux of the issue is that there was never a need for this pointless military campaign; a political rather than a martial settlement should have been pursued and lobbied for by the U.S. from day one. Instead, the EU and U.S. were too tantalized by the prospect of  sweeping Ukraine up into the West -- a reality that required the military defeat of the ""separatists"". In order to achieve that reality, the US and EU were more than willing to risk destroying the entire country (that is exactly what’s happened) 

* In sum, the Donbass was forced to accept a regime that they didn’t elect – when they rejected that regime, a military campaign was launched against them. Then Mr. Putin “aggressively” intervened on their behalf.

Fnatic were together for the longest time with a complete roster and established synergy yet all we got were ""good"" results. Lots of slumps during seasons, predictable playstyle, and mediocre international results. 

They won in EU Season 3 both splits,  then after beating a novice C9 (coming off of a complete steamroll of weaker NA competition) got stomped by Royal Club 3:1 at the World Championships AND lost to C9 a few months later in the Battle of the Atlantic and haven't beaten them ever since.

The question then becomes if they have the greatest Western player and another member of the top 3 (going by your standards) why have they fallen behind C9 from an international standpoint. Why is it that C9 is the closest thing the West has produced to a Korean level team?

Yellowstar has been with the Fnatic the entire time and has always performed at the top level for his position but at a point you have to question whether someone is truly the best when given that much time. In my opinion, Yellowstar is at Dyrus's level which isn't an insult by any means.

kieslowskifan,0,t3_2xhipg,"When Napoleon met Alexander I's envoy General Alexsandr Balashev in 1 July in Vilnius, Napoleon fumed at the fact that he had occupied a whole province of Russia without a major battle.  ""I'm already in Vilnius and I still don't know what we are fighting for,"" the Emperor is alleged to have said. Later in the interview, Napoleon ripped a window from its hinges and threw it into the courtyard below. 

This particular anecdote is rather telling about Napoleon's endgame in Russia. Aside from the objective of bringing Russia to heel and back into the Continental System, there really was not much of a coherent strategy behind Napoleon's actions. He had hoped to destroy the Russian armies at the Polish frontier, but the Russian forces evaded the Grande Armee. Thus Napoleon was at a loss in this campaign and often let events play out as he became preoccupied with destroying the Russian army. 

It is plausible that Napoleon intended to resurrect the kingdom of Poland if his invasion succeeded. His memoirs on St. Helena indicated that Napoleon would have put Józef Poniatowski on the throne, but this assertion should be taken with a grain of salt. The French 1812 treaties with both Prussia and Austria treated the Polish issue very gingerly and there is evidence that Napoleon's ardor for an independent Polish state had cooled somewhat by 1812. Napoleon only made very small steps to resurrect the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth or grant Lithuania autonomy from the Russian empire. He did set up a provisional Lithuanian government and raised several Lithuanian military units. These efforts are counter-balanced by the presence of French military governors and the refusal of the French to announce an abolition of serfdom, which would have been a sign of a more permanent French reform of Lithuania. Military expediency underlay much of Napoleon's actions in Lithuania as the provisional government and the Lithuanian elite provided the French armies supplies and other forms of tribute. 

Napoleon's treatment of Austria after 1809 does give something approaching a precedent as to how Napoleon would have treated a defeated great power. He browbeat the Austrians into surrendering slices of territory and paying a sizable indemnity, the Austrians were allowed to remain a power so long as it was allied to French interests. The existence of both the Duchy of Warsaw and the slightly enlarged *Rheinbund* states were to act as a check on Austria, but both these imperial entities were subordinated to French interests. In Napoleon's logic, these flanking satellite states would give Francis I no option but to hew to French leadership. The marriage to Marie-Louise was the carrot in this geostrategic partnership as it provided a personal connection between the Hapsburg and Bonapartist dynasties. Napoleon had a similiar attitude towards Alexander I, claiming that he had a personal connection with the tsar that was spoiled by Russia's corrupt ministers. His letters to the tsar, delivered by Balashev, emphasized that the two monarchs could still form a personal partnership. Napoleon flew into a rage when these entreaties were met with silence and at times threatened to raise a new Polish state and eliminate Russian power. While these tantrums do not speak well of Napoleon's character, an alternative explanation to them is that they were an exercise in brinksmanship as they would allegedly cow Alexander I into obedience. However, these threats were relatively empty. Any expansion of Poland would have increased tensions with the newly-formed Austrian alliance and many of Napoleon's diplomats warned him of this.    

There are also reports that Cossacks captured dress imperial regalia during the retreat from Moscow. Again, it is unknown whether Napoleon wanted to symbolically refound his empire as a pan-European system after defeating Russia, but there were preparations for a set of new coronations in Rome for 1813. Given the recent annexations of Holland and Catalonia, the idea that Napoleon would have used a Russian triumph as a pretext to declare a rearrangement European political order is not outside the realm of possibility. But again, the lack of any clear indications on Napoleon's part makes this idle speculation.    

In the end, Napoleon really did not have a very pragmatic or coherent grand strategy in 1812. Success against the Russians would have alienated his Austrian ""ally"" and provided a pretext for his Prussian ""satellite"" states, especially since the best check against Russian revanchism, a strong and independent Polish kingdom, would have eroded these shaky alliances. Russia itself was simply too big for Napoleon to partition or occupy for an extended period, as with Spain (and that itself went very poorly for the French). Napoleon had hoped the occupation of Moscow after the French victory at Borodino would somehow bring Alexander I to his senses and a negotiated end to the war, but this proved illusory.  One of his few consistent ideas Napoleon entertained in 1812 was that French military power could compel Alexander I to see reason and accept a peace favorable to Napoleon's empire. The longer Napoleon waited for Alexander I to act bring an end to the war, the options Napoleon had to end the campaign narrowed and he found he no longer possessed whatever initiative he possessed when he crossed the Niemen.

Yugoslavia was called by Victor Hugo as the place that would be ""the cause of all wars.""  It was the border of the Ottoman Empire, European Empires, and Russian empires.  It was a place where more ethnicities existed than possible.

So when Tito took over the region with the help of the British his big plan was to go through a process of eradicating cultures (similar to Russofication and Sinofication).  The Croats of course resisted the change.  The Croats aligned themselves with the Nazis during WW2 and the Austro-Hungarians during WW1, so not treated particularly well by Serbs.

Tito created a language called Serbo-Croat that took pieces of both languages but used the Roman alphabet.  Speaking other languages was banned and basically three cultures (Albanian, Serbian, and Croatian) were destroyed.

So when Tito dies militias and leaders form within various regions all out for each other's bloods.  The Serbs caused WW1, the Croats sided with the Nazis, Tito was a Serb, it was all tit for tat.  The fighting and blood shed between the two was unheard of.  People would walk into entire villages and napalm every single person.  Orders were given to execute women and children on the spot to try and prevent the other side from procreating.

The Albanians were also a target, they didn't have much of an army themselves and were relatively innocent in all of the matters.  During the Kosovo War, Albanians decided that Kosovo was going to be their own independent country and separate from Yugoslavia like everyone else did.  The Serbian army (Republic of Yugoslavia) came in and began a process they called ""ethnic cleansing.""  The Albanians that didn't leave the land were being killed en masse.

When NATO intervened and saw the damage special teams were setup to capture the leaders of all the factions.  They put 74 of them on trial total.  36 cases were withdrawn due to the indicted dying before the trial could end.  20 of them are still on-going.  26 are in front of appeals court and 2 were convicted but died in prison.  Hundreds of lesser generals were also put on trial with roughly similar numbers.

The big fish was Slobodan Milosevic, the leader of Republic of Yugoslavia during the whole thing.  He exploited Serbian nationalism and used it to legitimize everything.  He was never convicted of any crimes.  He died while on trial.  He was successful in defending himself against all accounts by the courts and was regarded largely as a failure of the courts to convict him.

• Full LP

•Base game itself is 60 hours, but depending on what DLC and start date you use, this can vary.

•Crusader Kings II is a RPG/ Strategy game for PC set in Medieval Europe and beyond, where you play as any character and guide his line through the perils of it all, from holy war to your half-brother trying to murder you. Intrigue is the name of the game

•ideally, Matt and Pat play together in a game using different PC's with characters near each other and related to each other, to maximise dick moves and hilarity. The Kings is Spain are a good start.

Failing that, any of them make a character and coat of arms using the DLC, and we watch hilarity ensue 

•I think the Best Friends should play this because they rarely if ever play strategy games, and we know that at least Pat is in to Risk. CK2 is a great game, universally praised for it detail and fun not to mention easy to pick up. Maybe recording it would be hard work, big I think so much would be going on that this should not be an issue. DLC would need to be looked at, as this game has way too much, when you need maybe the major 5-6

Lithuania now is able to import form Canada, US, Australia, Venezuela, heck even Azerbaijan.

Paludosa2,0,t3_2xjyae,"&gt;The problem, however, is that the Europe now emerging is far removed from this grand and noble idea. Two visions of Europe now conflict: on the one hand, there is the ideal of an economically united and integrated Europe to which I subscribe; on the other, its antithesis, a politically unified and centralized Europe. The best way to understand the full implications of how these visions differ is to remind ourselves of the **crucial distinction between the notions of state and society**.
&gt;
&gt;Albert Jay Nock made this point clear: 
&gt;&gt;*It is unfortunately none too well understood that, just as the State has no money of its own, so it has no power of its own. All the power it has is what society gives it, plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn. Therefore, every assumption of State power, whether by gift or seizure, leaves society with so much less power; there is never, nor can be, any strengthening of State power without corresponding and roughly equivalent depletion of social power.*",,1,False,False,cp0r07k,False,1427517093,t3_2xjyae,0,ukipparty,1,t5_2vl06,1425210075,,,t1_cp0r07k,0

the_straylight_run,0,t3_2xi973,"So in terms of Syriza's overall strategy, Varoufakis spelled out, a little less clearly than I'd like, exactly why it took the position that it did. He speaks of this when talking about the '2 opposing principles' (paraphrased) that he had to join together under a common thread.

These two principles are: Greece stays in the EMU (and on the Euro), and Greece rejects all Austerity measures. 

Now on the face of it, these are incompatible, and I think many in the more militant leftist groups fail to see that. If, for example, Varoufakis fulfilled exclusively what the left believes is his electoral mandate--to reject all austerity measures without negotiation--then it would immediately result in Greece failing to receive a new tranche of funds, which would start a chain reaction ending with Greece no longer using the Euro and returning to the Drachma. 

On the other hand, if Greece holds as true that it must stay within the Euro, then some negotiation and assent to the whims of the the Troika is necessary. The Troika have some say in what policies are approved and what are not, in the sense that in order to stay in the EMU their approval is needed. So Syriza had no choice but to negotiate, and to give some concessions to the other side, lest it fail to receive the consent required so that it could avoid default. 

In that regard, I think Syriza did precisely what was necessary and as such the agreement is quite an achievement for them.

Now I must respectfully disagree with the rest of what you write in your post. Bailing out the banks was, IMHO, only a reactionary and temporary fix. It was self-contradictory to the principles of a free market (which holds that any entity either sink or swim as a consequence of its own choices). More importantly, it passed on to taxpayers responsibility to rectify problems caused by private institutions while doing nothing at all to require permanent change from these institutions such that they can never harm society again.

It is true that banks in one EMU nation were exposed to banks and states themselves of other nations. There was, and is, serious risk of contagion should one institution or state within the EMU default. It is also true that as players on the international markets, these private institutions were exposed internationally to big American institutions like Lehman, BoA, Merrill Lynch, etc. These connections are such that failure in one triggers crisis in others, across borders and across states.

It was not a sufficient response to an existential crisis across global capital markets to simply ask 'how can we fix it' or 'how can we contain it'. In fact, a crisis of that magnitude laid bare the vulnerability of the system, alongside exposing the naked desire of capitalism itself. Capitalism was caught essentially with its pants down. Any fix should have thus required addressing these fundamental issues but has not. 

The reason for this is simple: the problems causing the 2008 Crisis are problems directly attributable to the self-propelling nature of Capitalism, aka its incessant push to obtain maximum yield on the basis of accepting minimal risk, and its likewise directive to sidestep regulation and market management. Fixing the problem is not just about recapitalising failed institutions then, but also about mitigating the intrinsic behaviour of Capitalism. It's no surprise really that this didn't happen, given that many of the components of Capitalism's ideology are held to be sacred.

A truly stabilising act would have therefore also contained a notion of lessening the impact of any institution to collapse the market. It is synonymous with acknowledging that any institution that is 'too big to fail' is also 'too big to exist.' It is taking steps to draw a line between where market commoditisation of life is welcome, and where it is not.

Now to return to Greece and to Germany, the German position, and that of other EU players is to defend this status quo and to hold as sacrosanct the tyranny of the markets. One of Syriza's main points is an attempt to do the opposite--to return a sense of morality and humanity to discussions about how to manage economic affairs that affect people. It was very telling, for example, for Varoufakis to say that he was in a finance meeting discussing Macroeconomics and for the finance ministers there to not only fail to engage in a discussion of that nature, but also to demand that the discussion centre on contractual and moral imperatives which are absent any recognition of the human element, save where aiding Greece hurts German or Portuguese or Spanish of Finnish taxpayers.

I would remind you that a welfare state measure--chiefly that governments subsidise large social welfare states via tax redistribution or transfer of funds--are NOT socialist measures. Any state in which the means of production are not owned by the proletariat is thus a capitalist state with a social welfare programme. 

So I would agree with you on an amended statement: 'you cannot fix capitalism with capitalist measures.' The welfare state is thus destined to fail because it cannot hope to fix an instability intrinsic to capitalism itself by simply giving money back to the victims. In fact, where the behaviour of Capitalists is causing suffering and inequality (which it does by definition) government supports are in fact immoral in that they merely extend the period of suffering rather than ending it. 

Thus, what's happening n the EMU and the EC is no different than the dialectical struggle against the bourgeoisie who are using the tools of state to control the proletariat. It is for German, Irish, Spanish, and Portuguese, and for that matter taxpayers in every EMU nation, to realise that they are in fact voting against their own interests. And that their finance ministers don't represent these interests, and never really have. That regarding the issues to be about obligations of who owes whom and which position is right merely serves to camouflage the real battle for control of the proletariat that has continued uninterrupted since Capitalism began.

Varoufakis's idea is to 'save captalism from itself' and this in other words means fighting to benefit people who don't realise that they are being wronged in the first place. Where this doesn't happen (and hasn't happened) I would therefore state that I think Syriza is doing a very fine job of trying to navigate between extremes for the benefit of all. It is a tough position to try and redefine the system from within whilst still working with institutions and people who oppose change. It is more difficult to do this while not trying to overtly destabilise the entire system itself.

That means if they go North they hit other northmen. If they go South West they'll hit current day Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and France depending on how far they go. And if they go East, they'll hit Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania etc. Don't forget that a significant portion of current day Netherlands wouldn't be there, the Dutch didn't start making dry land out of sea floor until much later.

Section 4. [**Etymology, mythology, and culture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair#Etymology.2C_mythology.2C_and_culture) of article  [**Altair**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The name *Altair* has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) phrase النسر الطائر, *an-nasr aṭ-ṭā’ir* (English: The flying eagle). The term __Al Nesr Al Tair__ appeared in [Al Achsasi al Mouakket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Achsasi_al_Mouakket)'s catalogue, which was translated into [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) as __Vultur Volans__.  This name was applied by the Arabs to the [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy\)) of α, [β](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Aquilae), and [γ Aquilae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Aquilae) and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star.  The spelling *Atair* has also been used.  Medieval [astrolabes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe) of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.

Sure we can pretend that the new actor is the same person as long as he looks close enough. A black guy isn't close enough in appearance to be able to even pretend it's the same person. Besides, a black guy would be a bit conspicuous in eastern Europe and wouldn't have been able to do the missions that Bond did before. 

There's enough wiggle room to sort of break continuity, but we still want to maintain some semblance of continuity (even if the timespan and age of the character doesn't make sense). A black character wouldn't be able to have any continuity. 

With no continuity, then is it actually James Bond, or is it just some black guy that calls himself James Bond? Does he drink Martinis shaken not stirred? Wouldn't that be weird if he says that line? I mean does that mean he's the same person, implying James Bond somehow turned black? Or is he a different person that only by coincidence likes the same drink as the white James Bond, and he also has the same name as the white James Bond. Or maybe the white James Bond never existed, all events in the previous Bond movies never happened. Or maybe we have to pretend Idris Elba is white? Or pretend previous Bonds were black?

Are you starting to see the problems with this? No James Bond movie has never nullified the events of previous movies entirely. They might not always mention Bond's previous missions, but we can always think that they somehow still happened (of course this requires a suspension of time, but the fans are used to doing that).

I usually start off by casting locust swarm and ghostwalk far into the crowd (got the feeling that locust swarm only jumps so far as I can see mobs, not sure if thats true), then dot most of the mobs with haunt and start focusing some (mostly elites) with my rain of toads to generate a fetish army.
This way i have sustainable dmg on nearly every mob (with that rune that makes locust swarm and haunt last for ever) and my pets finish them off.
Be sure to wear a 2handed weapon as its great for your dot dmg.

""Its strange too because when I think of teams with physical players I think of City. Perhaps their lethargic play today was due to apathy rather than physicality, and if so it'll be Pellegrini's job to learn how to motivate his team to bring out the best of them.

Lower table teams definitely don't have to deal with this as much because they play fewer games and don't have to travel outside of England to do it.

mareksaurus,0,t3_2xjwrk,"If you go back the 90ies Europe was much more prominent in both game development and publishing, despite factors you mention here (fragmented market etc.).

Psygnosis was a big UK-based publisher that eventually became a part of Sony. Codemasters was huge for many years. In France, Infogrames was absolutely massive, at one point gobbling up US franchises and studios left and right (it used to own Sid Meier's Civilization, Unreal, Oddworld, and many other IPs, and acquired US publishers GT Interactive and Hasbro and devs like Shiny Entertainment). Eidos was another publishing powerhouse and was based in the UK... it was the company behind Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex and more, though it was eventually acquired by Square Enix.

So I think your theories don't hold up. There were actually a lot of ""early birds"" in Europe, and market and cultural fragmentation didn't stop European publishers from becoming enormously succesful in Europe and internationally. I think the relative decline of Europe in terms of game publishing is simply due to individual business reasons, i.e. different companies seeing a decline for different reasons (or becoming eventually acquired by Japanese or US companies).

From the document:
""When candles are burned, they emit trace amounts of organic chemicals, including acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acrolein, and naphthalene (Lau et al., 1997). However, the primary constituent of public health concern in candle emissions is lead.""

""Lead wicks aside, consumers are also exposed to concentrations of organic chemicals in candle emissions. The European Candle Association (1997) and Schwind and Hosseinpour (1994) conclude that there is no health hazard associated with candle burning even when a worst-case scenario of 30 candles burning for 4 hours in a 50 m3 room is assumed.""

Ambry,0,t3_2xkb82,"I've visited the U.S. a few times, and I've seen various parts and have different experiences of each.
When I was about 11 or 12, I went to Florida with my family and foud it really fun. We stayed in motels, went to lots of theme parks and the weather was lovely. I saw a baseball game (Tampa Bay Rays) and loved how big, loud and fun it was! I particularly liked going on an Everglades tour and seeing wild alligators!

I went back the next year and went to the west coast. We started in LA and I was genuinely really weirded out by LA. It just seemed very deprived in a lot of areas, not the glamorous place I thought it might be. I really loved San Fransisco though, it was amazing and had a lot more character than most US cities. I'm from Scotland so I'm used to very old, beautiful cities with a lot of unique elements. I saw some of that in San Fran. 

One weird thing I found about the US was how gorgeous the natural beauty was. We went through Death Valley, monument valley and saw the Grand Canyon. So breathtaking to see something so wild and gorgeous. There just seemed so much space, so much... Vastness? It amazed me. The deserts and huge canyons were so different to the stuff I'd seen in Europe!

I went back a few years later to see some american universities, and whilst I enjoyed some of the cities (Boston, etc) I ultimately opted to study law in Edinburgh instead because it is free for me and I just felt the city and university I study in was a lot more historical and 'authentic' feeling, it's hard to describe. Harvard was very, genuinely old but other unis like Yale I felt just copied Oxford's architecture and tried to age the buildings by pouring acid down the walls... Not a fan.

Funny that you cherry picked one or two than make muslims look bad while ignoring some of the others, such as 80% of Pakistanis saying suicide bombings are never justified. 

&gt; No criticism of the religion is socially acceptable, because it is either shot down as "" racism"" or because the muslims go full retard on us.

Have you seriously never seen criticism of Islam? Or were you just cherry picking the recent cartoon incident?

&gt; If Christianity or Hinduism can be mocked why not Islam?

They all can.

&gt; Islam is the only religion which results in Thousands of people protesting over a cartoon(Chechnya,London,Pakistan).

People kill and protest over stupid things all the time, I'm not sure why you think only Muslims have ever done this.

&gt; They protest as a united front over Israels actions in Palestine, but don't present the same united front condemning ISIS,Saudi, Syria etc. 

They actually have, a lot. Even the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia outright condemned their actions. [Here's a bit more on just Islamic criticism of ISIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant#Islamic_criticism). But don't forget that with Palestine, protesting might actually get them somewhere, while protesting against IS is not really going to do anything.

&gt; They also plead with us to think about the ""human rights"" of Palestinians. What about the human rights of the people THEY have displaced and Enslaved? (Kashmiri Pandits, Mauritiana).

You do realize that pretty much every religion is equally responsible for actions like this too, right?

&gt; If Islam is not the root cause of terror, why don't we see people of similar backgrounds in militant extremism?(Arab Chrisitians, Or Tibetan Buddhists harming Chinese people).

We absolutely see tons on non-muslim terrorism. In fact, for the longest time, the majority of terrorist groups were actually communist rebels (secular). In modern times, [muslims are *still* not the majority of terrorists in the world](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html). In fact, if you wanted, I could list you terrorists from pretty much every major religion in the world.


&gt; They talk about the Islamic golden age and how christianity was barbaric a thousand years ago, why don't they talk about the tolerance they extend to non monotheists?(again, Hindus)

It's rather ironic that you should mention hindus, since there has been more than one case of [Hindus attacking and killing muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots).

People seem to forget that we absolutely blasted expectations, playing wonderful football. 

This year there has been a clear fitness issue, and an issue with European hangovers- but this is a highly competitive league with a staff that is relatively inexperienced in the challenge that has been presented to us this year.  

We have seen huge development this year, both from individuals (Besic, Stones, Naismith and Lukaku especially) and even as a team. Whilst it doesn't click all the time, we have shown that we have the ability to really mix up tempo over the last 6 weeks or so. 

Next year, without those nightmare Thursdays- and a number of new players in the side, I feel we will once again be back as a comfortable top half side. 

Whilst I may be wrong, I see a hell of a lot of positives within our play. Whilst we are doing some things poorly, and are perhaps putting too much emphasis on developing youth (playing Barkley and Lukaku week in week our for one), I think it is a strategy that will pay off in years to come.

Could we get a link of the Pew Poll from which your post builds its argument? 

&gt; No criticism of the religion is socially acceptable, because it is either shot down as "" racism"" or because the muslims go full retard on us.

How do you feel about the country of Israel, the amount of displacement they've caused to the Palestinians that lived where Israel currently is, as well as how any formal criticism of the abrasiveness of Jewish people in the US (Hasidic Jews self-segregating themselves from women on all forms of public transportation)?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/30/orthodox-jewish-flight-delay_n_5902078.html
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/20/bloomberg-responds-to-ort_n_1022174.html

&gt; They also plead with us to think about the ""human rights"" of Palestinians. What about the human rights of the people THEY have displaced and Enslaved? (Kashmiri Pandits, Mauritiana).

The US does this too, when we expect terrorists to give us back citizens held hostage but we're borderline making human centipedes in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Lots of other groups demand concessions for their sake and ignore the others. Heck, even the Israelis and Palestinians did that (but Palestinians didn't post on social media how they were treating dropped bombs like [http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/israelis-seen-clapping-and-eating-popcorn-while-watching-bom#.fypY2ZNXm]
(a blockbuster release.)

&gt; If Islam is not the root cause of terror, why don't we see people of similar backgrounds in militant extremism?(Arab Chrisitians, Or Tibetan Buddhists harming Chinese people). It's also Preposterous that the OIC make up their own ""sharia compliant human rights"" and give us the finger. They talk about the Islamic golden age and how christianity was barbaric a thousand years ago, why don't they talk about the tolerance they extend to non monotheists?(again, Hindus) or how christianity has reformed, or that we don't live in the 10th century?

Buddhists are usually nonviolent, so I don't know where in the world you were going with that...
And what are you referring to with the Hindus? I feel as though there haven't been any incidences where Hindu people have overstepped religious boundaries or thrown mud at Islam for the sake of egotism. 

&gt; They constantly say ""don't blame us for the acts of a few"" but they go full Halal on innocent European Jews(hypocrisy much). The solution to this cancer is in the islamic texts itself, and i think they should be exposed to their atrocities similar to how german civilians were(Bengal Genocide, public stoning of adulterers etc) to remove them of their pride.

Your argument went from ""I think Muslims are hypocrites"" to ""I want to commit retaliatory acts of hate on an entire religious group to dehumanize them and make sure they know their place."" You lose a lot of credibility that way, and I'm not sure how to change your view because you didn't link any well-reputed news sources, empirical studies, polls with large sample sizes, or any history articles to assert that your opinion was well-founded. I'm not sure you even want your view changed, or if you want to throw a self-serving rant on Reddit, have it go unanswered (because it's not an opinion based on objectivity), and say that your opinion is therefore valid and/or sound because no one refuted your fallacious opinion.

My hobby since I was 12 or so has been computer programming, and I am very fortunate to have become quite good at it, so I work remotely a couple days a week and make enough money to fund my travels. I think I had about $3000 in the bank when I left, as a buffer to get me started. 

I had been dreaming about traveling for the last two years as a college undergraduate, and there were a certainly a couple ""f it I'm going,"" moments. One was when I posted a curb alert on Craigslist and gave away all the stuff I couldn't keep in the corner of my parents attic. That night I was sitting my empty house having a beer and thought, ""well, I guess I'm committed now."" The second was buying a plane ticket. I procrastinated on that for some reason, perhaps because I was overthinking where I would start. Once I dropped $500 on my flight to Madrid through statravel.com (great website btw for super cheap flights if you're a student), that's when it became real.

I mainly use hostelbookers.com or hostelworld.com for recommendations, as well as suggestions from fellow travelers and hostel staff. Tripadvisor.com is pretty good too but I think that tends to cater more to a non-backpacker crowd. 

Random unsolicited advice: 

Use a small hiking backpack (something like 30-35 liters), and a smaller handbag to carry all your stuff. You want to be able to carry all your luggage on an airplane and not have to check anything. [This messenger bag](http://www.pacsafe.com/metrosafe-250-gii-shoulder-bag-8.html) is great for your valuables.

Get a small combination padlock for hostel lockers.

If you decide to go, I wouldn't rush to buy a Eurorail pass. I'm sure it's helpful to some people, but I haven't actually met a single person yet who has one. Backpackers these days tend to be more serendipitous with transportation, either using skyscanner.net for budget airlines (I flew from Seville to Barcelona for something like 30 euros on Ryanair, but *make sure if you use carry-on that it matches their size/weight guidelines or you will pay a 50 euro fee*. One trick is to take a bunch of clothes out of your bag and wear them all at once, but you feel like the Michelin Man and sweat a lot), buses, or [BlaBlaCar](http://www.blablacar.com/) is very popular these days.

Try local beer everywhere you go.

Keep a journal on you all day and jot down random thoughts, things you do, etc.

Get a decent camera. Don't be like me and think your smart phone will cut it (how I took this picture). Now I'm actually trying to find a camera to buy. I want a used Canon Powershot G11/G12/G13 or something and haven't found anything yet in former Yugoslavia.

Be social, get out of your comfort zone, hang out in hostel lounges, and participate in their events. Speaking of which, try to find smaller, more intimate hostels, even if you want to party. Everybody staying in a hostel likes to party, and smaller places actually offer better chances to meet more people.

One piece of unconventional advice, this is something I alluded to in another comment. Solo travel can either be a wonderful opportunity to learn to love yourself, or you could set yourself up to be lonely and depressed. I recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Intimate-Connections-David-D-Burns/dp/0451148452), which uses cognitive behavioral therapy to treat loneliness, help you to love yourself, and become a more attractive person (it's tailored more towards dating but is actually very beneficial even to people already in relationships). When you travel by yourself, you're somewhat in a vacuum and can experiment with core personality traits, and doing so with the help of scientifically-proven therapeutic techniques is so powerful.

If you're going for a while, you might consider exercising. I carry a [set of resistance bands](http://www.amazon.com/Bodylastics-Resistance-Stackable-anti-snap-components/dp/B006O09M4K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425232893&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=bodylastics) around with me and do weightlifting 3 times a week, modeled loosely around p90x. Day 1: back (pullups) and biceps (curls), Day 2: chest (resistance pushups), shoulders (resistance overhead press), and triceps (resistance tricep extension), Day 3: legs (resistance squats or lunges) and back (resistance deadlifts and pullups). About 16-24 sets each day, [alternating your body parts](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/supersets-vs-alternating-sets/) after each set. 

There's so much advice I could give, but the first half of [this book](http://travelstore.ricksteves.com/catalog/index.cfm?fuseaction=product&amp;id=20) goes pretty in depth into everything (the second half briefly goes into specific advice for different countries). Rick Steves is an authority on traveling Europe, but he tends to cater more towards the older hotel crowd, so I would get Lonely Planet Guidebooks specific to any region you're traveling.

I hope some of that massive brain dump was helpful :)

Edit: one more thing. Get an unlocked smart phone and buy sim cards wherever you go. You can get them everywhere, they cost just a few euros, and let you use several hundred megabytes or a few gigabytes of data, which is super useful for google maps and looking up random stuff while walking around.

FA is an European based A3 community, that takes pride in it's ''no-frills'' approach. FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.

Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 19.20 UK time. And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.

What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

First and foremost, understand that a great many brands are all out of the same factory.  Just as one example, from the [wiki entry for Synta Technology Corporation of Taiwan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synta_Technology_Corporation_of_Taiwan) :

&gt;  In 1999 Synta established the brand **Sky-Watcher**, with head offices in Richmond, British Columbia, to distributed in Canada and Europe, and in the late 2000s, to the USA market.[2] In 2005 Synta purchased the struggling US based **Celestron Corporation, continuing its manufacture of Celestron products** and running the US facilities through SW Technology Corporation, Synta's Delaware-based holding company.[3] Synta also **distributes under the Acuter name** and **manufactures products for Orion** Telescopes &amp; Binoculars.

So right away...any advice that suggests any one of those brands is simple superior to any other based strictly on brand-name is misleading...since they're all the same.

And that one company certainly isn't the only example of that in this hobby.

Next, you often get quite sage advice in threads like this, such as :

&gt; Avoid anything from a department store, or any telescope that boasts it's ""magnification"" level. 

This is excellent advice...except then you read...

&gt; I've also bought products from Celestron and Meade and haven't had any problems.

Another fine statement..many folks have had great luck with both of those firms...except : **You can find both in a department store, boasting about magnification.**

Here's an example...these [Celestron scopes](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Celestron-PowerSeeker-80-EQ-Telescope/17355890) are often found in local Wal-Marts.

--

The reason you'll rarely find a (responsible) hobby community recommending one specific brand or not is simply because of these very issues...there's just not a flat ""this brand is good, this one is not"".

At entry to mid-level, you're buying mass produced assembly-line equipment, regardless of brand.  Some is well designed...some is not.  Some has a good run through the line..some does not.  Many are produced in the same factory, despite the brand they're sold under.

What it comes down to, then, is actually doing the research to *learn what makes equipment suitable to your needs*, and then buy based on that.

That was your comment. Except as we see, even with ""proper control"" (whatever that means), net immigration from outside the EEA has still gone up. Which means that it isn't necessarily the lack of ""proper control"" within the EU that is causing the increase in immigration.

The webpage offers lots of definitons, also similar definitions ( you noticed it has 4 different notions there under the irony webpage, just irony, socratic irony and two else). Socratic irony is a different type of irony then just irony (as a literary device). What you're doing is comparable to saying that the definition of literal narrative is good enough to describe oral narrative. Yes, both narratives, but both are distinctive things. Not to mention movie narrative, comic narrative etc etc etc. All different and all different definitions, even if all are narratives.
 

But ok, let's use some actually academic sources then.
 
[Cambride dictionary](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/irony)
 
[Oxford dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/irony)
 
[Macmillan dictionary](http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/irony)
 

And now about the Socratic irony. The term is from 18th century, so not that old. This doesn't mean people didn't use thatkind of figurative speech before, it jsut means that as a term was invented then. It comes from ancient greece word _eironeia_ (or _εἰρωνεία_ if you care about the correct script), which translates into ""feigned ingorance"". And that is how the Socrates method was called in Platons texts about Socrates talks. You have to understand the ancient greece philosophers didn't think ""aw yes, I was totally ironic to that dude"". Irony is term of 18th century. No, what they thought was quite literal - I feigned ignorance to point out problems in their opponents logic. A rhetoric trap, if you will. And then the term irony was named so as a respectful nod (heh heh) to the classical european text on rhetorics.

The Merriam Webster dictionary just lumped several different definitions together. Look up any decent dictionaries (like above) or just get a textbook on poetics. I read the textbook on poetics in high school, where irony was clearly defined as I did before. In courses on poetic analysis in uni the same thing was reinforced. Yes the history of the name of the definiton was also introduced. But we weren't talkin about the etymology of the word _irony_ now, were we? We were talking about the definition. And definition is that, plain and simple.

But this worked only because the population trusted people in uniforms and marching uniformed men were a sign of power.

So, when you now look for fascists in special uniforms, you might look in the wrong direction, in particular outside of Europe. Fascists today wear expensive business suits and use the system to apply violence, not a private army. It is easier to manipulate the legislation and buy influence, than to form a functioning militia.

Krystie,0,t3_2xhgsw,"**Dying Light** : The overall look and feel of the game is fantastic, the parkour is really good. The parkous is not as good as mirror's edge, but probably better than most assasin's creed games. Something about the collectathon nature of the game and the xp/ability reward system makes the game quite addictive. The night time initially feels quite panic inducing. For the most part the night-time is completely avoidable and not really part of the core questing experience. Even though night-mod is mostly just stealth by avoiding the super monster light cones, it can be fun. The combat I'm not so sure about. Early on and for the entirety of the 1st of the 2 areas you get melee weapons. Combat for this involves just mashing left mouse button over and over again, scooting backwards, waiting for stamina to recharge and repeat. It can get really annoying after a while, along with the low weapon durability.

The grappling hook takes you a considerable amount of time to get, I think I'm half-way through the second area and I have it now.

**Dragon Age Inquisition**: I just started with this game, the presentation is nice, the story is cliched but engaging so far. But the combat is completely terrible. I'm used to either strategic RPGs (like Baldur's Gate, or something like Might and Magic X Legacy or even XCOM:EU), fps rpg like games like Mass Effect, and all out aRPGs like diablo, or action games like the new castlevania, dark souls or the witcher, or mmorpg's like WoW.

DA:I is none of these and is all over the place. You can't really queue up abilities and micromanaging requires you to constantly hit pause. The character AI feels really badly done but with the AI you end up dying a lot to bosses. At which point you have to rez party members which is fiddly and annoying.

Redkiteflying,0,t3_2xk378,"""Tarantallegra,"" better known as the Dancing Legs Hex, is a well-known offensive spell frequently practiced by wizarding school children as part of adolescent hijinks. Any wizarding child who went to magic school or grew up with siblings knows the unique compulsion to cut a rug that is produced by Tarantallegra. But what many witches and wizards don't know is the creator of the spell caused an uproar in Strasbourg, Alsace in the early 16th century.

This is the story behind the Dancing Plague of 1518.

Danzer Freifoth was an Alsacian wizard who lived alone on the outskirts of Strasbourg. The International Wizarding Statute of Secrey was more than a hundred years away, and like many witches and wizards, Freifoth existed on the fringes of Muggle society. With no ban on intermingling with Muggles and Floo powder (a quicker, more accessible form of travel than the available broomsticks and apparition of the day) firmly established as part of magical culture for almost 3 centuries by this point, magical people spread across Europe and the 16th century saw the greatest interconnection between Muggles and Wizards since the days of ancient Egypt. 

Freifoth made his living as a herbologist, growing magical plants for potioneers throughout the Holy Roman Empire. However, Freifoth was also a passionate amateur spell-smith, the archaic name for those individuals who work to create new charms and enchantments. Spell creation is a dangerous business – even known spells can produce unfortunate results if performed incorrectly (as the archetypal Wizard Baruffio has been used for centuries to demonstrate). The process of crafting new spells is perilous and can be deadly to even an experienced experimental incantation fashioner; one wrong syllable, one misplaced swish of the wand can be fatal. And although Freifoth’s endeavors in the realm of spell creation caused no harm to himself, it would have profound effects on Strasbourg. 

While there was no established magical community in the vicinity of Strasbourg, Freifoth was not the only wizard living near the town. Frederick Berkfalk was a well-known Tierrache, a person who hunts magical creatures for components to be used in potions, charms, and wands. Berkfalk was also intensely disliked by Freifoth. The origins of the animosity between the wizards has been lost to time, but it is clear that Berkfalk and Freifoth each looked upon the other as someone might look at a plate of mashed bubotuber – with great distaste. Yet though there was open hostility between Freifoth and Berkfalk, the bad blood never went beyond the occasional jinx or infrequent flaming bag of dragon dung left on a doorstep. This minor feud between neighbors may have been a forgotten page of history were it not for what happened in July, 1518. 

It was a bright Summer day, and Danzer Freifoth was bringing a large basket of medicinal herbs to sell in the market of Strasbourg, as he did regularly. By happenstance, on the edge on the crowded marketplace, Freifoth observed Frederick Berkfalk selling the skins of some animals he had trapped. That is when Freifoth had an idea. He had been experimenting with a new spell, and had had great success on the toads and rats he had tested it on. It was a minor hex, but one that when used correctly could cause great embarrassment to the afflicted. Freifoth took out his wand and surreptiously aimed it at Berkfalk. Freifoth was preparing to cast Tarantellegra on a human being for the first time ever. 

He missed. 

Before Freifoth was able to complete the incantation, a Muggle woman named Frau Troffea walked between Freifoth and Berkfalk and was struck by the spell. Frau Troffea began to dance uncontrollably in the middle of the street. Normally, such a misstep could be quickly corrected by performing the counter-hex, leaving it to appear as though Frau Troffea had merely been possessed by a momentary desire to jig in the street. This was not to be, for while Freifoth had indeed perfected his Dancing Legs Hex during his free time, the same could not be said for its counter-hex. Freifoth tried to cast the counter-hex on Frau Troffea, but appeared to succeed only in creating a fizzle of sparks from his wand. However, Freifoth’s counter-hex seems to have had an effect on the Tarantellegra Hex that has not been replicated by magical historians and scholars with any spell in the five centuries since the incident. Freifoth’s attempted counter-hex made the hex itself contagious.  Frau Troffea would continue to dance without ceasing for almost a week. In that time, the dancing spread to other victims in Strasbourg – 34 within a week and totaling near 400 afflicted before the month was out. Exhausted by their exertions but unable to stop the compulsion to dance, some of those affected died from heart attacks or strokes. 

Muggle authorities were in an uproar, but strangely did not suspect magic of being the underlying cause of the plague, assuming instead that it was some theretofore unseen illness of the blood. The afflicted were isolated in two guildhalls and the local grain market, which appeared to stem the spread of the hex’s influence. It was 27 days before Freifoth could come up with a counter-hex. 27 days in which dozens of Muggles succumbed to the demand of Tarantellegra. As clandestinely as he had cast the original hex, Freifoth was able to quietly counter-hex the infected Muggles over the course of half a day. The Dancing Plague was over. Freifoth was later sanctioned by the Holy Roman Wizengamot and fined a Galleon for the event. No doubt, the penalty would have been steeper if the Muggle populace had suspected magic played a role in the Plague. 

The Dancing Plague of 1518 is thus of great interest in the annals of magical history, not only for being the only known example of a contagious hex, but also as an illustration of the impressive powers of denial possessed by Muggles and the importance of proper spell crafting.

Depuis le début le peuple crie contre l'austérité (ce n'est pas nouveau et les images ont pourtant circulé dans les mass-médias avec beaucoup de répression de la part des anciens gouvernements : http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcjoj9_grece-resistance-populaire-2010-03_news), depuis le début que le peuple veut des solutions drastiques, mais il a fallu des années afin que l'extrême gauche ""puisse"" se faire entendre... mais même comme ça, on lui met (volontairement) des bâtons dans les roues.

L'extrême gauche a toujours eu dû mal à se faire entendre car les mass-médias dictent indirectement les règles à suivre : bah oui l'extrême gauche c'est le mal, ils sont mauvais, ce sont des voleurs fainéants... En fait, leur ""vrai"" mal c'est de vouloir lutter contre la corruption et donc les grandes fortunes qui, en conséquence, peuvent fuir du pays et créer plus de difficultés à la Grèce... vive l'hypocrisie financière à l'européenne !

Pourquoi les institutions européennes veulent aujourd'hui volontairement mettre des bâtons dans les roues à Syriza ? car laisser un pays payer des dettes c'est un moyen plus sûr de rentrée d'argent... mais bon, vous n'êtes pas obligé de me croire ;-)

&gt; C'est leur comportement qui pose problème, leur culture du je m'enfoutisme fiscal qui leur a explosé à la gueule.

Enfin, il faut aussi arrêter de vouloir la faire à l'envers : l'actuel parti Syriza est un parti qui a toujours voulu lutter contre le ""je m'enfoutisme"" des anciens gouvernements, contre l'austérité avec des solutions fortes...

yodatsracist,0,t3_2wzf99,"For the CHP, they probably need to change their entire electoral strategy, build grassroots for the first time since the Communists were going into the gecekondu in the 1970s. They're relying on identity politics (a ridiculous proportion of CHP voters are urban and secular or Alevi; that wasn't the case in the 90's) that will never have a plurality.  They probably can't outflank these parties from the left, promising an ""adil düzen"" like Refah did in the 1980's (CHP used to win the urban poor before Refah) because their financiers, the rich secularists, don't really want any economic policies that hurt them, so economically CHP and AKP have been pretty close every time I tried to look at their economic policies in detail (with AKP being traditionally slightly more EU friendly, but giving that up around 2007). To win, the CHP need to find a way to be open to moderate religious people without losing their secular base. Or Kurdish people without losing their nationalist base. Or maybe find another demographic group that they can win. But over all, demographics just are not on their side. The AKP runs strong all over the country. The CHP isn't even the main opposition party in like 2/3 of the country (look at Kayseri or Konya, MHP is usually second), and obviously can't hope to win many votes in the Southeast with their current policies (and the MHP's threat from the right keeps them from changing their policies) so that's like, what, 20, 25% of the country that's probably not voting CHP from the start? Demographics leave their strategy is just really limited. Any merger with the MHP will probably in total cost the two parties votes, as the religous right part of the MHP will probably jump ship as will some of the last leftist parts of the CHP. The high baraj means it's probably not smart for the moderate or Gülenist wings of the AKP to split and try to form a fifth party (I mean, look at Saadet) because there's no guarantee they could break 10% on their first election, and probably not enough momentum to carry them through two elections. The moderate AKPers would probably be better off just waiting for RTE to finish his term and see what happens next, see if someone they like like Gül takes over. Maybe an unlikely, unstable coalition of all the non-AKP parties could work together but all that unites them is not liking the AKP and it's hard to imagine such a coalition lasting very long in the unlikely event that one 1) gets enough possible votes (very unlikely it seems) and 2) actually forms (more likely the AKP would offer a sweet deal to the MHP). 

So, unless there's a giant crisis, either the consumer credit bubble bursts and Turkey goes into a serious recession, or what's happening in Syria starts crossing the border (beyond just refugees), I don't see any short term way that the opposition can hope to regain power. Historically, a coup would be a possibility, but the military was so thoroughly defanged after 2008, I don't think that would happen unless there was a real crisis (two sides killing each other in the street, like the late 1970's; a huge increase in terrorism because of Syria).",acemi ecnebi,3,False,False,cp15duq,False,1427524263,t1_cp13dv6,0,Turkey,3,t5_2qlnu,1425244577,,,t1_cp15duq,0

There have been Jews in Charleston since the 1600s, believe it or not.

I know that my own family members went there simply because they realized they needed to escape from Belarus, and Charleston is where the other people from their town who'd emigrated had gone. As for why that first wave of eastern/southern European immigrants came, I'm not totally sure, but it may have been the fact that there was a long history of other Jews already being in Charleston, so they figured Jews must at least be tolerated there. I do know why the very first Jews came to Charleston: its charter explicitly granted freedom to people of various non-Christian backgrounds, including Jews.

1. [380k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_and_Samaria_Area) from Judea and Samaria, [20k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights#Israeli_settlements) from Golan, and a unknown number from Jerusalem.


2. Besides the 380k israelis living in Judea and Samaria, if a theoretical Palestine refuses to accept them as citizens, it's an impossible number to tell. It's like tarot or astrology.


3. By looking at threats Israel faced between 48 and 67- I mean here assymetrical warfare perpetrated by non state actors but often funded by them, such as Nasser- the Galilee and Jerusalem region would be much less populated, pretty much what is happening with Ashdod and other southern cities due to Gaza missiles. Bombs inside public transports, kidnappings, and explosions would be more common.
Israel occupied Golan (800 meters above sea level) because northern territories were facing constant fire from above and the logic behind liberating Judea and Samaria was to have a presence in the Jordan valley, all this elevated area (you can see/target Tel-Aviv from Ariel for example), besides controlling the border. There were competing plans for this region: Allon plan, Dayan plan, Sharon plan, Rabin plan etc.
The dead sea/Jericho area is also surprisingly economically productive.
Of course there are also aquifers, energy sources and religious/cultural elements.

4. Israel has a tight window of action, in geopolitical terms. If one country in western Asia would acquire nuclear weapons, the israeli window of action would be even more reduced and they would need to make more concessions, lose more power, be more isolated, and have less influence in their own destiny. Not too mention that the israeli nuclear capability may be even a bluff.
It's like Pakistan being crammed between India and China, trying to not be reduced to a dwarf power, only under different conditions.
Also, the middle east is facing right now its own version of the european 30 years war: a region-wide conflict between a saudi-gulf bloc in one side, and an iranian bloc in the other. You may think Iran is weakened, but in fact they are occupying Syria right, [they are expelling the sunni population](http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Columnist/2015/Feb-19/287939-the-region-crumbles-and-lebanon-trembles.ashx), they have indirect control of Lebanon (Hezbollah), Iraq, Sudan and Yemen (Houthis).
It's in the best interests of Israel that none of the conflicting blocs win over the other. It has nothing to do with religion, with civilizations clash, terrorism or democracy, these are all political discourses, the real reason between Iran and Israel enmity is geopolitical interest.

I'm on mobile but I have some immediate thoughts:
Are you on the beach? This isn't clear. If you are, you are not charging enough. 

Many people like to eat out. Perhaps have a European plan? These guest should be able to schedule, say, dinner if they tell you in the morning. 

Beach vacations for couples are supposed to be romantic, not just relaxing. That bedroom does not say romance. The bed looks stiff and uninviting, think about softer linens. Real linen wears well and is very cooling yet soft if heat is an issue. Check out Amansala in tulum's website for rooms with a Mexican romantic vibe.

On that note, this is a boutique hotel, meaning you go above and beyond. So if you have guests who want to explore a desolate beach, you should pack them a delightful picnic (for a charge, champagne optional). The website should feature shots of the experiences you can provide. People have an easier time picturing themselves in paradise if images are more...editorial and show context instead of detail.

Do not suggest people stay elsewhere if they want a bar scene! Instead say that if they want a lively scene one night, the hotel is happy to book transportation there and back or suggest taxi companies.

Also, I find it unnerving how set you are about no additional guests being allowed. Sure, don't serve them meals (or at least charge for breakfast), but if a single traveller finds company for the night, that's a vacation highlight for that person. The innkeeper has a sacred responsibility -- you are here to provide hospitality, not judge someone else's sex life. Maybe that isn't what you believe, but it can be read that way.

As for the food, the others here are more experienced, but there isn't a ton of detail on your website. What is your wife's culinary background? Her philosophy? Does she go to the market every day? Does she work with local farmers? People love that shit. A smiling picture of her in the kitchen is always nice.

For that matter, if this is such an intimate hotel, it should say more about you, where you are from, why you, I dunno, left the corporate world to present a slice of heaven you fell in love with.

I do know that a man who recently burned a mosque to the ground was invited back by the Imam.  So if you're asking if I think that Muslims will *ever* react with tolerance in the face of hatred? [Yes, I do.](http://colorlines.com/archives/2015/02/this_man_set_fire_to_a_houston_mosque_islamic_leaders_forgave_him.html)

As for the cartoons recently published that sparked all that craziness, there is definitely another side to that story.  A lot of the world's Muslims come from places where religious *police* exist.  Think about that for a minute.  Think about the kind of mindset and habits that generates.  Think about *1984* and what it was like for those characters if they didn't *appear* to be appropriately joyful in their vigorous patriotism.  That's *real life* in many Muslim countries.

Now take those people who have been living like that for their entire lives and transplant them to another country.  They wanted to get out because they know that there is a better way.  But the habits are already there, and for many reasons (not all of them *un*justified), Muslims haven't exactly been welcomed with open arms all over Europe.

So it's a mess.  No one is surprised.

Muslims in the United States are far enough away (physically) from all that that you don't see quite as many people so easily baited (which is how I warn my friends against it:  ""don't be baited"").  In the U.S., the ""sticks and stones"" idea is so pervasive that it prevents quite a lot of that trouble.

But in Europe, the situation is a lot more complicated.  If you *really* think the issue is about cartoons, I'm afraid you have *massively* oversimplified things.

It is also not a question of priorities.

One, Azov is irrelevant to the Ukrainian war effort. If they disbanded Azov tomorrow nothing would change militarily. Had they disbanded Azov six months ago nothing would have changed militarily. Azov is about 1% of the Ukrainian front-line troops. Their contribution is not vital.

Two, Azov and its Nazi paraphernalia damages the Ukrainian image in the EU far more than their fighting contributes to the war effort. Ukraine might not care about neo-Nazis but EU countries care a great deal. And Ukraine depends on the good will of the EU and the West.

So, it is not a matter of priorities. It is, at least in my opinion, a matter of the new Ukrainian government really seeing nothing particularly wrong in neo-Nazis.

Edward_Elgar,0,t3_2xk7tk,"&gt; Just as a random side question, What's your stance on the UK being a part of the EU? My thoughts are, As long as Britain is still and always remains self governed and doesn't adopt the Euro, we're all good.

I'm for being part of the free market, but not for being part of the Eu. Eu law has supremacy over English law. Meaning if the Eu introduces a new law, we HAVE to adopt it and if we have laws that contradict the new Eu law, we HAVE to change ours. I don't agree with this whatsoever, I think we should make every single one of our laws. 

I also don't like being part of the European court of human rights, it undermines our law and our beliefs. For example, people in Britain by a majority do not believe prisoners should have the vote (https://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/11/25/public-says-no-prison-votes/) by in accordance to ECHR law we're breaking human rights by not granting them the vote. Which is a problem when the people who make your laws are not voted by you or in the same country with the same beliefs, philosophy and government system. I would like to see the UK leave the ECHR and replace it with our own bill of rights. For the past 1000 years England has been the forefront in law, there is no reason why we still can't.

Other reasons as I don't like being part of the Eu is the Eu commission, which is not a publicly elected commission that only has the power to create bills. MEP's (that we choose to represent us) cannot make bills, only vote on them. Other is the Euro, which is weak and hurts competition in the market, I also don't like the pressure applied by Germany to join the euro zone. I also don't like freedom of movement, I think countries in the Eu shouldn't be forced to accept immigrants and should be allowed to set their own border limits, something the UK public overwhelmingly what. I wouldn't mind being part of the Eu so long as it was nothing more than countries with free trade among each other, but that isn't what it is anymore and I don't like it. I think Britain should honestly turn its sights onto the commonwealth, set up our own free trade areas with the commonwealth and set up our own laws which countries that share exactly our same governments and law systems.

The commonwealth is also growing economically and mostly speaks English, unlike the Eu that is mostly not growing or actually decreasing and has to employ a man to speak 35 languages just to translate everything.",,2,False,False,cp18xti,False,1427525921,t1_cp1879f,0,INGLIN,2,t5_2v1ve,1425251127,,,t1_cp18xti,0

I agree but I wouldn't overrate it. There have always been idiots saying things like that. But before the internet and comment functions you couldn't really see it on a aggregated level. Like the weird loser in your local bar or the crazy uncle that everyone would ignore and be embarrassed of now have a nice little community.

That said, I also think it's because politicians and society are ignorant and therefore leave from for extremists. E.g. I live in the UK in a Muslim neighborhood, within 15min walking from my place there are several houses/flats of people/families of people that joined IS. If I go to the supermarket I see on average like 10 women in burkas, 90% of the non-European-descent women wear at least a headscarf but politicians claim that 'IS isn't Islam' and 'Islam isn't the problem'. Honestly, if your mother wears a burka, that's pretty extremist and then the son becomes an IS fighter and they see no connection!? Really?! I mean how fucking ignorant can you be?! Basically freedom of religion turned into this 'you can't criticize religion' sentiment.

Production started a week after WW2 broke out, the script was written before that.  Chaplin was getting word of Jewish atrocities from his Jewish friends in Europe (he himself was Roma) so he had some advance knowledge. 

It took almost as long if not longer to make the movie as America was actually in the war; you can split hairs about this date or that, and even more so, I've read that had Chaplin known the true extent of the holocaust he said he probably wouldn't have made the film at all.  So it exists in the odd little pocket of knowledge of events and the long time it takes to make films, it's certainly not a race.  But generally, when production started, Chaplin was still being pretty progressive.  

See the note in Wikipedia about Triumph of the Will - he saw it at New York's Museum of Modern Art and felt that he had to make a response. It is a technically very powerful film with awful, propagandistic and hateful ideas, but was accepted positively in some circles in the US at the time.

It disgusts me how large empires have absolutely no respect for small nations. For them it's either the US way or the Russian way, but has it ever come to their attention that the empires should not have a say in all of this?! If there is a choice and the small country, that used to be a part of the USSR, chooses Europe, Russia somehow seems to view that as an attack from the USA.

Russia thinks it own's something! Newsflash - they don't own Georgia, they don't own Ukraine, they don't own Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan. Actually they don't own the small ethnic groups that have been smothered by Russia to an absolute extinction either. If the people have managed to elect their leaders in a democratic manner, then the direction that the government chooses is absolutely no business of Russia! If there are countries that don't elect their leader(s) democratically, then no country should tolerate that.

Russia (yes, Russia, not just it's violently formed version USSR) has managed to repress so many nations in the history of humanity, that many have not survived, many are still fighting the legacy of poverty, poor development, hunger, cold and mass murders that this barbaric union headed by Russia brought us all. In no way is this acceptable, in no way could Russia argue if one of USSR's former members wishes to choose the European or the American way.

I live for the day when the true criminals of USSR and Russia are publicly convicted and forced to apologize for the horrors that they brought to it's neighbors and is still implementing on the small ethnic groups that have no right to learn their native language, that have no right to remember their culture! Thankfully there seems to be a rise of knowledge and understanding of why Estonia will never choose the Russian way.

Before a worldwide audience, he fully demonstrated his abilities as a wizard. He performed several flashy spells, and then, to great effect, he performed the Unforgivable Curses. To hurt. To control. To kill. The last he performed on the officers sent to arrest him and break up his demonstration. To audiences, they appeared to rush in and fire at Voldemort, to no effect, after which he then killed them easily. In reality, the officers had been abducted the night before, and hidden away nearby until they were needed to complete Lord Voldemort's dramatic introduction. Their guns had been loaded with blanks, and each of them was under the Imperius Curse of a nearby Death Eater.

After that, things were... the same, for a while. There was a flurry among the upper echelons as the Death Eaters consolidated their power, but they largely kept these things secret. There were a few media reports of strange lights or mysterious disappearances, but for the average person, life went on. There was a bit of a panic at first, with many fearing a civil war or foreign invasion. Many people stocked up on supplies, reopening abandoned bomb shelters, just in case. By curious coincidence, stores had been overstocked by a freak error at several delivery companies, and people were able to stock up cheaply. Everyone seemed certain that it was a prank, and the police were urging people that there was nothing to be worried about.

Until the rally of the following week. A gathering of concerned citizens organized themselves, via the internet, to force entry to several government buildings, which had been sealed immediately after Voldemort's proclamation. Death Eater response was swift and brutal. Any attempt to enter any official building without 'Ministry of Magic Approval' led to death, delivered with no warning. There were no second chances. 

Afterwards, there was a news broadcast that the Lord President Voldemort had forbidden the use of his name except for his chosen few. He was to be addressed as the Dark Lord, or Lord President. Punishment was one warning, then death. The first died publicly, laughing on videos on the internet to their friends and subscribers. Others gathered to demonstrate their willingness to denounce Voldemort by name. All fell victim to sudden Death Eater attacks. First offenders were mostly warned or stunned, depending on their attitude. It was common practice for Death Eaters to perform magic on the Muggles for amusement, and anyone present could at any moment be subjected to any number of strange curses, as each Death Eater tried to outdo the last. 

With all the police stations and military bases pacified by Death Eaters or Ministry Officials, through various methods, there was no real resistance. After the first protests, the internet went down. Television became spotty, then the phones were unreliable. Then the rolling blackouts started. It was for power rationing, they said. But things happened in the darkness. People went missing. And there was the Mark. Always, the Mark. But worse than that was the cold lonely feeling late at night, like there was nothing right in the world. Every once and a while, they found someone dead that way, alone in the middle of the street.

A few resistance fighters managed to kill or injure some inattentive wizards in the early days of the coup. The Death Eaters responded with vicious efficiency. The infamous Ten to One policy was implemented. For every Wizard that dies by Muggle hand, ten Muggles must die. Ministry of Magic Aurors, under the authority of Lord President Voldemort and his elite Death Eaters, implemented this policy nationwide. The attackers were hunted down without exception, forced to reveal all their deepest secrets, and then, the Ten were taken from their most cherished friends and loved ones. In the few cases where a Muggle managed to escape anonymously, the Ten were chosen at random. It became more accepted to play along. How do you fight an enemy that could be anywhere instantly, turn invisible, or force you to betray your most closely guarded secrets?

The first nation to respond directly to the events in Britain was, perhaps not surprisingly, Russia. Most of Europe was paralysed by indecision (and careful magical manipulation). Other nations didn't have the strength or the motivation required to deliver assistance. They seemed glad that the wizards hadn't arrived on their doorstep, as they rushed to assure their populations that there was no danger. Russia, on the other hand, had a very keen interest in maintaining a stable Britain, and was quick to declare the 'terrorist nation' illegitimate. Their first assault was a massive, coordinated air strike, based on old Cold War plans and updated for the modern age. It was the largest air battle since World War Two. NATO at its highest level of preparation would have been hard pressed to delay them, let alone stop them. And yet, almost every Russian plane that launched that day was destroyed.",,2,False,False,cp1duu8,False,1427528285,t3_2wrptf,0,WritingPrompts,2,t5_2s3nb,1425260630,,,t1_cp1duu8,0

Because if your argument is rooted in ""Russian imperialism"" and if you think this conflict started with what happened in Crimea then you're wayyyy off on how this even started. The coup happened due to the amount of financing far right (including many fascist and Ukrainian nationalist) parties got from the IMF. They fundamentally wouldn't have had the resources necessary to take control of the government anyway. And the West only pursued that with that goal when their attempts to overthrow Bashar Al Assad backfired. And let me underline that thank god John Kerry is as bad as his job as he is because if he had done it right then American troops would've found themselves fighting *alongside* what later became ISIS.

America was pursuing Syria to be within missile striking range of Russia, Ukraine fits that same purpose. And that's without getting into Iraq, Afghanistan, Wahabiism, and Iran. Because our policy in destabalizing the middle east is rooted in how much gold &amp; oil is there.

Having said that I do believe that you're able to get out of an economical crisis by increasing spending. However Greece has primarily a financial crisis which causes the economical downturn coupled with an general loss of an artifical height due to unsustainable policies which no responsible policy could undo. Further spending in this situation would only treat the symptons while making the situation worse.

As such Greece in its current situation is capable of, while losing quite some quality of living and creating social problems, repaying its debts over the coarse of quite some time. Additional money gifts would allow them to to increase social policies again to lessen the impact on the general population. However I can see no reasoning which would strike me to say it is fair to give such money to Greece rather than to some other EU country which arguably have even less. Ironically these very countries found themselves forced to give money to Greece during the height of the crisis.

DataSetMatch,0,t3_2xm8eh,"Fiddler on the Roof is the story of a fictional Jewish town, known as a shtetl, in the [Pale of Settlement](http://faculty.washington.edu/rmcnamar/link269/article1.html) of Imperial Russia. For the most part, the majority of the residents had been living in the area for generations, since the Pale was mostly made up of former territories of Poland-Lithuania Commonwealth (mostly present day Belarus and Ukraine). The Pale was created as an area in Imperial Russia where Jews could live, at first it was a relatively small area of western Russia, it grew as the borders of Russia expanded into the Commonwealth. Even inside of the Pale there were limits on where Jews could live, resulting in the majority residing in Jewish-only settlements. 

As to the reasons, there are myriad. While these areas were traditionally more tolerant to Jews than much of Europe, tension between Christian and Jewish communities still existed. During this period Russian policy was very anti-Semitic and tried to force convert or expel the entire Jewish population. Once these territories were under Russian control, tension between the two religious communities grew, unfettered and often inflamed by the authorities. In addition to all of this, due to the influx of expelled Jews from the interior of Russia with few possessions and wealth and a high level of poverty in the Jewish towns, petty crime in Christian communities was blamed on Jews.

Roywocket,0,t3_2xcpiq,"&gt; Sigh, I didnt reject MW because it didnt align with me. It did, it told the irony definiton there. Problem is, it told the other definitions on the very same page. The other dictionaries have only the irony in it, not socratic irony, which is a different thing. I'm still not sure what you're grilling me over with. You said: Irony means [definition of socratic irony]. I said: No, Irony means [definition of irony]. I had literally no need to point out it was socratic irony. Why?
&gt; Heh, doubt about my education if you need it. Oh noes, what if I tell you I stuided in folklore AND lit, double lies, surely. Whilre you're the one who think that when I talk about poetic tools I must take a tweet as a poem.... yeah right, I just think you don't have much experience with humanities.

Yeah we are still doing this?

I guess we are.

It is ok. I dont doubt your education. That doesn't make you right tho. You see some times people will fall back on technicalities in an effort to cover for poor positions. Like trying to cover for the notion that they didn't pick up on the notion of Socratic irony when the definition was right there. You likely wasn't aware of what Socratic Irony was. You see the term socratic irony is from 18th century, so not that old. This doesn't mean people didn't use thatkind of figurative speech before, it jsut means that as a term was invented then. It comes from ancient greece word eironeia (or εἰρωνεία if you care about the correct script), which translates into ""feigned ingorance"". And that is how the Socrates method was called in Platons texts about Socrates talks. You have to understand the ancient greece philosophers didn't think ""aw yes, I was totally ironic to that dude"". Irony is term of 18th century. No, what they thought was quite literal - I feigned ignorance to point out problems in their opponents logic. A rhetoric trap, if you will. And then the term irony was named so as a respectful nod (heh heh) to the classical european text on rhetorics.

Have I made my point clear by now? Do I have to explain it to you once again so it doesn't go over your head? We are literally at the point where I am repeating what you say at you in an effort to demonstrate how your behavior frustrates me. And like I said I will waste your time for just as long with this as you will waste mine. This is what you have been doing.

The welfare systems, single-payer healthcare, the not-wasting-trillions on pointless wars against brown people halfway around the world; the fact that America can't get there is our national shame.  What terrifies me, however, is that getting there requires moving our nation to the left to the point where our gun rights will be eliminated.

Europe has little gun crime, that's true, but that's not *because* of strict gun control, but in spite of it.  Violent crime is very nearly statistically unrelated to gun ownership by private citizens.  Poverty is far, *far* greater an indicator of *all* crime than gun ownership.  There are small towns in American where very nearly 100% of the homes have guns in them, and they haven't had a murder in...well, ever.  And there are major cities that have had de facto bans on private firearm ownership who have hundreds of murders a year.

At the moment, the only gun I have is an old semi-automatic .22 rifle, but that's just because I don't have a lot of cash on hand.  When I have some, I'm going to buy a good gun safe ('cause I have too many kids) and a nice AR-15.  Why?  Partially for home defense, but like 99% of it is I just want one, and I'm legally allowed to own one, because there's no good reason I shouldn't be.

""No one needs to have an 'assault rifle'"" is a stupid reason to ban them.  No one needs to have cars, either.  And swimming pools?  Why should anyone have their own?  If you want to swim, join the Y!  Wait, are you telling me you have your own computer?  But you have kids in the house!  Doesn't that seem unsafe?  Couldn't you just use the computers at the library?  You've got a lot of balls keeping a gassed-up lawn mower in the garage, that's crazy!  If you want your grass neatly trimmed you should just hire a service.

I get the fear about ""assault weapons.""  The media makes a shitload of money out of making people terrified that everybody with an old AR is just waiting for the right time to head to the local elementary school and murder scores of kids.  The fact of the matter, though, is that while that *does* happen and it is a horrible tragedy, it's statistically insignificant and almost impossible to prevent.  Even if you could eliminate every ""assault rifle"" in America, that doesn't do anything to stop a crazy asshole who, say, loads a U-Haul full of fertilizer and blows up a federal building in the middle of Oklahoma.

EaglezhighH8H8,0,t3_2xlsep,"&gt; Also your examples of the oppressions of the Jewish, Japanese, and Irish people is an extremely shaky argument. None of these oppressions were like slavery (except for a brief period of Irish oppression).

Really? Irish were treated worse then blacks. That's a fact. I have an article in the link. Japanese people got all of their belongings taken and got rounded up into concentration camps. Japs would get surgery to look white. Ever hear of the Chinese Exclusion Act? They wouldn't let anyone into the country. Chinese were heavily discriminated against.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act

Also, as I said, the Chinese were in ghettos as well. Still with a high IQ and low crime rate. Are you telling me that ghettos raise IQ in one group and lower it in another? Do ghettos do different things to different groups?

&gt;Comparing the Holocaust to Slavery is comparing Apples to Oranges. It's easy to argue that the Holocaust was far worse than slavery simply by the trauma and death count but I propose that it wasn't the horror of slavery that set blacks back but rather a systematic institutionalization of the vast majority of the black American population, a population literally introduced to the region for the sole purpose of slavery, throughout multiple centuries that created a disadvantageous culture of stupidity that runs rampant amongst the black population of America.

Please. I don't want to start diverging on the Holocaust. Just know, it's not what you're told. Most of the ""horrifying pictures"" of the treatment of the Jews was a result of allied bombings of German supply runs as well as bombing of German bridges so they couldn't bring food in. Are you going to feed your PoW or your soldiers?

The point is, groups have been heavily discriminated against and still have found success in America. ""Systemic racism"" is such a bullshit excuse. It's false and people still bringing it up are stopping us from getting to the actual root of the problem. People blaming everything on black people's downfall is simply not true. People in the same situation as blacks generally come out of where they are. Look at poor whites, there are double the amount of whites on government assistance then blacks. Where are these dangerous white cities? They don't exist. Crime is not correlated with SES. It's genetic as seen here.

&gt;The Role of Parenting in the Prediction of Criminal Involvement: Findings From a Nationally Representative Sample of Youth and a Sample of Adopted Youth 

&gt;“The role of parenting in the development of criminal behavior has been the source of a vast amount of research, with the majority of studies detecting statistically significant associations between dimensions of parenting and measures of criminal involvement. An emerging group of scholars, however, has drawn attention to the methodological limitations — mainly genetic confounding — of the parental socialization literature. The current study addressed this limitation by analyzing a sample of adoptees to assess the association between 8 parenting measures and 4 criminal justice outcome measures. The results revealed very little evidence of parental socialization effects on criminal behavior before controlling for genetic confounding and no evidence of parental socialization effects on criminal involvement after controlling for genetic confounding.”

Taking into account the socialization aspect of parents, they found that genetics overrides it. How you raise your children has no bearing on whether or no they'll be criminals or be privy to criminal activity.

&gt;Slavery in colonial America is simply incomparable to nearly any other form of oppression and is distinguished not by its cruelty or horror, but by its ability to literally form the entire ethos of the oppressed subject. Throughout the Holocaust the culture and religion of Judaism stayed strong. When the Irish were seen as one rung above apes in the social hierarchy they still preserved their culture holding many gatherings that preserved the Gaelic culture and Catholic religion.

Jews were actually treated well in camps, contrary to what you're told. Irish had a tough mindset. What happened to blacks? You can't blame every single problem on slavery, when groups have had it just as bad, if not worse then American blacks. As I said, it's simply not a true statement.

&gt;What separates American Slavery from these other atrocities is the fact that, up until recent African heritage movements, the culture of the black American population for the past many hundreds of years has been a culture and mindset specifically fabricated by white American plantation owners.

Blacks lower IQ is the cause of their environment and SES. To blame another group for it is bullshit.

&gt;This was a culture emphasizing subservience to the master and denying any form of free thought. This isn't a short period of history either. The black population of America followed the way of life of subservience and abolition of thought for centuries.

After they were free, they had a choice, did they not? I don't understand people who blame slavery on the plight of blacks in this country. Is it only American blacks? The blacks on the higher end of the Bell Curve, ( which there are very few of) from Africa come to America and make a nice life for themselves. It's nothing to do with a history of enslavement. It's everything to do with IQ and genes. You obviously have a small group of individuals of the race who will be on the far right end of the Bell Curve and will be able to find success in America. ""Systemic racism"" has nothing to do with it.

&gt;It's easy to imagine that generations upon generations of people unable to form more than a handful of complex thoughts would lead to a default state of stupidity for the typical black man in America.

You're wrong. You're basically blaming whites for the plight and state of the black in America today. Let me give you a good example.

Look at Rhodesia. The white farmers were there, farming the land. Mugabe kicked them out. The more intelligent blacks who realized that they needed the whites tried to get them to teach them how to farm, but Mugave found out and put a stop to it. Now, today, they struggle to survive and live a horrible existence without whites.


&gt;Now throw these incredibly stupid people who have only known service into the frying pan of freedom and what do you get? Degeneracy and thievery and an entire culture of people forced to grow from infancy to adulthood in a world that would rather see them bow or die.

The study I linked to above throws your argument out the window. Crime is, for the most part genetic. Also, see this.

&gt;American black males are twice as likely than American white males to have MAOA-L which has been linked to crime, violence and aggression in scores of studies going back over fifteen years. Black males are also 13.5 times more likely to have a rare version of the gene associated with “extreme violence and extreme aggression.” Latinos and American Indians are also nearly twice as likely as whites to have the more common version of the gene. However they are only about one fourth as likely to have the extreme version compared to blacks.

This is one of the genes they found that causes high aggression. As I have previously stated, most everything we do is genetic. For instance, IQ is .85 percent heritable with the other .15 percent coming from prenatal conditions, mainly the amount of oxygen that gets to the fetus.

&gt;Bring up any sort of biological argument about the size of a negro cranium you want but to deny and minimize the effects of slavery is simply incorrect.

Genetics has most everything to do with the plight of blacks in America. Slavery has no bearing on today. They cause their own problems.

You say SES. Does low SES cause blacks to rape 100 year old women? To burn women alive? No. They are genetically more violent. They have higher testosterone then Europeans and Asians. 

Blacks themselves are the cause for their own problems. Not any bullshit excuse like slavery.

5-6 players: I just put all of my armies on one space, and attack once per turn to get a Risk card.  Don't take territory unless you can control South America or Australia without much of a fight, and don't get involved in big wars with another player (which usually just fucks both of you relative to the other players).  Having like 23 armies on one space usually deters anyone from attacking you.  Taking territory too early is usually a mistake, since you'll just deplete your forces by defending it, and the losses usually far outweigh the rewards.  Armies are a lot more important than territories early in the game.

4 players: Grab South America or Australia if you can, otherwise stick to a defensive strategy and only attack for Risk cards.  The only exception to the defensive strategy is if someone is about to control North America or Asia too early in the game - then you attack them so they can't do that.  Europe is usually too hard to hold because it has more entry points.

3 players: Now you need to hold territory - it usually comes down to someone having NA/SA, someone having Europe/Africa, and someone having Asia/Australia.  So get one of those, and then just keep racking up armies while the other two players fight it out - the one who stays out of the fight usually has the advantage in the long run.  Try to get beachheads in the other guys' continents to deny them the bonuses - if you can hold Greenland/Iceland, Ukraine/Middle East, or Kamchatka/Alaska, you deny someone a large bonus even if they hold the rest of that continent.

2 players: If you have equal or more armies than your opponent, then wage all-out war.  Cash in a Risk card set that gives you a lot of armies, and then just attack everywhere and don't stop until you wipe your opponent out.  Attacker normally has a small advantage when armies are comparably-sized, but when you each have very large armies that are roughly equal, the attacker's chance of winning becomes large.

Much more problematic was a woman I had a few times over a year or so. She was very large, which wasn't a problem at all, but she also had a HORRIFIC odor. She smelled horribly, like sour milk. It was awful. When I saw her, I would need to breathe very shallowly through my teeth to keep from gagging. I was always determined to do the full session, but it was extremely difficult. I have no idea what the cause was, and I felt really terrible for her because she must have known, but it was awful. 

She was always really happy after, and I had the distinct impression she wasn't touched often, so I continued to book her when she called.

The Hon member may well take that into consideration when casting his vote on the motion, but once it is passed it would be his duty as a member of the Government to uphold it. If the very fate of the country hung in the balance then he might be forgiven for going against democracy, but this is no such case. If we are all to start doing whatever we can to block passed bills and motions just because we find them 'illogical', where does it stop? Would a Government be in its rights to refuse to change the Personal  Allowance or implement the Land Value Tax, as passed this Parliament?

&gt; I think many people seem to misunderstand TTIP. It is not we who are negotiating it, it is the EU that is the one negotiating it. Out power lies in out ability to refuse to ratify the treaty.

...and to declare our intention to vote against now, to withdraw, per say, throws out all influence we have over the EU to produce a palatable treaty. Would the Hon member also like to clarify then, given their new-found desire for nitpicking, meant by this statement 

&gt; The reason for my resignation would be for pulling out of negotiations.

This is known scholarship and incontrovertible fact. 

We can't find any good evidence for any starting point for the Indo-European languages, admittedly, but if it had started in India, it would most likely need to have left and come back a few thousand years later as Sanskrit, and not have developed there the whole time. There needs to be significant influence from other language families that we have no reason to believe ever had a significant presence in India to create Sanskrit from Proto-Indo-European. It's not impossible, we really don't have any evidence to disprove that, but it's very, very unlikely. 

And yes, Sanskrit has been restored in several areas of India. It's not really surprising, there are so many languages on that subcontinent that there's no reason why Sanskrit can't find a little living niche, and of course someone wanted to resurrect it. I would argue that it had been at least as dead as Latin has been in Europe (i.e. still being used, but very rarely being spoken) for at least a few hundred years there, but it's not the first language to be resurrected. 

In short, Sanskrit and the related works are definitely uniquely Indian, but the origin most likely isn't India. That's something to be proud of, though. Sanskrit is one of the great ancient languages, like Greek, Latin and Hittite, and is part of a huge tradition that stretches across the globe.

Now, can you believe in Christ and go to synagogue services?  Sure.  In most of the US, at least, there's nobody stopping you from walking in!  (Europe, sadly, is another matter...)  You can generally believe in whatever you want.  I know most people will say that you have to believe in *some* things, but as an atheist, I can tell you that's just not the case.  There's no required list of beliefs to be a Jew; you just need to be born Jewish or convert.  But there *is* a required list of beliefs to convert, and this list will vary from authority to authority, but a belief in Christ is definitely something you *can't* have.

That said, there are groups of people out there called Messianic Jews who believe in Christ.  Jews don't consider these people to be actually Jewish.  I don't know if they have a subreddit devoted to Messianic discussion and community, but this one is generally not the place for that kind of thing, given that Christ messianism is so completely rejected by Judaism (on the other hand, there's another kind of messianism in the Chabad movement that has nothing whatsoever to do with Jesus, which is generally also completely rejected by mainstream Judaism, but that's a separate discussion).

So if you want to be ""Jewish"" while still maintaining Christianity, you have the option of Messianic ""Judaism"", but Judaism goes in quotes there because it's simply not considered Judaism by anyone except perhaps the members of this separate religion.  Just be aware that it's a fairly small community and it's quite separate from actual Judaism.  And remember, you can still participate in Judaism as a non-Jew.  You can't receive honors at the synagogue or be counted in a minyan -- and I think it would be disrespectful to wear a tallit, which generally signifies that you're a full member of the community -- but you can certainly attend services, kiddushim, shabbatot, sedarim, whatever you'd like!",Traditional Egalitarian atheist ethnomusicologist,7,False,False,cp1jiuo,False,1427530929,t3_2xlz2t,0,Judaism,7,t5_2qi67,1425271757,,Blue,t1_cp1jiuo,0

China is extremely corrupt, it's just that corruption there is easier to hide as the Communist Party bigwigs also happen to own a lot of enterprises. India is much more transparent in their governmental system but also less strict in the sense that they don't make the concentrated, effective efforts as China does to stamp out lower level corruption. 

I am saying that the bigger you are, the more difficult it is to be efficient. US shares a very similar system of government with many Western Euro countries but it is more corrupt, due to the size. It is also a very odd thing to say that India's size does not have an effect on its corruption. Indian corruption is precisely because of its massive size (especially population wise and its diversity) and it's poor organisation (hard to democratically organise a country that is still lagging behind economically and technologically per capita wise). If India were smaller, there would be far less corruption. ",,-6,False,False,cp1kolr,False,1427531543,t1_cp1khd6,0,dataisbeautiful,-6,t5_2tk95,1425274415,,,t1_cp1kolr,0

Grazie tante che gli stranieri residenti e regolari hanno titoli di studio superiori a gran parte della media italiana (questo perché l´Italia ha il gravissimo problema di un bassissimo livello di istruzione- parlo di titoli di studio superiori alla licenza media).

Gran parte degli stranieri residenti in Italia proviene da paesi europei (Romania, Albania, Ucraina, Moldavia) o paesi extra-UE mediamente sviluppati (Cina, paesi del Maghreb, estremo oriente e sud-america), quindi si ritiene che queste persone abbiano almeno un livello di istruzione di base. 

Qui parliamo di persone che arrivano da paesi subsahariani (e dubito fortemente che si tratti di medici e ingegneri nucleari in fuga) e dalla Siria. Togliendo i siriani (unico popolo ad avere il diritto d'asilo, che tralaltro non vogliono visto che vanno quasi tutti in Scandinavia), due domande:

1- posto che l´Italia di suo ha gravissimi problemi nel fare sfruttare i titoli di studio dei suoi cittadini e degli stranieri residenti (vedi stereotipo della romena laureata che finisce a fare la badante), è lecito o no pensare che forse la situazione peggiorerà con il tempo, se gli sbarchi continuano con questo andazzo?

2- è lecito che l´Italia abbia il diritto di respingere persone che non hanno nessuna qualifica, nessuna possibilità di sopravvivere se non il vagabondaggio e l´elemosina (nel migliore dei casi), non scappano da una guerra (vedi marocchini, etiopi e pachistani tra le folle nei barconi) e che non portano nessun tipo di beneficio a lungo termine per il paese ospitante?

Yeah, I realize I can drop the engine on Wedge. I think I use it only once in my last game. I was playing around what to add after losing that engine, but it's just enough points for me to swap Blue to Tarn. Will try that out soon. 

I actually keep them in formation most of the time. Guess I never thought of Wedge as a flanker. That way the EU would have gotten more use on him. Yeah, shooting at 12 12 11 is definitely fun. Cracken giving 12 Blue or 11 Wedge an extra focus token can really put in the hurts. As for Roark, I see the blaster turret more as an extra. He is not the damage output. So my opponent has to choose between focusing on Wedge and Blue, or on Roark or Cracken as support. 

Back to swapping blue with Tarn, I don't know how much staying power does he has compares to Blue. With R7 I think it could be good. The dial is different though, and the advantage of Blue is that it has barrel roll and 2 K-turn. But I would love to fly more x-wings.

Example year, 2011-2012:

&gt;174 terrorist attacks in EU Member States. 484 individuals arrested in the EU for terrorist-related offences. Lone actors were responsible for the killing of 2 persons in Germany, and 77 persons in the non-EU country Norway. 316 individuals in concluded court proceedings for terrorism charges.

Out of those 174 terrorist attacks, **not one** was linked to Islamic terrorism or any other forms of religious terrorism.

In 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 it was less than 1% that was linked to Islamic terrorism or any other forms of religious terrorism - with about 200-175 terrorist strikes/year respectively occurring.

The majority of terrorism in Europe actually DOES come from ethno-nationlist/separatist groups.

So no, you're ass wrong on your beliefs. If you feel pissy about the source, then you can write a letter to Europol and explain to them how your television has been telling you that Islam is the only actor when it comes to terrorism and they get their facts from hippy liberals.

- while the ignorant could believe the two (snow cover and average temperature) are the same there are still periods of time when the average temperature is still negative in much of the northern parts (Scandinavian countries in Europe are very much at the same latitude as Alaska and the southern tip of Greenland), and over those intervals the snow cover does not reflect temperature but instead humidity (there is snow at -15 degrees and there is snow at -5 degrees even if the temperature warmed by a whooping 10 degrees); not accidentally the December-February interval is one of those and was picked by the con artists;

- here are the actual trends in Europe:

- and here is what the models are predicting:

&gt; Despite the projected decrease in long-term mean snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere, model simulations indicate occasional winters of heavy snowfall, but these become increasingly uncommon towards the end of the 21st century.

Germany had already broken nearly every condition of the Treaty of Versailles.  The invasion of Poland was simply too much for France and the UK to ignore, and Hitler knew it.  His Blitzkrieg was designed to conquer France as fast as possible and then, using the acquired French territory, to isolate, and eventually capture, Britain.  Thus, all important opposition to his west would be silenced as he made a move against the Soviet Union, completing his domination of Europe.  To add insult to injury, Hitler had the Jews residing in Vichy France sent to concentration camps and murdered.  But, yes, of course his real plan all along was to let the Jews live happily in a small territory (under the control of Germany), where they could prosper as free agents: as long as they didn't leave, and the Germans could enslave them, and that they and all 'impure' races were ultimately exterminated, or at least made docile, disposable slaves.  Starting to sound a bit like a concentration camp, isn't it?  Remember, Hitler didn't have to kill the Jews _at all_.  It was a choice he made because he wanted to do it.  If deporting the Jews was the preferable option, then why didn't he wait until such time as he had the resources to do so?  Not convenient enough for him?

Do we let people self-destruct, or do we take away their free will?

Another reason things like affirmative action are important is that in democratic society, minorities by their very nature do not matter. Allowing things to manage themselves in a free market sort of way works - if you're already on top. But try making money when you have none, or getting educated when you got to grade 8 at the highest, or making friends when you don't know anybody. 

As for reserves, the idea was to allow a culture to flourish without being overwhelmed by European immigration, and it has obviously been an incredibly failure. Personally, I see culture as something we participate in rather than something we own, and as such, it is fluid. However, part of the great thing about our society is that differing views on that sort of thing are tolerated.

I guess if you are pissed about the system screwing you over, getting mad at the people it is helping doesn't change anything. Get mad at the people in power, not the people who - like you - are just trying to survive. You're both getting fucked, and fighting over who gets *less* fucked isn't going to stop the fucking, you know? Get mad at the people doing the fucking, if you're going to be mad. 

It is easy to support a system that directly benefits you. More difficult to support one than passes you by in favour of someone who needs more help. I mean, if we're going for pure cost-effectiveness, we should just exterminate the poor, the hungry, the sick. 

But our society is not pure efficiency. We designate handicapped parking spots closer to entrances/exits because these people have limited mobility. We devote tax dollars to healthcare because people who need treatment aren't always able to afford it. This is just an extension of those policies. 

It is actually *less* of a burden on society to give homeless people a place to live and work than to put them in prison/hospitals. Things like scholarships and education allow people to become productive members of legal society instead of drug dealers.

Now, there is a difference between helping people who need it and assuming that everyone who's white has a fantastic life. Obviously this is not the case, but right now, more white people have fantastic lives than most other races. That's pretty fucked up, and if we don't artificially correct for it, the problem only gets worse. 

I mean, say we do nothing. People will become more racist, because without help, people raised in shitty situations will raise their children in equally shitty situations. People won't hire minorities because minorities are generally shittier people, and they'll be shittier people because nobody will hire them. In a lot of places, that's how things are right now.

Being cut off from the ""old world"" meant they didn't share in technology, like if Europe wasn't attached to china, through trade, Europe would have lagged behind greatly in agriculture and would have taken much longer to develop gun powder.

The thing about the old world is it had a lot of excess, having surplus means more people can spend time on arts and sciences, meaning more potential innovators are innovating, meaning you get better at generating a surplus. The fact that such a large portion of the world was so intertwine in trade made for a very effective positive feedback loop.

The ""new world"" didn't profit as heavily from trade, and never had the chance to master their environments enough to create surplus.

The reasons for that are complex and numerous but that's the simplest explanation.

Like the Renascence, it's common to say the Renascence was about great minds changing the way we lived, but it's important to remember the great minds were as much an effect of their already surplus filled lifestyles as much as they were creating further surplus.

The EDAR variant you're talking about is found at high frequency across many distinct East Asian ethnic groups (but not at fixation nor in all East Asian populations i.e. there are many people who would identify as East Asian without the variant). The phenotypic traits it has been linked to are known to follow a south to north increasing cline, despite all these people being ostensibly East Asian. If you just look at Japan the frequency of the EDAR variant is significantly different between the two major Japanese genetic clusters, is one more East Asian than the other?

Let's look at what the Wolfowitz Doctrine actually said:

&gt;We continue to recognize that collectively the conventional forces of the states formerly comprising the Soviet Union retain the most military potential in all of Eurasia; and we do not dismiss the risks to stability in Europe from a nationalist backlash in Russia or efforts to reincorporate into Russia the newly independent republics of Ukraine, Belarus, and possibly others....We must, however, be mindful that democratic change in Russia is not irreversible, and that despite its current travails, Russia will remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States.

Hmm, Paul Wolfowitz correctly predicting that Russia would backslide from free democracy and immediately seek to reincorporate independent states like the Ukraine against their wishes - maybe the guy knew what he was talking about.

A more precise term would be ""more control than they have now,"" or, ""no less than they have now."" Russia does not want NATO and/or Europe to control Eastern Europe. The expansion of either will not be welcomed by Russia. The expansion of either will hurt Russia more than it helps either NATO or the EU. 

There is a problem applying the term. Neoconservatism is an American political ideology, centered around the use of military force and the promotion of American strategic interests.  But I was more referring to your general lack of understanding of the term, and the fact that you conflate neo-corporatism with neo-conservatism. Neo-conservatism is a political ideology couched in history and academic literature. It was not born out of a desire to cynically cloak corporate interests. It was formed largely by prominent intellectuals and academics with no interest in furthering corporate interests. I encourage you to read the wikipedia article. It's funny how you accuse me of not being well-read, when you clearly have a very cursory understanding of neo-conservatism. 

NATO wants to expand into Russia's backyard for a lot of reasons. NATO (the organization) was predicated on the threat of Russian expansionism, and it is eager to continue being relevant. Most of its leadership are the type of people who would exaggerate the Russian threat and insist that NATO has a moral obligation to protect the democratizing states of Eastern Europe, which is a misguided rationale for US policy. People who occupy the position of NATO Secretary General want to feel like their job matters. They want to feel like Europe actually faces real security threats. They want their organization to get funding. Also, eastern european states petitioned to join NATO after the Cold War, so you can chalk the expansion up to a simple lack of discipline; it expanded because we weren't capable of saying no, even though we should have.  

You're constantly assuming that people in power don't make mistakes. They do. People harbor beliefs about foreign policy that are wrong. People do things that are stupid. It's not always this shadowy plot to increase corporate profits and appease private interests, even if you like how that sounds. That may play a role (unclear how it would factor into the expansion of NATO) but there are plenty of other explanations. And regardless of the explanation, my argument and conclusion remains the same: don't fucking expand NATO into Eastern Europe. It produces negative consequences.

LemuelG,0,t3_2xkwls,"Following this not-quite decisive reversal, and the entry of America into the war, the tone of German propaganda changed completely - from triumphal proclamations of total victory, to a myth of Wehrmacht defence of civilization against the barbarism and chaos of Bolshevism - in May '42 Goebbels directed his ministry: 'No propaganda of illusion', and during operation Blue (the attack on Stalingrad and the Caucasus) Hitler directed his press chief (Dietrich) to exercise restraint on the reporting on Stalingrad, and in one of his speeches in September as the battle raged he even seemed to be making excuses:

&gt; If there are people on the side of the enemy who say, 'Why are they suddenly stopping?'- then I can answer: because we are careful... because we stop at any point for as long as is necessary to bring our supplies in order.... people with any understanding of military problems will admit that the amount of territory which we have captured in a few months is itself something unique in the history of the world.... If someone says now: 'But the Russian does get through after all' - yes, we have to admit that they are a type of swamp human and not European. It is more difficult for us to advance in this muck than it is for those people born in the morass

SS papers insisted that the reason for delay in taking the city was more or less that the Soviet soldier was too stupid to realize when he was beaten. Operations were described as 'mopping up', but as stalemate loomed the city seemed to be relegated to the back pages, then drop out of the papers altogether - Goebbels was dissatisfied with the 'optimistic' tone of the official propaganda, and planned another change in strategy (according to Hans Fritsch, chief of German radio), which emphasized sacrifice and struggle as a necessary prerequisite of 'final victory', and even hinting at the dire consequence should his urgings go unheeded, as he wrote in *Das Reich* just before the launch of the Soviet counter-offensive:

&gt; We have thrown our whole national existence into the balance. There is no turning back now.

After the stunning success of operation Uranus Hitler tried to suppress the news from the public, but foreign news was being circulated by rumour (and illegal radio monitoring by curious Germans), and even then there was no acknowledgement that the Soviets had surrounded 6th Army, this sudden lack of information led to SD reports noting 'uneasiness and anxiety' on the home front. Solid news was replaced by empty assurances, as demonstrated by a Goebbels speech of 5th December:

&gt; We are absolutely convinced that in Russia the better man, the better race, the better political philosophy, and the better leadership will win the ultimate victory, as they always have throughout the history of the world

Hitler himself simply did not mention it, and instead reacted to growing disquiet with a wave of repression against 'incorrigible pessimists and small-minded philistines', using violence and punitive measures if necessary ('deserters' and 'defeatists' could see their families sent to concentration camps). But the final defeat of the 6th Army prompted a disclosure of the disaster (which could not be hidden any longer). 

To try to soften the blow propaganda emphasized the 'heroism' and 'sacrifice' of German troops, and their supposed mission as defenders against Bolshevism was doubled - with Goering comparing the stand to that of the Spartans at Thermopylae:

&gt; Only one sentence stands in this narrow pass: ""Wanderer, when you arrive at Sparta, report that you have seen us lying here, as the law commanded."" And one day the history of our own times will read that ""should you come to Germany, then report that you have seen us fighting in Stalingrad as the law, the law of national safety commanded""... it is ultimately a matter of indifference to the soldier whether he fights and dies in Stalingrad or Rzhev, in the deserts of Africa or the snows of Norway.

And:

&gt; The heroic battle of our soldiers on the Volga should be an urgent reminder to everyone to contribute his best to the struggle for Germany's freedom and for the future of our people

The fact that the 6th had surrendered was completely suppressed, instead, it was alleged that they had fought to the last, as seen in this army directive of February 3rd:

&gt; The heroic battle for Stalingrad has ended. In several days of mourning the German people will honour their brave sons, men who did their duty to the last breath and to the last bullet, and as a result have broken the the back of the Bolshevik assault on our Eastern front. The heroic battle for Stalingrad will become the greatest of all the heroic epics in German history. The German press has one of its greatest tasks before it. In the spirit of the special OKW communique to be issued later today, the press must report this stirring event, which outshines every feat of heroism known to history, in such a manner that this sublime example of heroism, this ultimate, self-sacrificing dedication to Germany's final victory, will blaze forth like a sacred flame. The German nation, inspired by the deathless heroism of the men of Stalingrad, will draw even more powerfully than before on those spiritual and material forces which assure the nation of the victory it is now more fanatically than ever resolved to win

The propaganda campaign now became downright grotesque in its hysterical pronunciations, as Martin Sommerfeldt (a liaison for the propaganda ministry) wrote:

&gt; On February 3 a special conference of the foreign press was called once more. I gave the Special Announcement to Brauweiler, because I refused to read a document which lied more vulgarly than the message that the eastern campaign had been decided

Following this, all mention of the battle was forbidden, official reports were suppressed as 'intolerable', letters from 6th army soldiers that had made it out of the pocket were confiscated - yet 45 of the 1500 still made it to their recipients, and the rumours quickly spread (no doubt aided by foreign radio broadcasts and propaganda), prompting the SD to report of 'deep depression' on the home front, but still no crisis presented itself, the German public was both obedient and cowed by Nazi terror right until the end, even if public faith in their leadership and prospects of victory had been completely shattered by the propaganda disasters presented by the battles of Moscow and Stalingrad.

Jay Baird, from: The Myth of Stalingrad, *Journal of Contemporary History*, July 1969:

&gt; The German home front was never really convinced by the Stalingrad propaganda. To the German people Stalingrad spelled disaster, and Hitler lost much of his prestige as a strategist. The situation was quite unlike that of the previous winter after the reversal at Moscow, because in this case he could not escape blame for the tragedy by sacking the Commander in-Chief and his generals, for now he was himself Commander-in-Chief and had personally directed the operations in Russia. His boasts of I942 had proved empty; as had those of I94I.

I wanted to touch on anti-British propaganda, but this was long! Please see:

Where I live in Ireland it's worse, in the 80's I could build a new house for the region of £20 - £30K while an average yearly wage might be £10K.

now it's my no means possible to buy a new place for under £150K in the same region while average wages might be 20 - 25K per year.

Now back to Romania as it's a recent example with numbers I can stand behind

&gt;While the average price of a hectare of farmland was 927 euro in 2007, this price has increased to 1,972 euro in 2011.  And after this, this rise continued up to more than 2,700 euro per hectare for so-called non-consolidated land. The prices continue to rise and lie between an average of 3,500 euro to 5,500 euro per hectare, depending on location and quality.

&gt;However, during the build up to these enterprises, investors from abroad have already bought ten percent of the farmlands through Romanian companies (Srl). And according to realistic estimations the current level of farmland use in the country would be no more than 25 percent.

So don't make me laugh with this ""Businesses can get capital and grow trickle down economics BS"" as always happens the few with access to money and good credit will buy up everything, milk the profits and leave the uneducated Ukrainian farmer digging the land for less than minimum wage because his small holding cannot compete with factory farming and he lacks the level of education to go into enterprise level farming.

Und es funktioniert! Sechs Milliarden Euro spenden die Deutschen jährlich für einen guten Zweck. Um an ihr Stück vom Kuchen zu kommen, greifen Vereine und Stiftungen oft zu denselben Marketingtricks wie Unternehmen. Manche beauftragen sogar professionelle Agenturen mit der Spendenwerbung – und zahlen diesen bisweilen unverschämt hohe Provision. Vor einigen Jahren verlor eine große internationale NGO aufgrund zweifelhafter Geldsammlungspraktiken ihr Spendensiegel; andere Verbände gingen daran zugrunde, dass sie riesige Summen in Marketingstrukturen, Gemeinkosten und Mitarbeitergehälter steckten. Generell gilt: Die finanziellen Tricksereien manch großer NGOs bringen den ganzen humanitären Sektor in Verruf.

This may be true for KFC, but it isn't true for every restaurant. For example, in China, Pizza Hut is a fine dining restaurant with limited reservations. So you couldn't ask, ""Is it harder to start a chain of restaurants now than in the past?"" without specifying when and where you were talking about.

&gt;Indians learned how to farm before columbus came along despite being an entire contintent away

Some ""Indians"" learned how to farm. Others had gardens, but never intensive food production, still others were hunter/gatherers until Europeans showed up. In fact, big parts of *Europe* didn't learn how to farm until people from the Firtile Cresant showed them how. So, again, the question, ""Is life easier before or after a population learns to farm?"" Is going to have different answers depending on who we are talking about.

Talking about how gender roles are different now than in the past is no less complicated than these other questions, and requires the same frame. For example, it is my understanding that there are very few stay at home parents in Nordic countries, so if you want to talk about modern childrearing, you would at least have to specify where you were interested in.

All of this leads to the point that I don't think anyone in this forum really understands what you are asking.

&gt;
The terms Oceania or Australasia are sometimes substituted for Australia to denote a region encompassing the Australian continent and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model. For example, the Atlas of Canada names Oceania,[21] as does the model taught in France, Italy, Greece[19] and in Ibero-American countries (Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Hispanic America).

&gt;Some international organizations also utilize particular variants of the continental system. For example, both the United Nations[28] and the Association of National Olympic Committees[17][18] utilize a five inhabited continent model. The ANOC uses this model in its logo.[29]

You are welcome. 

So depending on where you go to school your idea of a continent will change. Some other differences are that in the USA, Turkey is not considered part of Europe and neither are the carcasses. And many British do not consider themselves to part of Europe.

[Besides;](http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1115) 

&gt; all EU trade deals provide three important guarantees for public services – on regulation, monopolies and so-called 'national treatment'. These ensure that EU governments remain entirely free to manage public services as they wish.

&gt; Monopolies – **if they wish, EU governments can organise public services so that just one supplier provides the service.** This is what economists call a 'monopoly'. **The single supplier can be:
        publicly owned – in other words, a 'public monopoly'**
        a private firm with the exclusive right to offer a particular service.

&gt;    And it can operate at any level – nationally, regionally or locally.
     
&gt;    **'National treatment' and 'market access'- for publicly-funded healthcare and social services, education or water services, EU governments don't have to treat companies or individuals from outside the EU the same as those from within Europe and do not have to provide access to their markets.** Instead, governments can:
        favour European firms over foreign ones
        prevent foreign firms from providing, or investing in, these services
&gt;        reverse at a later date any decision to allow foreign firms to provide, or invest in, a particular service.
         
&gt;    **Regulation – EU trade agreements leave EU governments free to regulate whatever they consider to be public services.**
    Governments can do so:
        however they choose - for example, in the way they:
            give licenses to suppliers to provide a particular service
            set the quality standards that suppliers have to meet
        at any level of government – national, regional or local

&gt;    There is just one condition, which concerns companies from outside the EU which a government has already allowed to operate in its territory.
    In such cases, the government must treat the companies concerned the same way as it treats European ones.

&gt; **These three guarantees apply, regardless of how the EU lists its commitments on services in its trade agreements:**

&gt;    in some agreements, each EU country specifies the kinds of service it will open up to foreign suppliers – this is known as 'positive listing'
    in others, EU states say they will open up all services to foreign providers, except for certain services listed in an annex – known as 'negative listing'

&gt; The TTIP will work in exactly the same way, offering the same three guarantees for public services.",Verenigd Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,2,1425303983,False,cp1s59z,False,1427535092,t1_cp1rgmj,0,europe,2,t5_2qh4j,1425303391,,NETH,t1_cp1s59z,0

What are your degrees in?  Even if it's in something that employers find desirable, if you have a degree and no previous work experience, that's going to limit your options.  Is that really a surprise?  I'm thinking of IT as an example...I might prefer to hire someone with less education and more work experience, simply because they've shown that they can handle IT within a business organization without fucking up enough to get fired...not only would I have to train someone with only a postgrad degree on my systems, but I'd also have to train them on how to exist as part of a team, as part of a department, as part of an organization etc....this would take a lot more training, a lot more involvement, a lot more risk.

&gt; Plus, my culture deeply frowns on people who don't have materialistic goals and who don't want to work for a capitalist slave driver

I mean, what does this even mean, ""your culture""?  US culture, or a specific ethnic subculture?  If you're talking about US culture, then...no.  Just no.  Here's an example: think of all of the people employed in higher education across the country.  All those people working at colleges and universities...do you think that they operate under this hyper-capitalist boogieman you're angry at?  They're still doing knowledge work, but they're not in the same stereotypical driven-by-money competitive fields (which isn't to say that they're not competitive).

Murderers, pedarests, defilers of the innocent, whose only goal is to exert power over those they see as weaker than themselves?  Radical Marxists?  Who have contributed to the world...in what way?  European nationalists?  I mean, are you just talking about Europeans?  Sure, Europe is pretty chill, I guess...

&gt; The evidence shows that I'm not alone; I have been unable to date as every woman my age is working her butt off just to pay the bills

Well, maybe every woman you meet in your industry...or maybe women who have the qualities you seek are also driven to long work hours...or maybe someone who is so down on himself and his situation doesn't really attract the type of woman he's looking for...

&gt; Statistics show that this is a global trend; most people are worse off absolutely than they were in 2010 as global capitalism runs rampant and even the nations that did things right like Sweden are under pressure

Uh what statistics, proving what, about what, just...what what?  Sweden's under pressure to do what exactly?

Look, your title and your text say two different things.  The majority of your text is about how hopeless you feel in your situation.  From there you extrapolate to the rest of the world.

I don't know what your degrees are in.  But I can safely say that the reason you're in a shit job is that either you chose a field known for shit work at the bottom (like IT), you chose an industry that's known for shit work throughout (finance, banking, something else where giving your life is expected), your degrees are unmarketable (art history?), or you are unmarketable (skills/experience &gt; degrees at a low level).

I understand how it feels to be at the bottom and to want more, and I understand what it's like to do shit work.  But if you know how to work hard and you know how to work smart, you can rise above the shit and have a damn good life.  Capitalism really doesn't have anything to do with this post, I don't think.

People think cuts in public services are harmful and unnecessary, and they feel personally vulnerable. They believe that the Tories do not care about ordinary people and that their economic policies, though effective, are aimed at helping the rich. This is Labour’s strategic strength. Miliband may never seem prime ministerial compared with Cameron, but he can be made convincing as the defender of the people.

It is one of the great ironies of the economic improvement that it has gutted the heart of the Tory argument. Immigration and economy are falling relative to health care and education on the public wish list.

Miliband has been talking about this stuff, rightly or wrongly, from 2010. His advantage is he's likely to have credibility on the issue that the Tories won't be able to achieve. He just needs to stick strongly to that, de-emphasize the gap between the Tories and Labour on economic policy and treat Europe as precisely an issue that Labour are not even convinced is an issue.

TychoCelchuuu,0,t3_2xnzg6,"As Christopher Morris points out, that's not a good *definition* of the state, and Weber seems to realize this, because he provides a better definition elsewhere:

&gt; Since the concept of the state has only in modern times reached its full development, it is best to define it in terms appropriate tot he modern type of state, but at the same time, in terms which abstract from the values of the present day, since these are particularly subject to change. The primary formal characteristics of the modern state are as follows: It possesses and administrative and legal order subject to change by legislation, to which the organized corporate activity of the administrative staff, which is also regulated by legislation, is oriented. This system of order claims binding authority, not only over the members of the state, the citizens,.... but also to a very large extent, over all actions taking place in the area of its jurisdiction. It is thus a compulsory association with a territorial basis. Furthermore, today, the use of force is regarded as legitimate only so far as it is either permitted by the state or prescribed by it. (*The Theory of Social and Economic Organization* (Part I of *Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft*), trans. A. M. Henderson and T. Parsons (New York: Oxford University Press, 1947), p. 156, quoted in Morris' *An Essay on the Modern State*, p. 44 fn. 80.)

The characterization Morris gives in that book (chapter 2 specifically) I find much more compelling than either of Weber's definitions. It's a complex characterization but in short the five features of a state are continuity in time and place, transcendence (it's something over and above its organizations), political organization (the state's institutions are differentiated from others), authority (the state is sovereign in the Weberian sense, plus a bit more), and allegiance (it expects and receives the loyalty of its members).

If you want to pursue the legitimacy question, see [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/) and [this article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authority/) but note that even Weber's famous definition is that a state *successfully claims* the monopoly on the legitimate use of force. The state itself *does not* have to exercise legitimate force. The state may be entirely illegitimate. What is important is that it *claims* (successfully) the right to legitimately use force.

Analogously, I might successfully claim the right to legitimately use your car if I convince everyone it's my car, but I might be lying: it's still your car, and every use I make of it is illegitimate.

IDislikeTheGuardian,0,t3_2xm2tz,"&gt;And yet the US has still had and continues to have an unquestionably net positive effect on humanity. It's important to keep things in perspective.

Oh, is has a net positive effect? Really? Can you quantify that in any meaningful way?

The US is unique in that in our modern era, there is no country so determined to fuck with other countries like the USA. Previously, throughout history, European countries battled with one another, colonized areas, etc. so they did their fair share of shit...but that was in the past. We're supposed to know better now, and yet the only country that is quite literally invading other countries to spread an ideology - this time one of ""democracy"" - is the USA and it has come at a massive cost to both the areas they've invaded, the US itself and all its allied partners. But the elite in the US have benefited from this actions, so all is alright, yeah?

As for the rest of things, well, a net positive effect? Really? Would that be in fueling demand for super cheap goods that are made under abusive practices elsewhere? If not outright slavery? The coffee trade, the electronics trade from asia, the clothing trade, you name it and the US has driven demand for these at a price whereby they can only come from abusive sources.

No country is guilt free in that regard, but if you think the US is a force for good in the world you're very wrong. The only reason we don't have more turmoil in the world is because the US has borrowed $18tn off your children, their children, their children's children etc. to build a military that no one else can question.

And if you think *that* is a good thing, it's not. It's akin to other countries bowing or allying with forces in medieval times simply to avoid getting themselves on the wrong side of them, and in 2015 such fear based ""alliances"" shouldn't even be a thing.

&gt; If you want to get an idea how thorough this training was have a look at Vegetius' 'De Re Militari'

While Vegetius is an important primary source, a few things need to be kept in mind. Firstly, Vegetius was a high-ranking civilian bureaucrat (he was a *comes* and a *vir illustris*), and while we’re not exactly sure when he wrote his text, a commonly assumed date is during the reign of Theodosius I (379-95). As a civilian elite, Vegetius would not have had much practical experience with the army. While it’s likely he had access to military documentation, this would have been no substitute to actually being physically present with the late 4th century army on campaign. Secondly, the text is not intended as a comprehensive study of contemporary warfare, even if it touches on a wide-range of subjects. Rather, it is, as characterized by Michael Whitby, a “selectively critical epitome”. Vegetius’ intent is to highlight areas of the army he perceives are in need of reform, most notably a perceived laxity in training and discipline in the field armies, as well as the problems of (supposed) widespread barbarian recruitment.  Much of the text, then, is not an accurate depiction of the contemporary army, but rather a picture of what Vegetius believes the army *should* be, from an amateur, civilian (yet historically well-informed) perspective. In shaping the present has having denigrated from a superior past, Vegetius is also conforming to a standard *topos* of Roman literature. Taken together, Vegetius is a problematic source for the Late Roman army.

&gt;however their dark ages and even medieval counterparts would have had somewhat of a lesser training regimen due to them also having to participate in agricultural work. 

The essential reason why early Medieval states (the term “Dark Ages” has fallen out of use by scholars) couldn’t afford to maintain large professional forces was that they lacked both the wealth and the organizational sophistication of the Roman state. The Roman army was incredibly expensive, it was easily the single biggest annual state expenditure, perhaps claiming as much as half of annual revenues, perhaps even more. The Empire was able to raise such sums of money because it could draw upon the wealth of the entire Mediterranean world, and had the bureaucratic sophistication necessary to channel this money into a logistical system which kept the army paid, equipped, and fed. The loss of the wealth of North Africa critically undermined the Western Empire’s ability to maintain it’s army, while in the East, the loss of Egypt and Syria to the Arabs in the 7th century prompted massive reforms to the military system. Early Medieval states (if we can even call them states), in contrast, were far smaller, controlled less wealth, were decentralized and lacking in organizational sophistication. Large standing armies simply could not be supported. 

&gt;a large portion of the male population would have to agriculturally work to some degree because unlike the Romans, the feudal lords didn't have essentially slave armies working the Latifundia.

The idea of large, slave-run *latifundia* (a word not used by the Romans themselves) similar to the cotton plantations of the antebellum American South has largely been discredited by scholars.  This traditional interpretation of Roman slavery was fostered by the experience of New World slavery, which arose because of conditions which did not exist in the Roman world. Modern scholars have instead come to view Roman slavery as a largely urban phenomenon, with most slaves living and working in cities. Rome has increasingly been viewed as a “society with slaves” rather than a “slave society”, with slaves operating as a part of a broader labor market rather than dominating all facets of economic production. I'm not a Medievalist in the slightest, so I can't comment exactly on the current concensus, but most Medievalists have moved away from using the word ""feudal"" to encompass the entire spectrum of economic, social, and political relationships that existed in Western Europe during the Early and High Medieval periods.

&gt;The Romans merely borrowed it from the Greek tradition of the Hoplite.

While the hoplite phalanx was the formation first used by the Romans, I would quibble to say that close-quarters combat writ large was borrowed. The phalanx was also borrowed from the Etruscans (who borrowed it from the Greeks), not from the Greeks directly. It also appears that the Roman (and perhaps Etruscan, though I’m stepping out of my area of knowledge) phalanx was “looser” than the “classic” hoplite phalanx, allowing more room for missile and lighter-armed troops, more similar to the Greek phalanxes of the Archaic period. 

&gt;If you are interested in reading more about western military tradition I would definitely recommend Victor Davis Hanson's ""Why the West has Won.""

A lot of scholars have reservations about Hanson’s more recent scholarship, citing sloppy use of source material and incidences where he has allowed his political biases to cloud his work. While I don’t hate on Hanson as much as others do, there are certainly serious concerns in his methodology. While I can’t recommend a good text that provides an introduction to “Western” warfare writ large, a good introduction to the Roman army is Goldsworthy’s *The Complete Roman Army*. Written for a popular audience, Goldsworthy is a top scholar of the army, and writes in an engaging style that provides an easily digestible analysis of modern scholarly understanding.

There are people who have lived in the region for decades who have raised families there and love living in the UAE that deserve citizenship more than anyone else. Expats are allowed to buy property in the UAE, but they can never own it, because it will always be at risk of being confiscated by the government. Imagine pouring your life's work into buying a house, raising your family, and sending them to school in a country where in the blink of an eye, everything you worked for and loved could be stripped of you. Not only is it not fair, its criminal, and that is exactly the scenario that exists in the UAE.

Its a myth to think that the local language and culture would be lost. Emirati journalist Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi stated,

&gt;Should the UAE decide to naturalise say 1,000 people a year, on average it would take **around 900 years** for the naturalised population to outstrip UAE citizens (at zero growth rate for each side).

I suggest you read the entire **[article here](http://gulfnews.com/opinions/columnists/give-expats-an-opportunity-to-earn-uae-citizenship-1.1234167)**.

If you want to maintain the linguistic and cultural integrity of the UAE, then either give people citizenship by making them take language tests and help them immerse themselves into the culture and history of the region. I promise you, there are quite a few people who are more than willing to do that to continue living in a country they've grown to love.

Frankly, I don't understand this ethnocentrism that exists in many Arabs who live and work in the UAE. The West in general has been able to move on (for the most part) from this perspective, and actually take in immigrants on a regular basis, most of whom become functioning members of society and assimilate well into the culture while bringing their own flavor to the cultural makeup of the country they move to (unless you're talking to right wing Europeans).

Adding to /u/BrianFlanagan 's fantastic answer, it is worthwhile to consider the broader picture of Europe at that time. 

The reign of Henry VIII coincided with the rise of Charles V of HRE and Spain (and of Italy, of the Low Countries, etc. etc. etc.); and the rise of Francis I of France. It should be noted that both fought for HRE emperorship, a contest that was won by Charles V albeit at a high price. This started a lifelong rivalry between the Habsburgs and the Valois. 

Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Isabella and Ferdinand the Catholic Monarchs of Spain (or more precisely, or Castille-Leon and Aragon), was political. She was originally betrothed to Prince Arthur the older brother and heir to the English throne. When Arthur died, the 11-year old Henry was promised to her, partly so that the English won't have to return the dowry already partially paid. A papal dispensation from Julius II was obtained in support of Catherine's claim that her previous marriage was unconsummated. 

When Henry ascended to the throne in 1509, he allied England with the Habsburgs, joining in the anti-French Holy League founded by Pope Julius II, and even invaded France alongside Spanish troops in both Aquitaine  and Nord-Pas-Calais. Neither amounted to significant progress, so when Charles V's troops captured Francis I of France in the Battle of Pavia, he forced a treaty that didn't confer much benefit to England. Henry VIII was unhappy at the outcome. 

At the same time, as mentioned, Henry VIII was very concerned with the security of succession in England. He started to have affairs with the Boleyn sisters, and was infatuated with Anne Boleyn. As mentioned, we know that up to the early 1520s he was still quite the devout Catholic, having a good relation with Pope Leo X who named him ""Defender of the Faith."" 

However, the next few popes made relations with England complicated. Adrian VI, also known as Adrian of Utrecht, had been tutor to the young Charles V and even administered Spain in Charles V's absence. Leo X was a short-lived compromise pope. Clement VII was Charles V's chosen candidate, even if his reign was a turbulent period in Italy due to Francis I's invasion of Milan and northern Italy. 

When Henry tried to obtain an annulment from Clement VII in 1527, it was at a very complicated time. Charles V's commanders in Rome had lost control of unpaid troops, who then looted Rome. Clement VII was imprisoned for several months. Regardless, Clement VII refused Henry VIII's two main points of argument: (1) a childless marriage was sign that it was blighted by God, and (2) his marriage had required dispensation in the first place, so therefore arguments could be made it was not valid. 

A key change in Henry VIII's favor was installment of Thomas Cranmer, a close friend of the Boleyn family, as Archbishop of Canterbury. Henry VIII made it such that Cranmer was consecrated without taking an oath of loyalty to the Pope; thus, Cranmer could immediately grant the annulment Henry VIII sought. This set the stage for the ""Reform from the top"" that was mentioned. ",,8,1425328435,False,cp1z7bw,False,1427538385,t3_2xl25b,0,AskHistorians,8,t5_2ssp3,1425317572,,,t1_cp1z7bw,0

For this upcoming major, what are you picks to make it out of groups and your top 4, and lastly who do you think will take?

Group A: Fnatic, Na'Vi Group B: enVyus, Titan ( LGB can surprise ) Group C: NiP, HR Group D: VP, TSM

I think fnatic will win their second major.

Outside of EU, do you follow much of the NA (or others on that note) CS Scene? Also what is your take for the NA scene to get to the same level as EU? : I haven't watched that much CS outside of Europe, but I think the main thing that the NA teams are lacking is structure. Just listening to NA teams gives me a headache. Way too emotional

Why do you think NiP decided to move away from Maik?:  I don't know really. And I don't want to speculate. I am sure that they had their reasons!

What will/or do you miss the most with being apart of NiP?: The players!

What are your favorite skins in game?: Dragon Lore :)

How dreamy are Thorin's eyes?: Oh super dreamy. The tales say that if you stare into them long enough, you can see narnia

Lastly, where do you see CS eSports, eSports as a whole in 10 - 20 years and you along with it (or even away from it)?  I think eSports will continue to grow and in 10-20 years I am sure it will be classified as a real sport and with some world class tournaments that gets some serious TV and Media attention.
I highly doubt that I will be apart in eSports for another 10-20 years ;)",Fifflaren but not NiP,102,False,False,cp1zoof,False,1427538609,t1_cp1bj61,0,GlobalOffensive,102,t5_2sqho,1425318371,,official verified,t1_cp1zoof,0

ttoasty,0,t3_2xmoh1,"&gt;What was oh-so-destabilizing in the manner of an invasion?

Your own example of the breakup of Yugoslavia resulted in two wars and a genocide.  Is that oh-so-destabilizing enough?  I think it's also important to note that both Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia are examples of totalitarian regimes that later split along ethnic lines.  There were reasons for self-determination in those situations that don't exist in the US.

&gt;Ever heard of Switzerland or Austria? How about Luxembourg?
&gt;How do you think trade happens in Europe? You should play Euro Truck Simulator.

Well, let's not ignore the Schengen Area, as well as the EU as a whole, which allows this to be possible.  There's no guarantees of similar institutions and agreements if a state secedes.

&gt;No one will attack an independent Tennessee for the same reason they don't attack Canada and the same reason no one attacks North Korea.

&gt;The US already does this with Canada and other allies.

My point here is to illustrate that a seceded state would still be heavily dependent on the US.  So dependent that if the US were to suddenly disappear around it, it would not survive on its own.  What, then is the point of secession or allowing the secession?  If the US only has something to lose with the state seceding, why, pragmatically, would they allow it to secede?

&gt;Why? Was the Singing Revolution just childish people? Should the Baltic states have not voted for independence?

You mean another example of oppressed ethnic groups revolting against their totalitarian government that denied them a say in their own governing?

There are four main reasons why I still work:

* My work provides a good work/life balance and isn't tedious.  I also genuinely believe it does good in the world.  It also pays decently and provides a pension which grows the longer I work there. 

* One of the things my parents did for me was allow to go to college without going into debt.  Now that I have a family, I want to do the same for my children, and I want them to be able to do it for their children, etc.  There was a thread about this last week talking about generational FI.  I want FI that will last beyond my own self.

* I am pretty fiscally conservative in that I want a big safety net so that even if something calamitous happens I will know my family will be ok

* I want my children to have cool experiences growing up.  And I don't mean material things... but I want them to understand the concept what old means in Europe vs the US, learn about the Maori's in New Zealand and how they were just about the only natives who were able to not be subjugated by Europeans, experience the craziness of Akihabara, see the Pyramids of Egypt, see penguins in Antartica, etc. We probably won't be able to hit everything on that list, but I want to instill in them the hunger to experience the world around them and learn that the world is more than their neighborhood or city.

Sometimes when people think about FI they think it's a binary thing.  Either you are FI or you aren't.  I look at FI more as a spectrum.  FI starts when you don't have to work anymore and can get by.  Near the other end of the spectrum is FI where you can buy a $200M yacht and afford that $20M/year upkeep on it.

There would have been a collection of Germanic principalities that certainly would have been quite protestant during this era, but Germany obviously didn't exist in its present state for several centuries. The fractal principalities couldn't really be considered powerful in any sense quite yet. You're still dealing with the large ruling facilities that were old, wealthy and catholic. It could be argued that England was the first real protestant nation because of Henry's need for a divorce. On the continent, protestantism was a very bottom-up, or grassroots if you'd rather movement. It isn't until we see Calvinist Geneva that protestantism gets a stronger foothold in central Europe.
